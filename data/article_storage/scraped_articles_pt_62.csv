# Reflections Of An Editor Emeritus: Above The Law, 2006-2019
## As I hang up my keyboard as an active ATL editor, I reflect upon the site and its evolution over time.

Thirteen years is a long time. In 2006, George W. Bush was president, John G. Roberts was a brand-new chief justice, and the Biglaw starting salary was [$145,000](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/01/business/01legal.html). It seems like ancient history, doesn’t it?

And in 2006, Above the Law officially launched. On August 30 of the year, I published the site’s first post from a spare room — not a legal bedroom, no windows — in my apartment in the Logan Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C. I was ATL’s founding editor (and only editor, until I was joined in 2008 by Elie Mystal).

Over the years, Above the Law grew from a scrappy, irreverent, gossipy legal blog into one of the nation’s largest and most influential legal news websites. Today it’s based in New York, which I call home now as well, and owned by [Breaking Media](http://breakingmedia.com/?__hstc=222739652.9f70a6f410b9aba489f49421cffeaf40.1556044661752.1557224858498.1557228144578.14&__hssc=222739652.4.1557228144578&__hsfp=213439650), the leading publisher of websites and social-media channels for influential, affluent business communities. ATL has a dozen or so full-time employees, who work out of actual offices in Manhattan, and around 50 outside columnists, generally practicing lawyers or other legal professionals who work for the site on an independent basis.

In 2017, after my husband and I [welcomed our son into the world](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a45722/gay-parents-surrogacy/), I [stepped down as managing editor](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/a-changing-of-the-guard-at-above-the-law/) and handed over the reins of ATL to my longtime colleague, Elie Mystal. What happened next? In 2018, the site enjoyed record traffic and revenue.

With Above the Law in good hands, I felt comfortable taking my leave. As I [just announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/a-departure-memo-from-david-lat-leaving-abovethelaw-joining-lateral-link/), after almost 13 years as an editor of Above the Law (managing editor from 2006 to 2017 and editor at large from 2017 to 2019), I’ve [become a legal recruiter](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/a-departure-memo-from-david-lat-leaving-abovethelaw-joining-lateral-link/) and joined [Lateral Link](https://mainspringlegal.com/laterallink/), a longtime advertiser of ATL (the first, in fact). As a managing director in the New York office, I will focus on placing top associates, partners, and partner groups into preeminent law firms around the country.

As mentioned in my [departure post](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/a-departure-memo-from-david-lat-leaving-abovethelaw-joining-lateral-link/), I will remain involved with Above the Law as “Editor Emeritus” (not to be confused with “Partner Emeritus” or “PE,” for those of you have been reading ATL long enough to get the reference). I’ll write a column that will appear every other week on Tuesday (you’re reading the inaugural one), participate in ATL events, and assist with select editorial and sponsored projects. I will also still [write for other publications](https://davidlat.com/writing/) and [speak at law firms](https://davidlat.com/speaking/), at firm-wide retreats, partner retreats, summer associate events, and diversity initiatives.

But now that I’m officially “retired” as a full-time Above the Law editor (and full-time journalist), I thought this might be a good time to offer some reflections on ATL’s history to date. The past 13 years have witnessed major changes in both law and media, and ATL has evolved accordingly (which explains why, knock wood, the site remains successful and vibrant today). The site’s history offers an interesting window into how Biglaw and the legal profession more generally have changed over the last decade and a half.

I’ve divided up the development of Above the Law into two-year periods that reflect the focus of ATL at the time. The periods overlap because they’re far from clean or tidy; I’m no historian, but I think it’s fair to say that history is messy and complex, resisting efforts to impose excessive order on it.

2006-2008: Let The Good Times Roll

When new websites launch, they need to find a way to put themselves on the map. ATL did this partly through legal gossip — which the site still covers (better than any other outlet), although much less than it did in the early days — and partly through covering Biglaw stories and trends in a more detailed and granular way than had been done in the past.

The first major Biglaw story that ATL used to build an audience inside large law firms: the [Simpson Thacher pay raise](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/01/breaking-simpson-thacher-raises-associate-base-salaries/), announced in January 2007, which took starting salaries from $145,000 to $160,000. The traditional way to cover Biglaw pay raises was to publish one story about the first mover and then maybe, months later, a wrap-up of which firms had matched. The ATL way to cover Biglaw pay raises was to write up each and every announcement, in real time — which we discovered, from monitoring our website traffic, was an approach that resonated with readers. (It remains ATL’s approach to covering pay raises and bonuses; you can sign up for the salary and bonus news alerts [here](https://info.abovethelaw.com/atl-bonus-and-salary-alert-signup).)

2008-2010: It Was The Worst Of Times, It Was The Worst Of Times

But every boom — including the one we’re currently enjoying — gets followed by a bust. In fall 2008, the stock market crashed, Lehman Brothers collapsed, and if you were unfortunate enough to be going through on-campus interviewing at the time, your chances of landing a post as a summer associate dropped overnight. (One reason why OCI now starts in the summer is because certain top schools, haunted by the memory of fall 2008, moved up their on-campus recruiting schedules — and then everyone else followed suit.)

From 2008 to 2010, the Great Recession hit Biglaw — hard. And once again, ATL was there to cover the news that mattered in the lives of its readers — except this time, instead of pay raises and bonuses, the news was layoffs, pay freezes, dissolutions, and deferrals. Bad news, to be sure, but important news that people needed to know. I’m proud of the role that ATL played in keeping lawyers and law students informed during these dark days (a role we would later reprise when Dewey & LeBoeuf collapsed in 2011-2012, and employees relied upon us for information that their own management wouldn’t give them).

2010-2012: Please, For The Love Of God, Don’t Go To Law School

The collapse of legal employment eventually made itself felt in a collapse in law school enrollment. And this collapse was driven in part by harsh media coverage, much of it from ATL, of law schools whose graduates incurred six figures of (nondischargeable) debt for the privilege of not passing the bar and not finding employment as lawyers. The horrors of law school were a dominant theme of ATL’s pages during this time (reflected in how our [Law Schools](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/12/above-the-laws-top-ten-most-popular-posts-of-2012/) category page was the most popular category page for 2010-2012; in most years, ATL’s top category page is [Biglaw](https://abovethelaw.com/biglaw/)).

Much of ATL’s discussion of legal education at this time was, well, scathing. As someone who tries to be “nice” (which I hope will serve me well in my new career as a recruiter), I sometimes felt uncomfortable with the tone taken by some of my colleagues (mostly Elie), and occasionally I’d try to pen [half-hearted apologias](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/01/in-defense-of-law-school-because-what-else-are-you-going-to-do-with-yourself/).

But in hindsight, I must admit that Elie was mostly right. Many of these schools deserved to be taken to the woodshed. And the critiques of legal education — from Elie Mystal and others, including Kyle McEntee of the invaluable Law School Transparency and Professor Paul Campos of the University of Colorado (ATL’s Lawyers of the Year for [2010](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/01/atls-lawyer-of-the-year-2010-the-winner/) and [2011](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/01/atls-2011-lawyer-of-the-year-the-winner/), respectively) — drove reform in the academy. They led to heightened disclosure requirements from law schools, brought about greater transparency in legal education, and yielded more-informed and realistic decisions about whether to go to law school.

(The core criticism of law schools in this period — too much tuition, too much debt, too few jobs — is also what led us to create the [ATL Law School Rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/law-school-rankings/top-law-schools/). The ATL rankings, unlike certain other rankings, focus on two key factors — employment outcomes, and costs/debt — and they’ve been wildly popular with pre-law and law students since their launch in 2013.)

2012-2014: Identity and Ideology

As reflected in the Democratic primary contest for the 2020 presidential nomination, we live in an age dominated by identity and ideology. It might feel like a new age, but it has been gaining steam for several years now.

Above the Law is similarly focused on these issues — and has been for years. ATL has been a prominent voice for greater diversity in the legal profession for a long time — and has modeled diversity as well. Until my departure, the site’s full-time editors consisted of a gay Asian (me), an African-American (Elie Mystal), two women (Staci Zaretsky and Kathryn Rubino), and Joe Patrice, whom we jokingly referred to as “our token straight white male.”

ATL has a vertical and a podcast, [The Jabot](https://abovethelaw.com/the-jabot/), focused on the issues and experiences of women and minorities in the law. The Jabot [launched in 2017](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/welcome-to-the-jabot/), but I date the site’s focus on issues of identity and ideology to the 2012-2014 period (or maybe even earlier).

If you look at ATL’s top stories for [2012](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/12/above-the-laws-top-ten-most-popular-posts-of-2012/) and [2013](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/12/above-the-laws-top-10-most-popular-posts-of-2013/), you’ll see a number of them relate to issues of gender and race. Also in 2013, the [Black Lives Matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter) movement launched — and Elie Mystal became (and remains) one of the nation’s leading voices on the intersection of race and the law.

The [2013 Lawyer of the Year award](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/01/above-the-laws-2013-lawyer-of-the-year-competition-the-winner/) went to Robbie Kaplan, then at Paul Weiss and now at [Kaplan Hecker & Fink](https://www.kaplanhecker.com/), the first LGBT individual and second woman (after Justice Sonia Sotomayor in 2009) to take home this honor. Kaplan won in large part because of her history-making win in United States v. Windsor that year, which struck down the Defense of Marriage Act — and in 2014, fueled by Windsor, marriage equality came to one state after another.

Not everyone loves this heightened focus on identity and ideology, and when I was an editor at ATL, I’d often hear from readers who longed for less partisan days. And given my own fairly moderate political views, I was sometimes uncomfortable with the extremes.

But news outlets exist in specific cultural and political climates, which they both affect and are affected by. And given the larger trends in American discourse towards ideological polarization and emphasis on identity, ATL’s shift on this score was inevitable, for better or worse.

2014-2016: The Rise of the Machines

Above the Law is most well known for Biglaw industry news, along with a soupçon of humor and gossip. Many of our readers don’t know that ATL is also one of the top outlets, if not the top outlet, for coverage of legal technology, startups, and innovation. And given the way that technology is transforming the legal sector, lawyers and law students ignore legal tech at their peril.

I date the start of ATL’s serious focus on tech to the launch of Joe Borstein and Ed Sohn’s [alt.legal column](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/08/alt-legal-stop-what-youre-doing/) in 2014. In the years that followed, ATL added more and more writers and resources to cover legal tech, including [Robert Ambrogi](https://abovethelaw.com/author/robertambrogi/), the dean of tech-focused legal journalism. This all eventually culminated in ATL’s [acquisition of Evolve Law](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/above-the-law-and-evolve-law-join-forces/), which is now [Evolve the Law](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/), ATL’s Legal Innovation Center.

2016-2018: Biglaw Is Back, Baby

This age is easy to explain: [NY to 180!](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) in 2016, courtesy of Cravath. And then — finally, after years of it being a joke meme — [NY to 190!](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) in 2018, thanks to Milbank.

Despite the increased overhead associated with higher salaries, Biglaw continued to boom. Law firm revenues and profits hit record highs in 2018, as reflected in the latest [Am Law 100 rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/am-law-100-reveals-the-biglaw-firms-we-expect-to-make-money-have-made-money/).

But as we all know, nothing lasts forever. See the discussion of the Great Recession, supra.

2019 and beyond: ?

What does the future hold for the legal profession and the world of law? I don’t know — and anyone who claims to know is foolish.

But what I do know is that no matter what the future brings, Above the Law will be there to cover it. I’m profoundly proud as its founder, and I’m deeply grateful to all the readers, writers, editors, and sponsors who have brought ATL to this point — and who will ensure that it will continue to thrive in the years ahead.

# Are You Working For A Laggard Firm? How Biglaw’s Wealthiest Stack Up On Associate Pay Raises
## With the dust on this round of increases finally settling, now seems like a good time to take stock of how the wealthiest firms performed. Was your firm a leader or a laggard?

From a pay perspective, the current Biglaw market offers associates some incredible opportunities. 2022 has brought not one, but three increases to the associate base salary scale. [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/) kicked things off, only to be outdone by [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/davis-polk-raise-2022/), which was itself overtaken by [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cravath-raises-22/). As exciting as the first-mover jockeying has been, the varied responses of other top firms have also been fascinating to watch. If you’re a Biglaw associate, obviously you want your firm to (at least) match the top of the market. But there’s a meaningful difference between a follower firm that dutifully announces a quick match and one that inexplicably drags its feet. Even if the latter firm ultimately ends up in the same place as its peers, nobody would prefer to work for a laggard.

With the dust on this round of increases finally settling, now seems like a good time to take stock of how the wealthiest firms performed. Was your firm a leader or a laggard? If you find yourself at a laggard firm, you might want to reflect on whether you feel appropriately valued. As we at Lateral Link can attest, the lateral market remains hot, so you very likely have other options.

Comparing top firms’ performance

To provide a snapshot of relative performance, we sorted firms into four buckets:

- Gold: the firm was a first-mover in the 2022 salary raises, and to the extent another firm subsequently outbid it, the firm matched the new top of market; 
- Silver: the firm matched the most recent (Cravath) increase in the same week that Cravath announced it;
- Bronze: the firm matched Cravath, but with some delay (not in the same week that Cravath announced); 
- [Wooden Spoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wooden_spoon_(award)): the firm had not matched Cravath as of end of day March 16.
As the pool for our analysis, we took the top 50 firms by revenue per lawyer (RPL), based on the most recent [Am Law RPL ranking](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/04/20/the-2021-am-law-100-ranked-by-revenue-per-lawyer/). We used RPL because this metric best captures the economic health of a firm. To put it bluntly, a top 50 RPL firm can afford to match the Cravath scale.

Before relying on our results, please be advised that our source of data on salary increases is Above the Law’s [tracker](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-raise-tracker-2022/), as of end of day March 16. The tracker is updated based on insider tips to Above the Law and therefore may not be comprehensive. We excluded the top firm by RPL, Wachtell, because the Wachtell pay scale has long been distinct from the rest of the Biglaw market.

With those caveats out of the way, let’s see how the firms stack up. Note that within each category, the firms are listed from highest to lowest RPL.

Gold	Silver	Bronze	Wooden Spoon
Davis Polk	Kirkland	Gibson Dunn	Sullivan & Cromwell
Cravath	Simpson Thacher	Weil	Fish & Richardson
Milbank	Ropes & Gray	Fenwick	Wilson Sonsini
Skadden	Cooley	Fragomen
Cahill	WilmerHale	Steptoe
Debevoise	Fried Frank	Pillsbury
Quinn Emanuel	Proskauer	Crowell & Moring
Paul Weiss	Akin Gump	Alston & Bird
Latham	Willkie	
Paul Hastings	Schulte Roth & Zabel	
Sidley Austin	King & Spalding	
O’Melveny	Goodwin	
McDermott	Kramer Levin	
Vinson & Elkins	Winston & Strawn	
Orrick	Morrison & Foerster	
Covington & Burling	Cadwalader	
Cleary	Dechert	
White & Case	Sheppard Mullin	
Morgan Lewis	Arnold & Porter	
 

In our laggard watch, we have to give a special shoutout to Sullivan & Cromwell, the second-highest ranked firm by RPL, after Wachtell. With RPL approaching $2 million in 2020, there is no doubt that SullCrom can afford to pay the new Cravath scale. And, realistically, there is no doubt that the firm will match — eventually. But there’s no good excuse for leaving associates in limbo when all of your peer firms matched relatively promptly.

Another notable laggard is Gibson Dunn, the wealthiest firm in the Bronze category (#14 by RPL). Gibson Dunn matched on March 14, a full two weeks after Cravath raised the bar. The firm’s associates surely noticed the delay, given that the large majority of Gibson Dunn’s peers near the top of the RPL ranking had confirmed their Cravath matches within a few days. Considering the firm also [lagged in PPP growth](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/the-100-pointer-law-firms-ppp-growth-outperformers-over-the-past-decade/) over the past decade, ambitious Gibson Dunn associates may be asking some tough questions.

Implications: consider your options

Even though some, or perhaps all, of the “Wooden Spoon” firms will eventually announce full matches, being a laggard can have real consequences for a firm’s associates. Time value of money matters. When a laggard firm eventually matches and pays out the increase retroactively, any associate who left the firm in the interim will not receive the retroactive bump. And even for associates who don’t incur a material financial hit from the delay, the uncertainty imposes a psychological cost.

The good news for associates at laggard firms is that the healthy lateral market makes this a great time to switch firms. If the way your firm has handled the salary increases frustrates you, why not do something about it? It never hurts to explore your options. And who knows? Maybe you will end up joining a firm that treats its associates with more respect.

# Lawyers Should Share Their Billable Hour Rates With Other Attorneys
## Attorneys may find they are not charging enough for their legal services.

A while ago, I wrote an article about how employees [should not be scared to share their salary information](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/associates-should-share-salary-information-with-each-other/) with other people who work in the same workplace. Indeed, employers have considerable power to deny workers just compensation when employees do not know how much everyone makes, so spreading this information can have positive benefits. In a similar vein, lawyers should not be afraid to share their billable hour rate with other lawyers, since attorneys may find they are not charging enough for their legal services.

The amount an attorney charges for legal work varies greatly and can depend on a number of factors such as the experience of the attorney, the size of the firm, and other considerations. Depending on the circumstances, the amount charged by lawyers for the same work can be extremely different. I was once sitting in court for a routine matter. Any lawyer could have handled it, since we basically only needed to sit around for hours and speak to the judge for two minutes at the end of the conference.

During the court appearance, I discovered that my adversary was charging his client at least three times more than I was charging mine for the same appearance. Granted, my adversary worked for a Biglaw shop and probably handled a wide assortment of cases for the client, including this one-off court appearance. However, the experience really opened my eyes to how varied fee arrangements can be with clients.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
It is very difficult for lawyers to make rate determinations in a vacuum. Lawyers can consult online guides about how much money a lawyer charges in a given area, but such guides might be outdated, or they might not accurately reflect the amount of money charged by similarly situated lawyers.

Without accurate information, lawyers starting out might charge the lowest rate they think is reasonable to clients and then slowly raise this rate until they face resistance by clients. However, this is a slow process that can take considerable time, and it is difficult to renegotiate fee arrangements for clients who may have gotten in at the beginning of this cycle. It would be better for lawyers to know which rates are average in a given area so they can charge that sum with confidence and not face blowback from clients.

The only time in my practice when lawyers ask other attorneys for their billable hour rate on a regular basis is if one attorney is referring a client’s work to another lawyer. I always felt uncomfortable answering questions about billable hour rates charged to specific clients since this is almost certainly confidential information.

However, getting on the same page about billable hour rates can be helpful. An attorney may not want to even talk to a client if the lawyer knows that the client is unlikely to agree to that lawyer’s billable hour rate. When asked about my billable hour rate in this context, I usually reply with the range of rates my firm charges in general so that I do not divulge client-specific information, which I feel strikes the balance between providing helpful information and protecting client confidences.

Even if lawyers share their billable hour information, other attorneys should still take these details with a grain of salt. Some lawyers might want to inflate the amount they actually charge in order to look better in front of colleagues. Moreover, some lawyers might not be charging reasonable rates because they themselves do not have accurate information and are either billing clients too little or too much.

However, most lawyers would be better off learning what other attorneys in their area are charging. This can help lawyers determine which rates they themselves should charge and ensure that lawyers are not being taken advantage of because they lack information.

# Top-Ranked Biglaw Behemoth Cuts Partner Pay, Delays Raises And Bonuses
## One of the wealthiest firms in the world is cutting costs due to COVID-19.

If there’s anything at all that has been learned thus far from the coronavirus crisis, it’s that cost-cutting measures are coming for all of us. Even well-known firms at the very top of the Biglaw heap have implemented austerity measures.

We’ve now learned that DLA Piper — a firm with almost 4,000 lawyers and $2,835,986,000 gross revenue in 2018 — which currently sits at #4 on the latest Am Law 100 rankings, has taken steps to control its costs going forward. While associates in America were told just last week that there would be no layoffs or salary cuts, it seems like it’s a very different story in the firm’s offices in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Africa.

In an announcement from global co-CEO and managing partner Simon Levine, the following actions were disclosed in an effort to be “open and honest about the challenge our business faces in such difficult economic conditions”:

- Partners’ monthly draws will be reduced beginning on May 1, and partners will defer quarterly distributions for three months. Further, the firm’s reduced profits due to the coronavirus crisis will have an impact on partner pay going forward in 2020.
- Pay raises will not be awarded for the first half of the 2020-2021 financial year, and possibly for the entire year, but this will be reviewed in November.
- Bonus payments will be delayed, and a decision won’t be made on when such awards will be paid until June.
- The firm may ask some people to temporarily reduce their working hours or take sabbaticals.
We reached out to DLA Piper for comment, but have yet to hear back.

As noted by Levine, “we must all take the required steps to preserve jobs wherever possible and protect our firm.” Hopefully this is what it takes to avoid layoffs.

# Biglaw Partner Squatting In Disney Mansion? Wait, What?
## Housing court in Connecticut is a whole thing.

This is a pretty screwy set of allegations.

Disney’s former CFO Lawrence Rutkowski claims in a housing court affidavit that Willkie Farr partner [A. Mark Getachew](https://www.willkie.com/professionals/g/getachew-a-mark) is squatting in Rutkowski’s mansion. Housing court in Connecticut is different than your local housing court.

Apparently, Rutkowski rented a Connecticut mansion to Getachew, but now [Getachew isn’t paying rent](https://nypost.com/2020/10/21/ex-disney-cfo-says-couple-squatting-in-his-2-2m-ct-mansion/) and with the pandemic eviction ban in place, Rutkowski has no recourse.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“It is clear that they have no intention of paying rent — now or in the future because they know Governor [Ned] Lamont keeps extending the ‘no-eviction’ moratorium.”

Running this through the affidavit-to-English translator, Rutkowski’s saying “it is clear that they seem to expect me to comply with state law even though it’s not convenient for me,” which is not the most compelling argument out there. Obviously the eviction moratorium is intended to help families who can’t make ends meet in this crisis and not, say, Biglaw partners, but that’s where the next wrinkle comes in.

Because according to court filings, Getachew isn’t stiffing Rutkowski on rent for the fun of it. Getachew actually brought the housing court case in the first place after discovering that Rutkowski’s house required a number of repairs that Rutkowski hasn’t reimbursed. Getachew claims to be withholding rent to cover the cost of the repairs.

But the Getachews claim that Rutkowski lied when he said the pool, hot tub and waterfall “were in good working condition,” with their complaint alleging that Rutkowski knew there were problems with the pool before signing the lease.

The Getachews say the pool, air conditioning system and other aspects of the house were plagued with problems that forced them to shell out their own money for repairs in just their first three months there.

It’s hard to get teary for someone whose complaint is a malfunctioning waterfall, but if you’re paying $11K/month, you have a right to expect things to work. Rutkowski claims everything could be fixed for about $3,000, yet Getachew racked up over $46,356.22 in repairs. The New York Post echoes the Rutkowski affidavit’s framing of this as a ridiculous sum, but if a high-end pool has broken pipes underground, it gets expensive pretty quickly. Even if it’s not $46K, it’s definitely more than $3,000. Hell, $3,000 won’t even pay for a new winter cover for a pool.

In any event, you never expected to see Biglaw, squatting, and Disney all in the same headline, but it’s 2020 and here we are.

# One Of World's Top 10 Law Firms Is The Latest Victim Of COVID Cuts
## They're looking at firmwide pay cuts and employee furloughs.

Don’t look now, but worries over the financial impact of the novel coronavirus have infiltrated yet another successful Biglaw firm. As we’ve noted time and again, no matter how impressive a firm’s gross revenue is, austerity measures may be coming down the pipeline thanks to the unrivaled havoc that COVID-19 has wreaked upon the world’s markets.

Today, we have news from Eversheds Sutherland, a firm that was declared the 10th best legal practice in the world in Law360’s most recent [Global 20](https://www.law360.com/articles/1181369/law360-reveals-the-global-20-firms-of-2019) rankings. It seems that the international firm’s U.S. branch is slashing salaries across the firm and furloughing employees. Specifically, the Eversheds equity partners will “lead the way” when it comes to reduced compensation, taking smaller distributions, and both lawyers and staff will face a 10 percent pay cut on average (including bonuses). Those who earn $50,000 or less will not have their compensation reduced. In addition, 40 staff members — about one-third of whom can’t do their work remotely — will be furloughed for three months’ time thanks to the pandemic.

On top of these COVID cuts, the firm plans to defer the start date for its incoming first-year associates to January 2021, and will be hosting a shortened summer associate program online. All law students who take part in the remote summer program will receive full-time job offers.

“[A]s we look at the economic news and listen to our clients, we are planning for future reductions in work. I think this is an appropriate, prudent preparation for the future, given everything we’re seeing,” Mark Wasserman, the firm’s U.S. co-chair, [said in an interview](https://www.law.com/dailyreportonline/2020/05/06/eversheds-cuts-compensation-furloughs-staff-as-firm-prepares-for-less-work-ahead/). “We’re preparing for what we think will be less work for the short term. We don’t want to be caught off guard. We can always dial [these measures] back if there is a faster recovery.”

On the bright side, the firm has an employee relief fund that those facing unforeseen hardships — like furloughs — will be able to take advantage of these difficult times.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# DLA Piper Makes Major Lateral Move In Private Equity Space
## The firm's making a big play in the space.

The red hot [lateral market](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/the-biglaw-lateral-market-is-fire-right-now/) strikes again! Blockbuster lateral moves have become a [recurrent theme](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/biglaw-job-offers-without-interviews-what-hath-the-hot-lateral-market-wrought/) that has [ripple effects](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2022-associate-salary-increase/) throughout the industry. The latest winner in the battle for attorney talent is megafirm DLA Piper.

DLA Piper added 27 private equity lawyers from Honigman in a major lateral move. The group will be based in DLA’s Chicago office, and consists of eight partners — including Harris Eisenberg, Alex Plakas, Nathan Wilda, and Drew Rosenberry — with the balance of the attorneys being counsel and associates.

Joe Alexander, DLA Piper’s U.S. vice chairman, [pointed to the benefits](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/04/21/the-nature-of-the-beast-lateral-group-moves-gain-more-momentum/) of transitioning an entire group of attorneys in one fell swoop:

“So they know each other well and have a lot of current deals going on. So the hope is by bringing the entire group, it can be fairly seamless,” Alexander said. “And in addition, we’re looking for capacity. The last 18 months have been a very busy time period. So it’s not only a matter of the group being able to help each other, but we’re always in the market for top-notch private equity lawyers because there’s need for capacity.”

He added: “It’s a double positive. It both helps us fill a need we already had as well as helps the group make sure there’s nothing missed in transition.”

As [reported by ](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/dla-piper-raids-honigman-for-25-chicago-private-equity-lawyers)Bloomberg Law, Honigman’s statement on the departures is very evenhanded and looks to the positives of the firm:

Honigman said it is a “healthy, highly profitable” firm that’s recruiting to support its corporate, private equity and transactional practices, which have made nearly 80 hires over the past 18 months. The firm said it has experienced “record growth” in recent years and remains “well-positioned” across its practices and in Chicago.

“We will have departures just like we will have arrivals,” the firm said in a statement. “In today’s highly competitive environment, it is simply the nature of the beast for the legal industry.”

However, law firm consultant Peter Zeughauser of the Zeughauser Group[ says these sort of blockbuster lateral moves ](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/04/21/the-nature-of-the-beast-lateral-group-moves-gain-more-momentum/)are causing anxiety for smaller firms that would really like to keep these highly profitable attorneys right where they are:

“These firms have much more net operating income to play with, and with their large concentrations of lawyers in high-rate markets, they have higher average billing rates, and they’re just much more profitable. And they’re able to pick groups off,” he said.
“I don’t know a firm in the regional space that’s not anxious about that or nervous about that,” Zeughauser said.

Susan Mendelsohn, a Chicago-based legal recruiter who worked on the move, said the group fielded “extraordinary offers” from multiple firms trying to land the talent. Mendelsohn also has some theories as to why we’re seeing [large-scale lateral moves](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/paul-hastings-big-winner-in-blockbuster-lateral-move/) right now:

“Maybe the firms that need to merge aren’t merging, so larger, profitable groups are finding new homes within a larger platform that are more beneficial to their practice. Because if you’re at a smaller firm, there is a ceiling to your growth, for sure,” she said.

Whatever the reason behind them, these large lateral moves are sure spicing up Biglaw.

# Associates Should Share Salary Information With Each Other
## Sharing salary information is only awkward if firms use ignorance to take advantage of attorneys who should be earning more money.

As numerous readers of this website are already aware, many of the top law firms pay associates a set amount of money based on the year an attorney graduated from law school.  Indeed, salaries in Biglaw recently increased, and this website covered at length how many of the top law firms copied the salary scales of other firms to stay competitive with one another.  As a result of this somewhat uniform pay scale, it is usually pretty easy to find out what associates earn at many of the top law firms.  In fact, some directories even publish the pay scales of many Biglaw shops in order to increase transparency.

However, [the vast majority of attorneys do not work in Biglaw](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/balance-side-hustles-main-job/).  In addition, many attorneys at Biglaw shops might not be on a partnership track, and may not be paid the same amount of money as partnership-track associates who work at these shops.  In any case, most attorneys work at firms where salaries can vary widely from attorney to attorney

Of course, there are some criteria that are used to base salaries at many non-Biglaw firms.  These factors include experience, practice area, and a number of other considerations.  However, the most important factor that is assessed when awarding salaries at many law firms is how little a firm can pay an associate without upsetting them.  Many attorneys who work at non-Biglaw shops make less money simply because they previously worked at a job that paid less than the market rate.  In addition, other associates earn lower salaries simply because they did not protest their lower salary to management at their firms.

One of the ways that firms can oftentimes get away with underpaying associates is by encouraging people not to share salary information.  In fact, I distinctly remember two times during my career when bosses of mine suggested that I not share salary information so that I avoided creating any tension at the firm.  In addition, sharing salary information is extremely awkward, since knowing that someone makes more or less money than you can impact personal relationships.

Nevertheless, having a better understanding of how much money other attorneys earn at your firm can help attorneys negotiate higher salaries.  For instance, I had a buddy at a former firm who graduated from law school several years before me and who had worked at the shop for years prior to my arrival at the firm.  I shared my salary information with this attorney, and he was shocked to discover that he was paid less money than me and some other more junior associates.  My friend was an extremely experienced attorney, and he probably made less money simply because he earned even less cash at the beginning of his career, so the firm could get away with offering him less compensation.

My friend decided to discuss his salary with some of the partners at the firm, and he noted that many of the junior associates were making more money than him.  Of course, the partners had no excuse for why this attorney was making less money, and they did not want to lose a qualified attorney.  My buddy eventually received a sizable raise, and if he was not aware of my salary information, the firm could have continued to take advantage of my friend.

There are some who think  it is not polite to share salary information, and that sharing compensation numbers could create a hostile atmosphere at a firm.  This is nonsense.  Sharing salary information is only awkward if firms use ignorance to take advantage of attorneys who should be earning more money.

Furthermore, it is important to note that there are many public policy reasons why associates should share salary information with one another.  The main way that associates can discover if firms are discriminating against them on the basis of race, gender, or another protected class is through exchanging salary information.  This is why sharing salary information is typically protected by law, and associates should not be ashamed to discuss how much money they make with one another.  Indeed, this website has covered all of the gender discrimination lawsuits filed against many law firms, and it is much harder to discover if there is an illicit pay discrepancy between attorneys if individuals do not share salary information.

Of course, firms can avoid all of the drama of paying associates different sums of money by just giving everyone the same salary depending on when they graduated from law school.  This is what Biglaw firms do, and this lessens the risk of being accused of illicit pay discrepancies or creating drama at a firm.  Yes, compensation can and should vary based on the performance of an attorney, but differences in compensation can be doled out in the form of bonuses rather than varying salaries.  If all firms simply adopted a pay scale based on experience and varied compensation with bonuses, there would be more transparency and fewer reasons to share salary information.

However, so long as firms try to screw their associates by paying them the least amount of money possible, associates should share salary information with each other.  There is no other way to ensure you are not being underpaid by your firm or if a shop is being discriminatory in how it doles out compensation.

# Behind Biglaw's Dismal Diversity Numbers
## Let's delve into these numbers!

Surveys are not just a way for a law firm to know the numbers and to gain information. They also help strengthen the firm’s relationship with its associates. One of the top legal news services in the country, Law360, conducts the Glass Ceiling Survey — and this centers my discussion with Law360’s Kerry Benn. Kerry presents not only the numbers that result from the Glass Ceiling Survey, she also talks about the disparity between the law school numbers and the actual law firm numbers and what she thinks are the reasons why there are fewer women, especially women of color, in the field.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

# Yet Another Biglaw Firm Is Improving Its Parental Leave Benefits For Associates
## Firms stepping up their family-friendly policies is something that's worth celebrating.

If there’s ever been a Biglaw trend worth watching and definitely worth celebrating, this is it. It’s a well-known fact that it’s incredibly difficult for hard-working parents in extremely high-pressure jobs to spend good quality time with their children, and now more and more Biglaw firms are acknowledging that they must change their parental leave programs to get with the times. Now, Sidley Austin has joined the party with extended paid leave that’s gender-neutral.

The firm’s new program includes 14 weeks of paid parental leave for all new parents, and birthing parents will receive an additional 8 weeks of leave, for a total of 22 weeks paid leave. Perhaps most importantly, in its improved parental leave program, Sidley removed its prior primary and secondary caregiver designations, so now anyone may receive these benefits, regardless of gender. From [Big Law Business](https://biglawbusiness.com/sidley-austin-increases-paid-parental-leave-for-u-s-lawyers):

“The changes to our parental leave policy reflect the firm’s ongoing commitment to support our lawyers and attract the best talent,” Larry Barden, chair of Sidley’s management committee, said in a statement. “We review our parental leave and other policies on a regular basis to ensure they align with our lawyers’ needs and make Sidley an attractive destination for the next generation of lawyers.” …

“It is important that parental leave policies evolve to reflect societal change, and we recognize that,” Sidley’s Barden said. “We intend to continue to offer appealing benefits that will allow our lawyers to be their best selves, both at work and at home.”

Kudos to Sidley Austin on its new parental leave benefits. Firms stepping up their family-friendly policies is something we’ll continue to pay attention to — particularly as we head into recruiting season. Hopefully your firm is changing its ways when it comes to important policies like parental leave. Please [let us know](mailto:staci@abovethelaw.com) when it happens.

# Biglaw Merger Lands New Am Law 100 Firm In Our Stockings
## It's the season of coming together.

It’s been a spell since we’ve had a significant Biglaw merger. But the [rumors we were talking about back in April](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/biglaw-firms-in-rumored-tie-up-talks-refuse-to-comment-on-would-be-merger/) have finally come to pass and Arent Fox and Schiff Hardin will be merging effective March 1, 2022, to create ArentFox Schiff.

Hard luck for Hardin.

After years of watching the Am Law second hundred lose ground, the firms apparently decided their futures required bold action. With a reported $333.6 million and $173.9 million in revenue last year, Arent Fox and Schiff Hardin respectively clocked in at 107th and 163rd on the Am Law 200. Merging those figures on the back of an envelope, the new firm would come in around 77th in this year’s list, which [Am Law says](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/12/01/arent-fox-and-schiff-hardin-to-merge-creating-a-new-am-law-100-powerhouse/) would place it between Crowell & Moring and Barnes & Thornburg.

But you can’t necessarily rely on back of the envelope measurements like that. Slapping revenue figures together ignores the possibility of losing business due to conflicts or redundancies, as well as the possibility of gaining business due to leveraging new resources. Arent Fox is almost twice as big as Schiff Hardin, so the revenue gap doesn’t immediately signal some sort of fee schedule disconnect — a common problem in mergers. Arent Fox currently plays only in fairly big markets — NYC, DC, LA, SF, and Boston. Schiff Hardin adds the Chicagoland presence between Chicago and Lake Forest, but also an outpost in Ann Arbor. Beyond that, its attorneys operate in areas Arent Fox already works in. Will there be any fallout from the overlap in NYC, DC, SF, and the LA-area? Remains to be seen.

Still, the firms seem psyched about the merger. As Arent Fox chair Anthony Lupo told Am Law:

“It’s a compelling deal. I was most impressed with how complementary our practices are,” Lupo said in an exclusive interview with The American Lawyer, explaining as an example that while Arent Fox is strong in retail, Schiff brings strength in consumer products, and Schiff’s environmental strengths complement Arent’s agricultural tech offerings. “There were so many areas that we were lined up right next to each other. We were both in the same industry, but we weren’t competing with each other. It was a very robust combination.”

Is this the start of another wave of merger talk? The consolidation bug subsided for a while as firms just tried to keep ahead of COVID, but with things settling down, the door may be opening to more Am Law 200 tie-ups. It could be an interesting 2022!

# National Firm Not Matching Davis Polk Scale
## Not 'cool.'

To some extent, the bonus game is all about expectations. It’s why Davis Polk responded to Cravath’s bonus announcement with a supplemental “special bonus” rather than just raising the bonus amounts — the firm wants to be able to go back to the Cravath level next year and write off 2021 as an outlier.

No one wants to retreat from expectations. We’re seeing that with the Kirkland bonuses, where the firm yet again beat the market, but by significantly less than it beat the market in the past. Associates notice these things.

Today, McKool Smith informed attorneys of individual bonuses and, from what tipsters report, the firm matched!… Cravath.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
However, according to our intel, the firm opted out of the special bonus scale set by Davis Polk and ultimately matched by the Biglaw market (including Cravath eventually).

For the second year in a row the firm fails to give associates the special bonuses. While last year the firm ultimately did pay them, their failure to do so again is a bad look and associates are pissed.

It’s a curious strategy especially given last year. After weathering the criticism of 2020 and then handing over all the cash anyway, one might have thought the firm learned that this wasn’t tenable. We’ll have to wait and see if it has another tranche of payments in its future.

# Top 20 Biglaw Firm Announces Reopening Plans, And Lawyers Won't Be Required To Return To The Office
## Associates who are happy working remotely can keep doing just that.

Many law firms have been operating with a “post”-COVID mindset for quite some time now, but some are just now officially reopening their offices. For lawyers who have gotten used to the remote lifestyle that’s been emboldened by the ongoing pandemic, what they really want to know is how many times they’ll be required to return to the office each week. For one top firm that recently announced its return-to-office plans, the answer is they won’t.

Cooley — a firm that’s ranked at No. 19 in the 2021 Am Law 100, with $1,552,149,000 gross revenue in 2020 — released its reopening plans last week. The firm’s offices will be fully in play as of June 1, and all personnel must be vaccinated to set foot inside the doors. Perhaps most importantly, there is no in-office requirement for attorneys. That’s right, associates won’t have to return to their desks. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/04/20/cooley-sets-june-return-without-in-office-requirements-with-vaccine-mandate/) has some additional details from a memo sent by CEO Joe Conroy:

“At the core of our flexible approach is an acknowledgment that in the Cooley workplace of the future, one size will definitely not fit all. We will each have different perspectives, desires and unique life circumstances dictating our decisions around how much of our work life to conduct in the office,” Conroy wrote.

But he underscored that Cooley “will not be a virtual law firm.”

“Whether it is the morning greeting from our reception desk, the impromptu coffee run or the informal knowledge share across the hall, all of these moments have been missing from our lives. As we look toward the future, we will reimagine how we work together and how we interact with our workplaces, and our partners will lead by example,” Conroy wrote.

To us, Conroy’s messaging here seems to point to the fact that at some yet-to-be-determined point in the future, attorneys will be expected to make appearances at the office, but for the time being, those who are happy to work at home may continue to do so.

As soon as you find out about reopening plans at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# Biglaw Firm Admits To 'Painful' Mistake After Displaying Lynching Artwork
## That's a pretty big whoopsie.

There is something soulless about most corporate art. Be it faux-magnificent steel sculptures that could be the cover of an Atlas Shrugged reprint or [those humanoid paper maché abominations Big Tech keeps shoving down our throats](https://t-artmagazine.com/what-is-corporate-memphis-and-why-is-it-everywhere/), it can be refreshing to see art displayed in a business that has that je ne sais quoi associated with realness and raw feeling.

All that said, a good rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t be displaying dead bodies at law firms — and someone at Duane Morris should have gotten the memo:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
A tipster notified us that a couple paintings were mounted on a wall without a placard. That’s no crime on its own. But, when one of the paintings depicts what looks like a man recording a lynching victim, you should expect people to scramble for context. This is part of the firm’s response:

Duane Morris is committed to providing a safe and supportive working environment at our offices. Recently, privately owned artwork was installed – by non-Duane Morris personnel and without Duane Morris management’s knowledge – at our Philadelphia headquarters and we acknowledge this particular artwork was disturbing and painful. It was installed after normal business hours and the following morning when Firm management discovered the work, they immediately took it down. Our Firm Chairman Matthew A. Taylor and Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer and partner Joseph K. West subsequently conducted a video meeting with the Firm’s Black/African American Attorneys and Black/African American Staff ERG organizations, which was attended by more than 100 attorneys and staff members. During this meeting, our Chairman apologized for this mistake to the group personally and on behalf of the Firm.

We will continue to work collectively to learn from this event, as it does not reflect our Firm values.

The artwork is from 20th century African American artist Herbert Singleton, whose work depicts images of the poverty, violence and crime he experienced growing up in the American South.

This piece was not appropriate for display at our law firm, regardless of individual views on art and the purpose of art in our society. It is part of a private, world-renowned collection of “Outsider Art” owned by a retired partner and was installed by non-firm personnel.

In short: late at night, when no employee or member of higher management that could be held responsible was present, unnamed art aficionados with poor taste installed a portrait of a lynched man — we are just as shocked as you are!

This reverse burglary narrative would make more sense if it was actually just [some hype building for the second season of Lupin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPdb8njLCrA).

The firm’s statement went on to note that when a piece of art gets taken down for curation and conservation reasons, another is hung in its place, as happened here. You mean to tell us that some unidentified, non-firm employee is entrusted to unilaterally decide which paintings from a retired partner’s collection of artwork gets displayed, but lacks the common sense to think, “Hey, dead body on floor 12 might not be the best look for the firm”? The pieces of the art collection –presumably owned by Sheldon Bonovitz — are interesting [and worth reading about](https://www.artworkarchive.com/blog/collector-spotlight-jill-and-sheldon-bonovitz-champions-of-outsider-art). This piece in particular would be great for a museum. Little weird to be in someone’s living room but hey, decorate your castle. But decorating a workplace corridor with a sprinkle of terror for the sake of rawness is a gross commodification of grittiness that Thelonius Ellison [spends half a movie lambasting](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5IoNK5YDoI&pp=ygUaQW1lcmljYW4gZmljdGlvbiByYXcgYmxhY2s%3D). Things are clearer with hindsight, but whoever is responsible for hanging this picture really should have known better.

# It's Time For Biglaw Firms To Get Real About Billable Hours Requirements
## The truth shall set you free.

[T]he problems that can accompany billable hour requirements are tractable and avoidable. Transparency is an indispensable baseline to making the billable hour work well. Law firms must be clear about expectations—the real ones. State them up front. Better yet, provide current and historical statistics such as average hours worked per lawyer per week, month, and year, ideally by office location, department, and seniority. In the absence of firms standing by publicized expectations, this data would provide a window into any divergence between stated requirements and reality.

— Members of the American Lawyer’s Young Lawyer Editorial Board, writing about the need for Biglaw firms to honestly [disclose incoming associates’ “real” billable hour requirements](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/07/30/associates-just-want-the-truth-about-billable-hour-requirements/) (i.e., not just the bare minimum that’s required to keep their jobs, but what’s actually expected to maintain bonus eligibility and partnership consideration).

# Biglaw Partner Takes Shots At Banks To Promote Side Hustle
## He just comes right out and calls banks -- his clients, mind you -- untrustworthy.

Mohammed Paracha via NRF

Massive financial institutions just love leaning on massive legal institutions, a.k.a. Biglaw, for their legal needs. After all, they have the size and know how to handle complex legal matters. One such lawyer that routinely handles such complex matters for banks is [Mohammed Paracha](https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/en/people/121438), a banking and finance partner and head of Middle East at Norton Rose Fulbright.

Paracha is also a [founder](https://www.nester.com/who-we-are) of Nester — a real estate financing company. In a video promoting Nester, he didn’t just hype the fintech disruptor — he takes shots at traditional banks, as [reported by](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-bold-nrf-banking-partner-rubbishes-banks) Roll on Friday:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In his video promoting his company, Paracha and co-founder Youness Abidou take aim at the traditional banks as they position Nestor as a disrupter helping people the current system ignores.

“We can reach the masses and touch hearts and minds by empowering people to achieve the goals that they simply haven’t been able to achieve through the banks”, explains Paracha.

As viewers rush to draw down their pensions so they can fund a bridging loan for a dental practice in Manchester, the NRF partner moves in for kill: “Do you know how your money is used by a bank?”, he asks.

“We are programmed to trust banks, but then they use our earnings to make greater profits for themselves. Is that okay? Why do we keep trusting them? Isn’t it time your hard earned money did more for you? Isn’t it time you tried something new, something smart, something that improves your bottom line and not your bank’s?”

Despite the verbal side-eye Paracha’s throwing his clients’ way, they aren’t saying anything about the video — at least not publicly. And Paracha’s statement on the video controversy focuses on the benefits of Nestor, if not the way he’s chosen to promote the venture:

Paracha told RollOnFriday, “I invested in Nester in a personal capacity in 2018 because of its social impact aims, which are to empower everyday Muslim consumers who have very few financial products to invest in due to the prohibition on interest”.

He said, “Muslim consumers remain one of the most financially excluded groups in the UK, which is compounded by the high inflationary environment, and many retail banks are unable to cater to this niche market because it is very difficult to do so in a financially viable manner”.

These are great reasons for Paracha to invest in Nester! But the controversy shows how potentially messy things can get when a lawyer’s outside interests overlap with their clients’ business.

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

Since January of 2022, how many lateral partners has Paul Hastings added from such noteworthy firms as Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, Gibson Dunn, Shearman & Sterling, Buckley, and O’Melveny & Myers?

Hint: According to chair Frank Lopez, they’re not done expanding either, “Our strategy is to continue to elevate our reputation and work on our clients’ most complex and important matters. While we are always looking to strategically grow across all of our practices, we would expect to grow in finance, private equity and M&A, capital markets, litigation and real estate this year.”

See the answer on the next page.

# Biglaw Partner Fired For 'Inappropriate Personal Conduct'
## Mayer Brown takes a clear stand: some things are more important than a partner's book of business.

Zac Barnett

I don’t want to go around getting all optimistic, but is it possible that things are really changing in Biglaw? It seems elite law firm have pretty much decided that inappropriate conduct is a nonstarter for their employees — and that includes high-profile parters.

Last night, an email was sent to all attorneys at Mayer Brown by Chairman [Paul Theiss](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/people/t/theiss-paul-w?tab=overview), informing them that Chicago-based partner Zac Barnett had been terminated from the firm. The email revealed Barnett was fired for “inappropriate personal conduct with a subordinate,” noting that such behavior was “contrary to Mayer Brown’s core values.” Theiss also said additional details would not be forthcoming to protect the privacy of a third party.


In 2015, Barnett was named leader of the firm’s global Fund Finance practice, where he managed a team of six partners and 17 associates and counsel. At the time, partner and co-leader of Mayer Brown’s global Banking & Finance practice Doug Doetsch said, “Zac’s new title is a reflection of the leadership role that he has already been fulfilling for several years, and he has earned the trust of his colleagues.” All references to Barnett have since been removed from Mayer Brown’s website.

While the exact nature of what Barnett did may not be public, it is good to see Mayer Brown take such a strong stance against inappropriate conduct. The era when a partner’s book of business was the only thing that mattered to a firm may be over, and stances like the one Mayer Brown took do more to prove that point that a million flowery words on the subject.

When asked for comment, a representative of the firm sent Above the Law the following statement, which largely repeats the language of Theiss’s earlier email:

Zac Barnett is being terminated by Mayer Brown. His termination is due to his inappropriate personal conduct with a subordinate; the conduct was unrelated to client matters and is contrary to the firm’s core values. To respect the privacy of a third party, we are not providing additional details.

# How To Set Better (And Healthier) Boundaries In Your Career
## What is your end goal? What are you trying to prove by working so hard? Who are you trying to impress?

As you enter your legal career, you’re excited to land your first associate attorney role and see the fruits of your labor (i.e., that paycheck). You eagerly show up early to the office, stay late after the partners leave, put in weekend hours, and you eagerly take on the extra research/memo projects that your boss shovels out. You feel a sense of pride and excitement when the managing partner compliments your work product and work ethic.

Year after year, you continue pushing yourself, stretching your boundaries further out, citing that they are simply part of “paying your dues.” You miss out on extracurriculars and other nonwork activities because long hours are just the nature of the profession. You remind yourself how you were conditioned to outwork and outperform — some of which is that Type A personality that helped you excel during your three years of law school and the bar exam.

For the 12 years I practiced law, I consistently took on more work than was expected of me. I always volunteered for the projects no one else wanted, and I willingly put in the late nights and weekend hours. That same work ethic carried over into my entrepreneurial journey — for more than six years, I easily worked 12 to 14 hours a day, tacked on extra hours at night and on the weekends, and I always gave myself shorter deadlines to impress clients.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Hard work paid off, and my professional and financial success grew at a rapid rate — long client waitlists, happy clients sending more business in the form of referrals, pages and pages of articles and media features, large-scale speaking engagements, etc. I exceeded financial metrics I never dreamed of ascertaining.

While the massive success felt good and fulfilling, on the other side of it, I was juggling extreme fatigue and frustration for being spread so thin but always inevitably saying “yes” to others. My anxiety and high-performing pressure spiraled at a rapid rate — externally I had it all together, but internally, I was exhausted and often resentful watching others who bragged and boasted about not working late nights or weekends and always being present for family, friends, wine tastings, and vacations.

At a certain point, I began to ask myself: What is my end goal? What am I trying to prove by working so hard? Who am I trying to impress? How much longer can I truly continue to work at this pace, and do I want to?

One of the managing attorneys in my last in-house counsel role referred to me as the “doormat employee” — always overextending myself and always saying yes, and thus, always being a doormat for others to step on.

It hit me like a ton of bricks. Throughout my legal career, there was an overarching theme: I never implemented work boundaries. She was just the first to call me out on it.

Of course, on the opposite end of the spectrum was a senior counsel who constantly bragged about his “work smart, not hard” mentality. Of course, he was the last one in the office door in the mornings, the first one out when the clock struck 5 p.m., the one who always took a lunch break, and of course, the one who always passed on the extra projects. He made it look so effortless.

I hit a roadblock last year during the pandemic when I [suffered through COVID-19](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/how-my-battle-with-covid-19-taught-me-its-okay-to-take-those-sick-days/) and other personal losses. I began to draw boundaries because my physical, mental, and emotional health required it. I had no choice but to scale back and [prioritize myself](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/why-i-am-setting-intentions-instead-of-resolutions-in-the-new-year/). For the first time, I accepted the fact that I am just one person and there are only so many calls, emails, documents, etc. that I can handle in a single day. Only this time, I took actionable steps to create boundaries. I remembered my managing attorney’s words, and I used them as a guide to implement the boundaries.

Two years into the pandemic, we can all admit to the struggles of setting boundaries. Some of this is due to a lack of separation between home and work since they now occur in the same physical place. Other portions of it are due to having more time to think about what work means to us and what we want our work-life balance to look like.

Perhaps you’ve even asked yourself: is there more to life than lawyering?

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In conversations with clients, I ask them: what does your exit strategy look like for your career? How do those last five to 10 years of work look like for you? How has COVID changed that strategy?

As a recovering people-pleaser and “doormat employee,” I knowingly admit just how challenging it is to define boundaries. Our lack of boundaries in the workplace can often transcend into our personal lives, making it even harder to stop bad behavior felt in relationships and friendships.

Remember, boundaries also look different to different people. Some boundaries occur in not responding to evening emails until the next day, limiting being available after 6 p.m. for work-related calls, or even holding off on responding to nonurgent emails that come in over the weekend. For some, it’s checking their emails at set hours in the day or in blocks of time instead of responding to each email as it comes in. For others, it’s holding consultations or client meetings at specific times rather than making themselves readily available.

Work boundaries are imperative — they protect our internal energy, our time, and our sanity. They also keep us fueled for success and grounded in our professional and personal existence.

The key is to be clear, specific, and honest when setting boundaries — both with yourself and those at work. I remind myself that my own boundary setting is a [work in progress](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/how-im-redefining-what-work-hard-means-in-2021/) — it’s never perfect, and it’s always being modified to the situation.

Going forward in 2022, how are you creating better and healthier boundaries for your career?

# Biglaw Firm's Easy, Breezy Approach To Office Reopening
## What works for you this summer?

This weekend, I had an interesting conversation with a friend (who I saw in PERSON; science is amazing) about what it means to be “post” COVID. As my extended friend/family group is rapidly becoming fully vaccinated (and I’ve always worked at least part-time remotely) I argued that we are already societally there — or at least nearly there. My companion said it wouldn’t be until work went back to normal, and of course, what “normal” means is very much up in the air. But with June already here, Biglaw firms are trying their best to figure out what that means.

And they are struggling to figure it out as much as we all are.

Take Kelley Drye’s office reopening plan. The firm, ranked 141 in the Am Law 200 with $221,916,000 in gross revenue last year, put out guidance on returning to the office. According to a firm representative:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“Kelley Drye is encouraging its lawyers and administrative staff and professionals to use the summer months to ease back to an in-office work schedule by coming to the office from time to time. After Labor Day, we expect to move to a fuller return to the office with flexibility for remote work.”

Which basically boils down to, do the best you can…. and hopefully we’ll be back after Labor Day. Not the most concrete, but perhaps the most real world. We’ve not yet heard if the firm has issued formal guidance on vaccinations or masks.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# ABA Takes Giant Step Backwards On Transparency
## An abuse of the accreditation process that will benefit a handful of schools and hurt prospective law students.

Without public input, the Council for the ABA Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar has rolled back measures that make law schools more transparent. The ABA has eliminated from the current consumer information report, available for every ABA-approved law school, several pertinent job categories. It has also obfuscated whether jobs are funded by the law school or earned on the open market. The result: students will be misled after years of progress.

Both the process and substance have already stirred the ire of those in and around legal education.

To see why, it’s worth recounting the recent history of transparency at U.S. law schools. In [2010](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/04/increasing-transparency-in-employment-reporting-by-law-schools-what-is-to-be-done/), my [organization](https://www.lawschooltransparency.com/) made national hay about deceptive employment statistics used by law schools and blessed by the ABA. In their marketing materials, law schools used a “basic employment rate,” typically ranging from 85% – 95% because the rate did not, among numerous flaws, distinguish between jobs at Starbucks, in the law library, and with major law firms. Schools would also advertise six-figure salaries without reporting response rates, which were sometimes as low as 10%. As a result, the ABA and law schools took a beating in the national press, which undoubtedly contributed to demand for law school [decreasing dramatically](https://www.lawschooltransparency.com/reform/projects/Admissions-Tracker/).

Fast forward a few years, beginning with job statistics for the class of 2011, and the ABA began to require law schools to publish far more transparent data. This was accomplished through a very public, deliberative process. In subsequent years, the ABA made additional changes to data collection, reporting, and publishing. Sometimes the changes were positive, other times they were not, but the process was collaborative and transparent.

This June, the Council did a complete about-face when it implemented revised disclosures and ordered a change to the data collection/reporting process. There was no public notice and comment. Neither Law School Transparency nor the National Association for Law Placement, a key player in law school jobs data reporting since the 1970s, were even privately consulted. Jim Leipold, NALP’s executive director, told me that “NALP was not involved in the decision. Technically, no one was. They did this behind closed doors without any period of notice and comment.”

Writing for [TaxProf](http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2017/08/without-any-transparency-in-the-process-the-council-for-the-section-of-legal-education-and-admission.html), Jerry Organ, a law professor at St. Thomas University, Minnesota School of Law and transparency advocate, said that the Council “simply approved a proposal purporting to simplify reporting of employment outcomes that was submitted by one Council member, Paul Mahoney, whose law school was among several that would benefit from the reclassification of law-school-funded positions.”

Meanwhile, the newly adopted proposal has sparked considerable discontent on the deans-only listserv, with a number of deans echoing the concerns expressed in a lengthy email this morning by Matthew Diller from Fordham Law. Many career services deans are also upset with the changes coming from nowhere.

Here’s the timeline of events:

May 30, 2017. Paul Mahoney, the former dean of the University of Virginia School of Law, writes a [memo](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/legal_education_and_admissions_to_the_bar/council_reports_and_resolutions/August2017OpenSessionMaterials/17_august_EQ_report_forms.authcheckdam.pdf) to the Council. He argues that the consumer information report each law school must publish should be simplified. He also argues that various definitions and categories should be revised.

June 1-2, 2017. The Council approves, after minimal discussion, the exact form report Mahoney mocked up. The plan is to change the data collecting/reporting process to reflect the new report for students graduating in 2018.

There is nothing positive to say about the process by which the Council adopted the proposal. Trust in law schools and the ABA have not been restored. Substantially changing the available consumer information without any input makes restoring that trust even more challenging.

As for the actual [substance of the proposal](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/legal_education_and_admissions_to_the_bar/council_reports_and_resolutions/August2017OpenSessionMaterials/17_august_EQ_report_forms.authcheckdam.pdf), simplifying the current report makes sense if done properly, but the new form makes consequential mistakes.

###Three Good Ideas From The New Form
(1) School-funded jobs get their own category under “employer type”
On the current report, if a law school funds a job with the government, the graduate counts as working in “government.” On the new report, these graduates will count as “school funded.” This makes the government hiring picture clearer. After all, the government was not willing to pay them to work—the school picked up the tab.

(2) Local, State, and Other Clerkships combined
On the current report, these clerks are reported in two categories: local/state in one, other clerks in the second. In 2016, just 20 graduates (of over 37,000) were in the latter category.

(3) Collapsing part-time and short-term jobs into one category
The current report includes five columns that categorize jobs by term and time.



The new report includes three columns. If a job is either short-term or part-time, it gets lumped into the “other” category.



These three changes make the report more readable without prospective law students losing valuable information.

###Four Terrible Ideas From The New Form
(1) Eliminates the total number of graduates from the report
The new report does not include the number of graduates, which means someone using the report will have to add up other columns to figure out what percentage of the graduating class falls into a given category.

(2) Combines law firm categories
The current report breaks the law firm category down by the number of attorneys at the firm. The categories are solo practitioners, 2-10 attorneys, 11-25, 26-50, 51-100, 101-250, 251-500, and 501+. Inconsistent with more than two decades of data collection by NALP, the new report combines these categories differently: 2-10, 10-100, 100-500, and 500+. Amazingly, Mahoney’s mock-up report, which the Council approved, sloppily created overlap in these categories. The Section of Legal Education will fix that oversight, but it demonstrates the seriousness of the process.

Sloppiness aside, the new categories group law firms that have nothing in common. Firms with 10-25 attorneys are vastly different from firms with 50-100 attorneys. Further, firms with 251-500 attorneys are more alike firms with 501+ attorneys than firms with 100-251 attorneys.

(3) Eliminates important school-funded transparency
While the new report does reapportion graduates in school-funded jobs from government or public interest into their own category, it does the opposite “above the line.” That is, school-funded jobs have been moved back into the ever-important bar passage required category, obfuscating whether a school’s graduates are getting jobs on the open market. As Jerry Organ pointed out (quoted above), this change substantially affects the statistics at a handful of schools. It is a completely inappropriate use of the accrediting process to benefit these schools.

(4) Combines unemployed and unknown.
The new report combines three categories of unemployed with the unknown employment status category into one “bad” category. Among other benefits, the unknown category provides useful information about which schools do a very poor job with collecting data. The various unemployed categories also shed considerable light on shady practices. Most egregiously, this will preclude reporting a school’s unemployment rate.

Finally, it’s one thing to simplify the public report for consumers. It’s another to stop providing the disaggregated data to researchers who may, for instance, want to investigate the relationship between part-time or short-term jobs and race or gender. And it’s even worse to stop collecting the relevant data all together for accreditation purposes. This will make the auditing process more difficult. It will also make interim monitoring of accreditation status more difficult on the Section of Legal Education staff.

The Council meets again in a week. I hope and expect to see the Council reverse course. But it will not be enough to acknowledge the considerable procedural and substantive mistakes and to start the revision process. The Council must overturn its June decision. Otherwise, I suspect we’ll see Congressional involvement and Department of Education complaints yet again, along with the prolonged, negative, and national attention that comes with it.

# Big Changes On The Horizon For Boies Schiller Bonuses
## Welcome to the market standard.

There are a lot of changes going on at Boies Schiller. Most of these changes have been a [deliberate effort ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/everyone-seems-to-be-overreacting-to-these-boies-schiller-departures/)to move away from the eat-what-you-kill model that resulted in a series of associated fiefdoms and towards a more traditional Biglaw model.

The latest change that puts the firm more in line with its peers is a radical departure on their bonus structure. For a long time, the firm prided itself on its generous bonus formula that includes a revenue share component that affords associates a cut of the matters they work on, which for contingency work can be massive.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
According to a[ report](https://www.law.com/2020/05/29/boies-schiller-flexner-to-replace-associate-formula-bonus-system-with-market-rate-scheme/) from Law.com, Boies Schiller is making a move towards market rate bonuses:

In a statement, co-managing partner Nick Gravante confirmed that Boies Schiller is adopting a new associate compensation system, although he did not provide further details about the previous formula system or that the new system would be market-based. He said the compensation changes are a “positive step in the firm’s ongoing restructuring, which ensure that associate compensation is aligned with the firm’s strategic goals.”

Gravante also confirmed that current Boies Schiller associates may choose which bonus structure to be compensated with. ”We believe associates are substantially benefited by having the option of staying with our current system or choosing the new system,” he added.

Though Gravante was tightlipped about the new structure, sources at the firm say the scale is “slightly higher than the market rate set by Milbank” [last year.](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/breaking-biglaw-bonuses-are-here/)

There have also been criticism of Boies’s bonus structure’s opacity. And while junior associates often make out better than peers at other firms, senior associates often compare less favorably than the market standard. And one slow year at the firm can have compounding effects:

Associates who did not hit their minimum hours would be put “in the red,” meaning that they had to make up the money and hours the following year. One former Boies Schiller attorney equated this rollover to a “debtor’s prison.”

The new compensation system is an effort to bring more transparency to the firm, where office managing partners and executive committee members are left in the dark regarding equity and compensation, sources close to the firm said.

It’ll be very interesting to see exactly what the firm’s bonus scale is when the end of 2020 finally rolls around.

# Another Biglaw Firm Matches Bonuses, Plus Extra Cash For High Billers
## Extra money means extra holiday cheer.

Bonus season really is the best time of the Biglaw year. Sure, you probably worked a ton and had to sacrifice your personal life to do so, but at least you get a nice big bonus in recognition of all that hard work. But just how generous will those bonuses be?

That question was largely answered when Milbank [acted first in announcing bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/breaking-biglaw-bonuses-are-here/), then Cravath[ matched that scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/cravath-announces-bonuses-now-the-2019-bonus-season-can-really-begin/). Now Cadwalader has announced that their associates will also be compensated on those market rates as well.

And the market scale that pretty much all the big firms will be following is:

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Class of 2019 – $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2018 – $15,000
Class of 2017 – $25,000
Class of 2016 – $50,000
Class of 2015 – $65,000
Class of 2014 – $80,000
Class of 2013 – $90,000
Class of 2012+ – $100,000

Plus, the exciting part for those who’ve notched a particularly busy year, is that associates and counsel who bill over 2,200 hours will receive bonuses of 120 percent of their class year. Which is a nice extra way to say thank you. Bonuses will be paid by the firm in February. ([Full memo on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/another-biglaw-firm-matches-bonuses-plus-extra-cash-for-high-billers/2/))

Remember, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Biglaw Firm Offers Associates 75 Billable Hours For Diversity & Inclusion Work
## This is the third highest number of hours that any firm has offered yet.

Biglaw firms across the country are implementing all manner of initiatives to bring attention to the importance of diversity and inclusion among their ranks. We’ve previously acknowledged [Dorsey & Whitney](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/biglaw-firm-introduces-diversity-hours-that-count-toward-associate-billable-requirements/), [Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/care-about-biglaw-diversity-well-now-you-can-bill-for-it/), [Davis Wright Tremaine](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/5-concrete-steps-law-firms-can-take-to-advance-diversity-equity-and-inclusion/), [Reed Smith](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/the-first-biglaw-firm-to-offer-billable-diversity-hours-for-all-timekeepers/), [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/top-25-biglaw-firm-offers-bonus-eligible-diversity-inclusion-billable-hours/), [Baker McKenzie](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/top-5-biglaw-firm-raises-the-bar-on-billable-diversity-inclusion-hours/), and [Ropes & Gray](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/top-biglaw-firm-offers-associates-100-billables-hours-for-diversity-inclusion-work/) as firms where approved diversity and inclusion-related work will be billable for attorneys and will count toward bonus thresholds. We’ve just received word that in the final days of Black History Month, yet another Am Law 100 firm rolled out a similar program in an effort to show just how dedicated it is to furthering diversity and inclusion within the legal profession.

Locke Lord —  a firm that brought in $496,433,000 gross revenue in 2019 — announced yesterday that effective January 1, 2021, attorneys at the firm will be able to receive credit for up to 75 hours of qualifying diversity and inclusion activities toward their annual billable hours requirement. Here’s an excerpt from the firm’s press release on its new policy:

The announcement closely follows several recent actions to further elevate and strengthen the Firm’s diversity and inclusion efforts. After achieving Mansfield Rule Certification 3.0 from Diversity Lab in 2020, which requires firms to consider a diverse slate of candidates for a defined list of roles, committees and leadership activities, Locke Lord is currently participating in the Mansfield Rule 4.0 Certification, which will conclude by July 2021. Locke Lord also achieved a 100 percent rating in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s 2021 Corporate Equality Index for the fifth consecutive year. A perfect score in this annual report evaluating policies and practices related to LGBTQ employees, culture and corporate social responsibility earns the Firm the distinction of being an employer of choice for LGBTQ employees.

Congratulations to Locke Lord on its commitment to diversity, and for offering its attorneys a way to create a more inclusive workplace. At 75 hours, the firm’s diversity billables are higher than almost every other firm that has announced such programming, save for Ropes & Gray (100 hours) and Baker McKenzie (125 hours). What an admirable way to support diversity and inclusion efforts.

Which firms will be the next to step up and do what’s right?

# Donald Trump Wishes He Was As Gangsta As Rodrigo Duterte
## This is what happens when you elect people who aren't ""regular politicians.""

Yes, that is a giant E. Honda in Davao, where Duterte used to be mayor. You’re welcome.

In my ongoing attempt to make Americans realize what would happen under a Trump presidency, here’s another Rodrigo Duterte story. During a nationally televised Filipino Senate hearing, a self-proclaimed “death squad militiaman” testified on his alleged work for Duterte during Duterte’s tenure as mayor of Davao. From the [Daily News](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/rodrigo-duterte-ordered-murders-killed-official-hitman-article-1.2793228?utm_content=bufferfd8c2&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=NYDailyNewsTw):

Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte once killed a justice department official with an Uzi machine gun and was responsible for about 1,000 extra-judicial murders of criminals and political rivals during his time as a city mayor, a self-professed former death squad militiaman said…

Among the most disturbing allegations to come out of [Edgar] Matobato’s testimony was that the then-mayor of Davao City personally shot the justice department employee during a standoff at a road block in 1993…

“Mayor Duterte was the one who finished him off. Jamisola (the justice department official) was still alive when he (Duterte) arrived. He emptied two Uzi magazines on him,” Matobato said.

A spokesman for Duterte, Martin Andanar, denied the allegations.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
When Donald Trump thinks he could shoot a man on 5th Avenue without hurting his chances, Duterte is his proof of concept.

I bring this up for two reasons:

1. Holy Jesus Christ, dude. The Philippines is supposed to be a real country, not a volcanic lair controlled by a Bond villain.

2. This is what happens when you elect people who claim they aren’t “regular politicians.” There’s a benefit to being regular. Regular people do not go around Grand Theft Auto-ing justice department officials. They don’t tell the U.N. to go f**k itself. REGULAR people don’t think Doctor Oz is a real doctor!

Duterte, Brexit, the rise of Trump… I’m starting to think that everything [Plato ever said about democracy](https://classicalwisdom.com/plato-and-the-disaster-of-democracy/) was entirely correct.

Observe, too, how grandly Democracy sets her foot upon all our fine theories of education,–how little she cares for the training of her statesmen! The only qualification which she demands is the profession of patriotism. Such is democracy — a pleasing, lawless various sort of government, distributing equality to equals and unequals alike.

Elie Mystal is an editor of Above the Law and the Legal Editor for [More Perfect](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolabmoreperfect). He can be reached [@ElieNYC](https://twitter.com/ElieNYC?lang=en) on Twitter, or at [elie@abovethelaw.com](mailto:elie@abovethelaw.com). He just used Rodrigo Duterte and Plato to slam Trump in the same post, and believes he should get some extra credit for that.

# 'Legal Tech Lists': The 10 Most Significant Legal Tech Developments Since 2010
## Startups, AI, the cloud, and much more.

Every year, I write a year-end wrap-up of the most significant developments in legal technology. 

At the end of the past decade, I decided to [look back on the most significant developments of the 2010s](https://www.lawnext.com/2020/01/the-decade-in-legal-tech-the-10-most-significant-developments.html) as a whole. It may well have been the most tumultuous decade ever in changing how legal services are delivered.

Here, I revisit those changes — and add a few post-2020 updates. 

1. The Surge of the Startup

Undeniably, the 2010s were the decade of the startup, a decade that brought multiple stories of ambitious law students and innovative lawyers launching companies that quickly became major players. 

Sure, there were plenty of failures too. Not everyone can or will succeed. But somewhere out there right now is the next Clio, the next Fastcase, maybe even the next Westlaw.

So my No. 1 pick for the top-10 stories of the decade in legal tech is the startup — and the influence startups have had, and will continue to have, in shaping and reshaping the legal industry.

2. The New Era of Artificial Intelligence

In 2010, AI wasn’t really much of a “thing” in legal. By the end of the decade, it was much more pervasive, but still not a dominant technology. Now, in 2023, thanks in large part to GPT, it seems to be everything everywhere all at once.

We have yet to see the full potential of generative AI in legal, but with GPT-4 having passed the bar exam and big firm partners extolling the virtues of GPT-powered “legal assistants,” it is clear that we are on the cusp of a new generation of technology that will disrupt the practice of law for many decades to come.

3. Skies Clear for the Cloud

For anyone new to law practice, it may be difficult to fathom the degree to which lawyers feared the cloud before 2010. 

We still see evidence and remnants of that, as many firms continue to resist moving core functions to the cloud. But where a decade ago the cloud seemed ominous, it now is widely accepted as inevitable.

Some among you might argue that we’d reached that point much earlier, others might contend we’re not yet there. But what nobody can deny is that we have come 180 degrees in our use of the cloud. 

Something else that nobody can deny is our trajectory forward. As we cross over into a new decade, there is no question where the future lies. It is in the cloud.

4. The Untethering of Law Practice

The first iPhone came to market in June 2007, the first Android tablet in 2009, and the first iPad in 2010. 

These smart devices, combined with the growth of the cloud, ushered in a new era in mobility. 

Over the course of the decade, lawyers went from being effectively tethered to their desks to being able to work from anywhere.

The untethering of law practice has been a sea change so dramatic and so far reaching that we hardly even notice it anymore. But it has changed law practice forever.

5. The Proliferation of Practice Management

Practice management is not the sexiest of topics, given an industry abuzz with talk of artificial intelligence, analytics and blockchain. 

But it is an area of legal technology that has had a profound impact on the legal industry over the last decade. 

It has been instrumental in moving us from a profession that barely used technology to one that now sees it as essential and routine.

6. Upheaval in Legal Ethics

We were just shy of the start of this decade when, in 2009, then ABA President Carolyn B. Lamm appointed a special Commission on Ethics 20/20 to consider whether advances in legal technology and the globalization of legal practice called for changes in the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct.

No one could have known then what a tumultuous decade it would be for legal ethics, or that the decade would close with major challenges underway to long-accepted standards of legal practice and professional regulation.

Indeed, the Commission on Ethics 20/20 did call for changes. 

To my mind, the most significant — one I described at the time as a sea change in the legal profession — came in 2012, when the ABA formally approved a change to the Model Rules of Professional Conduct to make clear that lawyers have a duty to be competent not only in the law and its practice, but also in technology.

7. The Ascension of the Client

Since 2010, the tables have turned, with clients wielding more power than ever before in the delivery of legal services. It has brought about a change that futurist Jordan Furlong captures succinctly in the title of his 2017 book, “Law is a Buyer’s Market.” 

“Newly empowered clients have adopted aggressive buying behaviours and begun dictating the terms of their relationships to law firms,” he says. “Law has become a buyer’s market, and it’s never going back.”

Indeed, the rise of the client has been a defining trend of this decade. It is a trend driven by the demand for better access to legal services, better service from legal providers, greater accountability from legal providers, and fairer and more-transparent pricing.

8. The Global Networking of the Legal Industry

Think about how the legal profession’s use of social media evolved over the decade. 

In 2010, both Facebook and Twitter were still relatively nascent companies, and LinkedIn, although eight years old, was just beginning to gain significant momentum. In that year, just 17 percent of firms maintained a presence on any social network, with most of those on LinkedIn. By 2019, that number had risen to 80% of firms.

Social media knows no borders. Through blogs, Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter, legal professionals are connected to and engaged with their peers in every corner of the globe. 

The problems we face as legal and justice professionals are universal, and so are the solutions we build to address them.

9. The Accelerating Influx of Investments

The legal industry has turned a corner on its use and adoption of technology. Law firms are becoming innovators, legal departments are demanding efficiencies and process improvements, a cavernous justice gap cries out for better delivery systems, and regulatory reform efforts foretell a new era of private-sector involvement in the delivery of legal services.

Investors get this. The surge in investment that marked the end of this decade is not just a trend – it is a condition of the market from which there is no turning back.

10. The Emergence of Data-Driven Legal Practice

For generations, the watchwords of the legal profession were intuition and experience. Whether as a lawyer advising clients or a judge deciding peoples’ fates, our wisdom was our most-valued asset, and the primary driver of our decision-making was gut instinct. Not only did we not use data, but it was not available to us even if we wanted to.

The problem with that is that we have no real understanding of what works and what does not. As James Greiner, director of the Access to Justice Lab at Harvard Law School, told me in 2017, “In no field is resistance to evidence-based thinking more ferocious than in United States legal practice.”

However, in the last few years, lawyers have started to appreciate the value of data and the insights it can provide. 

The most dramatic example of this has been litigation analytics – tools that take data derived from court dockets and documents and apply analytics to make predictions about likely outcomes or patterns. 

At last, it seems, the legal profession has discovered the value of data as a tool to drive more-informed and more-strategic decisions across all aspects of practice.

Honorable Mentions

Here are five other developments over the decade that will shape the legal profession for years to come:

Cybersecurity insecurity. Ah, for the naïve days of 1999, when the ABA issued an ethics opinion saying in so many words, “Don’t worry about encryption, your data is secure.” Fast forward to 2017, when the ABA felt compelled to update that opinion. This time, said the ABA, the cybersecurity question lawyers need to ask is not if, but when.

The buzz around blockchain. One of the most talked-about technologies of the last half of the decade was one that did not exist in the first half. But for all the buzz around blockchain, we are still waiting for the killer app.

The growth of the ALSP. The 2010s brought the rise and proliferation of alternative legal service providers such as Elevate and UnitedLex. They have become so dominant and mainstream a force that it is no longer accurate to call them “alternative.”

The rise of legal ops. The legal operations professional has become one of the most influential positions in legal departments and law firms. Reflecting this has been the founding of the Corporate Legal Officers Consortium (CLOC) and the creation of a legal operations section within the Association of Corporate Counsel.

Women move to the forefront. Women have played leading roles in the development of legal technology for as long as there has been legal technology. But as I wrote in a 2017 column, the latter part of the 2010s seemed to be a turning point for women in legal tech, with women at the forefront of the industry to an unprecedented degree, leading companies and holding other positions of influence.

# Everybody Freak Out: Bedbugs In Biglaw
## Now comes word that you may catch the modern scourge just by working -- that really adds insult to the injurious hours already required in Biglaw.

It’s been joked that in NYC, bedbugs are a much more unfortunate potential outcome of a one-night stand than an STD. Bedbugs are certainly harder to get rid of then the clap, and a lot more costly as well.

But despite their name, the risk of bedbugs lies in many other locations besides another’s bed. [Stores](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/01/urban-outfitters-bed-bugs-2012_n_1727735.html), [movie theaters](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bedbug-scare-time-square-amc-empire-25-theater-article-1.2360247), even [subways](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bedbugs-found-subway-line-article-1.1934519) — just thinking about it is enough to make you scratch.

Now comes word that you may catch the modern scourge just by working — that really adds insult to the injurious hours already required in Biglaw. A tipster has reported that a Biglaw office has bedbugs:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Greenberg Traurig has bed bugs! They are keeping a tight lid on things and everyone is forced to sit on my floor knowing there are bedbugs. They are scared of mass panic and bad publicity. No one wants to come in and sit in their offices because they are scared they will be bitten or bring home one of these critters. Management is doing a poor job in comforting us. ATL please help! It’s so scary having to sit here late at night and possibly having unwanted critter visitors with you! GtLAW, forget about bad publicity and take care of your employees!

Yikes! Listen, bedbugs can happen to even the most discerning person, it isn’t something to be ashamed of. In fact, the Metlife Building — where Greenberg Traurig has its New York office — [has had them before](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/09/metlife-building-under-attack-from-bedbugs-four-law-firms-potentially-affected/), and will probably have them in the future. It is a fact, though an unsettling one, of modern city living. The best move is to be open and forthright with your employees, and take care of the problem as quickly as possible.

But here’s the thing: we first heard rumors about bedbugs in the New York office of Greenberg last week. We reached out to GT five days ago, but they were unable or unwilling to confirm the firm was dealing with bedbugs. And now the info from tipsters has come rolling in, as the firm finally seemed to acknowledge the issue to employees yesterday:

Bed bugs confirmed. Everyone is required to leave the office by 8:30 p.m. tonight so that exterminator can come.

NY office all floors have limited outbreaks. Today was the first time the firm officially commented on it to the whole office.

Even other tenants of the building have heard about “isolated” outbreaks of the vermin. We reached out to the firm again, and have yet to hear back from them explaining the sequence of events or the steps they’ve taken to address the problem. But whatever the reasons behind the seemingly slow reaction, it is probably cold comfort to those employees dealing with bug bites, and the prospect of bringing those nasty critters home.

Let’s all take a second to remember a more innocent time, when this was the strongest association most of us had with bedbugs — and good luck trying to get that catchy song out of your head.

Time’s Up.

At some point, time is going to be up for Biglaw. There is going to be a reckoning. A story published today on [RollOnFriday](http://www.rollonfriday.com/TheNews/EuropeNews/tabid/58/Id/5522/fromTab/36/currentIndex/0/Default.aspx) sure looks like the shape of things to come. The publication reports that a partner at Baker McKenzie (they don’t say which office, but the story is filed under the site’s “European News” section) was sanctioned, but not fired, after the firm’s investigation into an alleged sexual assault.

Here are the details, according to RollOnFriday:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
[A]fter an event the partner invited several associates including the victim back to his hotel for drinks, following which he assaulted her. Insiders say that the assault was relatively minor. But it was sufficiently serious to the firm for management to agree that the associate would be paid a significant sum of money, would enter into a confidentiality agreement and would not return to work.

The partner apparently offered to make a large donation to charity by way of atonement. It is not known whether this was accepted. But he remained at the firm and shortly afterwards was promoted.

RollOnFriday also claims that a line in Baker McKenzie’s accounts was an alleged payoff to the associate, but that the firm stated that it was simply “restructuring costs in various departments.”

RollOnFriday claims that it’s been tracking this story for over a year. A Baker McKenzie spokesperson reportedly gave this statement to the publication:

“We take any allegations of inappropriate behaviour or misconduct extremely seriously. This incident occurred several years ago and was reported by our HR team at the time. We treated the allegation very seriously and immediately carried out a thorough investigation, including obtaining both external and internal advice. On completion of the investigation, the Firm imposed sanctions on the partner concerned. A confidential settlement was then reached with the employee, which we are not in a position to discuss to protect the interests of the employee. Our Code of Business Conduct reflects the values of our organisation, and we expect all of our people, whether partners or employees, to abide by the principles and standards of behaviour set out in that Code.”

It’s significant here that the firm admits that an investigation was conducted, sanctions were imposed, and a settlement was reached with the victimized employee. It’s also significant that the partner — RollOnFriday has kept all the names confidential — was apparently still allowed to work at the firm.

Our Baker McKenzie U.S. contacts confirmed this statement shortly after publication.

We all know that sexual harassment and assault happens in Biglaw. The [legal industry is not immune](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/metoo-no-a-law-degree-doesnt-insulate-you-from-sexual-harassment/) to the culture of harassment. We have reported on numerous… [open secrets, at anonymous firms](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-pink-ghetto/). But what we haven’t been able to report on is whether any of these firms haven taken the allegations seriously. We don’t have details on investigations, or punishments, as Biglaw HR complaints remain largely locked inside of a black box.

That’s almost certainly going to change. Victims are going to be more willing to come forward and demand that predators be held accountable. Firms are going to realize that they can’t sweep these issues under the rug. We’re all going to realize that [silence](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/are-lawyers-perpetuating-a-culture-of-silence-surrounding-sexual-assault/) is the sexual predator’s best friend.

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors. [Michael Allen](http://www.laterallink.com/about/team/1) is Managing Principal at Lateral Link, focusing exclusively on partner placements with Am Law 200 clients and placements for in-house attorneys.

Does an uptick in lateral partner moves predict an increase in lateral associate moves?

As with most statistical answers, the data somewhat equivocates, but mostly points to this being true. We’ll dive into this grey area later, but first let’s explore how we came to this conclusion.

The legal market consists of many non-intersecting specialties and sub-specialties of law created in part to facilitate lateral hiring. Corporate practice alone has dozens of unrelated specialties that, though nested under the Corporate parent group, may never intersect in practice. Why is this important? Determining a causal relationship between partner movement and associate movement necessitates that the two are related. This leads to a catch-22. Broader practice groups that lump specialties all under one “corporate practice” have too many unrelated sub-specialties to confidently determine a causal relationship, while smaller practices like Tax or Trusts & Estates have so few lateral moves that one additional partner or associate move becomes disproportionately significant.

I chose the practices of Labor & Employment and Real Estate to analyze because they are both sufficiently large, and their overarching practices narrow enough to suggest a true correlation.

So how does one compare associate and partner movement?

To compare these we pulled the monthly moves of lateral associates and partners in Real Estate and L&E over the previous two years. We then de-trended the series and de-seasonalized the data to remove any variables that might obscure the relationship between partner and associate moves.


How might these affect our analysis? The lateral market is highly seasonal. Movement varies greatly by quarter, largely in part because bonuses are disbursed in the fourth quarter, disincentivizing attorneys from moving. Predictive movement in one quarter may be masked by the augmenting and diminishing effects of the lateral market’s seasonal component. For example, a flurry of partner movement in September may not correlate with associate movement in November because the seasonal component is dampening the activity in the fourth quarter.

De-trending is also vital to this process; since the partner and associate markets can grow at different rates, removing growth helps remove background noise from the analysis.

Using cross-correlation, we analyzed the correlation and any lag between the two series. Surprisingly, the two practices yielded different results. Labor and Employment yielded no significant correlation between partner moves and associate moves, meaning the former was not predictive of the latter. However, for Real Estate, partner moves exhibited a significant correlation with associate moves that lagged around two months, meaning one could reasonably expect increased associate movement to follow two months after increased partner movement.

What Happens When an Associate Departs?

Conversely, are associate moves at all predictive of partner movement? The answer is a resounding no. There was no predictive correlation between associate movement and partner movement. However, they do tend to correlate together in tandem, but this is generally accounted for by partners taking associates with them as a lateral group move.

To test this hypothesis, I offer the following predictions on the lateral market for the next year:

1. The associate market will continue to grow.

When Cravath raised salaries in June, lateral associate activity shot up. However, as we move towards the end of the year, lateral associates moves are behind their predicted pace.

Our clients have echoed a shared sentiment that they wish to wait to see how the bonus market shapes up before committing to another firm. Our ARIMA forecast for the lateral market in Q3 is projected to be the best lateral quarter on record. We still believe it will set that record, but it won’t reach the lofty heights we previously predicted.

Recently, our star associate recruiter made 25 associate placements. We expect around the same if not more activity as the lateral market accelerates once a new salary equilibrium is reached.


2. Banking and Bankruptcy associates will move en masse.

Should our predictive model hold true, the increase in Banking and Bankruptcy partner moves – compared to other practices – will lead to an increase in associates in the respective practice areas. However, this model does not hold true for every practice area, and these two could potentially operate outside the model.


3. There will be a significant rise in associate laterals in Q1 2017.

With firms stretched thin from the new salary raises, we expect some disappointing bonus announcements this coming holiday season to offset the salary increases. In the past, we’ve observed disappointing bonus announcements precede a rash of lateral movement away from the offending firm.

We take pride in understanding the legal market and responding to trends as they occur. If you are curious about your current place in the legal market, we are always happy to provide insight and analysis to help you reach your goals. Since lateral moves are now a requisite for competing in the modern legal market, it is imperative you are equipped with the right information and connections to help you offset any losses later down the line.

# Loyola 2L Hits the Big Time (Even If Not the Big Law)

On the front page of today’s Wall Street Journal, there’s an excellent [article](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119040786780835602.html), by Amir Efrati, about the not-so-hot job prospects for non-top-tier law school graduates. Here’s the lede, which nicely summarizes the situation:

A law degree isn’t necessarily a license to print money these days.

For graduates of elite law schools, prospects have never been better. Big law firms this year boosted their starting salaries to as high as $160,000. But the majority of law-school graduates are suffering from a supply-and-demand imbalance that’s suppressing pay and job growth. The result: Graduates who don’t score at the top of their class are struggling to find well-paying jobs to make payments on law-school debts that can exceed $100,000. Some are taking temporary contract work, reviewing documents for as little as $20 an hour, without benefits. And many are blaming their law schools for failing to warn them about the dark side of the job market.

It’s a most worthwhile piece (although somewhat reminiscent of this [article](http://www.law.com/jsp/nlj/PubArticleNLJ.jsp?id=1183712786622), by Leigh Jones for the National Law Journal). Here’s our favorite part:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Some un- or underemployed grads are seeking consolation online, where blogs and discussion boards have created venues for shared commiseration that didn’t exist before. An anonymous writer called Loyola 2L, purportedly a student at Loyola Law School, who claims the school wasn’t straight about employment prospects, has been beating a drum of discontent around the Web in the past year that’s sparked thousands of responses, and a fan base. (“2L” stands for second-year law student.) Some thank “L2L” for articulating their plight; others claim L2L should complain less and work more.

Loyola’s Dean Burcham says he wishes he knew who the student was so he could help the person. “It’s expensive to go to law school, and there are times when you second-guess yourself as a student,” he says.

One tipster quips: “Loyola Dean David Burcham wants to find and help Loyola 2L. How? By refunding his tuition?”
So, will the real Loyola 2L please stand up — and [email us?](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Loyola%202L) We’d love to discuss potential opportunities with you. Thanks.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# The Biglaw Firm That Kicked Off 2020's Special Bonus Craze Is Back With Even MORE Money
## Great news! Hooray!

Way back in September 2020, when Biglaw firms were busy rolling back their COVID austerity measures, one firm decided to offer a sign of hope for all associates. After surviving salary cuts, furloughs, and sometimes even layoffs, their firms really did appreciate all of the hard work they were putting in during the pandemic.

Cooley — a firm that hadn’t announced any compensation cuts — stepped up and [offered special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cooley-bonuses/) ranging from $2,500 to $7,500 for all associates and counsel. Of course, Davis Polk [upped the ante](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/) (just like the firm [did this spring](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/)), but Cooley deserves all the credit in the world. Now, the firm is here to match Davis Polk once again. Here’s what the scale looks like at Cooley:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
These special bonuses will be paid out to eligible associates and counsel who are on track to hit 1950 or more creditable hours in 2021, measured pro rata on May 30 and August 31 for June 30 and September 30 pay dates. Those who miss the June payment will be eligible to receive the September payment if they hit the required hours. As noted in the memo, these bonuses are “in addition to, and will have no bearing on [the] year-end merit bonus.”

Congratulations to everyone at Cooley! Once more, this is very exciting news for the firm that was bold enough to start a bonus trend during a pandemic.

(Flip to the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/cooley-spring-bonus-2021/2/) to see the full memo from Cooley.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Biglaw Firm Tells Partners To Share Their Offices With Associates

We may well be on our way to a brave new officeless world. COVID has shown many businesses — including law firms — that they don’t need the real estate footprints they once thought they did.

But we’re not there quite yet.

The physicality of an attorney’s personalized workspace plays into the mystique of a successful lawyer. I vividly recall the Biglaw call back interviews my 2L year and, like many law students, I was duly impressed with the partner offices I was trotted around to. The corner offices with views of Central Park, the buttery leather couches that clearly cost what translated to a year’s rent for me, even the “messy” offices that were piled with more paper than I’d ever seen in one place still gave an aura of their vastness. And all that for a long time helped define what I considered success. As an associate, meeting in a partner’s office was akin to getting called to the principal’s and I always sat up a little straighter, plastered a smile on my face, and was on my best behavior. I can imagine I’d ever be comfortable enough to invade a partner’s sanctum without them looking on and do my own work.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But that’s exactly what Freshfields is telling their attorneys they should be doing. The London base of the Magic Circle firm is moving to a new office later this year (the move was delayed due to COVID), and [as reported by](https://www.legalcheek.com/2020/08/let-junior-lawyers-use-your-office-if-youre-not-around-freshfields-partners-told/) Legal Cheek, the new space is believed to be about 20 percent smaller.

Perhaps in response to this new reality, the London office is rolling out an “office release system,” wherein junior attorneys can use a partner’s office, if that partner is working from home that day:

“If you’re not there, you give your office up”, London managing partner Claire Wills told the website [Legal Week](https://www.law.com/international-edition/2020/08/13/you-must-give-up-your-office-if-you-are-not-in-freshfields-tells-lawyers/) (£), while another partner, who isn’t named, said lockdown had shown that “people do not need rooms full of paper and offices in the traditional sense.”

They added:

“I used to think I could not work without precedents around me but it’s more a comfort blanket. We’ve been at home without any of this stuff and most people are busy.”

But lest you think this transition will be seemless, a source at the firm says some people are “quite territorial about rooms and desks.” Which isn’t terribly surprising. It’ll be fascinating to see how this plays out long term.

# Another Biglaw Firm Moves To A 4-Day In-Office Schedule
## Four days in-office is slowly building momentum.

Biglaw continues to sort itself into the firms that are mandating a strict back-to-the-office policy [and those](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/good-luck-trying-to-make-d-c-lawyers-return-to-the-office-4-days-each-week/) that [are not](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/west-coast-biglaw-firms-wont-be-mandating-office-attendance-any-time-soon/). But with [Skadden](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/you-didnt-see-your-kids-before-the-pandemic-you-shouldnt-expect-to-see-them-now-says-elite-law-firm-partner/), [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/davis-polk-4-day-office/), [Weil Gotshal](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/weil-gotshal-4-days-in-office/), and[ Ropes & Gray](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/ropes-gray-4-day-office-policy/) all coming out with four day in the office mandates, we’re into full-blown Biglaw trend category now. And, well, with so many big-name firms moving to this schedule, it provides plenty of cover for firms that wish to follow suit. Enter [Vinson & Elkins](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/vinson-elkins/). The firm, which made $934,700,000 in gross revenue last year, making it 57th on the Am Law 100, announced today they’re joining the four-day in-office club.

From the executive committee’s email to all attorneys and business professionals:

Over the past two years, as we emerged from the pandemic, we have worked to balance the dual goals of maximizing our time together in the office while also embracing remote flexibility. In recent months, the legal and professional services market has shifted with a growing number of firms – as well as clients – moving to a four-day model. We also continue to hear from many of you that some of the connectivity that we highly value is jeopardized when a substantial number of our people are away from the office on any given day. As has always been the case, we support remote flexibility when the situation calls for it and ask that you use your best judgment in consultation with your team.

The turn around to this new normal will be fairly fast, as the new policy will take effect September 11th.

There will still be some manner of flexibility in V&E schedules, as folks will be able to pick whether Monday or Friday is their work from home day, but Tuesday through Thursday will be all hands on deck.

How is your firm mandating (or not) in-office attendance? As soon as you find out about office attendance plans at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

Twenty-plus years of working at law firms and with lawyers and you learn a few things about the practice of law, client service, and legal operations in general. I frequently read and hear about leaders in corporate legal departments who want a law firm partner working on their legal problems.

Is this necessary when you can get the same or better legal counsel for half the cost?

Don’t misunderstand, GCs don’t want a 23-year-old first-year fresh out of law school as their lead attorney either. But there are plenty of legal minds to go around, many of which have matured within lawyers who are not partners.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
There’s been some talk about the demise of the old-school law firm partner model. [Sara Randazzo’s](https://www.wsj.com/articles/being-a-law-firm-partner-was-once-a-job-for-life-that-culture-is-all-but-dead-11565362437?ns=prod/accounts-wsj) recent article in the Wall Street Journal made a splash when she wrote that the emergence of two-tier partnership structures at law firms sounds the death knell for life-time partnership at law firms. ATL’s [Joe Patrice](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/repeat-after-me-partnership-without-equity-is-not-a-partnership/?rf=1) and [David Lat](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/what-do-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-partnership/?rf=1) recently wrote critically of non-equity partner structures, too.

I say, it probably doesn’t matter anyway.

I had a boss who argued to me that titles just don’t mean much. The thought was “who cares what we call the position; titles are free.” That may or may not be true, since clearly advantages are afforded to those who hold loftier titles. But when it comes to actually delivering legal services, does the lawyer’s title matter? My experience is that it does not.

A partnership is merely a way of setting up a business. In the end, law firms provide professional services and it shouldn’t matter whether the lawyer performing the work is a “real” partner, special counsel, or an associate. Frankly, most corporate legal leaders I talk to look at law firms as just another vendor.

The better question I think is why law firm partnerships thrive at all? Few firms actually function as partnerships, least of all the behemoth-sized firms. Practice areas, even in smaller firms, are siloed and function as separate little fiefdoms. Some firms are so large, it has been observed, that the so-called “partners” do not even know each other. If it weren’t for shared administrative services such as accounting, marketing, and the like, I’m not sure many firms would qualify as a going concern.

Anyone who has ever worked at a law firm figures out fairly quickly that most lawyers are terrible businesspeople. Smart firms leave the administration and operations to people with that experience.

So, where does this leave us? What does it mean to be a partner in a law firm today?

Honestly, the only discernable difference between partners and other lawyers at a firm is tenure and compensation. Some partners are good at generating business, but all lawyers are encouraged to develop new business. And sure, tenure generally means experience, and with experience comes a certain level of knowledge and skill, but given that it now takes like 10 years to become a partner, does anyone think the knowledge gap between the seventh-year associate or counsel and the partner is that far apart?

And the fact is that the attributes of being a partner have no correlation to how good one is at understanding complex litigation or transactional issues. Compensation means you’re successful financially, not necessarily that you’re any good. Prestige doesn’t mean a thing if you cannot execute.

No, what makes a lawyer valuable as outside counsel is their understanding of the client’s business, the client’s legal needs, and exposure to risk. Navigating and mitigating those needs, particularly in the face of contentious or complicated litigation or complex transactional issues, are what’s valued. Collaboration, creative problem solving, and great client service — these are the value points that corporate legal leaders seek. And you don’t need to be a partner to meet these needs.

In fact, arguably, some partners today are not as well-suited to manage modern litigation, eDiscovery, information governance, and cybersecurity issues. As the practice of law becomes more complex and the legal industry — hopefully — continues to evolve, it seems to me that young, technology-oriented lawyers are going to be positioned best to solve client business problems.

The hundreds of lawyers I’ve worked with over the course of my law firm career, many of whom I trained as first-years, are more than capable of working on and resolving complex legal issues. So, next time outside counsel’s invoice arrives, look at the partner’s hourly rate. The next call should be to a senior associate who probably bills at half that rate.

# The Best Biglaw Firms For Minority Attorneys (2019)
## Did your law firm make the cut for this important metric?

The legal sector continues to be one of the least diverse professions in the country. While more than 30 percent of law students are minorities, just over 16 percent of lawyers and about 9 percent of partners are attorneys of color. In fact, the number of minority equity partners has only increased from 7.1 percent to 8.6 percent since 2014. Racial diversity in law firms seems to have effectively flatlined, leaving minority lawyers at a disadvantage.

Thankfully, corporate clients have demanded more diversity in the legal teams that staff their matters, which has in turn driven elite law firms to recruit more minority attorneys and increase their inclusion efforts. At some of the very best law firms, minority attorneys are mentored, sponsored, and pushed to build networks that will allow them to receive an invitation to the partnership ranks.

In order to recognize the Biglaw firms that take special efforts to maintain diversity among their ranks, [Law360](https://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/1171445/the-best-firms-for-minority-attorneys) (sub. req.) has created a list of the top law firms for minority attorneys. These firms were first grouped by headcount, and then ranked according to the percentage of minority attorneys at the nonpartner and partner level.

For the smallest Biglaw firms (150-299 attorneys), these are best for lawyers of color:

1. Knobbe Martens: 18 percent minority equity partners
2. Procopio Cory: 12.8 percent
3. Shutts & Bowen: 18.2 percent
4. Best Best & Krieger: 23.2 percent
5. Atkinson Andelson: 32.1 percent
5. Munger Tolles: 19.0 percent

Check out [Law360](https://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/1171445/the-best-firms-for-minority-attorneys) for rankings of the smallest law firms (20 to 149 attorneys).

Strategies for ensuring minority lawyers have a good shot at making partner differ from firm to firm, and include formal mentorship programs, business marketing workshops, and integration into the firm’s community at large. These measures have been met with success, but there is still a difficult road ahead.

While these firms should be applauded for their efforts to increase racial diversity, there is still much more work to be done. Congratulations to all the firms listed!

This year is finally drawing to a close, and we’re all so very, very tired. The thought of working from home used to be seen as a somewhat of a luxury, but after doing it for almost two years, it’s become simply exhausting. As we’ve noted in the past, when your home is your office and your office is your home, the concept of work-life balance is no more, especially for lawyers who thought they were always “on,” even before the coronavirus crisis.

Back in March, Orrick came up with an amazing solution for this problem: the [“Unplug Time” program](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/top-50-biglaw-firm-rolls-out-incredible-bonus-eligible-time-off-policy/). The firm offered everyone (i.e., staff, associates, of counsel, career associates, and partners) the chance to truly “unplug” by crediting up to 40 hours of bonus-eligible time for everyone to sit back, relax, and simply stop doing work. Many Biglaw firms talk a good game about mental health and wellness, but Orrick was the first firm (that we know of) to offer bonus-eligible hours dedicated to taking time off work. Now, almost one year later, another firm is following in Orrick’s footsteps.

Yesterday, Sheppard Mullin — a firm that brought in $867,416,000 gross revenue in 2020, putting it at No. 50 in the most recent Am Law 100 — announced that it would be rolling out an “Unplug & Recharge” program for certain attorneys at the firm. Both associates and special counsel can earn credit for up to 40 hours of bonus-eligible time to “recharge.” Here’s a slide from the firm’s video presentation with some details about its new policy:

Sources we’ve heard from at the firm could not be happier about Sheppard Mullin’s new program:

Forty hours per year are credited toward our billable hours and we are expected to unplug completely during that time. As you can imagine, we are all thrilled and proud to work for a firm that is an early mover on this concept.

Congratulations to Sheppard Mullin on its exceptional new wellness policy. This firm understood the assignment when it comes to attorneys’ mental health and general well-being in the pandemic era.

There are now just two firms that have made taking time off to rest and relax billable and bonus eligible. When will more join them? We sure hope it’s soon!

J. Edgar Hoover — not the best FBI director.

Or maybe the question should be, “Who is not being considered to serve as the next director of the FBI?” There might be some truth to this headline from The Onion: [Trump Announces 40-Month-Long Search To Fill FBI Director Post](http://www.theonion.com/article/trump-announces-40-month-long-search-fill-fbi-dire-55988).

At the current time, Andrew McCabe, top deputy to the recently dismissed James Comey, is serving as acting FBI director. It’s not clear how long he’ll stay in that post (especially after congressional testimony that [probably didn’t endear him](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/11/us/politics/live-briefing-james-comey-andrew-mccabe.html) to the White House). He might be replaced as interim FBI director by one of the following individuals, according to the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-interviewing-candidates-for-comeys-interim-replacement/2017/05/10/179ccb5c-35a6-11e7-b4ee-434b6d506b37_story.html?utm_term=.07a394ec44c8):

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
[Candidates interviewed on Wednesday by attorney general Jeff Sessions and deputy attorney general Rod J. Rosenstein] were [Michael Anderson](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/chicago/news/press-releases/michael-j.-anderson-named-special-agent-in-charge-of-chicago-division), the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Chicago division; [Adam Lee](https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/pressrel/press-releases/adam-s.-lee-named-special-agent-in-charge-of-richmond-division), the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Richmond division; [Paul Abbate](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/washingtondc/paul-abbate-assistant-director-in-charge), the executive assistant director of the FBI’s Criminal, Cyber, Response and Services Branch; and [William “Bill” Evanina](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/national-counterintelligence-executive), the national counterintelligence executive in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

Far more interesting and important, however, is who will be nominated by President Donald Trump to serve as FBI director on a permanent — or maybe, in light of [Jim Comey’s fate](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/president-trump-had-the-legal-power-to-oust-james-comey/), not-so-permanent — basis. Guessing the identity of the future nominee has become Washington’s latest parlor game, and the list of possibilities is long.

What is the White House looking for in the next head of the FBI? According to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/us/politics/fbi-interim-director.html?_r=0), administration officials seek someone with “a lack of deep ties to Mr. Trump, to avoid the appearance that he wants to install a crony at the top of an agency that is investigating the activities of his presidential campaign.” Per [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/10/who-will-replace-james-comey-list-238201), “Senators are calling on Trump to find the kind of consensus pick that has often proved elusive for the embattled president.”

President Trump’s firing of James Comey can be [criticized](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/trump-fires-james-comey-for-helping-trump-get-elected/) or [defended](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/president-trump-had-the-legal-power-to-oust-james-comey/?rf=1), but I think we can all agree that one downside was the optics: it could be seen, and has been seen by some, as an attempt to shut down or weaken the Trump/Russia investigation. So if Trump wants the strongest exoneration possible in the Russia probe, that exoneration should come from someone of unimpeachable integrity and independence. (The notion of [nominating Judge Merrick Garland](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/judge-merrick-garland-to-replace-james-comey-as-fbi-director/) for the post is intriguing, but don’t hold your breath waiting for that to happen.)

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Here are 18 names floated for FBI director by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/us/politics/fbi-interim-director.html?_r=0), the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-interviewing-candidates-for-comeys-interim-replacement/2017/05/10/179ccb5c-35a6-11e7-b4ee-434b6d506b37_story.html?utm_term=.07a394ec44c8), and [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/10/who-will-replace-james-comey-list-238201) — in alphabetical order, with the publication(s) mentioning them indicated parenthetically, followed by brief blurbs:

1. [Kelly Ayotte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Ayotte) (NYT, P): former U.S. senator and former attorney general of New Hampshire. She’s popular among her former colleagues, but she has a history with Trump, whom she criticized during the presidential campaign. If nominated and confirmed, she’d be the first woman to lead the FBI.

2. [Dana Boente](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Boente) (WP): U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District Virginia, interim head of the Justice Department’s national security division, and former acting deputy attorney general (in the wake of the [firing of Sally Yates](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/trump-tells-acting-a-g-youre-fired-probably-just-like-that/)). Some Democrats might give him a hard time over Yatesgate, but I’m not sure that would get much traction (especially since he was appointed by President Obama to serve as U.S. attorney). An eminently sensible choice, even if not as “sexy” a pick as some of the others.

3. [Chris Christie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Christie) (P): New Jersey governor, former U.S. attorney (as anyone who watched a Republican primary debate knows; “when I was a federal prosecutor…”). Christie was an early and prominent Trump supporter, but that could raise questions about his independence. Also, his unceremonious removal as head of the Trump transition effort suggests he still might have foes in the administration (e.g., Jared Kushner, whose father Christie sent to prison when he was U.S. attorney).

4. Senator [John Cornyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cornyn) (NYT): senior U.S. senator from Texas, former Texas attorney general and associate justice of the Texas Supreme Court. Cornyn certainly has the credentials, but he might be too important in the Senate right now, as current Majority Whip. It might not make sense to remove him from that post, and he might not want to give it up to head the FBI anyway.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
5. [Mark Filip](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=9711) (WP, P): senior litigation partner at Kirkland & Ellis, where he also serves on the management committee, and former federal judge, deputy attorney general, and assistant U.S. attorney. Filip has a great record and résumé (he also clerked for the late Justice Scalia), and judicial service is a big plus. As noted by the [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/us/politics/fbi-interim-director.html?_r=0), “Judges were long selected to run the F.B.I. because they were seen as likely to keep agents within constitutional boundaries and were steeped in criminal law.” A perfectly plausible pick.

6. [Alice Fisher](https://www.lw.com/people/alice-fisher) (NYT): Latham & Watkins partner (and executive committee member); former head of the Justice Department’s criminal division, during the George W. Bush administration. A respected and experienced lawyer, who’d be the first female FBI director (but it’s not clear she has the “juice” to secure this high-profile position).

7. [Rudy Giuliani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani) (P): the former New York City mayor and Manhattan U.S. attorney has an extensive law enforcement background, but he also has… extensive baggage. For starters, he’d be criticized as too close to President Trump, whom he vocally supported during the 2016 election. He’s also about to turn 73 (May 28), so his time may have passed — as even he seems to realize, saying [earlier this week](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/giuliani-im-not-a-candidate-for-fbi-director/526074/), “I’m not a candidate for FBI director. The president’s not gonna ask me, and I’m not gonna be FBI director.”

8. Representative [Trey Gowdy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trey_Gowdy) (NYT, P): Republican congressman from South Carolina, former state and federal prosecutor. He has lots of law enforcement experience, but his tenure as chair of the House Benghazi Committee makes him radioactive to Democrats — and not the right pick if the White House wants someone above the partisan fray.

9. [Raymond W. Kelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Kelly) (NYT, P): former New York City police commissioner. Highly regarded in law enforcement circles, Ray Kelly was previously considered to serve as FBI director (and supported for the post by Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer). But he has some enemies at the bureau, as a result of “turf wars” between the NYPD and the FBI, and at age 75, he might be too old (he’d be 85 at the end of his ten-year term).

10. Judge [J. Michael Luttig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Michael_Luttig) (NYT, WP): general counsel at Boeing, former Fourth Circuit judge (1991-2006) and Department of Justice lawyer. Judge Luttig, one of the most highly regarded federal judges in the country during his 15 years on the bench, would be a superb pick, given his (well-deserved) reputation for brilliance, integrity, and [commitment to the rule of law](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/supreme-court-shortlister-turned-general-counsel-calls-out-the-court-plus-presidents-and-congress-too/). He has not only judicial experience but also national security experience, thanks to his decade as GC of Boeing, a major defense contractor.

11. President [John Pistole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_S._Pistole): president of Anderson University, a private Christian liberal arts university in Indiana; former FBI deputy director (under George W. Bush) and head of the Transportation Security Administration (nominated by President Obama). With his significant experience at both the FBI and in national security (through his TSA leadership), Pistole is a compelling candidate.

12. [Mike Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Rogers_(Michigan_politician)) (NYT, P): former Republican congressman from Michigan (2001-2015), former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and a former FBI agent himself. He might be just what the doctor ordered; per the Times, Rogers is regarded as a “straight shooter” at the bureau and “probably has the credibility to steer the F.B.I. out of a hurricane of bad publicity.” (Perhaps his only significant liability is brief service on the Trump transition team, which could raise the issue of his independence.)

13. [Chuck Rosenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Rosenberg) (P): acting head of the Drug Enforcement, former federal prosecutor and chief of staff to Jim Comey. His extensive law enforcement background is a big asset, but Politico raises the possibility that his service as Comey’s right-hand man “might be too close for comfort for Trump.”

14. Judge [Amy St. Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_J._St._Eve) (WP): current federal judge, former federal prosecutor and associate independent counsel in the Whitewater investigation. She has an excellent reputation, the advantage of judicial service (like Filip and Luttig), and the potential to make history as the first woman to head the FBI (like Ayotte and Fisher) — but query whether the Chicago-based judge has enough “mojo” inside the Beltway.

15. [George Terwilliger](https://www.mcguirewoods.com/People/T/George-J-Terwilliger-III.aspx) (NYT, P): partner at McGuireWoods, where he leads the white-collar and crisis-management practices; former deputy attorney general under George H.W. Bush and U.S. attorney under Ronald Reagan. A very well-connected and well-respected lawyer, and certainly a viable choice.

16. [Larry Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Thompson) (WP, P): former deputy attorney general under George W. Bush, as well as a former U.S. attorney, King & Spalding partner, and Pepsico general counsel. As Politico points out, Thompson would make history as the first African-American head of the FBI, and he “enjoys a strong reputation among former Justice officials”; the main issue is his age (71).

17. [Fran Townsend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Townsend) (P): former homeland security adviser to George W. Bush, former federal prosecutor (under then-U.S. Attorney Rudy Giuliani), former Main Justice lawyer (in the Clinton Administration). Townsend would be the first woman to lead the FBI, has served under both Republican and Democratic administrations, and was [considered by the Trump administration](http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-cybersecurity/2016/11/a-look-at-frances-townsend-potential-homeland-security-secretary-217553) to serve as Homeland Security Secretary. A strong contender, despite concerns about her DOJ service in the Clinton administration and her [criticism](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ex-homeland-security-adviser-fran-townsend-trumps-muslim-ban-risks-national-security/) of candidate Trump’s “Muslim ban” (if anything, these facts might help win her Democratic support).

18. [Ken Wainstein](http://www.cadwalader.com/professionals/kenneth-wainstein) (P): co-chair of the global litigation and white-collar practices at Cadwalader, former (and first) head of the Justice Department’s national security division, former U.S. attorney for D.C., and former general counsel and chief of staff to FBI director Robert Mueller. According to Politico, Wainstein “is widely respected by prosecutors and law enforcement officials, [and] was reportedly considered by President Barack Obama as a replacement for Mueller in 2011 before Obama asked Mueller to extend his term by two years.”

*************

Whew! That’s a lot of names, a lot of talent, and a lot of experience in law enforcement and national security. If I had to put them into tiers:

Top tier: Mark Filip, Michael Luttig, John Pistole, Mike Rogers, Ken Wainstein, Fran Townsend.

Middle tier: Kelly Ayotte, Dana Boente, Alice Fisher, Chuck Rosenberg, George Terwilliger, Larry Thompson.

Bottom tier: Chris Christie, John Cornyn, Rudy Giuliani, Trey Gowdy, Ray Kelly, Amy St. Eve.

President Trump and his advisors should easily be able to pick a strong nominee, capable of winning confirmation with bipartisan support, from this slate of distinguished public servants. And let’s hope they do just that, so we can move on from political controversy and focus on keeping our nation safe.

UPDATE (10:54 p.m.): Interviews are starting this weekend, per the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/sessions-to-interview-candidates-for-fbi-director-1494632898):

Attorney General Jeff Sessions is scheduled to interview candidates to be the next FBI director on Saturday, including Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas), according to people familiar with the interviews.

Other candidates expected to be interviewed that day include Michael Garcia, who was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan in the George W. Bush administration and is now a state appellate court judge in New York, and Alice Fisher, who also served in a senior Justice Department role in the Bush administration, the people said.

FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe will also be interviewed Saturday for the job, the people said.

[Michael Garcia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Garcia) would be an excellent pick; he has judicial, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security service. I’m pleasantly surprised to see Andrew McCabe on the list; he’s a well-regarded wunderkind of the FBI, but I thought the Trump administration wouldn’t have appreciated his recent congressional testimony. I’m still uncertain as to why Senator Cornyn would want the job.

UPDATE (5/13/2017, 7:45 p.m.): According to the [AP](http://www.witn.com/content/news/4-candidates-to-be-FBI-director-are-in-line-for-interviews-422166753.html), eight candidates have now been interviewed, including Mike Rogers, Fran Townsend, Judge Henry Hudson (E.D. Va.), and Adam Lee (head of the FBI’s Richmond office, and a candidate for interim director as well). All are solid candidates, in my view.

# Biglaw Firm Prohibited By Lender From Returning Former Partners' Capital Contributions
## LeClairRyan has seen a lot of partners leave recently.

The Biglaw firm of LeClairRyan has been banned by their lender from paying former partners’ capital contributions, according to a [report from Law360.](https://www.law360.com/articles/1171316/leclairryan-blocked-from-paying-ex-members-letters-show)

As you may recall, the firm has a lot of former partners floating around these days — the firm lost almost 10 percent of its headcount in 2018 due to lateral moves, and [partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/biglaw-firm-loses-over-a-dozen-partners-as-more-firms-spread-to-boston/) continue to[ depart](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/biglaw-firm-that-just-lost-over-a-dozen-partner-loses-even-more/) for [greener pastures](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/the-partner-departures-at-this-biglaw-firm-are-really-piling-up/) in 2019. Indeed, just this week, the firm lost four attorneys from their[ Boston office to McGlinchey Stafford](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/06/20/four-more-leave-leclairryan-as-boston-pair-launches-mcglinchey-stafford-office/), three IP partners to [California firm Burke Williams & Sorensen](https://www.law360.com/articles/1170516/leclairryan-sees-back-to-back-exits-in-calif-boston), and another five attorneys across the northeast[ to Duane Morris](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/06/17/duane-morris-scoops-up-five-lawyers-from-leclairryan/). (Though the firm did expand with the addition of a [Dallas office](https://www.law.com/texaslawyer/2019/05/01/leclairryan-expands-in-texas-opening-dallas-office/) earlier this year.)

According to the letters obtained by Law360 from ex-partners, the firm’s general counsel is letting them know they can’t get back the money they put into the firm as scheduled as it would violate the leverage ratio in their loan documents:

In the first of the letters, the firm’s general counsel Lori D. Thompson informed the former LeClairRyan attorneys that the firm’s lender said in February that disbursing capital redemption payments would put the firm in violation of its loan covenant regarding its leverage ratio.

She wrote that the Virginia-based national firm expected to resume payments to the former shareholders as quickly as it can, and would keep them apprised when that would happen.

“We have been working closely with our lender in an effort to have that restriction lifted,” Thompson wrote.

In a subsequent status update letter, Thompson said the deferment on payments was still in place and offered the former shareholders an opportunity to review additional details about the firm’s finances, provided they signed and returned a nondisclosure agreement.

In a statement on the matter, Thompson stressed the firm intends to resume the return of capital when it’s able:

“Our firm’s corporate documents prescribe when and how capital will be redeemed and impose limitations on making such payments, as I would assume every law firm’s governing documents would do,” Thompson told Law360 on Thursday.

“The purpose of the limitations is to protect the financial position of the firm,” she added. “Consistent with those documents, redemption of capital has been deferred and payments will resume when those limitations are no longer applicable.”

While it is not unusual for firms to have restrictions on the redemption of capital, the volatile composition of LeClairRyan’s partnership has put the issue into sharp relief.

# Skadden Announces Year-End Bonuses And Makes Up For Lost Time
## That's an impressive payday coming associates' way -- especially for senior associates!

Once Cravath decided to open up their pocketbooks with their 2020 bonus scale, we knew it was just a matter of time until the rest of Biglaw followed suit.

So count Skadden as an early adopter. It’s not surprising that the elite Biglaw has decided to come out with bonuses that largely match the prevailing market rate (the class of 2014 and more senior may receive an optional additionally $10,000 over the straight market rate) with year-end bonuses ranging from $15,000 to $110,000, depending on class year. But they also ponied up the extra cash to match the COVID appreciation bonuses that [swept through Biglaw this fall](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-fall-special-bonus-tracker-which-biglaw-firms-are-handing-out-cash-for-associates-hard-work-during-the-pandemic/), which is sure to make December 18th — the date Skadden will pay bonuses — extra special.

The bonus scale is as follows ([you can read the full memo on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/skadden-bonus/2/)):

Back in October, Skadden was among the Biglaw firms to [pump the breaks on the COVID appreciation bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/skadden-confirms-the-inevitable-no-fall-bonuses/). It’s nice to see the firm’s promise to make it up at year-end has been kept.

As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477).

# Dear God, Don't Put The Election In The Hands Of Lawyers
## De jure universal suffrage doesn't matter if de facto voter disenfranchisement happens in courtrooms.

It makes me indescribably angry that counting every legally cast ballot is considered partisan, instead of, you know, A CENTRAL TENET OF DEMOCRACY, but here we are. I know you know, but as of this writing there has been no declared winner of the 2020 presidential election — despite what the president might say.

Because there’s an unchecked pandemic raging, Democrats launched a PR campaign to get voters to cast early and mail-in ballots. And voters obliged, but that’s left us in a dilly of a pickle with Election Day having come and gone and no winner declared. Of course, declaring a winner is only a modern convention but the president has the attention span of a gnat, so.

Anyway, we’re now advancing to the litigation phase of the election, which, again, is a disgrace. Pennsylvania looks to be a key swing state, and the [effort to get ballots tossed](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/is-this-gop-attempt-to-toss-out-ballots-in-pennsylvania-a-preview-of-the-fun-in-store/) out is already underway there. Then there’s the effort to get the Post Office to actually deliver the ballots that were cast, and, [yeah that’s not going well.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/judge-sullivan-orders-post-office-to-actually-deliver-any-ballots-theyve-got/) Actually, it’s been a [banner year](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/10/30/courts-reject-voting-rights-extensions-in-covid-shadowed-elections/5998149002/) for election lawsuits, with a record breaking 230 filed between January 1 to October 23.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
We already have [some intel on the Biglaw firms that are working on the Republican election cases](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/the-biglaw-firms-doing-trumps-election-bidding/?rf=1), ahem, Jones Day and King & Spalding. [While Dems have looked to](https://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/1325719/the-biglaw-attorneys-battling-over-an-undecided-election) Greenberg Traurig, Dentons, and of course their go-to election lawyer Marc Elias at Perkins Coie.

And it’s true, as I’ve had to repeat to myself multiple times over the morning, that Joe Biden’s most likely path to victory (some combination of the upper Midwest “Blue Wall” — Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania — and Arizona) is still very much viable. But Dems had hoped for a larger margin of victory that would stop Trump from trying to[ (further) undermine democracy](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/gop-lawyer-slams-trump-for-undermining-election-confidence-despite-long-career-of-undermining-election-confidence/). Because that’s where we are as a nation, we have de jure universal suffrage but the de facto voter disenfranchisement will start to happen in courtrooms.

While I — probably naively — still have faith that the legal challenges will be fruitless and Joe Biden will ultimately be sworn in as our 46th president, it FUCKING SUCKS. Counting ballots isn’t a difficult concept. It shouldn’t mean you’re in the bag for Dems because you want the damn votes cast to be counted. But, again, this is where we are.

Is all this a sign that we’ve entered late-stage democracy? Almost certainly yes. But should you freak out that Biden will lose this particular election? No, at least, not yet.

# The Biglaw Firm On A White-Collar Lateral Partner Spree
## The firm's making big moves.

Biglaw firms are all about [defining their priorities](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/02/biglaw-firm-pivots-direction-and-loses-partners-in-the-process/) right now.

The latest firm to make some moves consistent with their strategic plans is Mayer Brown. The firm’s head of global litigation and dispute resolution practice, Richard Spehr, has said that growing the white-collar and regulatory practices in D.C. and New York is their “number one strategy” and the proof is in the hires.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/02/04/mayer-brown-continues-white-collar-spree-taking-dc-partner-from-paul-hastings/) Law.com, this week, Mayer Brown added Michael Levy, formerly of Paul Hastings, to its roster. And his new firm is excited to have him on board:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“Michael is well-respected in the D.C. community and widely known as a first rate trial lawyer,” Raj De, managing partner of Mayer Brown’s D.C. office, said in a statement.

According to his new firm, Levy worked on the Enron case as well as the financial mishaps of Fannie Mae, the downfall of MF Global and the NFL’s “Spygate” scandal involving the New England Patriots. He has also represented clients who were involved in investigations into the murders of four Americans in Benghazi and the use of a non-governmental private email server by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

As Spehr said, there are even more plans to grow the practice, and they say they are actively looking for lawyers to join the firm from the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York. This will build upon a series of lateral moves the firm has made over the last few years. Back in 2016, they added Daniel Stein, former chief of the criminal division of SDNY. Glen Kopp, also formerly of SDNY, joined Mayer Brown in 2018. In late 2018, Audrey Harris was also brought on as co-chair of the firm’s anti-corruption practice. And in 2019, Jason Linder and Glenn Vanzura joined the firm’s L.A. office.

Congratulations to the firm as they continue making big-impact lateral moves.

UPDATE: Please check out the bottom of this post for firms mentioned that have since raised associate salaries.

Biglaw. The term is used to denote the best, most prestigious part of the legal profession. But we are in the midst of a seismic shift in the market; the [new Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) has upped the stakes for what is really considered an elite law firm. And quite a few Biglaw birdies have shared with us that not everyone is going to be able to make the leap.

So the question must be asked — what is better than Biglaw?

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Here at Above the Law, we like the term “MoneyLaw” to refer to the top tier of compensation leaders. As boutiques have repeatedly proven, being able to run with the big kids isn’t just a matter of size. So a term that captures the generosity of the law firm, regardless of size, is key. Kudos to all the firms that have, at long last, cast off the pallor of the Great Recession of 2008 and actually begun to share the wealth with the associates that make the firm tick.

Now comes everyone’s favorite part of the salary wars: the airing of grievances. Yes, yes, I know it hasn’t been quite a week since Cravath announced the new scale, but the rumors had been swirling for a while, and the ability to respond quickly to market conditions is key. So, who is missing from the [MoneyLaw list](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2016-salary-increase/)?

Where are the [Silicon Valley Biglaw](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/the-white-sandal-elite-the-go-to-law-firms-of-silicon-valley/) leaders? Cooley made the move, but what about Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati or Fenwick & West? Even Valley boutiques are getting in on the action, so the time is really ripe to make a move.

And we haven’t heard much from firms based in or originally founded in Los Angeles, even though national firms’ branch offices in L.A. have matched. So what about Latham & Watkins? Folks there are really annoyed they haven’t seen the money yet:

I truly hope you all come out with an article that embarrasses Latham for being so late in the game to match. They’ll blame it on global committee issues, but there’s absolutely no reason we haven’t matched when we were number 1 in revenue two years running. Many associates are just plain annoyed and embarrassed that we have matched.

Indeed, even outside the Valley, lots of California firms (like Gibson Dunn, Paul Hastings, Orrick, Morrison Foerster, and O’Melveny & Myers) aren’t on board with the new salary scale.

How come no word from California powerhouses like Gibson, Latham, PH, Orrick, MoFo, Wilson, OMM, etc.? Probably because an article needs to be posted to put some pressure on them…Cooley is making them all look second-rate.

Then there is the question of Washington firms. As we noted yesterday, Covington [does not seem to think](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-salary-hike-not-all-offices-are-created-equal/) its D.C. associates are worthy of a salary bump — as one tipster referred to it, “Covington’s being a jerk.” The powers that be from Covington tried to paint the picture of D.C. as a market with naturally lower comp, but not everyone from Biglaw agrees. The D.C. branch offices of Paul Weiss, Milbank, Kirkland, Davis Polk, Quinn, Weil, Freshfields, Willkie and more have all matched the new scale. Now the question remains, what will other D.C. firms do? Arnold & Porter, WilmerHale, and Hogan Lovells haven’t announced what they will be doing. Then you have to wonder about the highly prestigious Williams & Connolly, which has always paid base salaries about market, but with no bonuses. With the new scale and the expected bonuses, midlevel associates and W&C may find themselves making less than market.

UPDATE 3:09pm: More rumors swirling for a DC firm, and it doesn’t sound like it’s good news:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Unofficial word at Arnold & Porter is that a salary increase is “not a definite no”. Given the row over sub-market bonuses as of late, which had a lot of valuable associates almost leaving the firm, a “no” here would be pretty devastating to associate retention and recruitment.

The overwhelming trend has been for national Biglaw firms moving over to the new scale to do it for all U.S. offices. This puts pressure on regional firms to match. Like how Houston-based Vinson & Elkins just announced pay raises for its associates. But will other Texas firms, like Baker Botts, follow suit?

Chicago-based firms have also made some moves, but what about Mayer Brown and Sidley Austin? The Sidley associates are hopeful they’ll see a raise, but aren’t counting on it:

Associates at Sidley are following the raises very closely, hoping Sidley steps up. We’re thrilled Kirkland and Winston matched, since those are Sidley’s top competitors as Chicago-based firms. Sidley is usually pretty late to the party (someone called Sidley “penny-wise and pound-foolish”), so hopefully they don’t make the same mistake they did with bonuses in 2014 (where they were way under market). The Executive Committee is meeting this afternoon in NY, so here’s to hoping…

And what about Dentons? It is now the largest firm in the world, and is aggressively advertising itself as an innovative market leader. But maybe not in the realm of compensation.

Other Biglaw firms that haven’t crossed to the land of MoneyLaw include Alston & Bird, Jones Day, Akin Gump, DLA Piper, Proskauer Rose, Hunton & Williams, and King & Spalding. Are there any other firms we’ve missed? Has your firm tipped its hat one way or another?

UPDATE 2:47pm: We told you [we loved our tipsters](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/thank-you-tipsters/)! Mere minutes after this post went up we started to hear from more discontented associates, desperate to know if they’ll be getting raises (we’ll be updating this section as more info comes in):

Total radio silence from Greenberg Traurig NY. All the associates are waiting for Fried Frank, Kramer Levin, or DLA Piper to match for us to match.

Just read your “Missing Firms” post. For another Chicago based firm… Jenner & Block has not indicated one way or another re salary increase after getting on board with bonuses in the last cycle.

Ropes hasn’t matched yet–in fact, none of the big three Boston firms have moved (ropes, Wilmerhale, Goodwin Procter). Some satellite offices in Boston have already gone, though (Cooley, Weil, Skadden) and Ropes has to be under pressure from the NYC firms since it competes directly for talent
with them in pretty much every practice area.

Dechert is now one of the only firms in the top 20 PPP rankings that hasn’t at least matched the new Cravath scale. The general attitude here is that the firm should be embarrassed when our competitors with much lower PPP (e.g., Winston) match in all U.S. offices. Folks are already talking about jumping ship if we don’t pony up within the next week.

Pillsbury leadership has indicated that it is monitoring the situation in NY as well as all other markets where it has offices, but that the timing of any announcement is uncertain at the moment. However, after experiencing a massive defection of partners and associates to Winston Strawn last year, I hope leadership is feeling enough pressure from that match to take the plunge. Of course, more Cali firm matches would help too. It bears mentioning that the vast majority of associates at Pillsbury, about 65 % do not get bonuses. If base pay were not to be raised, total compensation would be way below market. Recruitment and retention would definitely be affected. I know I’m ready to leave if there is no match and have heard similarly from others.

Plus there have been questions about White & Case, Baker & McKenzie, Shearman & Sterling, Cadwalader and Schulte Roth.

UPDATE 4:03pm: Woohoo! Someone we called out in this piece has now jacked up their compensation scale. [Congrats Latham](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/earths-highest-grossing-law-firm-increases-associate-salaries-worldwide/), welcome to MoneyLaw.

UPDATE 4:40pm: Another firm is making it rain! [Sidley matches](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biggest-firm-yet-matches-cravath-pay-scale/) the full MoneyLaw compensation scale.

UPDATE 5:24pm: [Proskauer has made the cut](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/game-set-match-in-this-biglaw-firms-major-offices/), raising associate salaries to the new compensation grid.

UPDATE 5:49pm: West coast is making moves! [Well done O’Melveny](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/money_on_the_west_coast/)!

UPDATE 8:33pm: [Fenwick matches](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/that-180k-payday-is-spreading-on-the-west-coast/)!

It’s been a crazy couple of weeks of law firm maneuvering and we certainly still haven’t seen the end of the exciting, frustrating, downright depressing announcements, and ubiquitous [stock images of money](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-23-sexiest-stock-images-of-money/12/). But we wanted to take a moment to look back at this week and address some of the most pressing questions readers have sent us about the shenanigans.

I understand firms jumping up to 180K when their direct competitors in their main market jump up. What market pressures are the global firms (Jones Day, Hogan Lovells, DLA Piper, Baker McKenzie, and Norton Rose Fulbright) feeling right now?

Norton Rose Fulbright is a great example: their US presence is based in Texas. Do they follow V&E in Houston? Or can they hold out because their focus is more on the global, as opposed to local, market?

This is a great question and a quirk of being a partnership is that there are probably multiple answers among the firm’s leadership. I’d imagine a good number of those Houston partners see V&E as a peer. And, likewise, there are partners in the U.K. who don’t know what a Viney Elk even does. The matter is further complicated for firms with partnership structures that offer some degree of office autonomy. Fierce pressures to stay in line with the crosstown rival compete with the overarching firm’s interest in protecting it’s overall identity.

Ultimately, the fairest answer is probably “both.”

Obviously everyone who is at these firms is thrilled about associate salary raises. Any indication that they will also affect clerkship bonuses though? I realize it’s kind of a niche issue, but if clerkship bonuses stay the same then the opportunity cost of clerking just increased by $20K, which is nothing to shake a stick at when you have 6 figures of debt.

As someone who decided to skip a federal clerkship for exactly this reason, I know exactly what you mean. Back then though, the paltry clerkship bonuses of the time and the big raise the firms had just implemented meant leaving $70K-$80K on the table. I didn’t have the financial wherewithal to walk away from that much money.

Firms are better about clerking now, but they’re also firms. It took almost 10 years to raise salaries, bank on at least a year before anyone figures out they’ve made clerking more expensive.

So amid the jubilation over the base salary increase, this neurotic summer has a troubling thought. Might firms who feel pressured to match, but weren’t anticipating it to happen so soon, not hire all their current summers despite a traditional 100% offer rate because they can’t afford us all?

David Lat already jumped on this question and I don’t have any quibble with his answer:

I doubt it. Low offer rates are awful publicity. Better to give everyone offers and stay at 160k than take on a pay scale you can’t afford & no offer.

Would love some analysis on what NY to 180 means for firms in smaller markets that don’t try as hard to keep up. The 80K hit I took to move to (major Seattle firm) from an SV office is now a 100K hit at a time when Seattle needs lawyers. It’s been complete radio silence here….?

Before last week, I’d have said that’s the cost of moving to a small market. The Northwest will get its raises, but at the slower pace more befitting a society where you get a contact high walking down the street. But, hell, [everyone’s getting raises now](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/no-your-office-doesnt-deserve-the-ny-to-180-raise/).

Remember, this is a market that [only recently bumped salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/10/which-firm-just-gave-its-first-years-a-20000-raise/), and those firms have to feel their moves in the last year put them where they should be. But an outsider like Orrick — who announced a [$165K starting salary in their Seattle office](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/california-based-biglaw-firm-matches-cravath-in-most-offices/) — might push the local firms to comply.

Is anything happening for the Big Law support staff that have been torn apart, terrorized, fired and downsized and received 2 – 4% raises for the past 7 years?

Sadly, the answer is probably nothing good. We’ve already seen [staff layoffs since raises were announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/bad-timing-alert-layoffs-follow-raises/), and while those layoffs were unrelated to the raises, that kind of underscores the point that these raises — at best — won’t arrest the negative trend for firm staff. At worst, this could be the push partners need to trim the ranks even more.

Technologically savvy associates, new tools, and [droid lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/bakerhostetler-hires-a-i-lawyer-ushers-in-the-legal-apocalypse/) have put more and more pressure on staff. In my career, the only lawyers who really used their secretaries were the oldest attorneys who would still dictate memos. Most everyone else had moved to disposable, recently graduated paralegals for many of the tasks traditionally assigned to administrative assistants. And those partners are aging out of the profession.

It’s unfortunate, because it’s really amazing to watch a seasoned admin at work. There’s a lot of industry know-how garnered over years of working closely with top attorneys.

For the record, I think MoneyLaw is a silly name. Elite makes much more sense.

Except “Elite” doesn’t make a lick of sense. Would we call — absolutely no offense intended here — Crowell an elite firm but King & Spalding not? One has issued a raise and the other hasn’t (yet). There are firms whose attorneys’ pedigrees, financials, and practice make them “elite.” Some of those firms have raised to Cravath’s scale and some haven’t. Others who we would not, if we’re being totally honest, consider “elite” have raised and others haven’t. The point of MoneyLaw (or “PaidLaw” as I pushed to make the term, but lost) was to group firms by their willingness to pay associates — [for good or ill](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/crowell-moring-matches-wait-what-in-the-holy-hell-is-going-on-here/) — regardless of their prestige or lack thereof.

# Hogan Lovells And Shearman & Sterling... Potential Merger On The Horizon
## Didn't see that coming.

Just when you thought 2022 Biglaw news might ease into an eggnog-fueled nap, German website Juve throws a curveball, announcing “[Hogan Lovells und Shearman & Sterling prüfen Kanzleifusion](https://www.juve.de/markt-und-management/hogan-lovells-und-shearman-sterling-pruefen-kanzleifusion/).” And if you aren’t up to date on your Babbel subscription, “Kanzleifusion” roughly translates to “law firm merger.”

Biglaw merger rumors require generous doses of salt. Dealing with this many moving parts presents tons of obstacles in the form of conflicts, billing rates, redundancies, overhead… there’s a lot that can derail talks. There’s a reason we aren’t talking about “[Allen O’Melvery](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/allen-overy-and-omelveny-are-considering-merger-please-name-it-allen-omelvery/).”

Still, at the point merger news hits the press — even “early” merger news — it’s safe to assume that talks have advanced beyond swiping right.

[Hogan Lovells](https://www.hoganlovells.com/) has around 2500 attorneys and [Shearman](https://www.shearman.com/) boasts about 850. Equity partner profits are roughly comparable between $2.5M and $3M. Am Law says the merger would create the number 3 law firm by revenue (depending on the extent of conflicted out work, of course).

The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/12/21/hogan-lovells-and-shearman-respond-to-merger-talks-report/) got statements from the firms and they are as generic as you’d expect from an early stage merger discussion:

Hogan Lovells said in a statement: “As a leading global law firm we regularly review our global strategy and opportunities that we believe may be available to us, and that includes discussions with different firms in the market. This demonstrates our confidence in our unique offering and our balance of practice areas, global footprint and sector strength.”

Shearman’s own statement said: “We continuously consider the various levers of growth that are accessible to us as part of our strategic planning process. These include both internal and external opportunities that would benefit our firm and our clients. Beyond that, we never comment on market rumors or speculation.”

They also report that sources are all over the map when it comes to characterizing the talks, with one saying it’s been going on for some time, another calling it exploratory, and still others having heard nothing until today.

Geographically speaking, the firms have offices in a lot of the same locations. Shearman’s international presence is decidedly smaller than what Hogan Lovells brings so it makes some sense to bulk up the size of those locations, but it’s hard to see what exactly Hogan Lovells gains location-wise. Practice area expertise? Certainly a lot of talent in play here, but if that’s the only goal it’s a lot easier to just pick off a practice group or two in the lateral market. So is this really just a “go big or go home” moment? One plus one [doesn’t always make two](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/04/21/for-the-am-law-100-mergers-dont-always-mean-immediate-results/) when it comes to mergers, but smart mergers can turn it into three.

Over the coming months we’ll get a sense of how the firms think this particular equation works out.

Allen & Overy’s merger with Shearman & Sterling [will be official in May](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/ao-shearman-merger-approved-poised-to-become-third-largest-firm-in-the-world/), but before that time, the top firm is taking care of some expansion in the Middle East.

On Monday, the firm received its license to operate in Saudi Arabia, and promptly opened a new office there in Riyadh. As noted by Bloomberg Law, in May, lawyers from a Shearman team in the area will join the office.

Allen & Overy previously conducted business in the area through an association Khoshaim & Associates, a firm in the area, but that relationship concluded in 2020. A&O now joins the likes of Clifford Chance, Kirkland & Ellis, Latham & Watkins, and Linklaters with independent practices within the region.

[Khalid Garousha](https://www.allenovery.com/en-gb/global/people/Khalid-Garousha), who was recently [elected as senior partner for A&O Shearman](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/03/ao-shearman-names-its-first-global-leadership-team/) and currently serves as A&O’s interim global managing partner and regional managing partner for the Middle East and Turkey, had this to say about the firm’s move: “A&O has had a strong presence in the Middle East since 1978, including a long history of advising clients in the Kingdom.”

Congratulations to Allen & Overy  — and to A&O Shearman come May — on the new office.

# The Power Of Pro Bono: Biglaw Firm Scores Major Victory For Victims Of Flint Water Crisis
## White & Case has worked hard for the children of Flint, and it's starting to pay off.

On April 25, 2014, they switched over the Flint water supply. The city’s Emergency Manager, an unelected official foisted upon the city by the state government, claimed that switching the water supply from Lake Huron to the Flint River marked the first step in saving Flint’s long-term finances. A more cynical eye might say the switch was the first step in an unnecessary infrastructure project that transferred public funds from a politically unpowerful, predominantly minority city to private contractors to build a pipeline of dubious value that left the city starved of the cash needed to secure clean water in the interim, but that’s neither here nor there.

What happened next is the ongoing calamity we know so well. The Flint River’s water is highly acidic and corrosive and the interim water supply plan didn’t include corrosion controls. In the aftermath of the switch, General Motors had to shut off the water supply because its parts were corroding. You’d think this would tip off someone that maybe the city of 100,000 people shouldn’t be drinking the same water burning holes in auto parts. But it didn’t, and that corrosive water resulted in lead leaching into the system and the populace ended up poisoned by a dangerous, irreversible, and — to the extent it corrupts the DNA of the victim — multi-generational contaminant.

On April 25, 2018, I sat down in the [well-appointed offices](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/white-case-has-built-the-new-modern-law-firm-office-and-its-awesome/) of [White & Case](https://www.whitecase.com) to discuss the first fruits of the firm’s tireless efforts to get justice for the children victimized by this crisis. On April 12, the legal team representing the children of Flint, pro bono, including attorneys from White & Case, the ACLU of Michigan and the Education Law Center (ELC) reached a partial settlement with the Michigan Department of Education (MDE), Genesee Intermediate School District (GISD), and Flint Community Schools (FCS). The agreement establishes a two-tiered screening program for area children, consisting first of a survey process where parents and teachers can identify children displaying symptoms of lead poisoning and a second prong providing sophisticated psychological testing for children flagged by the first process. Lead poisoning manifests itself in a wide variety of ways, making a robust screening process essential. Considering upwards of 30,000 kids may have been exposed during the crisis, this is a substantial investment.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Above the Law’s [pro bono columnist David Lash](https://abovethelaw.com/author/davidlash/) shared his thoughts on the significance of this result:

The work White & Case has done in Flint, Michigan, is an extraordinary example of how vital the efforts of pro bono attorneys can be in protecting those who are most vulnerable.  The firm’s work on this water quality-focused litigation exemplifies the impact of lawyers who bring to bear their skills and expertise, resulting in the kind of help that only the judicial system, and dedicated attorneys, can provide.  If pro bono work is our profession’s highest calling, White & Case’s pro bono protection of the health and safety of children is the most meaningful example of why that is so true.

[Lindsay Heck](https://www.whitecase.com/people/lindsay-heck), a fifth-year litigator at White & Case, explained that this screening program is a significant win, but still just a start. As the process accumulates data, she said, that’s when the work of designing programs to help these children get the assistance they need can begin in earnest. She’s hopeful that the parties will reach a global settlement to provide resources for that stage. However, if that’s not to be, she assured me the firm is prepared to continue fighting.

It’s a tremendous win and one that Heck credits the parents who she’s been representing for bringing the case to this point:

This is their everyday reality. They’ve been incredibly brave in letting us tell their stories unflinchingly. It’s our hope that this settlement can be a model and the parents can take solace that this will help others.

The victory underscores White & Case’s significant commitment to pro bono. The firm won the New York Legal Aid Society’s highest award in 2017 and consistently secures high- and low-profile victories through its global pro bono efforts — efforts that add up to the tune of 108,000 hours globally.


Lindsay Heck

Heck’s work fighting for the children of Flint is indicative of the firm’s commitment. Heck, who got her pro bono start fighting human trafficking in Detroit, joined the Flint matter as a senior associate when she was just a third-year and she’s been running point on this matter, first with partner Greg Little (now leading the charge on the Flint case as an attorney with the ELC), and now under the supervision of partner [Greg Starner](https://www.whitecase.com/people/gregory-starner). “It’s a good example of how pro bono can accelerate your career trajectory,” she observes.

The idea that pro bono offers young associates their best avenue to take on tasks often reserved for much more senior attorneys isn’t new, but stories like this serve as an important reminder of how true that is. White & Case had first-years second chairing depositions on this matter, and Heck explained that some attorneys were given substantive work to do on this matter basically right as they came in the door. Those are practical skills that will serve those attorneys well as they advance at the firm.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Why is pro bono so well-suited to featuring young lawyers in starring roles? It’s certainly not that pro bono matters are “less important.” The work that goes into a case like the Flint Water matter is as high impact as any other litigation. If one’s looking for a culprit, it’s that most paying clients and large firm culture generally have developed an allergy to [letting young associates handle paying work](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/proof-that-law-firms-dont-really-care-about-associate-development/) that they are entirely capable of handling. If anything, it’s actually pro bono practice where the roles are properly meted out, not the billable side.

But if there’s a bright side to this quirk of Biglaw culture, it’s that it allows lawyers hungry for professional development the opportunity to lend their skills to causes that really need them. If a firm like White & Case can cultivate a more experienced young workforce by bringing its considerable Biglaw firepower to bear on a civil rights crisis of this magnitude, then they’ve managed to master the “doing good while doing well” formula.

# World's Richest Man's Complains About Law Firm's 'Greed'
## I'd like to report a murder. The victim is 'irony.'

After Elon Musk tried to get out of buying Twitter, [Wachtell rolled in to hold him to the terms of the merger agreement he hoped to escape](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/twitter-complaint-demonstrates-that-every-lawyer-everywhere-always-is-smarter-than-elon-musk/). After forcing Musk back to the deal, the venerable firm continued to advise Twitter to get the deal over the finish line. For its efforts, the firm sought and received a “success fee” of around $70 million. Now, [X lawyers are suing Wachtell](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/elon-musk-sues-wachtell-for-being-better-lawyers/) and just asked to keep the case out of arbitration [based on Wachtell’s “greed.”](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/10/03/pointing-to-wachtells-greed-x-corp-argues-law-firm-cant-force-arbitration-in-fee-lawsuit/)

Can’t make this stuff up!

To put this in perspective, as of the last estimation of Musk’s net worth, the $70 million success fee sought by Wachtell would be the equivalent of a first-year associate for $60.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Is $70 million a lot? Sure. Is it a reasonable ask for a law firm that secured $44 billion for its client? Yeah, actually. The “greed” claims become all the more ridiculous when you recall that Wachtell sets this fee based on earning “60% to 80% of the fees paid to investment advisors” on a deal, meaning there’s some knucklehead frat bro banker out there earning way more and no one is saying jack. Morgan Stanley got paid an estimated $1.3 billion on this deal.

But it’s easier to burn bridges with one Am Law 50 firm than to alienate Goldman Sachs, so it’s Wachtell that has to be dragged as “unethical” and greedy for seeking a pittance compared to the bankers.

# This Bonus Announcement Is Short, Sweet, And To The Bank
## With the time the firm saved reading the bonus announcement, maybe they can afford extra pro bono work?

We all know what time it is. It’s bonus season and people want their money. Why go through all the fanfare of thanking associates for their undying commitment to the firm or not wearing socks with holes in them. Send the damned email out, know everyone is going to try and bill .1 for reading it, and keep it moving.

At least that’s the vibe I got from Weil, Gotshal & Manges. While I wouldn’t go so far as to call it curt, it was definitely efficient in its delivery. Like so:

Class Year	2021 Overall Strong Bonus	Special Bonus
2021	$15,000 (prorated)	N/A
2020	$20,000	$4,000
2019	$30,000	$6,000
2018	$57,500	$11,500
2017	$75,000	$15,000
2016	$90,000	$18,000
2015	$105,000	$21,000
2014 and more senior, including three year counsel	$115,000	$23,000

Congratulations on your bonuses, pay off your student loans, do some paying it forward, etc.

# An In-House Reality Check: The Grass May Not Be Greener
## In-house roles can be a good fit for many lawyers, but the way law firm associates idolize in-house counsel positions often indicates an incomplete understanding of the realities of these jobs.

As a legal recruiter, one of the most common things I hear from law firm associates is that their goal is to go in-house. Law firm associates often can’t wait to leave behind the billable hour.

On the face of it, there’s nothing wrong with that — in-house roles can be a good fit for many lawyers. But the way law firm associates idolize in-house counsel positions often indicates an incomplete understanding of the realities of these jobs.

Having spent the majority of my legal career working in-house, I am deeply familiar with the tradeoffs associated with working in-house and can tell you it is not what you’ve been led to believe.

A lengthy interview process

If you land an interview, buckle up because it’s a long road.

You’re likely to get your first taste of the differences between law firms and companies during the in-house interview process.

Law firm interviewing tends to prioritize efficiency: you interview with some partners, meet a few associates, go to lunch, and get an offer. The whole process takes about a month and sometimes much less. 

For in-house roles, you typically apply online, send your resume into the ATS abyss, and hope for the best. If you are one of the lucky ones, you will advance to a recruiter phone screening. Once that is complete, expect to wait at least a week to meet with the hiring manager. After interviewing with the hiring manager, you will be scheduled to meet members of the legal team. If all goes well, you’ll be introduced to the functional leaders you would support. Finally, you may meet with the Chief Legal Officer. The time between rounds is usually about a week. In the interim, you may be expected to complete a take-home assignment or a case study, which you then may or may not present to your potential future colleagues. Overall, expect this process to take four to eight weeks or longer. 

From profit center to cost center

As a lawyer at a law firm, you are part of the profit center: you bill hours and directly generate revenue. You are paying for staff salaries and keeping the lights on. In contrast, an in-house legal department is a cost center, supporting the revenue-generating parts of the business, but not bringing in revenue independently.  

When you go in-house, all eyes are no longer on you, and you are somewhat less important. This shift affects every aspect of your job, including resource allocation, leadership focus, and budget.

No longer the profit center and no longer keeping time, in-house counsel must find ways to add value to the business and develop creative ways to measure those contributions. Adding value and measuring it is doubly important in times of economic uncertainty, when companies move to cut costs.

A change of pace — but not necessarily slower

Whoever told you that in-house counsel enjoy a well-balanced 9-to-5 was wrong. Let’s be clear: the typical in-house role is far from the relaxed 40-hours-a-week you’ve been pitched. In reality, 60-hour weeks are not uncommon for many in-house lawyers.

First, the decision to hire in-house counsel is made for a reason: there is a lot of work to be done. You are expected to take on the work of outside counsel independently, and to do so with fewer resources.

Remember that hearing you went to 30 minutes away or the time you spent sitting in court waiting to argue? As an associate, this counted as productivity. As in-house counsel, when you spend time on activities where your presence turns out not to have been necessary, you’re the one who bears the cost. You still have to get your work done, and frequently that means putting in time in the evenings or on weekends to catch up.

Finally, businesses move at an incredible pace. You’re likely to find that timelines are extremely short. Gone are the days when you had two weeks to complete a memo. Now you need to do it in 30 minutes. Your internal clients need quick answers, and if you don’t weigh in immediately, the business will take action without you.

Juggling many responsibilities

Private practice is all about specialization. But at most companies, especially smaller ones, every in-house counsel has a much more diverse range of responsibilities on their plate. That can be exciting, but it’s also time-consuming and stressful, especially when you are given responsibility for an area unrelated to your prior law firm practice.

Startups take this to the extreme. Not only will you be one of the few lawyers in the company (perhaps even the only one!), but you will also probably be one of the smartest people in the room. People will recognize that, and they’ll want to tap you for projects that aren’t squarely within the legal domain. Being involved in non-legal subject matter might sound fun, but it can be exhausting when combined with the legal work that forms the core of your portfolio.

Be realistic about the tradeoffs

There’s no denying that law firms can be a tough environment, and a long-term career in private practice isn’t for everyone. But it’s easy to take for granted the benefit of being surrounded by smart and well-credentialed colleagues. Not to mention resources like immediately responsive paralegals and subscriptions to any database you desire. Or a well-defined career progression with material increases in compensation every year. As an in-house counsel, you can’t expect a luxury building in a prime location, a private office, an assistant, a paralegal, or even Westlaw.

You may be more than happy to make those tradeoffs. But do think it through carefully. The grass isn’t always greener.

# Lawyers: Who Do You Think You Are?
## How can attorneys begin to work with their inner critics? Here's some advice from a Biglaw partner.

Jeena Cho

I remember many occasions throughout my career where my inner critic very judgmentally asked, “Who do you think you are?” I struggled with this voice that was constantly reminding me all the ways in which I wasn’t good enough or smart enough, and all the ways in which I didn’t know enough. Perhaps you struggle with your inner critic too.

I wish in my younger days as a lawyer that I knew what I know now — you are entitled to show up, even [if you believe you aren’t enough](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/3-lies-lawyers-should-stop-telling-themselves/). You can learn as you go, you can figure things out, and you can ask for help. Also, you are not the only one that struggles with the feeling of not enough.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Recently, I sat down with Laura Maechtlen on [The Resilient Lawyer podcast](http://theanxiouslawyer.com/rl-48-laura-maechtlen-on-being-lgbt-in-big-law/). She is a [partner with Seyfarth Shaw](http://www.seyfarth.com/LauraMaechtlen) where she serves as the National Vice-Chair of the Labor and Employment Department and Co-Chair of the Firm’s Diversity and Inclusion Action Team. By all outward appearance and evidence, Laura is a model of success. Yet she too experiences occasional self-doubt.

In our interview, she shared that when she first started at Seyfarth as a second-year attorney, “success to me looked like I still had a job in a year.” Despite positive feedback and praise, her inner critic would say things like, “God, they’re going to figure out that I wasn’t the girl that was meant to work in a law firm.”

The inner critic is a terrible roommate. It prevents us from celebrating our own success and finding joy in it. As Laura shared, “When I recently was asked to serve in a new position at the firm as our Vice Chair for the Labor and Employment Department — which is the greatest department in the world (although, I’m completely biased) — for weeks I would get up in the morning and think, ‘Did that really happen?’ The inner critic is amazing. I’m so lucky to be able to serve this amazing group of people. Sometimes I can’t believe it.”

You may be wondering, how do I get rid of the inner critic? In my experience, it’s not something you want to get rid of, but rather, you have to get better about recognizing it. Once you begin to observe your thought patterns, you can start to see the broken record that repeatedly plays itself over and over again in your head.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As Laura explained, “If I’m spending too much time worrying, thinking things like ‘I’m going to be fired tomorrow because I’m a terrible lawyer,’ I know I’m off in some way. When I realize I’m off in my thinking, it reminds me to re-center by saying, ‘Wait. Stop. Okay. What’s happening to make me feel this way?’”

When I asked Laura how attorneys could begin to work with their inner critics, she shared this sage advice:

My first career was in music and I had a violin teacher who said that, for every good habit and good technique you learn when practicing the violin, you can practice a good habit once, and then you move on and it will sink in. But, to get rid of a bad habit, you must practice doing something the right way five times for every one time you practiced a bad habit. He said, ‘Bad habits have people, people don’t have bad habits.’

It’s the same thing with the ‘imposter syndrome’ thinking we all struggle with. For each time you engage in that negative thinking, you have to counteract it with positive thinking in a much greater quantity.

I wish for other people — especially junior attorneys — to pay attention to the positive feedback; to seek it out to counteract the inner critic; practice thinking about how you are contributing in a positive way and making sure you’re aligning how you spend your time and your career in a way that you’re positive and happy about.

When you practice law in this way, you can start to recognize that all those negative, self-destructive thoughts are just the impostor syndrome devil that has perched itself in your brain and you can work to get rid of that devil.

What I’ve learned over the years of practice is this: I don’t have to get rid of that part of me that always feels as though she is never enough. That voice can have room in my head with all the many other characters. However, the inner critic is not allowed to be in the driver’s seat.

My wish for you, my dear reader, is this: you can be comfortable with who you are, your accomplishments, your failures, your gifts, as well as your shortcomings.

# A 4-Day Work Week For Biglaw? Yeah, Right.

Realistically for some people it may work. But does it work well? Not really, you end up doing more on those four days than five and would probably still end up working over.

— A partner at an elite firm in the U.K., in comments given to [Law.com International](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/06/15/could-the-four-day-week-work-in-big-law-405-105943/) on how he thinks a four-day work week would out in a Biglaw setting. This month, more than 3,000 employees at 70 companies in the U.K. started a [trial of a four-day work week](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/06/15/could-the-four-day-week-work-in-big-law-405-105943/). Those employees will work for four days instead of five, without any effect on their pay. In the legal profession, where there are sometimes pressing client matters that need to be attended to, it seems unlikely that a shortened week would be feasible for all employees.

We probably did half our interviewing before the formal OCI process.

— A partner at Simpson Thacher, commenting in an interview with [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/big-law-firms-are-making-more-pre-oci-job-offers-2022-8) on the firm’s early law student recruiting for summer 2023, which came ahead of law schools’ formal on-campus interviews. “Now, it’s just like the Wild West,” said another Biglaw partner, who mentioned that some summer associate prospects are entering interviews with “three or four offers” already in hand. Sources at Latham & Watkins say that the firm will likely conduct fewer OCI interviews this year because it’s already made 2023 offers to many students.

# Donald Trump's Tax Lawyers Saying, 'Trump Who?' As IRS Changes Hands
## Morgan Lewis is winding down its relationship with Trump's ventures.

Screenshot NBC News

This picture forms the first half of an epic Biglaw “How it started” meme. Immediately before his inauguration, Donald Trump stacked up a [pile of empty manila folders](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/revealed-whats-really-in-trumps-stack-of-folders/) and made Morgan Lewis partner Sheri Dillon explain that Trump was placing all of his business in a trust. That the trust would be administered by his kids, thus defeating the purpose of a blind trust was an afterthought for Morgan Lewis, the firm that had advised on Trump’s taxes for years.

After the [New York Times revealed](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage) a fortune [built on shady exploitation of tax laws](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/10/3/17934360/trump-taxes-illegal-new-york-times-expose) that [forced Trump’s federal judge sister to resign before facing a damaging investigation](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/maryanne-trump-barry-pulled-a-kozinski/), four years of Trump family holdings [profiting off the government in ways that underscored the blind trust lie](https://www.govexec.com/oversight/2018/10/new-evidence-suggests-trumps-coordination-gsa-fbi-headquarters-plan/152128/), and the New York AG’s office [naming Dillon and Morgan Lewis as defendants](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2020/08/24/ny-attorney-general-sues-trump-organization-and-attorneys-amid-probe-of-family-finances/) in its Trump Organization probe, the firm seems to have decided that “Trump,” “taxes,” and “Morgan Lewis” are terms they don’t want to see in the same sentence. Even if some of the questionable moves predated the firm’s involvement.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
[And so we come to the “how it’s going” half of the meme](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/01/20/morgan-lewis-seeking-to-cut-ties-with-trump/):

A spokesperson for Morgan Lewis indicated Tuesday that it is working to wrap up its long-running tax work for the former president and his companies.

The American Lawyer suggests that Morgan Lewis hasn’t suffered the same blowback that [Jones Da](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/yesterday-was-the-day-america-learned-what-weve-known-about-jones-day-all-along/?rf=1)y or [Cleta Mitchell](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/cleta-mitchell-out-at-foley-lardner-after-troubling-donald-trump-call/) did because representing Trump’s business interests is a more palatable endeavor than trying to “overthrow democracy.” And not to diminish the extensive work Jones Day billed to its “voter suppression” matter number, Trump’s business and tax dealings shouldn’t get lost in a shuffle of empty folders. Taxpayer funds appear to have been redirected for his benefit, foreign entities pumped cash toward his interests in an effort to curry influence, and his charities increasingly appear to be empty shells. If none of this is illegal, it’s certainly not something a firm should want to get its name mixed up in.

And the “if” is doing a lot of work in that sentence.

So Morgan Lewis will say good bye to the Trumps after years of loyal service. They’ll still be in the headlines by dint of the existing probes, but they’ll begin the transition — now that Trump is out of office — to purging their firm reputation of its connection to the reality TV host.

But don’t cry because it’s over, smile that the firm banked massive revenue over the years.

# Judge Questions The Integrity Of Biglaw Firm In Epic Benchslap
## This benchslap is painful even before the judge turns into a 'disappointed dad.'

“Evidently I have an entirely different view of integrity and honor than you do.”

That’s the money line right there in yesterday’s brutal benchslap from Southern District of Texas Bankruptcy Judge [David Jones](http://www.txs.uscourts.gov/content/chief-united-states-bankruptcy-judge-david-r-jones), who’s presiding over the bankruptcy of Midstates Petroleum. Squire Patton Boggs is counsel to the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (UCC), and Judge Jones is none too pleased with their behavior.

As Debtwire [reports](https://www.debtwire.com/dockets/cases/txsb-4-16-bk-32237?s=690):

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The judge was upset with UCC counsel Squire Patton Boggs, which had raised questions about the conduct of Midstates executives and their lawyers at Kirkland & Ellis, then negotiated a UCC settlement while simultaneously reaching a deal on its fees.

Only problem is, the actions of Kirkland and its clients have all been aboveboard, and it’s Squire’s simultaneous settlement and fee arrangement that strikes the judge as potentially problematic:

“I will tell you, I’ll be interested to see how this is implemented because I don’t understand a lot of it,” Judge Jones said yesterday. “I’m going to need a real good understanding of how this was accomplished at arm’s length. I don’t understand how counsel for the committee can negotiate for the UCC while negotiating its own fees. But perhaps that’s an issue for another day. And I certainly hope we haven’t hit three strikes,” he said.

Judge Jones’s reference to three strikes is building on what has become a theme. Back at a hearing in August, Squire partner[ Norman Kinel](http://www.squirepattonboggs.com/professionals/k/kinel-norman) alleged a proposed settlement was based on a “patently false” claim and that there were serious concerns about the behavior of Midstates and Kirkland. At the time, Judge Jones warned Kinel that he did’t feel like he was being given the full truth. And at yesterday’s hearing, when Squire dropped these complaints and supported a newly negotiated settlement and fee arrangement, Judge Jones decided he’d had it with the Biglaw firm:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“The way you’ve handled things, you’ve got a lot of growing up to do,” the judge told a Squire attorney. “You don’t have a skillset that will let you talk your way out of this. You were wrong. Try to learn a lesson out of this, because if it happens again – and your performance in this court will be known to every judge in the Southern District [of Texas] – if it happens again, there’s an unfortunate result in store for you.”

The feeling that there were machinations behind the scenes not disclosed to the judge is a recurring theme in his comments. The tongue lashing was so intense that multiple tipsters wrote to Above the Law, calling it a “huge bench slap,” “extreme,” and “a total beat-down.”

“The one thing I demand more than anything is transparency,” Jones said. “And I do that for a number of reasons. Folks who hire the lawyers of the caliber that are in this courtroom, they have somewhere to go they can ask questions about the process. The great majority of folks affected by these cases do not. And it is those people I have a special focus for, and for the guy whose – and I hope I’m not referring to anyone in particular – the guy who runs a small water truck in Oklahoma who isn’t gonna get paid on his last three invoices and is gonna run his truck on bare tires or can’t afford braces for his daughter, that’s the guy who matters most to me when it comes to transparency.”

Then he went all “disappointed dad” on Squire:

“And today I’m sad, I am,” he went on. “In the court of public opinion, we are all judged by the lowest common denominator. And we’ve all taken a black eye today, we all have. I didn’t sleep a lot last night thinking of this issue and what I could’ve done differently to have the standard that I require met. And I’m gonna agonize over that for a long time. So today’s proceeding is hard for me, because I haven’t given the public what I think they deserve in terms of the process. So it’s with a heavy heart that I proceed forward on confirmation of the debtor’s amended plan.”

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Introduces New Lockstep Salary Scale Across All U.S. Offices

Associate compensation is once again a hot topic in the highest echelons of the legal profession, and young lawyers at some firms are finally reaping the benefits of the 2018 salary hike that brought starting salaries to $190,000. By the time this wave of salary increases is over, we may finally see a somewhat uniform salary scale across the majority of large law firms, all across the country.

The firm announcing salary increases this time around is Holland & Knight, ranked 38th on the Am Law 100 with $1,044,337,000 in 2020 gross revenue. The firm has been in the news recently for its [potential merger](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/biglaw-firms-in-talks-for-merger-that-could-create-one-of-the-largest-firms-in-america/) with Thompson & Knight, but now, the firm is making news by offering lockstep salaries in each and every one of its U.S. offices. Here’s what the new salary scale looks like at the firm, effective July 1, 2021 (full memo available on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/hk-salary-increase-2021/2/)):

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Steven Sonberg, the firm’s managing partner, noted that H&K is also “reviewing [its] annual associate bonus program to ensure it is market-competitive” and that any changes made “will not impact the special bonuses that were announced in April.” (That’s because for the firm’s bonus program to remain market-competitive, nothing can impact those bonuses.)

Congratulations to everyone at Holland & Knight who just got a raise, and to everyone who will see increased market bonuses at the end of the year.

(Flip to the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/hk-salary-increase-2021/2/) to see the full memo from Holland & Knight.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Biglaw Firm Withdraws From Election Litigation Before They Get Jones Day-ed
## A Biglaw firm's reputation is a valuable -- and fragile -- thing. UPDATE: It looks like the firm made the right call.

Check out the update at the end of the story.

Biglaw is sure getting a crash course in brand management. The vagaries of elite legal representation is usually considered niche news, if it’s really news at all. At Above the Law — a publication that makes its nut documenting (and ridiculing) the minutia of Biglaw — we’re sure enjoying the rest of the world taking a long hard look at Biglaw.

There was the New York Times [article blowing up](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/even-jones-day-lawyers-are-giving-trumps-election-lawsuits-some-serious-side-eye/) Jones Day (and Porter Wright) over their election litigation representations. Then there was Jones Day’s lackluster [response to the controversy. ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/yesterday-was-the-day-america-learned-what-weve-known-about-jones-day-all-along/)And there was the Lincoln Project promising to spend $500,000 on [an ad campaign](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/jones-day-to-prepare-for-a-bad-pr-campaign-the-likes-of-which-theyve-never-seen-before/) going after them — and, importantly, their clients — over the representation. And then the MeidasTouch PAC actually released a [Jones Day attack video](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/you-have-to-watch-the-opening-salvo-in-the-anti-jones-day-ad-campaign).

Man, repeating the shitstorm that’s been raining down on Jones Day over the past few days just does not get old.

Toward that end, Snell & Wilmer recently withdrew from their role in an Arizona case alleging voting improprieties. The case seeks a manual review of in-person purported overvoted ballots, as well as a delay on certification of the results. The Arizona Secretary of State describes the case as “grasping at straws.” But that’s not Snell & Wilmer’s problem any more.

As [reported by](https://today.westlaw.com/Document/Ief147bd0247611eb8dfbdfeb7526f5c7/View/FullText.html) Reuters Legal:

Associate Presiding Civil Judge Daniel Kiley on Tuesday granted Snell & Wilmer’s request to withdraw as counsel of record for the Republican National Committee. The RNC had teamed-up with the Trump campaign and the Arizona Republican Party in the case, which alleges that Maricopa County incorrectly rejected some votes cast on Election Day.

Though Snell & Wilmer hasn’t commented on the withdrawal, there are plenty of people connecting the dots and surmising that the firm got out while the getting was good.

Snell & Wilmer, the firm representing Trump in the Arizona election litigation, has withdrawn from the case. Doesn't say explicitly that this is the cause but appears clear they didn't like the brand damage tied to trying to steal an election. [https://t.co/Pe40k48CrX](https://t.co/Pe40k48CrX))

— Josh Marshall (@joshtpm) [November 12, 2020](https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/1326721985574002689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Now, Snell made the motion to withdraw on Sunday, before the Jones Day pile on really began in earnest. But it’s not like this was unexpected — we’ve been calling Jones Day out on using the courts to contest the election[ for over a month](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/the-biglaw-firms-doing-trumps-election-bidding/?rf=1), since, you know, the president said this was his plan well before November 3rd. And the whole thrust of the Times article, which really got the ball rolling, was that there’s internal discord and concern that repping the president/GOP is “shortsighted” at Jones Day and Porter Wright. It’s not a far leap to assume another firm’s fearful that a case like the Arizona litigation could harm their reputation.

Maybe Jones Day could use a little of that foresight.

UPDATE: Looks like Snell made the right call. MeidasTouch founder Ben Meiselas, which already put out a [Jones Day video](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/you-have-to-watch-the-opening-salvo-in-the-anti-jones-day-ad-campaign/), says they were ready to go after Snell before they withdrew:

# Reinventing The Law Business: 3 Essential Virtues For Lawyers

Bruce Stachenfeld

Patrick Lencioni writes some great books. They are “business books,” so some might say that lawyers should logically have no particular interest in them. But that would be completely wrong. Indeed, the reason I have been successful in somehow starting and running a law firm for close to twenty years is that I regularly draw on insights and ideas from other industries and other thinkers, and Lencioni is someone who continuously delivers good ideas. To cut to the chase – if I had a friend starting a law firm and he asked me to pick a single writer who would be best to read to teach him what he needed to know in starting and running his law firm successfully, I think I would pick Patrick Lencioni.

Okay – so enough buildup.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Lencioni recently wrote a book called [The Ideal Team Player: How to Recognize and Cultivate the Three Essential Virtues](http://amzn.to/1Z3wYN0). In it, he describes the ideal team player that any business would want to build on. The book is a parable and a story – like all of his books – which makes it easy reading; however, in the end he comes up with just three characteristics for the ideal team player, and the more I think on it the more I think he is “dead-on b*lls accurate” (to quote Marissa Tomei in My Cousin Vinny):

- Humble
- Hungry
- Smart
Those are the three characteristics for the ideal teammate/partner in a law firm. To dissect this a bit, Lencioni explains:

- Humility is the single greatest and most indispensable attribute of being a team player.
- Hungry people almost never have to be pushed by a manager to work harder because they are self-motivated and diligent.
- Smart simply refers to a person’s common sense about people.

And when you think about it, what do you have when someone is missing one of these key ingredients? I will tell you flat out – you have trouble!!!

Consider how much trouble a person who is not humble can cause? He can make everyone around him miserable as he consistently believes he – and only he – is the reason for the team’s success. You don’t need to watch a sports movie to know how much trouble people like this can be.

Someone who is not “hungry” results in the team being uninspired as they realize on some level – overtly or subtly – that they are just carrying this person on their backs. And the more this happens, the more resentful they become.

A person who is not “smart” in human relationships? Even worse! A politician, or inadvertent troublemaker, just pisses everyone off around him and makes everyone resentful. Indeed, sometimes one person who is not smart in human relationships can bring down the whole ecosystem around him.

But if you have these three traits, I think you really do have it all in your teammates.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
After I read the book, I thought about whether I had these traits. I thought about whether my partners, my associates, my administrative personnel have these traits. Happily I am pleased with the results of my thinking (other than wonderment about whether I am humble — I am going to ask my wife about this…).

So I thank Lencioni for writing this super-simple and insightful book and commend it to you. And, ending as I began this article, if you are running a law firm – or working in one – it is a quite valuable exercise to look around at your employees or at your peers or at your bosses (as applicable) and assess whether your teammates have these traits. Perhaps your firm might need a little reinventing if these traits are not present in your team – or – more positively – perhaps you have a great team and now all you need to do is go out and win a few games.

I always feel like I’m just saying the obvious. But sometimes the obvious needs saying.

How should you handle a client meeting?

First: Show up.

Second: On time.

Third: Prepared.

I’m startled how many times people don’t expect me to prepare — or prevent me from preparing — for meetings that we have at corporations. (“Here’s the PowerPoint deck for the meeting that begins in two minutes. I’ll talk to you then.”) At law firms, that’s far less common. If you’re going to occupy the client’s time, you should be fully prepared for the event.

Fourth: Put away your iPhone.

I’ve both heard about and witnessed lawyers responding to email messages while they’re attending meetings with clients. (One lawyer was responding to emails during a beauty contest.) This is very, very bad form. Leave your phone at home. (I know you feel naked without it, but you can do it.) Or leave it in your briefcase. At a minimum, turn the damned thing off.

The client matters. More than anything else in the world.

(Unless your house is burning. But someone will find you to tell you about that. And it’s too late, anyway.)

So give the client your undivided attention.

Really.

Fifth: Listen.

The percentage of time that you should spend listening varies with the meeting. But people frequently speak too much. I attended a beauty contest (when I was in private practice) with two of my junior partners. We were making the pitch by phone. My two partners had prepared exhaustively and were intent on impressing the client with their great ideas. But a few times during the meeting, my partners insisted on reciting their gems of wisdom (which were really pretty good) when you could tell that the client was trying to speak.

I tried to intervene: “Joe, did you have something to say?”

This is hard by telephone; you can’t see the client’s reaction. But even during a telephonic meeting, you can always pause or solicit comments.

And I’ve seen the same mistake made during in-person meetings.

If you’re trying to impress someone, let that person speak. He may have something worth hearing; at a minimum, he’s the guy you’re trying to impress, so don’t interfere.

Sixth: Don’t interrupt.

It’s rude.

I know we do it often in casual conversations, but many people are insulted by being interrupted.

Just let the person finish what she’s trying to say.

It’s not so hard.

Seventh: Speak.

The percentage of time that you should spend speaking varies with the meeting (and your status). For example, senior people should (often) speak more than junior ones. But even junior people should generally speak. You were invited to the meeting. There was probably a reason for that. Unless you were meant solely to be a note-taker (or you were invited to be sure that you were kept abreast of issues), people are presumably interested in what you have to say.

Say it.

Eighth: Speak only to the group as a whole.

Don’t get into a side discussion with the person sitting next to you.

You were called together as a group for the meeting. The group should discuss the issue. If something comes up that you should discuss with only one person privately, then have that discussion privately — after the main meeting ends.

Nine: Don’t bad-mouth the competition.

I know that opposing counsel is “the kind of lawyer who always [whatever].” Or the other firm competing for the business has some terrible blemish. Or something else.

Restrain yourself.

If you’ll bad-mouth the other guy when he’s not present, then you’ll also bad-mouth me when I’m not present.

Or I might think so.

Unless you’re sure that I won’t have that reaction, don’t bad-mouth the other guy.

Is this all common sense?

Absolutely.

Is it commonplace?

You’d be surprised.

“For the violence of relationships / Hold your head up, don’t take that sh*t, run away from it / I should’ve ran away myself, the amount of pain I was dealt.” — [Nas ](https://genius.com/23748885)

This week, I had the opportunity to interview Susie Luo, author of “[Paper Names](https://www.susieluo.com/),” on the podcast “[Charge the Wave](https://chargethewave.com/2023/05/02/susie-luo/).” Luo graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and Cornell Law School. She began her career in Biglaw and began writing her novel at night while working as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs.

“Paper Names” was published earlier this week and it has already been named a Book of the Month Club Pick for May, and a Best Book of May by “Good Morning America.” It is a Most Anticipated Book by Reader’s Digest and has been hailed as “a well-woven tale about the legacies that are passed down through generations.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It is about an unexpected act of violence that brings together a Chinese American family and a wealthy white lawyer in this propulsive and sweeping story of family, identity, and the American experience.

Set in New York and China over three decades, “Paper Names” explores what it means to be American from three perspectives. There’s Tony, a Chinese-born engineer turned Manhattan doorman, who immigrated to the United States to give his family a better life. His daughter, Tammy, who we meet at age 9 and follow through adulthood, and who grapples with the expectations of a first-generation American and her own personal desires. Finally, there’s Oliver, a handsome white lawyer with a dark family secret, who lives in the building where Tony works. A violent attack causes their lives to intertwine in ways that will change them forever.

Taut, panoramic, and powerful, “Paper Names” is an unforgettable story about the long shadows of our parents, the ripple effect of our decisions, and the ways in which our love transcends differences.

I was especially inspired by the opportunity to interview Luo during [AAPI Heritage Month](https://www.asianpacificheritage.gov/) because of the generational perspectives she covers in her writing. For anyone supporting AAPI voices and writers this month, be sure to pick up “[Paper Names](https://www.amazon.com/Paper-Names-Novel-Susie-Luo-ebook/dp/B0B5LKK8WN)” today. Without further ado, here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation:

Renwei Chung: Can you share with us a bit about your background and career voyage?

Susie Luo: Of course – and thank you for giving me the opportunity to share my journey and my novel on ATL! I was born in China, came over to America when I was 3 years old, spent some time with my family in Flushing, New York, and mostly grew up in New Jersey.

I’m a full-time writer now, but I definitely took the scenic route! After graduating from Penn, I went where every responsible political science major is supposed to go: law school. Then I moved to New York City, where I practiced as a mergers and acquisitions lawyer at Shearman & Sterling for three years before moving on to becoming an investment banker at Goldman Sachs for three years. I wrote my debut novel, “Paper Names,” during my final year at Goldman.

RC: What prompted you to write a novel?

SL: I started writing “Paper Names” in March 2020. The first month of lockdown. I don’t have to remind everyone what that time felt like. I was so grateful that we could still connect with our family and friends via FaceTime, virtual hangouts, and phone calls.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
But after a few weeks, I realized there were people in my life I wasn’t able to connect with. People like some of my doormen, the security guard outside the office, the barista who knew my coffee order. These were people who I saw more regularly than most of my friends. I missed them. And that got me thinking about what their lives looked like behind the sunny “hellos” and “good mornings.” And what a deeper friendship between someone like a doorman and a resident of a building would look like.

RC: “Paper Names” is set in New York and China, covering three decades – and tells an unforgettable story about the long shadows of our parents, the ripple effect of our decisions, and the ways in which our love transcends difference. What inspired you to tell the story from three different generational perspectives?

SL: Because sticking to one perspective would’ve been too boring for me to write! In life, people can witness the exact same situation and walk away thinking different things happened. It’s what makes humans so fascinating and so frustrating.

I wanted to show different perspectives (our distinguished trio here is Tony, Tammy, and Oliver) to reinforce the idea that we all move through the world in a way that makes sense to us, but not others. And so maybe we can give people who act or think differently from us a little grace.

In “Paper Names,” we see that Tony fiercely loves his daughter Tammy, not always in the way she wants or needs, but in the best way he knows how. And if she could take a step back and slip into his shoes, she can recognize how deep that love is.

RC: It is still so rare to see an AAPI woman protagonist featured in literary works or represented on television and the big screen. How can we ensure more of these stories are told in Hollywood and the media in general?

SL: I wish I had the solution. I think maybe one step we can take is doing away with the assumption that the audience or the acting talent for these stories aren’t there.

The AAPI community wants to watch these stories! And we will show up! Just like we did for “Shang-Chi” — which was a massive box office success and proved that even the Marvel franchise could evolve and cast diverse talent — and for “Everything Everywhere All At Once” — which started out as a smaller movie and exploded. (Fun fact: I would love Ke Huy Quan to play Tony!)

RC: The expression “Did you lose face?” and the following excerpt will be all too familiar to many of your readers. What do you hope folks who aren’t as painfully familiar with this concept takeaway from this piece of the novel?

Did you lose face? A phrase that he’d grown up with. Defended against. His father used to spit it at him at every opportunity. That one time he missed top honors in the third grade. Or when, from the stern of a small fishing boat, he struggled to drag up the net, a three-meter-long cylindrical mesh contraption that was too unwieldy for a twelve-year-old boy. Or on his sixteenth birthday, when his father read out loud a newspaper’s rejection letter of his short story. Afterward, he tore up the paper. “You wrote about a talking calculator? You just made me lose my face.”

Tony hadn’t heard that phrase since he’d left the village for college. By then, he had made himself unobjectionable. Not only was Tony brilliant — the top engineering student at the Dalian University of Technology — but he also played basketball. A rare meld of brawn and brains in China. Girls hung around the court after his games, hoping for some attention. They all knew he was going places. Everyone — from his professors to his roommates — knew he was special.

SL: Shame is a universal experience. We’re all at the mercy of it. And I wanted to show readers that even someone who looks wildly accomplished on the outside — whether that be Tammy, a brilliant young lawyer; or Oliver, a handsome scion; or Tony, who buys his dream house — can feel that acute ache. They can all fear judgment — or the nagging thought that they’re not good enough.

I hope that the next time readers feel that sinking feeling of shame, they find compassion for themselves, and realize that at that precise moment, many people are feeling the same way. We can let shame isolate us or we can let the shared experience connect us.

RC: I noted numerous references to food as a language of love throughout the book? Can you share more about this theme?

SL: Dumplings! Sesame balls. Biang Biang noodles. Did I just make you hungry?

Making food for someone is such a caring act, and especially for low-income families, it’s an important way to show love. Parents can’t always afford to buy their children the coolest toy on the market (which was, of course, Barbie’s driveable Jeep), but they can put time and effort into making them their favorite meal.

This theme of making food to express love was just another way to show that it’s these caring acts that mean far more than money ever will. Money isn’t everything — and when it comes to love, it could actually mean nothing.

RC: Can you share some of the other underlying narratives interwoven throughout?

SL: One underlying narrative is about the little things we experience that inspire us to do the big things. When Tammy has that small interaction with the lady at the nail salon, it kicked off her desire to become a lawyer. Or when Tammy offhandedly says that something is “cool,” it propels Tony to go outside of his comfort zone and pose alongside a movie star for a magazine cover. We often think it’s the big moments that make us change our lives, but I wanted to show that more often, it’s the small moments that change our heart.

Another narrative that I explore in “Paper Names” is what I call “performative goodness.” Oliver does “good” things — he talks to his doormen about their families, he’s extra nice to the waitress, and he runs marathons for charity. But when Oliver does these things, he’s doing mental math. He’s calculating the cost of doing that thing versus how much benefit he’ll receive.

On the other hand, there are times when the best of humanity surges up in an instant. When Tony sees someone who needs help, he immediately sprints to her aid, even though it puts him in harm’s way. This begs the questions: how much of our goodness is strategic and selfish, how much is instinctual, and what’s in between?

RC: Any advice for someone wanting to balance a legal career with a creative side hustle?

SL: Just give it a try! It’s easy to think of a project as having to climb an entire mountain, when it’s really about putting one foot in front of the other. If I thought of writing as publishing a perfectly polished book, I might never have started. But I thought of it as writing 250 words a day, and then 1,000 words a week, and then a chapter a week.

It’s much easier to balance a creative endeavor with a legal career by taking those small steps, and one day, you might find it blooming into something much larger.

RC: What do you think will surprise readers about “Paper Names”?

SL: “Paper Names” is an AAPI book, but it’s not *just* an AAPI book. It’s a book for everyone. It’s full of sweet surprises and twists, and I guarantee you won’t see the ending coming!

# So You Want to Lead Your Firm? Be Careful.

Global Chair. Head of Litigation. Office Managing Partner. Those are some nice sounding titles, right? In a profession that emphasizes prestige and status, it isn’t surprising that many high-achieving partners aspire to lead their firms. For a partner who has achieved success at each rung of the Biglaw hierarchy, the pinnacle of leadership may seem like a natural next conquest. But if you’re in a position to reach that pinnacle, you should ask yourself two questions before accepting the appointment. First, why do I want this job? Second, is the timing right?

Realities of law firm leadership

Successful law firm partners are accustomed to interacting with powerful corporate executives. Watching their clients run companies or in-house legal departments naturally encourages some lawyers to think, “hey, I could do that!” And what better way to prove it than by chairing their firm?

It’s important to recognize that the power wielded by a Managing Partner is materially different from that of a CEO. Companies are fundamentally hierarchical organizations, and although the most effective CEOs will inspire employees to align with the CEO’s vision, the reality is that a CEO can act unilaterally where necessary. Reporting lines are clearly delineated, and team members who resist directives from senior leadership are unlikely to last long. Moreover, employees who quit are rarely in a position to take a substantial portion of the company’s business with them.

Compared to a CEO, a Biglaw Chair is generally in a weaker position to drive change unilaterally. We can all think of examples of exceptionally powerful Managing Partners—often these are founders of their firms with their names on the letterhead. But in the more typical case of a partner who rises up the ranks to assume the role of Chair, the experience of leadership is more herding cats than giving orders. Partners are owners, and they feel entitled to a real say in the firm’s direction. This is especially true of the rainmakers, whose power is reinforced by their ever-present ability to take their book of business elsewhere. In contrast to the efficiencies of hierarchical corporate structures, law firm leadership entails a slower, more collaborative and constrained process.

Another notable difference between CEOs and Biglaw Chairs is that Biglaw leaders frequently are not the highest paid members of their firms. CEOs are generally assumed to have outsized responsibility for the financial performance of their companies, and their outsized compensation reflects this. In a law firm, the dynamic is different. A Managing Partner plays an important role in ensuring smooth operation of the firm, but revenue is generally credited principally to the decentralized business development efforts of individual partners. (Recall the analogy we recently drew between [law firm partners and franchise owners](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/biglaw-partners-should-think-like-franchise-owners/).) Outsized compensation is earned through rainmaking, not through leading the firm in an administrative capacity.

Before agreeing to become Chair, you would be wise to take a step back and reflect on why you aspire to firm leadership. It is a challenging job, and compared to practicing full time, you aren’t likely to earn a premium for assuming a top leadership post. Make sure you look beyond the title when assessing the desirability of these roles.

Pitfalls of an early rise to the top

Presuming you are under no illusions about what leadership will entail and you have decided that you want the role, the second critical issue is timing. Star partners often ascend to the top of their firms as soon as the opportunity presents itself. This makes perfect sense on one level—who knows if you’ll get a second chance at a later date? But if you are offered the opportunity to lead your firm as a mid-career partner, it’s important to think through the potential pitfalls.

The main risk is that you’ll come to the end of your leadership tenure and will be poorly positioned to resume your practice. If you expect chairing the firm to be your last job, you don’t have to worry about giving up your book of business. But if you take on the leadership role as a mid-career partner, with the expectation of practicing for another decade on the back end, you need to be mindful of the difficulties of reintegrating into full-time practice.

The nature of the risk depends on whether the Managing Partner role is a full-time job. If you are expected to devote your full attention to leadership, you will necessarily have to hand over your practice to other partners. And if you do that, you shouldn’t expect to get it back several years down the line. Transitions of this sort tend to be sticky: by the time you return to the scene, your clients will be accustomed to dealing with those other partners and may not see a benefit in switching back to you. In an era in which firms increasingly prioritize profitability above all, you will struggle to return to your pre-leadership position of strength without a robust book of business.

If your firm expects you to continue to practice part-time while in leadership, the risk of losing your client relationships is mitigated, but your practice may still be impaired. Your competitors will be focused solely on building their books, whereas you will be distracted by your firmwide responsibilities. Remember: fancy titles are nice, but your long-term value to the firm derives from your ability to grow and maintain your practice.

You should assume that taking on the Chair role is effectively a retirement plan. If that makes you uncomfortable, it’s probably best to delay the job for now.

# Furloughed Biglaw Associate Charged In New York Molotov Cocktail Attack
## He was furloughed in April as part of the firm's COVID-19 response.

Although states have slowly but surely started to reopen in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, the nation has been in a state of unrest following the officer-involved killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020, with mass protests breaking out across the country in response to police brutality and racism. Unfortunately, some of these peaceful gatherings have turned into riot situations, with looting and other acts of aggression taking the place of meaningful marches across America. One of those who stands accused of taking part in these violent crimes is a Biglaw associate, or we should say a possibly former Biglaw associate — one who was furloughed earlier this spring thanks to the COVID-19 outbreak.

[Colinford Mattis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colinfordmattis/), 32, stands accused of damaging New York City Police Department vehicles with Molotov cocktails during a Brooklyn protest this past weekend. Mattis was allegedly behind the wheel of a van while his passenger, Urooj Rahman, 31, a 2019 graduate of Fordham University School of Law who’s been identified as a human rights lawyer, allegedly threw an incendiary device at an unoccupied NYPD vehicle.

According to his LinkedIn profile, Mattis is a 2010 graduate of Princeton University and a 2016 graduate of NYU School of Law. Mattis is a member of Pryor Cashman’s Corporate Group, but he was [furloughed in April](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firm-furloughs-associates-firm-hopeful-they-can-return-to-work-soon/?rf=1) as part of the firm’s austerity measures against the pandemic. His profile page was removed from the firm’s website yesterday afternoon. Mattis’s employment status with the firm is currently under review in light of these criminal charges. Here’s a statement from the firm:

“While we were already living in fraught times, the terrible situation around the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis has added painful stress to our lives,” [managing partner Ronald] Shechtman said. “As we confront critical issues around historic and ongoing racism and inequity in our society, I am saddened to see this young man allegedly involved in the worst kind of reaction to our shared outrage over what had occurred.”

Mattis and Rahman will appear today in the Eastern District of New York.

# Ethics And AI For Corporate Counsel
## Corporate counsels should take a proactive approach to understand the legal risks associated with AI.

As artificial intelligence continues to develop and evolve, businesses are becoming more and more aware of the potential implications of this transformative technology. The spread of AI is raising various complex legal questions — from data privacy concerns to impact on antitrust law — that corporate counsel must be prepared to address.

Data Privacy And Cybersecurity

Businesses need to be aware that AI systems can rapidly process immense amounts of data, leading to potential data privacy and cybersecurity issues. Since these systems can quickly identify patterns in user behavior and gain insights into confidential information, businesses must be mindful of the data they are collecting and how it is being used. Any unauthorized access or use of this data could constitute a data breach or violate applicable privacy regulations.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In addition, businesses must also recognize that AI systems can be subject to bias or discrimination. For example, if an AI system is trained on biased data, it may produce inaccurate results by treating certain groups of people differently. Businesses should ensure that their AI systems are tested for potential bias to avoid discrimination-related legal issues.

Antitrust And Contract Law

When it comes to antitrust law, businesses need to be aware that specific AI algorithms may be considered anti-competitive if used to manipulate pricing or limit competition in a specific market. Businesses should consult with their legal counsel before deploying any AI systems that may have the potential to be anti-competitive.

In terms of contract law, all contracts involving AI systems must be reviewed and updated regularly to keep up with the rapidly changing legal landscape. Businesses should also be aware of applicable laws or regulations when drafting these contracts.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Even though the legal implications of AI are still evolving, corporate counsel should be prepared to address any potential issues and ensure that their businesses remain compliant with applicable laws. By proactively addressing legal issues associated with AI, businesses can avoid costly litigation and ensure the integrity of their data and systems.

Possible Implications

Since AI affects a wide range of areas, corporate counsel needs a comprehensive understanding of the applicable laws and regulations to advise their businesses properly. Corporate counsel must also stay up to date with any changes in the legal landscape so that they are prepared to guide on any issues that arise and protect their interests by ensuring compliance.

Lastly, businesses need to be mindful of the potential implications of employment law when using AI. For example, businesses using an AI system to evaluate resumes or candidate interviews should consider the potential for biased hiring decisions resulting from this method. Businesses should also ensure that any AI systems used in the workplace comply with applicable labor laws and regulations.

# Greenberg Traurig Explains Why It's Too Cheap To Raise Associate Salaries
## Google tells me that Traurig is German for ""sad, unhappy, sorrowful, miserable.”

Greenberg Traurig, fresh off of [divesting itself of the laughable Rudy Giuliani](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/greenberg-traurig-throws-rudy-giuliani-under-the-bus-right-quick/), has seen the associate raises… and decided to check out. It does not want its associates to pass Go and collect two hundred dollars. It wants everybody to WAKE UP, and it apparently thinks that a minor cost-of-living adjustment like the one offered by Milbank [and other firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises-2018/) is courting disaster.

Firm chairman Richard Rosenbaum explained his thought process over on [Bloomberg in Biglaw Business](https://biglawbusiness.com/raising-associates-to-190k-the-economy-is-lulling-law-firm-leaders-to-sleep/).

The good economy is lulling law firm management to sleep when leaders should keep the sense of urgency required to deliver innovation and value to clients.

Actions like adjusting salaries on an across-the-board basis are evidence of this. In a realistic, albeit optimistic, environment, these decisions should be, as they are for us, individualized, local, and tailored to what is best for the client, the associate, and the firm. Associates in many firms will end up frustrated due to enormous workload hours when work is there and intense pressure to bill when work ultimately slows down due to market conditions. Clients and partners in many firms will be unhappy with the pressure on rates to pay for these decisions. And for a number of firms who are following along with the rate increase because they think they must, it will hit partners in the pocket, because the practices at those firms don’t justify higher rates.

Somebody should put this guy in a pamphlet titled: “Why Trickle-Down Economics Is Always A Sucker’s Bet.”

The last part of Rosenbaum’s statement is undoubtedly true: associate raises will hit partners “in the pocket” if they can’t also increase billing rates. That’s obvious. It sure sounds like Rosenbaum doesn’t think his partners can justify higher billing rates, but I’m sure he’ll play it off by suggesting that he just wrote a whole column out of the goodness of his heart to look out for the little guy.

Really, it’s the first part of the paragraph that is most insulting, and/or is evidence that Rosenbaum thinks his audience is stupid. Associates will feel “frustrated due to enormous workload hours when work is there and intense pressure to bill when work ultimately slows down.” Umm… THAT IS ALREADY THE LIFE OF EVERY BIGLAW ASSOCIATE. Rosenbaum offers no argument or evidence for why an associate making $190K will feel this pressure, but an associate making $180K will not!

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Who the hell does he think he’s talking to? Is there even one Greenberg Traurig associate who wants to come forward to say “Man, I’m really happy I’m making less money here than I could be at Milbank, the intense pressure to bill is not for me.”

From there, Rosenbaum devolves into purely masturbatory rhetoric:

For us, our highest priorities remain excellence, delivering value and innovation and maintaining a wind-proof culture based on individual respect, trust, empowerment, and collaboration. Change can be empowering, but not when it is simply based on what the “pack” is doing rather than a solid strategy which is grounded in our core values. For over 50 years, we have found our best opportunities in change; it has allowed our firm to be diverse, entrepreneurial, nimble, and responsive over the years. But we do not base our changes on the whims of the marketplace or ill-advised, so-called experts.

Wind-proof culture? Really? Does Rosenbaum have an application in to be a writer on Billions that I don’t know about?

Whatever. Bottom line, Greenberg Traurig [laid off associates during the law recession](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/11/nationwide-layoff-watch-greenberg-traurig-tells-real-estate-associates-to-take-a-long-weekend/), it [laid off staff](https://www.law.com/dailybusinessreview/almID/1202553129646) during the Obama recovery, and it will likely lay off attorneys when the Trump recession hits, whenever that glorious day comes.

And it’ll probably follow along with the salary raises, once Cravath and the rest of its competitors do.

Hanging out there like a flaccid sock does not make you “wind-proof,” it just makes you a wet blanket.

What could be better for a Biglaw firm than bringing in record revenue? Bringing in record revenue for 10 consecutive years!

Over the course of the past decade, the U.S. economy has seen many ups and downs, with extreme turbulence in recent years thanks to the pandemic — but Greenberg Traurig has been posting promising revenues, against all odds.

The elite firm — which brought in $2,171,720,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 14 in the most recent Am Law 100 — recently announced its 2023 financial results, and the firm is quite likely to move up the rankings. As noted by [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/greenberg-traurig-hits-10th-consecutive-year-of-record-revenue), Greenberg Traurig brought in $2.3 billion gross revenue in 2023, a 6% increase over 2022’s numbers.

[Richard A. Rosenbaum](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/professionals/r/rosenbaum-richard-a), Greenberg Traurig’s executive chairman, offered the following statement on the firm’s success:

“Our consistent, record-breaking financial performance over the past decade of change and disruption underscores the resilience of Greenberg Traurig’s platform and business model, as well as our uniquely diversified set of clients, talent, practices, industries, and locations, across the U.S. and the world.”

Congratulations to Greenberg Traurig on another record-breaking year!

Once you are in a big, white-shoe law firm and you’re forced to leave, you are out of sync. The likelihood of getting another job at a big firm is slim to none. This has really derailed her career.

— [Jo Anne Simon](http://joannesimon.com/staff/jo-anne-simon/), attorney for [Tamara Wyche](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamara-a-wyche/), commenting on the [trials and tribulations her client has suffered](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202799184651/ExBig-Law-Associate-Who-Flunked-Bar-Can-Proceed-With-Suit-Against-Examiners?mcode=1202617075486&curindex=3&curpage=ALL) ever since being forced out of [Ropes & Gray](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/ropes-gray-llp/) after twice failing the New York bar exam. Wyche, a graduate of Harvard Law, filed suit against the New York Board of Law Examiners in 2016, alleging it was the [denial of testing accommodations](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/06/14/harvard-grad-who-flunked-bar-sues-over-loss-of-big-law-job/) that she received in law school that caused her to fail the bar exam and lose her job. She has worked in [temporary attorney and contract positions](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202799184651/ExBig-Law-Associate-Who-Flunked-Bar-Can-Proceed-With-Suit-Against-Examiners?mcode=1202617075486&curindex=3&curpage=ALL) since she was fired. Wyche recently found out that she may proceed with parts of her suit against the BOLE to allow for discovery into whether New York’s sovereign immunity bars her claims.

# Another Biglaw Firm Withdraws From Election Litigation (No, Not Jones Day)
## Another chip in Donald Trump's 'the courts will give me the election' strategy.

Who says some good, old-fashioned pressure doesn’t work?

Just a few days after a New York Times [article blowing up](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/even-jones-day-lawyers-are-giving-trumps-election-lawsuits-some-serious-side-eye/) Jones Day and Porter Wright over their election litigation representations, Porter Wright has decided to bow out of their representation of the Donald Trump campaign in the legal battle contesting the results of the election in Pennsylvania, saying:

Plaintiffs and Porter Wright have reached a mutual agreement that Plaintiffs will be best served if Porter Wright withdraws, and current co-counsel and such other counsel as Plaintiffs may choose to engage represent Plaintiffs in this case. Plaintiffs are in the process of retaining and causing other counsel to enter an appearance herein.

This comes after a firestorm of controversy that saw Porter Wright, and other firm’s representing the president and/or his allies in election litigation like Jones Day, be accused of undermining American democracy. PACs [like Lincoln Project](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/jones-day-to-prepare-for-a-bad-pr-campaign-the-likes-of-which-theyve-never-seen-before/) and[ MeidasTouch](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/you-have-to-watch-the-opening-salvo-in-the-anti-jones-day-ad-campaign) are going after these big firms for trying to undo the free and fair election in courts, and though Porter Wright has not issued a statement on their withdrawal, it seems like it all got to be too much.

They aren’t the first Biglaw firm to ditch their election work — Snell & Wilmer also withdrew from election litigation (in Arizona). And it seems it was just in the nick of time, as[ MeidasTouch revealed they were ready to launch attack ads](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/biglaw-firm-withdraws-from-election-litigation-before-they-get-jones-day-ed/) against Snell before they withdrew.

Giant firm Jones Day is still representing the Pennsylvania GOP in their election litigation. But I wouldn’t expect them to back out any time soon. Their [response to the controversy](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/yesterday-was-the-day-america-learned-what-weve-known-about-jones-day-all-along/) thus far has been to double down on their representation.

Read the motion to withdraw below.

Rapid advancements in generative AI are just the latest seismic event in these interesting times.

Still, a lot of people seem to think this is an especially big deal for the legal profession and business world. 

Since we aren’t sure where this could ultimately go — beyond an expectation of “big changes” — we thought we’d poll our audience for insights into what you all think. 

Please take a few moments to take our (always) brief, (always) anonymous survey on generative AI. 

We can promise you one thing: It won’t involve any surprise chatbot text. (Or will it?)

# 5 Surprising Insights From The US Treasury Department’s Study Of The Global Art NFT Trade
## The study doesn’t shy away from acknowledging the darker sides of the market.

The U.S. Treasury’s recent [study on the global art trade](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Treasury_Study_WoA.pdf) has provided an insightful look at the inner workings of the art market, the regulations currently in place, and emerging areas potentially in need of additional regulation. The study doesn’t shy away from acknowledging the darker sides of the market, taking the time to debunk some myths and misconceptions about art crime and money laundering.

- The study found that most art market participants are not compelled by federal regulations. While most art market participants were not subject to any federal regulations related to tracking money and how it is used, many people choose to do so voluntarily. In fact, these voluntary practices are slowly becoming the norms in the industry.
- The study also found that inaccurate claims about the art market create risk and the perception that the market is unregulated. Inaccurate claims about the art market create risk because they make it look like no one is watching the market. That, in turn, attracts criminals wanting to use the market to launder money.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
- The study found that there is a difference between art crime and crimes perpetrated through art. There are important distinctions between art crimes and crimes that use art to launder money. Art crime, for example, might just entail stealing a painting from a museum. If someone uses a fake painting to launder the proceeds of a drug deal, however, that’s a crime that was perpetrated through art.
- The study also recognized the need for a higher threshold for art market transactions. When it comes to taxes, the IRS already has a rule that someone buying or selling a work of art worth $50,000 or more must provide extra information. The study suggested that something similar should be in place for all art market transactions.
- Lastly, the study found that information sharing between art market participants is crucial for countering money laundering and other financial crimes. In stressing that it’s important for everyone in the art market to share information, the study pointed out the benefit of everyone being able to recognize and report suspicious activities.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Overall, the U.S. Treasury Department’s study of the global art trade found that, while many art market participants voluntarily maintain AML/CFT programs, more regulation is necessary to prevent crime perpetrated through the market.

Ultimately, the study called for a higher threshold for reporting suspicious activity in the art market, a proposal meant to protect both the market and those who participate in it.

What role do you think the government should play in ensuring the consistency, security, and integrity of the art market?

# The Latest Considerations For Supply Chain Agreements 
## The first line of defense against unforeseen loss is tightly drafted contracts prepared by well-equipped attorneys.

One of the largest business impacts of the pandemic has been the interruptions to the global supply chain that have hit nearly every sector, from electronics to wine production — and even baby formula.

While supply chain issues first started making news in 2020, they continue to grab headlines two years later.

As a result, many companies and their lawyers are rethinking their business strategies in an attempt to address potential supply chain issues and curb future financial uncertainty.

The first line of defense against unforeseen loss and risks of liability for any company is tightly drafted contracts prepared by well-equipped attorneys. PLI’s half-day program, [Supply Chain Agreements 2022: Manufacturing and Market Disruption](https://www.pli.edu/programs/supply-chain-agreements-manufacturing-trade-wars-and-covid-19?t=live?tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2), will provide the basic building blocks for attorneys dealing with negotiating, drafting, or advising on manufacturing, supply, and distribution agreements.  

The program will touch on key supply chain-related issues, including:

- The causes and extent of current supply chain disruptions
- How material shortages, tariffs, trade wars, workforce issues, freight and shipping issues, and port delays are impacting supply chain contracts
- What manufacturing companies are doing to mitigate losses and recover from disruptions
- Key contract terms related to sustainability
- How to develop contracting strategies for mitigating sustainability-related risks
- Tips for negotiating agreements from both the buy and sell sides
- What to expect from manufacturing markets in 2022
Any in-house, litigation, or transactional attorney involved in advising on manufacturing, supply, and distribution contracts needs to be aware of these developments. For the most up-to-date insights on factors  impacting supply chain agreements, [register today](https://www.pli.edu/programs/supply-chain-agreements-manufacturing-trade-wars-and-covid-19?t=live?tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2).

Looks like Chadbourne & Parke will be getting hitched, and taking their partner’s (firm) name. Today they announced a merger with Norton Rose Fulbright, and the combined firm will be known as Norton Rose Fulbright.

News of the merger began making rounds earlier this month, but, [according to](http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/home/id=1202779548573) the New York Law Journal, now it’s official. The combined firm will have approximately 1,000 lawyers, and the powers that be at the two firms are making the appropriately complimentary noises about the upcoming nuptials:

“Chadbourne has a proud history, and is known for its world class practices in energy, infrastructure, banking and finance,” [Peter Martyr, Norton Rose Fulbright’s global chief executive] said in a statement. “Joining forces with our new colleagues, we can offer our clients significant new capabilities in New York and Washington, D.C. We will benefit from new offices in Mexico City, São Paulo and Istanbul, and we will be able to offer our clients expanded capabilities in London, Dubai, Latin America and other key markets.”

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Andrew Giaccia, Chadbourne’s managing partner, said in a statement that the firms shared the same strategic goals. “Following the combination, our global offerings will be virtually unrivalled in many areas, from energy and infrastructure to finance, bankruptcy and restructuring, litigation and regulatory work,” he said.

Reports indicate Norton Rose wasn’t the only potential partner on Chadbourne’s list, they’ve been scoping out potential merger partners for about a year:

Sources close to Chadbourne say that the firm had approached firms including Baker McKenzie, DLA Piper and Hogan Lovells to discuss merger options over the last year, before settling on a deal with Norton Rose Fulbright.

Chadbourne has seen a stream of partner exits recently, including corporate and project finance partner Margarita Oliva Sainz de Aja, who joined Baker McKenzie last month; a three-partner arbitration team that joined Cooley last December; and bankruptcy partner Douglas Deutsch, who joined Clifford Chance last summer.

Chadbourne can now close their law firm Tinder account. Though, really, you should never close your Tinder account because it’s worth it to check in to see what [desperate](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/02/law-firm-merger-mania-fulbright-and-pillsbury-are-talking/), [revealing](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/pillsbury-winthrop-and-chadbourne-parke-call-off-merger-talks/) [selfie](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/11/orrick-and-pillsbury-call-the-whole-thing-off/) Pillsbury Winthrop’s using for its profile these days.

For many young (and not-so-young) lawyers, working as in-house counsel is a professional promised land. And even if this view might be somewhat idealized, one can understand the attractions of life as corporate counsel: no billable hours, the ability to focus on serving a single client, the opportunity to learn more about the business world, and (generally) more reasonable hours than Biglaw.

Because the demand for good in-house legal jobs among a certain sector of the legal profession exceeds the supply, these jobs can be very hard to get. I have previously offered my [three tips for the in-house job search](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/3-tips-for-the-in-house-job-search/), but they’re just general pointers; there’s so much more to the process.

So how can you land a great in-house gig? And how can you do a great job once you’re there?

To get answers to those questions from an expert, I recently spoke by phone with [David Stiepleman](https://www.sixthstreetspecialtylending.com/about/team/dstiepleman), a cofounding partner of [Sixth Street Partners](https://sixthstreetpartners.com/). After graduating from Columbia Law School and working at Cleary Gottlieb, David worked as an in-house lawyer at Goldman Sachs and Fortress Investment Group, en route to his current role as co-president and COO of a global investment business with approximately $34 billion in assets under management.

Here’s a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation.

DL: You’ve had an accomplished career, starting off in Biglaw and winding up as a business builder. Many lawyers would love a professional path like yours, including stints at a top law firm, top investment bank, and top fund manager, culminating in helping start a multibillion-dollar business as its COO. Can you begin by telling us a bit about your journey?

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
DS: When I started out as a summer associate at Cleary Gottlieb, I didn’t know what I wanted to do. In the summer of 1996, the firm sent me to Ireland for two weeks, where I tried to follow along watching a senior lawyer do a deal. It was a great experience — figuring out what the parties wanted, how to reconcile their divergent interests, and how to get a deal done. I saw that and thought: I can do this. And it was a relief, finding something that I really wanted to do.

DL: So you spent five years at Cleary as an M&A generalist, learning about different industries and working on different deals, and you were doing well. How -– and why -– did you make the jump in-house?

DS: I got the opportunity to spend time at Goldman Sachs through a secondment, and after a few months, the Goldman folks said to me, “Why don’t you stay?”

I had expected to return to Cleary, but at that point I had an “a-ha” moment. I thought to myself: this job is so much fun, I deal with 16 different topics in a day, there are so many smart people here, and it’s busy and crazy and intense. But at the end of the day, I can go home and have dinner with my family, while great outside lawyers do the work that I used to do. So I stayed.

I became the lead counsel of the Americas Special Situations Group, which is where I first worked with my partner Alan Waxman, who led the business and who would later get our core group back together at Sixth Street. This is when I really started getting into building a business, helping grow the Special Situations Group within Goldman.

DL: And then you continued to move toward the business side of things.

DS: Yes. In 2007 I went to Fortress, where among other things one of my mandates was going to Japan to help a new team build a real estate business. I had no prior experience working in Japan or building a real estate business, but we figured things out. And it was really fun.

Then in 2010, I got a call from Alan, who said he wanted to get the band back together to rebuild the Special Situations group as part of TPG. I said to him that I’m a New Yorker, I can’t move to California. But my wife said take the meeting.

I took the meeting, and then the job, and that was over 10 years ago. We founded Sixth Street, which fortunately thrived — and which now after our [recent deal with TPG](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200501005457/en/TPG-Sixth-Street-Partners-Announce-Completion-Agreement) is a completely independent business.

DL: Over the course of your career, as both a lawyer and a business executive, you have hired many in-house lawyers. What do you look for when building a legal department?

DS: For in-house roles, you need nimble lawyers who can migrate from one field to the next and who are comfortable with change. As investors, if we find an opportunity, it will only last for a certain period of time –- so we need to be nimble to take advantage of it.

At Sixth Street, we have a predilection for M&A generalists. We find that they have the nimbleness and the skill set we need, which is all about managing risk. Over the years, we have brought in some very talented senior M&A associates from firms who have grown with Sixth Street. One lawyer who came out of a New York firm and has been with us for five-plus years became our general counsel earlier this year.

That’s our model: take people who are good lawyers with good skill sets, and get them to become cross-disciplinary and comfortable with things they may not have done before.

DL: When do you think you went from being a “lawyer” to being a “businessperson”?

DS: It was an evolution, not a specific moment in time. I realized that I was clinging to certain aspects of my identity –- for example, “I’m a lawyer,” or “I’m a New Yorker” –- that I didn’t necessarily need to cling to.

By the time we were starting Sixth Street, not only was I fine with not being a lawyer, but having and using those business-building skills was an imperative. As a small team starting a new business, everyone had to go outside their comfort zone and be OK taking the lead on new things, and that’s something we’ve focused on keeping as we’ve grown.

DL: As a former in-house lawyer and a business executive who works with many in-house lawyers, what advice would you give to in-house lawyers? And what mistakes get made?

DS: First, work for a company and for people you can really get behind. Knowing that your internal clients care about the right things is crucial. Since we had all worked together before, I knew that our partner group would do our best not only to invest well but also explicitly to want to make the right decisions, the ethical decisions.

In investing, there are ways to make money that aren’t super-great. We don’t want to be in a situation where we are underwriting to some misunderstanding or some “gotcha” point hidden in a deal.

Second, get your reps. Know how to conduct yourself as a professional and as a lawyer. Don’t go in-house too early and think you can just wing it. Reach a point where you can be useful and commercial.

What’s valuable is someone who can perform pattern recognition. If you’ve only seen six deals, and they’ve all been bond offerings, that’s not a good fit, at least not for us. Try to get broad experience, so even if you come across a type of deal you’ve not done before, you can figure it out by comparing it to something you have done.

Third, learn how to manage your time. Law firms and law schools don’t teach this. There’s too much to do, and if you try to do everything, you’ll do none of it well. Figure out what’s important and what outside resources you need, and get them to do those things.

[For more advice from David Stiepleman to corporate counsel, see this excellent memo, [Who the Best In-House Lawyers Are](https://sixthstreetpartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Best-in-house-counsel_-D-Stiepleman-June-2020.pdf).]

DL: So that brings up the subject of outside counsel. What advice do you have for external counsel? And are there any “pet peeves” of yours when it comes to your outside law firms?

DS: First, if you’re representing us, we want you to care about this deal or project like it’s your own business. We want you, at least to some degree, driving yourself a little bit nuts thinking about the risks, looking around corners — not just pumping out documents, but thinking about substantive issues. We want to partner with law firms that are helping us manage risk.

Second, we want firms that understand the importance of teamwork. You’re colleagues; talk about and think through things together. Don’t just tell me to go talk to so-and-so at your firm. Talk to so-and-so yourself and work on our issues collaboratively.

A pet peeve of mine: law firm partners who always say, no matter what, “We definitely do that.” Really? Have you done it before? How many times have you done it before? With what results?

There’s nothing wrong with tackling a unique or novel legal problem, but you need to be honest about your expertise and whether you’re the right firm or lawyer for the job. We really appreciate hearing, “We aren’t the best at this, but we can introduce you to the experts.” That’s the spirit of partnership we value.

DL: Let’s turn to current events. Today’s environment, in which so many people are working remotely, presents challenges in terms of running a business. Can you talk about how you’re navigating this?

DS: Our priorities have been safety — of our own people, as well as the whole community — and making sure our business continues to run seamlessly.

With everyone scattered, our focus turned to doubling down on relentless, nonstop communication, as we tried to spot risks and opportunities across our business. We went from standing meetings to more frequent communication, in quicker bursts. We also have a proprietary platform for communicating that everyone feeds information into, which has been an advantage in this environment.

DL: Also regarding recent events, I saw the very [thoughtful and heartfelt note](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/note-sixth-street-community-david-stiepleman/?trackingId=NMcME1ndTzqnb%2F1gJgTqnw%3D%3D) you sent within Sixth Street in the wake of the horrific killing of George Floyd, which itself came after the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. What was your thinking in making this communication and sharing it beyond Sixth Street?

DS: Because it was the right thing to do. As a group of partners, we have diverse views on many things, but there was no disagreement on this. We’ve been sickened by what we’ve been seeing, and we wanted to make sure our people knew that — not just our black professionals or professionals of color, but everyone who is a part of our diverse workforce of almost 300 professionals around the world.

We wanted to stand up and be counted and for our ecosystem — including our external lawyers and everyone else — to know about our culture, our values, and what we stand for.

We’ve been exploring ways to address the problem of underrepresentation in our industry for some time. Two years ago, a number of us across Sixth Street started working with Sean Mendy and his team at Concrete Rose, which is an early-stage investing business focused on underrepresented founders and talent. They’re building a great platform, and we’re confident you’ll be hearing a lot more about them over the next decade.

At Sixth Street, our culture is the most important thing to us. It’s the hardest thing to maintain, it’s what makes us a great place to work, and it also helps us hopefully invest and manage risk well. We are focused on maintaining an open, collaborative, respectful culture, where people think like owners and act with integrity. That’s what we are all about.

DL: Well stated. Congratulations on your success and the success of Sixth Street, David, and thank you for taking the time!

# Biglaw Firm Announces Bonuses Up To $30,000 Over Market Rates -- If The Billable Hours Are Right
## Busy associates are generously rewarded here!

January is rapidly rolling to a close, but that doesn’t mean the curtain has closed on Biglaw bonus season. Consistent with past practices, on Friday, WilmerHale announced their year-end bonuses.

The bonuses at the firm are tied to billable hours — 1,900 hours to get any year-end bonus and 2,000 to hit market bonuses. But, for those who had a particularly busy year, bonuses can be quite lucrative. As detailed in the chart below, associates could see up to $30,000 over market bonuses ([memo available on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/wilmerhale-2020-bonuses/2/)).

According to sources at the firm, 85 percent of attorneys received a bonus this year and 35 percent got above market bonuses for hitting 2,200+ hours.

But that’s not the end of bonus news at WilmerHale. Like so many Biglaw firms, they giving out special bonuses this year for associates’ hard work during the challenging year that was 2020. Full market special bonuses kick in at 1,900 hours, but everyone is eligible for some special bonus money.



And tipsters at the firm seem pleased with the firm’s bonuses:

# Will Associates Take Advantage Of These Innovative Parental Leave Policies?
## Believe it or not, your law firms want you to take advantage of the parental leave they're offering -- without consequences.

If you look back just 10 years, it would not have been even a thought that this would happen. It’s not enough to have these policies. You really have to stand behind them and encourage your associates to take advantage of them.

— [Regine Corrado](http://www.bakermckenzie.com/RegineCorrado/), a partner at [Baker & McKenzie](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/baker-mckenzie/) who leads the firm’s [North America Women’s Initiative](http://www.bakermckenzie.com/womensinitiatives/), commenting on the firm’s [parental leave policy](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202758457125/Firms-Offer-More-Parental-Leave-But-Will-Associates-Take-It?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=1&curpage=ALL). Baker & McKenzie currently offers 18 weeks of paid leave for primary caregivers and six weeks for secondary caregivers. Corrado says the number of parents who have taken advantage of the firm’s secondary caregivers policy [has increased since it was rolled out in March of 2014](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202758457125/Firms-Offer-More-Parental-Leave-But-Will-Associates-Take-It?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=1&curpage=ALL), which is an “extremely positive development.” Corrado says firm leaders have made it clear that they really want associates to take the full leave time that is offered to them in order to bond with their children.

The managing partner of the Belgium office of international law firm Baker McKenzie, [Daniel Fesler](https://www.bakermckenzie.com/en/people/f/fesler-daniel), has, temporarily, stepped down from his leadership role. The firm confirmed the move as they complete an internal investigation into claims of racism at the firm.

The allegations stem from a departure memo from an attorney at the firm which details a variety of problematic incidents. As [reported by](https://www.legalcheek.com/2023/02/baker-mckenzie-belgium-managing-partner-steps-down-pending-review-into-office-racism-claims/) Legal Cheek:

The mixed-race lawyer, who we have not named, alleges a series of discriminatory incidents took place during her time at the firm, which include colleagues using the “N word”, touching her hair, and questioning whether a family photo was “a rap album cover”.

She also says she was “yelled at” by a staff member for reporting the use of “blackface” during a traditional “Sinterklass” event and that her work email address indicated only part of her surname as “it would otherwise be confusing for clients”.

The N-word? Blackface?? Touching her hair??? None of this sounds good, indeed, it reads like Racism 4 Dummies.

Baker McKenzie has issued a statement apologizing for the attorney’s experience, and committing to completing the investigation with “immediate priority.” Kirsty Wilson, the firm’s global inclusion, diversity & equity committee chair, said, “We are very sorry and sincerely regret that this individual, and any colleague, has had this experience. We do not tolerate racism, sexism or any form of discrimination, and we take the issues raised in our former colleague’s email extremely seriously.”

She continued:

“We are absolutely committed to continue building a positive, respectful and truly inclusive culture that lives up to our values as a firm and where all of our people feel they belong,” continued Wilson. “We will do better, and this includes making any changes needed so that all of our people can thrive.”

# The Bullying In Biglaw Is Off The Charts -- And Managing Partners Are Too Scared To Stop It

This is shocking… but not surprising. According to a recent survey of 124 law firm managing partners, conducted by industry consultants Patrick McKenna and David Parnell, a whopping 93(!) percent of firm leaders report bullying at their firms.

I guess it doesn’t get better.

Moreover, the survey reveals that the bullies are the high earners, and pulling in the big bucks for the firm makes 40% of those surveyed unable — or unwilling — to stop the objectionable behavior. As Law.com [reports](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/10/21/note-to-law-firm-bullies-your-managing-partner-is-afraid-of-you/):

“It’s frankly uncomfortable. It’s not that they’re necessarily pushovers,” said law firm consultant McKenna, who co-authored the survey with legal search executive Parnell. McKenna said he almost titled the survey, “Bad Boys” after the theme song in the TV show “Cops.”

The problem, McKenna and Parnell said, is that nobody is coming for the bad boys. Law firms often lack good procedures for disciplining partners who act out of line—by blocking the success of others, refusing to participate in firmwide initiatives or building personal fiefdoms within their firms.

This probably doesn’t come as a shock to associates working at firms where screamers and other forms of bullies are de rigueur. And the survey reveals most of the managing partners know they should be doing something about the bullies, even when they don’t know exactly what that is.

Some managers have already gotten the message. Fifty-nine percent of all respondents said they had reduced a partner’s compensation because of detrimental behavior in the past five years, while 52 percent said they had asked partners to leave in the past five years for conduct that offended their values.

But McKenna said it is vital to make such moves explicit. Some managers reported using compensation cuts to “send a signal” to a partner, with no specific reason given.

“Then what you get is a bad-acting lawyer who’s pissed off,” McKenna said.

So we know that bullying at law firms is a major problem, and the partners in charge have little understanding of how to fix it. Well, there’s no helicopter mom about to swoop in and demand that the problem be fixed. It’s up to all the partners and associates toiling away in law firms to implement change themselves.

The last time he sued a newspaper for libel was in 1984, and his suit was ultimately dismissed.

Billy Bush, formerly of Access Hollywood, has hired Orrick partner Marshall Grossman as he tries to negotiate his exit deal from NBC and further defend himself in light of his role in the now infamous Donald Trump ""grab them by the p*ssy"" tape. [[Hollywood Reporter](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/billy-bush-lawyers-up-goes-938219)] * New Jersey Governor Chris Christie wants to bring sports gambling to his state. He's asked Ted Olson to take the fight to the Supreme Court, where he'll argue that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act is an unconstitutional assault on state sovereignty.

[[WSJ Law Blog](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/10/14/new-jersey-asks-supreme-court-to-hear-sports-betting-case/?ref=/blogs/law)] * Where do the members of Wall Street's secret society of in-house lawyers for the world's most powerful banks meet for their yearly gathering? Reportedly organized by Shearman & Sterling partner Robert Mundheim, the 2016 soirée was held at the Trianon Palace Versailles, a place opulent enough to discuss banking woes.

What’s your over/under bet on this split decision? [[WSJ Law Blog](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/10/14/new-jersey-asks-supreme-court-to-hear-sports-betting-case/?ref=/blogs/law)]

* Where do the members of Wall Street’s secret society of in-house lawyers for the world’s most powerful banks meet for their yearly gathering? Reportedly organized by Shearman & Sterling partner Robert Mundheim, the 2016 soirée was held at the Trianon Palace Versailles, a place opulent enough to discuss banking woes. [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/inside-the-secret-society-of-wall-streets-top-in-house-lawyers/)]

* A federal judge has temporarily enjoined the Houston College of Law (formerly known as South Texas College of Law) from using its new name because it’s confusingly similar to the University of Houston Law Center’s name, and has created a “substantial threat of irreparable injury” to the school. We’ll have more on this later. [[Houston Chronicle](http://chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Federal-judge-in-to-law-school-Hold-off-on-that-9972069.php)]

# Let's Watch A Biglaw Managing Partner Get Hit In The Face With A Pie

In a move surely intended to boost esprit de corps — either by showing the troops that even the boss can have a little fun, or by inviting attorneys to embrace catharsis — a Biglaw leader allowed himself to get smacked in the face with a pie and we have video, because of course we do.

The backstory isn’t exactly clear. For example, we have no idea why the woman takes the shortcut in what seems to be a pie throwing contest, but from what we’ve been told, that’s [Andrew Sandler](https://buckleysandler.com/people/andrew-l-sandler), Chairman and Executive Partner of Buckley Sandler, getting one right in the kisser.

Hopefully the glasses survived that nasty hit.

UPDATE: The firm has graciously helped fill out the gaps in this tale. Here’s their statement:

Sandler took the hit (from partner Jonice Gray Tucker) as part of “Pie a Partner for Legal Aid” — a fundraising effort put on by Buckley Sandler as part of our contributions to the 2017 Generous Associates Campaign.

Lawyers and staff at the firm bid on the opportunity to plant a pie in face of 13 participating partners – who then had the option to return the favor by tripling the amount bid. In all, the firm raised more than $21,000 for Legal Aid.

No partners were injured during the taping of this event, but there was a carpet that needed serious cleaning.

UPDATE: Damn. This was a successful fundraiser. Legal Aid got $25,000 out of Buckley as part of an overall [$1.79 million campaign](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/legal-aids-generous-associates-campaign-raises-179-million-smashing-previous-record-300498843.html).

Thanks to the Notorious RBG for the reminder not to participate in illegal activities.

# Screw Cravath, What's Kirkland Going To Do?
## Maybe Cravath doesn't represent the top of the market quite like it used to.

Now that Cravath, the traditional ringleader when it comes to associate pay, [has joined the associate raise train](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/), matching the Milbank scale for juniors and exceeding it for mid-level and senior associates, the industry is left with a burning question: do we really care what Cravath does anymore?

As the Milbank raises have more or less sat there like the proverbial elephant in the room while the bulk of the market kept looking around at each other wondering if they should join in — or potentially go over the top — it once again drove home how reliant the industry is on one firm to make bold moves and set the tone for everyone else to sheepishly follow. An arbiter of all that is acceptable in compensation, even if they aren’t the first firm to move — that’s always been Cravath before.

This may come as a shock for all of us who’ve spent a decade hanging on Cravath’s every compensation memo, but it’s worth wondering if — perhaps — it’s outlived its leadership role. Considering the top firms as measured by any metric, and Cravath’s place should trigger the old Sesame Street jingle, “One of these things is not like the other.” As the rest of the elite have expanded into behemoths, Cravath is still a relatively small 500 or so attorneys. As the rest of the top-tier firms have opened offices around the globe, Cravath still sits on two locations. It’s time to wonder if Cravath — while undoubtedly still a premier firm — may not offer much insight to its peers because it simply doesn’t have that much in common with them anymore.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Take, for example, Cravath’s decision to up the ante for more senior associates. Are other firms as worried about losing mid-level talent? At its size, Cravath can’t afford losing too much of its senior talent to clients, but a firm like Latham could get raided and still have bodies to spare. Since Cravath doesn’t hire senior laterals the way other firms do, its not like their decision to pay more at that level presents a lateral risk for their peer firms. These are all issues unique to Cravath. While some may want to proclaim yesterday as the start of a new “Cravath scale,” it’s just as likely a footnote to the Milbank scale. The on-campus recruiting cycle is still marching to Milbank’s drum.

That’s why I’m more interested in what Kirkland’s going to do. Kirkland outpaces Cravath in every metric and more closely resembles the new normal among the Biglaw elite with 13 offices and almost 2000 attorneys. That’s who the rest of the top firms are recruiting against. Once we know what Kirkland and Latham and Skadden intend to do to keep ahead of the recruiting pack, that’s when we’ll see the market fall into line.

Will they consider breaking the $200K threshold? That’s certainly what everyone must be wondering. There was a day when Cravath’s adoption of the $190K first-year salary would immediately bring everyone into line. Maybe it will again.

But it’s as likely that the rest of the firms just took a long hard look at Cravath and wondered what Kirkland’s about to do.

# U.S. News Gets In On Rating Biglaw Firms -- The Results Are A Mixed Bag

Fresh off the embarrassment of the en masse [yeeting ](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/u-s-news-lashes-out-at-law-schools-that-dont-want-to-play-their-silly-little-rankings-game-anymore/)of [schools](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/u-s-news-ranking-methodology-may-have-changed-but-law-schools-are-still-dropping-like-flies/) from their much ballyhooed law school rankings — and delaying the most recent version of the rankings[ twice](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/u-s-news-delays-release-of-much-anticipated-law-school-rankings/) as a result — U.S. News and World Report has decided to try their hand at law firm rankings. Today [they announced](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-news--world-report-reveals-the-2024-best-companies-to-work-for-law-firms-302047440.html) the 2024 U.S. News Best Companies to Work For: Law Firms list. And it’s quite the read!

U.S. News Managing Editor of Money Susannah Snider’s statement on the ratings gives a sense of what U.S. News is trying to capture with the ranking (besides relevance now that the law school ranking is on the decline). “Professionals evaluating law firms where they can build their careers typically prioritize various needs such as pay, work-life balance and professional development,” said Snider. “To reflect that style of decision-making, the U.S. News Best Companies to Work For: Law Firms takes a modified approach to Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs to inform an ‘Employee’s Hierarchy of Needs.’ Among other factors, we look at law firms that contribute to a positive work environment and day-to-day employee experience, and offer opportunities for upward mobility.”

But for those actually *in* the industry, I’m not sure how useful the U.S. News numbers really are.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
There’s not a cumulative ranking in the U.S. News “ranking.” Paradoxical, I know! But they do provide a scorecard for each firm, which lets you know how they stack up in each of six categories: Quality of pay and benefits; Work/life balance and flexibility; Job and company stability; Physical and psychological comfort; Belongingness and esteem; Career opportunities and professional development.

Before we delve too far into this, a word to the wise: take these numbers with a grain of salt. The [methodology](https://money.usnews.com/careers/companies/methodology) is inherently subjective — how exactly are you supposed to measure psychological comfort at a job? Or esteem? Plus it includes people sounding off on forums like Glassdoor and LinkedIn, and there’s an inherent selection bias for those opt-in platforms — just because an associate doesn’t have time to complain on Glassdoor doesn’t mean all is well at a firm. But beyond that, some of these numbers are… a bit of a head scratcher.

Listen, I’ve been covering this industry for a lot of years, and some of these scores just don’t pass the smell test. For example: [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/milbank-raises-associate-salaries-and-announces-year-end-bonuses/) — the firm which has consistently raised the bar on compensation — gets a 3!! on salary? WTF? [Kirkland](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/kirkand-scores-another-record-financial-year-conducts-not-layoffs-anyway/) — known for its cutthroat culture — gets a 5 for belongingness? Ummmmm, okay? [Goodwin](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/goodwin-is-conducting-performance-reviews-that-have-resulted-in-job-cuts/), the [poster child](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/am-law-20-firm-begins-layoffs/) for recent [layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/goodwin-stealth-layoffs/), gets a 5 on stability?? (Maybe the [disappearing Fishbowl posts](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/01/public-posts-mentioning-goodwins-layoffs-keep-disappearing/) about Goodwin are at work here.) But [Baker McKenzie](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/baker-mckenzie-layoffs/) gets a 1 on stability? Why? Make it make sense.

Of course, there is a bunch that does makes sense in the rankings, like Biglaw’s consistently poor work/life balance rating.

# The 'RBG' Movie: A Portrait Of A Supreme Court Justice Whose Commitment To Women's Rights Has Shaped The Nation
## Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's life has been dedicated to seeking justice for all, but for women especially.

What’s one word that you’d use to describe Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg? Some would call her a hero, and some would call her an icon, but in the past and still to this day, others refer to her in far more ineloquent terms, like “demon,” “devil,” “witch,” “evildoer,” and “monster.”

That’s exactly how the documentary “RBG” begins, with snippets of Justice Ginsburg’s critics calling her names, followed by a close-up of her looking directly into the camera and repeating the same words she uttered during her 1993 confirmation hearing when asked about her opinion on women’s rights: “I ask no favor for my sex; all I ask of our brethren is that they take their feet off our necks.” It’s a very powerful moment, and it sets the stage for the rest of the film, which captures the essence of a woman whose life has been dedicated to seeking justice for all, but for women especially.

The film, directed by Betsy West and Julie Cohen, follows Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg from her childhood to her 25th year on the Supreme Court, marking her inspirational accomplishments along the way. In the 1970s, long before she was appointed to the D.C. Circuit or the Supreme Court, Ginsburg litigated and won five of the six cases she argued before the high court, all in an effort to make sure the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection clause applied to women. As Arthur Miller notes in the film, “she was creating a legal landscape” to change the world for women.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
I did see myself as kind of a kindergarten teacher in those days because the judges didn’t think sex discrimination existed. Well, one of the things I tried to plant in their minds was: think about how you would like the world to be for your daughters and granddaughters.

The film also poignantly chronicles Justice Ginsburg’s relationship with her late husband, Martin Ginsburg, who championed his wife every step of the way. He was a man who Ginsburg described as “the first boy I ever knew who cared that I had a brain”; a man who collected letters where the authors praised his wife and carefully arranged them in a book for her to later peruse; a man who as an elite tax lawyer was happy to stand back, cook, and crack jokes while his wife made history.

“RBG” highlights how Justice Ginsburg, who once found herself as more of a centrist on the Supreme Court, slowly but surely moved to the left as the high court began to become more conservative. It wasn’t until 2015 that Justice Ginsburg became a pop culture icon, earning herself the nickname “The Notorious R.B.G.” for her stunning dissents in the Shelby County and Hobby Lobby cases, inspiring young women across the country and ensuring that her legacy will endure for future generations to come.

Towards the end of the documentary, Justice Ginsburg is asked if she regrets not having stepped down from the bench while Barack Obama was president so he could appoint her successor. She seems to hesitate for an incredibly brief moment before asserting that she’ll continue to serve as a justice for as long as she’s able to fully perform her duties on the high court. Long may the liberal lioness roar.

# Elon Musk Rights 'Error' Of Hiring Competent Biglaw Firm
## Sure... we can pretend this is a totally normal way to hire a Biglaw firm.

One of the unexpected perks of the 2023 hellscape has been watching — in real time — why you shouldn’t let personal grudges dictate how you run your business. Unless you just enjoy setting $44 billion on fire (in which case I can think of way better ways to spend the cash, but I digress). But you know, Elon Musk’s id is still in charge of Twitter, firing engineers who [have the gall](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/02/musk-fired-top-engineer-for-explaining-why-his-tweets-views-are-down/) to tell him he’s not as interesting as *he* thinks he is, and [taking over everyone’s timeline](https://twitter.com/oneunderscore__/status/1625667481653112832?s=20&t=rIlMc0JKBiir7pdLX6aiXg) with his brain farts.

Musk takes this attitude to Twitter’s legal hiring too. Last month, an appearance by Perkins Coie on behalf of Twitter [made headlines](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/elon-musk-blames-hiring-biglaw-firm-he-personally-hates-on-an-error-because-he-has-no-idea-what-hes-doing/). The Biglaw firm’s work for the social media company predates Musk’s takeover, but Perkins Coie is also on Musk’s personal shitlist, so cue the controversy.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Back in December, Musk took aim at the Biglaw firm, and one of its partners, [Michael Sussmann](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/michael-sussmann/). He ranted that he “isn’t using Perkins Coie” as outside counsel and urged others to join him in his boycott of the firm, saying, “No company should use them until they make amends for Sussmann’s attempt to corrupt a Presidential election.” Sussmann was [predictably acquitted](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/michael-sussmann-not-guilty-as-trumplands-great-stupid-hope-falls-predictably-flat/) on charges he misled the FBI’s general counsel when talking to them about evidence linking the Trump Organization and a Russian-based bank, because he didn’t mention he also worked for the Clinton campaign.

When confronted about the representation, Musk said he was going to let bygones be bygones and move forward with the experienced litigation team. HAHAHAHA. No, that’s not at all what he did. He started pointing fingers, saying, it was “an error on the part of a member of the Twitter team.” And, “Perkins will not be representing Twitter on future cases.”

But Perkins Coie is out even on the case that caused all the hubbub. As [reported by](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/law-firm-targeted-by-elon-musk-ends-work-twitter-case-2023-02-13/) Reuters:

Lawyers from Seattle-founded Perkins Coie [told](https://tmsnrt.rs/3E5mtpn) a federal judge in California on Friday that another firm will take over representation of Twitter and its former CEO Jack Dorsey in the case, a civil RICO lawsuit filed by a far-right activist who was previously banned from the social media platform.

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)
Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Biglaw Bonus Season Is OFFICIALLY Here, With Cravath Leading The Charge

It’s the most wonderful time of the year: no, we’re not talking about the holidays. In Biglaw, the best season is bonus season. And the good news is that this year — in addition to [raises](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2021-associate-salary-increase/) and [special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/special-bonus-tracker-2021/) — bonuses are pretty generous.

Cravath has announced year-end bonuses, and it is the first Biglaw firm to do so. Historically, the Biglaw bonus first movers (since Above the Law’s founding in 2006) are as follows, and Cravath has reclaimed its throne as Biglaw’s bonus leader for the first time since 2018.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
When [Above the Law asked readers](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/biglaw-associates-expecting-bigger-better-bonuses-after-wild-year-of-billables/) what they anticipated in advance of official bonus season, 58.24 percent of respondents reported that they believed 2021 bonuses would be higher than 2020 bonuses — and they were actually correct!

Cravath has announced the following scale for 2021 year-end bonuses:



This is the first time in years that Cravath has increased the size of its bonuses across all class years. Everyone will see more money, and the most senior associates in Biglaw will now be receiving $115,000 instead of $100,000. Huzzah!

# Comfort Zones – Often Not So Comforting

Why would a law firm that had one single client accounting for more than 50% of its business not do anything about it? Why would a lawyer who has over 75% of her business coming from one client not do anything about it? Why would a lawyer who is doing work that is pretty simple and a candidate for future price compression or replacement by artificial intelligence not do anything about it? Why would a lawyer with expertise in one area of the law not think ahead to gain expertise in other areas of the law before the first area of the law becomes obsolete? Why would a young lawyer getting poor training at her law firm, but getting a decent paycheck, not do something about it before she becomes obsolete? Why would a lawyer who knows the chance of making partner at her firm is about 3% stick around to see if it happens?

The answer to all of these questions is the same as the story about the frog in boiling water. You have heard, I am sure, that if you put the frog in cold water and slowly heat the water to a boil, then the frog will not perceive that the water is getting hotter and will stay there too long until it is boiled to death.

(I just looked this up on Google – actually [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog) – and learned that this is indeed a myth. Apparently a German physiologist demonstrated that only a frog “that had its brain removed” would sit in the boiling water until it was too late.)

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
I actually love this metaphor because in my view sitting too long in a comfort zone seems to be equivalent to having your brain removed. It is just so ultimately dumb. I suspect for the neuroscientists of the world, it is similar to the reasoning (or lack of it) of someone trying to quit smoking who knows, full well, that “one more cigarette won’t make a difference.” In the same way, waiting another day to look for another client, another line of work, or another job will not make a difference either. And there we sit in our comfort zones.

Comfort zones are of course “comforting,” but they are similar to the guy who fell out of the plane and five minutes later said, “Well, this isn’t so bad after all.” But like the guy said in the movie Avatar, “Sooner or later you’ve got to wake up.” And that is when you find out that “reality bites,” to quote another movie.

My favorite story here is my own. When we started our firm we were dependent on one – super – client for quite a few years. My brilliant marketing program consisted of picking up the phone when they called with legal work and saying “okay boss” or words to that effect. Somehow, despite this managerial idiocy on my part, I had convinced close to thirty lawyers to follow me in making their jobs at my law firm. It really is hard to know what on Earth we were all thinking.

But it made a lot of sense. We were doing cool and interesting work. We were immune from ups and downs in the market as this client kept growing. And we were making a lot of money. Life was good…… until it wasn’t.

During the global financial crisis, I remember getting a call from the senior fellow at the client. He said, “Bruce, we’re going to make a lot of money next year. But we’re going to sit things out for a while.”

I remember thinking – as the ground rushed up to meet me – “Well, what are we doing to do?”

That was when I – and my colleagues – woke up to the “bite” of “reality” and the realization of how utterly stupid we had been sitting in a comfort zone for too long.

Why, I wondered, hadn’t I made some efforts to diversify and find new clients during all those years of plenty? I mean, I am not a moron, am I? I am pretty smart. Ask my wife. And my colleagues are smart too. But sometimes smart people do stupid things. And the stupidest thing that smart people do is linger too long in a comfort zone.

It took me years – and some real panic and suffering for both myself and my team – before we were able to right the Duval & Stachenfeld ship from the mess I had made. I blame no one but myself for the situation we were in. I was the managing partner, after all. And I vowed never again to let something like this happen – not on my watch.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
To conclude, I don’t want to sound too much like Tony Robbins – for whom I have a ton of respect, by the way – but I do urge you: if you are sitting in a comfort zone (perhaps like one of the ones I outlined above), get out – today – don’t delay – before reality bites you in the …. Or you are making decisions comparable to the de-brained frog in the boiling water. Surely you – we – are more intelligent than that poor frog.
