# But Will Associates In The Mutara Nebula Get A Cut Of These Raises?
## Or does 'all U.S. offices' also cover associates who bring high-end legal representation to the Crab People?

DLA Piper, which once listed that it [had an office in “country” of Africa](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/02/dla-piper-literally-doesnt-know-what-country-some-of-their-offices-are-in/), has entered the associate raise game.

It’s a straight match of Cravath, for all U.S. offices in major markets. DLA Piper is famously large, with offices all over the world. Matching the associate raises is big news for the market, just because of the sheer size of the firm. Now, anytime Reed Smith or Greenberg Traurig make you a job offer, know that there’s a DLA Piper office, probably inside the local bus station, willing to pay you more money than those firms.

Here’s the memo. It… really is this short (no summer bonuses). And I’d like to think that the scribbling was included in the original, but that’s probably just tipster flair.

As you can see, DLA offers free helium to all those who work in the U.S.

I don’t know how the U.S. raises will play with associates just outside the United States. How will DLA Piper’s associates in low Earth orbit take the news? The cost of living on the Mars Opportunity rover isn’t going down.

Oh, I kid, DLA. Having global client services is actually a good thing. Congratulations. Associates in DLA Mariana Trench can afford to stop swimming to work and take mermen rickshaws instead.

# Biglaw Partner Suspended For Watching Porn At Work
## Each and every part of this story is disgusting.

It’s not every day that a Biglaw partner gets suspended for watching porn in his office, but today is apparently that day.

It seems that Hogan Lovells has disciplined an unnamed partner in its London office after he was caught watching an adult video while he was on the clock — and it wasn’t the firm’s IT department that made the illicit discovery. According to [RollOnFriday](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-hogan-lovells-partner-suspended-after-rival-lawyer-films-him-watching-porn), an attorney at the law firm Irwin Mitchell, which is located directly across a narrow street from HoLove, looked out the window and witnessed the Biglaw partner misbehaving at his desk. The Irwin Mitchell lawyer then whipped out a cellphone, filmed the partner in question as he indulged in adult activities at his desk, and sent the video to the Hogan Lovells HR team. Sources at the firm told RollOnFriday that this was a case of “Hogan (Self) Lovells,” which makes the situation all the worse.

Hogan Lovells has launched an investigation into this partner’s predilection for pornography. “We were made aware of an individual in our office misusing their computer to watch adult material,” a Hogan Lovells spokesperson said in a statement given to [ALM International](https://www.law.com/2018/11/09/hogan-lovells-suspends-partner-for-watching-adult-video-at-work-396-9099/). “Such behavior is unacceptable and we have suspended them pending a full internal investigation.” Here are more details from the firm:

“We didn’t block access to websites unless they represented a cybersecurity risk (e.g. they have malware on them),” the spokesperson said. “The nature of our work for clients sometimes means we need to carry out investigations in areas which require us to have flexible access. We have reviewed and tightened this policy.”

We’re not sure what’s more disgusting, the fact that a Biglaw partner may have been masturbating at his desk while watching porn at work, or the fact that a voyeur lawyer from a firm across the street watched the act as it happened, decided to film it, and then distributed another form of porn to Hogan Lovells. As an FYI for all parties who were involved in this gross scenario, you’re supposed to be performing pro bono work in your spare time, not pro boner work. You’re all gross. We seriously hope this helps!

# Quinn Emanuel Partner Warned By Federal Judge About Losing His Cool
## There's an awful lot of money on the line.

Quinn Emanuel represented a class of healthcare insurers in an Affordable Care Act case against the federal government, and secured a $3.7 billion settlement. For their efforts — and the risk associated with taking on the contingency case — the trial court awarded them $185 million in legal fees.

Partner Derek Shaffer had to appear before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to defend the large size of the award against the complaints of class objectors. And as [reported by Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/us-appeals-court-questions-185-mln-award-law-firm-quinn-emanuel-2022-12-05/), it did not appear to go particularly well:

During argument, the appeals court appeared concerned by what appeared to be the Federal Claims judge not performing a “lodestar cross-check,” which involves a review of hourly rates and the number of hours worked on a case. “You put the world on notice. There will be a lodestar cross-check. She didn’t do it,” Chief Judge Kimberly Moore told Shaffer.

The class objectors, represented at oral argument by Sheppard Mullin, suggested attorneys fees of $8.8 million. That must be one hell of a lodestar cross-check if the proper amount of fees is a mere 4.8 percent of the award! Biglaw elites may look down their noses at plaintiffs’ work — particularly of the contingency variety — but society needs these suits. As Judge Posner famously described “the realistic alternative to a class action is not 17 million individual suits, but zero individual suits.” Everyone waits to object after the case is all nice and settled, but as Shaffer indicated during argument, Quinn Emanuel took on a real risk of NEVER getting compensated, noting the government “is not a defendant who is likely to settle — this is not a defendant who fears being subjected” to a large penalty.

And having that much cash on the line apparently made Shaffer a little testy. And Judge Moore was quick to point it out:

“Counsel, I’m trying to … figure out to myself why you’re … pointing your finger at us and sort of yelling at the court,” Moore remarked. She added: “It’s your money. If I had $187 [sic] million on the line, I’d probably lose my cool a little bit, too — so go for it.”

Shaffer did apologize but Judge Moore is not wrong — well over a hundred million dollars is a lot to get angry over.

Paul Rawlinson

Back in 2018, Baker McKenzie then-Global Chair, Paul Rawlinson, took a [temporary leave](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/10/global-chair-of-biglaw-firm-taking-temporary-leave-due-to-exhaustion/?rf=1) from the firm due to “exhaustion.” The following year, [Rawlinson passed away](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/biglaw-chair-dies-after-taking-leave-for-exhaustion/), though not many details were known about his death at that time. Now we’ve learned that he died by suicide.

Law.com [is reporting](https://www.law.com/2020/06/10/former-baker-mckenzie-chief-paul-rawlinson-died-by-suicide-inquest-hears-405-62228/) that during a virtual inquest held yesterday by the Surrey Coroner’s Court in the U.K., it was revealed Rawlinson died by suicide. They also heard that Rawlinson was suffering an “acute depressive illness,” and was undergoing treatment at a Swiss rehabilitation center, Kusnacht Practice, at the time of his death.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The firm made the following statement:

“Paul’s sudden death in April 2019 was a tragedy, most obviously for his family, but also for Baker McKenzie, where he had been a long serving partner and inspirational leader in various roles. He was a man of enormous charisma and energy,” Baker McKenzie said in a statement Wednesday. “The circumstances surrounding Paul’s death are a private matter for his family and we continue to request appropriate respect for that. As painful as events have been for his many friends and colleagues in the firm, our thoughts throughout have been with Paul’s wife and children, and will continue to be, as they move forward.”

These details of Rawlinson’s death provide a poignant reminder of the mental health issues that often run rampant in Biglaw. If you or someone you know is depressed and in need help, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255) or a lawyer assistance program in your state.

# Biglaw Firm Offers Students Who Didn't Get Summer Associate Jobs The Chance To Work As 'Virtual' Summer Associates

We see this as an extremely valuable learning exercise for these students to well prepare them to finish out the second and or third year of law school and have on their resume a very valuable experience having worked through and lived through this simulated exercise over eight weeks.

[It will be] just like being a summer associate in a law firm.

— [Michael Volpe](https://www.venable.com/professionals/v/michael-j-volpe), co-chair of Venable’s labor and employment practice group, commenting on the firm’s [simulated summer associate experience at a “virtual” law firm](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/venable-new-york-law-school-offer-virtual-summer-firm-program). Venable has teamed up with New York Law School to create and put on this eight-week training program in record time. “I think people recognize what this summer means to a large group of law students who otherwise will lose their summer and will lose out on tremendous opportunities,” said [Anthony Crowell](https://www.nyls.edu/faculty/faculty-profiles/faculty_profiles/anthony_w_crowell/), dean of NYLS.

# Attention Associates: Tell Us About Your Health Plan
## Is your firm screwing you on health care?
By [Joe Patrice](https://abovethelaw.com/author/joe-patrice/)  
onNovember 29, 2017 at 10:58 AM

Shares[](https://twitter.com/share?url=https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/attention-associates-tell-us-about-your-health-plan/&text=Attention%20Associates:%20Tell%20Us%20About%20Your%20Health%20Plan)[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/attention-associates-tell-us-about-your-health-plan/&display=popup&ref=plugin&src=share_button)[](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/attention-associates-tell-us-about-your-health-plan/)[](javascript:void(""#ea-share-count-email""))
When we reported on [Simpson Thacher’s bonus announcement](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/biglaw-firm-matches-cravath-but-are-they-cutting-associate-compensation-while-no-ones-looking/), our tipsters pointed out that changes to the firm’s health plan would result in associates paying more for less coverage over the coming year. Happy Holidays!

That inspired more than a few tipsters to point out that Simpson’s new plan — while increasing the burden on employees next year — may not even be the stingiest health plan out there. One tipster claimed that one elite New York firm’s employee contribution is $60 more per pay period than Simpson’s and another top-of-the-heap firm plan is charging 60 percent on top of what Simpson is.

We’ve not gotten secondary confirmation on either of these tips, but if firms — big firms, small firms, or boutiques — are routinely bleeding associates on their health care, that’s something we want to know. Frankly, we don’t want only bad news, either! If a firm is going above and beyond to provide stellar care for cheap, we want to know that too.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
So we’re asking our tipsters — one and all — to tell us what their firms are charging for health care. Attorneys have overlooked the details of their health plans for too long — it’s not only literally a life-and-death issue, but it can really eat into your salary too. Let us know [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Health), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Obviously these are all very much “first world problems.” Attorneys aren’t roaming the streets uncovered and the contributions they make to health care aren’t really breaking their bank accounts in the grand scheme of things. But that’s no reason to be complacent. Your bosses are putting more in their pockets and hoping you feel too ashamed to complain. Don’t fall for it.

Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Rolls Out Generous Bonuses, And Eligibility Includes Time Billed For 'Unplugging'
## More firms should have programs like this!

It’s officially bonus o’clock at yet another Biglaw firm. One by one, members of the Am Law 100 have made their own bonus announcements, matching the prevailing market bonus scale (and sometimes beating it for associates whose performance in 2021 was extraordinary in terms of billable hours and/or client service).

The latest firm to share the wealth with associates and counsel through its year-end bonus program is Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe. The firm brought in $1,152,850,000 gross revenue in 2020, putting it in 35th place in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking. Orrick’s bonus schedule should look quite familiar if you’ve been following Above the Law this bonus season.

That’s a Cravath/Davis Polk match, and according to Orrick’s memo, its hardest working associates and counsel will be eligible for additional bonus amounts. The firm has also committed to pay special bonuses to its career associates and analytics project attorneys.

The firm’s 1950 hours baseline for bonus eligibility includes up to 100 hours of a combination of training, DEI, business development, innovation, and other forms of firm and self-investment; pro bono hours; as well as up to 40 hours of time devoted to unplugging (i.e., time for attorneys to take care of themselves and their families and to invest in their own mental health and wellness). As noted in the firm’s memo, Orrick calls its [“Unplug on Us” program](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/top-50-biglaw-firm-rolls-out-incredible-bonus-eligible-time-off-policy/) “an important reflection of what we collectively value.”

Congratulations to everyone at Orrick on their year-end and special bonuses!

# Partners Should More Often Admit To Associates When They Are Wrong
## No one likes to admit that they are wrong, but sometimes it's necessary.

Being a law firm partner is a pretty big deal in the legal industry. Depending on the firm, only a select few attorneys are elevated to partnership, and this usually means that an attorney has the skill and experience needed to be a firm leader. However, partners of course do not know everything nor are they infallible. In my experience, partners may have a difficult time admitting they are wrong even when pressed with persuasive information by associates, and this can lead to a number of negative consequences.

One of the biggest reasons why partners do not like admitting when they are wrong to associates is because it may impact their pride. Partners often have much more experience than associates, and they accordingly should know more about the law and strategies that can be deployed in a case. However, this does not mean that a partner’s understanding is never wrong, especially since the law is constantly changing, and partners cannot be expected to know everything about everything. Moreover, associates who recently attended law school may have a fresher understanding of the law and legal research techniques that can be used to arrive at the correct answer.

One time earlier in my career, a partner tasked me with researching how our firm could stay a decision pending an appeal. The ordinary situation, as this partner described it, was to post an undertaking in the amount of the judgment so that the party that won the judgment would not be prejudiced while the appeals process occurred. However, I found in my research that when an insured was covered by a policy of insurance, we may not need to post an undertaking, and we may be able to merely provide some paperwork by the insurance company saying that the carrier would pay the amount of the judgment if there was an adverse decision on appeal. This was a much more favorable situation to us since insurance was involved in our case, and this could eliminate the need to post a substantial sum of money.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
I brought this research to the partner working on the file, and he would not believe that we could simply file some paperwork from the insurance company to stay the appeal. He read the provision on point that explicitly permitted this to occur from his own desk reference book, and he still would not believe that this could occur. At one point he even asked another lawyer to come into his office and asked this lawyer to read the particular provision at issue and side with him, but of course the language was in black and white that such a process was available. The partner let his pride get in the way of apprehending a procedure of which he was not familiar, and he had an extremely difficult time admitting that he was wrong.

Another common situation in which partners have a difficult time admitting they are wrong is when it comes to research projects. At bigger firms, partners may task associates with researching small snippets of a brief or finding case law which supports a proposition that a partner wishes to include in a brief. However, sometimes the proposition that the partner wants authority on is wrong, and case law does not exist to support the point. Partners may not accept that their arguments cannot be supported and force associates to keep looking for authority that does not exist, which can waste resources. Partners should accept that associates conducting the research itself are more likely to know what can and cannot be supported by the law and not be upset if expectation are not satisfied after research is complete.

Another time when partners should more often admit that they are wrong to associates is if associates think of better ways to make arguments. Unfortunately, partners are often too willing to think that their experience and age makes them better tacticians than associates who may be closer to the research of a matter.

One time, I was tasked with filing a motion to compel a party to provide materials for our expert to inspect. The party argued that they needed to keep the materials pursuant to state law, and as such, they could not be compelled to turn it over. The partner wanted to argue that there was a very low chance that the party would be caught not possessing the required materials by authorities so the court should compel their production to us.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.

I have no idea why the partner thought a court would countenance skirting the law, but I had a better idea. After reviewing the applicable authorities, I suggested arguing that the party was merely loaning us the materials, and since the materials would be returned, and since the party maintained a possessory interest in the materials, the law would be satisfied. The partner had a hard time buying my argument even though I was closer to the research and knew what points we could make to persuade a court to compel production.

All told, no one likes to admit that they are wrong, and partners may think that their experience and age makes them more qualified to render legal opinions. However, associates are often closer to the research, and partners should more often admit they are wrong to avoid inefficiencies and best serve clients.

# Nationwide Layoff Watch: Banished Beyond The Gates
## The cuts, which hit multiple departments and offices, are just the latest manifestation of upheaval at the firm.

Lawyers at [K&L Gates](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/kl-gates/) have to worry about dragging the firm [into political controversy](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/biglaw-managing-partner-to-entire-firm-stfu-on-scotus/). Support staff at K&L Gates have a much bigger concern: job security.

Last week, according to several of our sources at the firm, “scores” of support staff were laid off at K&L Gates (the exact number is unknown). The laid-off employees included employees who had been with K&L Gates (or its legacy firms) for several decades, as well as new employees who had been at the firm just a short time (and who presumably left other good jobs to join KLG).

In terms of departments, the affected employees included nearly the entire IT training team, the entire Q/A team, Tier 2 Support, and at least one Project Manager. In terms of offices, they included Seattle, Chicago, Dallas, Melbourne, and possibly others. The affected employees did not include any upper-level management, “compounding the problem of an already too top-heavy org structure,” as one tipster told us.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Severance was provided in the amount of two weeks per year, plus benefits until the end of February and one month of career placement services (although the group providing placement services is so busy that it’s difficult to speak with anyone). This is just the latest manifestation of upheaval in the ranks of staff at K&L Gates, which last month witnessed the unexplained departure of the firm’s Chief Information Officer (CIO).

“They do not understand the importance of the positions they eliminated,” one affected individual told us. “Clients will suffer with no support to the users.”

We presented the foregoing information to the firm, which issued this response, through a spokesperson:

K&L Gates takes pride in providing professional growth opportunities for employees at all levels. The firm works to assure the right employees are performing the right jobs in order to maximize client service and efficiency. As is the case with any global professional services organization, we periodically review our staffing needs and make adjustments for the good of the firm and its clients.

Fair enough. In these efficiency-focused times for law firms, cuts are sometimes necessary. But that economic reality doesn’t make things any easier for the K&L Gates employees who just lost their jobs.

Do you have any additional details on what’s going on at K&L Gates? [Please drop us a line](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=NRF%20Layoffs%20/%20Office%20Closure). We wish all those who may be affected at the firm the best of luck while they seek new job opportunities in the legal industry and beyond.

If your firm or organization is reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs) or text us (646-820-8477). Thank you for your help in keeping law firms honest.

UPDATE (5:45 p.m.): We don’t know how many staffers were affected, but we are probably talking about dozens on a firm-wide basis, given what this source had to say:

The K&L Gates layoffs hit Pittsburgh staff particularly hard. They aren’t finished. Tough to get official counts, but close to 30 staff. Secretaries and paralegals that I know got 12 weeks of severance.

At this point, no lawyers known to be involved in cuts. They need to cut underperforming associates/income-level partners and particularly focus on the gluttony of unnecessary managers.

UPDATE (2/10/2017, 10:05 a.m.): A different tipster offers this defense of the firm:

To its credit, K&L Gates used to be very humane about firing both staff and lawyers. While Latham Lathamed, KLG just kept people on while they were still slow. One associate in the 2011 class literally didn’t bill one hour for the first five months she was there (I understand she wrote a great treatise chapter). Unfortunately, it got really bloated, which is part of the reason why partners weren’t getting top dollar compared to peer firms. Recognizing the existential threat of partner departures, they’re making hard choices they should have made a long time ago. They had way too many staffers. Probably twice as many as they needed in some offices.

If this source is right, then it was only a matter of time before such a reckoning took place.

UPDATE (2/15/2017, 11:05 a.m.): Please see [this update](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/nationwide-layoff-watch-150-to-200-jobs-is-a-lot-of-jobs/) for additional information. Specifically:

1. The cuts affected an estimated 150 to 200 staffers.

2. Whether the cuts included upper-level management depends on how broadly you define “upper-level”; directors in admin, HR, and marketing departments were affected.

3. Severance arrangements varied from employee to employee.

# Law Firm Merger Trend Continues In 2020
## More law firm merger madness.

It’s still early in 2020, so you may still be feeling the whole “new year, new me” vibe. And that’s cool, I’m still feeling the resolutions myself. But when it comes to the law firm merger landscape, 2020 is shaping up to look a lot like 2019. We saw a lot of law firm mergers last year, and now, not even a full week since the calendar flipped over there are two more mergers to talk about.

The first is the combination of Cincinnati-based Taft Stettinius & Hollister merging with Minneapolis-based Briggs & Morgan. The new entity, known simply as Taft, has 600+ lawyers and 12 offices. The combined revenue of the new firm will likely place them in the Am Law 100.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2020/01/03/taft-lathrop-gpm-officially-tie-the-knot-kicking-off-2020-law-firm-mergers/) Law.com, the powers in charge of the merger say there’s been a smooth transition:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“There were no hiccups or problems we didn’t anticipate,” said Steven Ryan, the partner in charge of Taft’s Minneapolis office. Taft managing partner Robert Hicks expressed similar sentiments, saying while there was some “scrambling” at one point, “it couldn’t have gone any better.”

The second merger of 2020 sees the marriage of Kansas City, Missouri-based Lathrop Gage and Minneapolis-based Gray Plant Mooty, now known as Lathrop GPM. They newly expanded firm has ~400 lawyers across 14 offices. Lathrop GPM managing partner Cameron Garrison had good things to say about the change:

“As you can image, a combination of this size takes a lot of heavy lifting, and attorneys and staff throughout the organization have done a phenomenal job implementing the combination in a short amount of time,” Garrison said.

And don’t expect the merger madness to slow down any time soon.

Apart from Taft and Lathrop GPM, 10 more law firm mergers are scheduled to close in the first quarter of 2020, according to consultancy Fairfax Associates. This includes Dentons’ [combinations](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/10/07/dentons-combines-with-two-us-firms-in-one-go-launching-new-american-strategy-405-45784/) with Indianapolis-based Bingham Greenebaum Doll and Pittsburgh-based Cohen & Grigsby, as a part of Dentons’ “Golden Spike” strategy to ostensibly create the first national law firm in the U.S.

A Dentons spokeswoman said they “continue to anticipate launching sometime in January,” but wouldn’t give a specific date.

Plus, on February 1st, we expect to see the merger of two Biglaw firms Faegre Baker Daniels and Drinker Biddle & Reath. The new firm, Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath, is expected to take its place in the top Am Law 50 with 1,300+ lawyers and 22 offices.

There seems to be a never-ending amount of callousness mixed with stupidity mixed with cognitive dissonance mixed with outright violence and horror these days.

The London office of Biglaw firm White & Case allegedly fired a partner who was suffering from mental health issues due to the loss of his wife to cancer. Disputing the fired partner’s claim and saying that the partner was terminated for “poor performance,” the catchall of all catchalls, the firm noted that “[sadness and grief](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/biglaw-firm-defends-firing-of-widower-noting-sadness-and-grief-are-not-disabilities/)” are not sufficiently disabling under British law.

Maybe that argument has to do with the whole British concepts of “stiff upper lip” and “carry on,” but how unfeeling can one be to not sympathize, empathize, whatever words you choose, with the death of a loved one? (I will talk about Uvalde later.)  And with more than 1 million COVID-related deaths in this country, how could anyone not have been touched personally by grief and sadness, a sense of a loss that is indeed forever? Amazingly heartless? Stupid? Res ipsa loquitur.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Bravo to Mark Herrmann, who reiterates what should be [a main tenet of law](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/the-perils-of-thinking-that-its-all-a-game/) practice, in that you don’t reach for the moon in litigation if your client is only entitled to a piece of green cheese. Whoever thinks that litigation, trying a case, is just a game is stupid. Even if freedoms and lives are not at stake as they are in criminal cases, civil cases of whatever nature are equally important to the parties involved, and to treat them without the requisite degree of seriousness is not only stupid, but malpractice. That’s why explaining to clients the value (or no value) of a case is essential. The failure to do that is also stupid and malpractice. Our job is to tell clients the good, the bad, and the ugly about their cases. They should not be seen just as ticking billable hours (whether a person or an entity) but with real-life problems that need to be resolved as best as possible, without bankrupting them. Isn’t solving problems, be they micro or macro, why we do what we do?

“Chutzpah” is one of my favorite words. Substitute “gall” or “nerve” for it, and you get the idea. So how about this for nerve, gall or chutzpah? One of the defendants awaiting trial arising out of the January 6, 2021, “house party” wanted to go on a trip outside the U.S. to celebrate that he was a winner in a sales contest at his company. (Full disclosure: I have been to several of those, courtesy of my ex-husband, many years ago, and it is a week or so of good times. However, he was not awaiting trial on any offense, except for his long-held grudge against the Dodgers moving from Brooklyn to LA.) So, it’s a [great bench slap](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/benchslap-judge-dropkicks-capitol-riot-defendants-request-for-luxury-mexican-vacation/) when a court tells a defendant how it really feels about the defendant’s untimely request to travel to Cabo. [    ](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/benchslap-judge-dropkicks-capitol-riot-defendants-request-for-luxury-mexican-vacation/)

And here in the Central District of California, Federal District Judge Otis Wright has [washed his hands](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/federal-judge-up-and-quits-case-after-getting-annoyed-with-attorney/) of a criminal trial he was presiding over. It was, in a sense, an “off with their heads,” or more particularly the public defender who was doing what lawyers are supposed to do, provide a vigorous defense, and make a record for any appeal. If only we lawyers could get rid of clients in the same way.

How about having [Elon Musk for a client](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/elon-musk-takes-time-out-from-failing-to-buy-twitter-to-fail-to-build-his-own-law-firm/)? I don’t know what your reaction may be, but mine is simple: pass. Talk about having an issue or two — or 20 — with client control. Do you think there is enough money in the world to be part of a law firm that he will hire, fire, direct, and control? And more than one general counsel at Tesla [has taken a hike](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/12/tesla-loses-its-third-general-counsel-in-the-last-year.html) from Tesla in the past few years. Calling all superheroes and others who don’t care about their reputations and who are willing to put themselves in harm’s way. A situation of cognitive dissonance?

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
It will be easier to practice once the LSATs go the way of VCRs. (Remember those? Remember dial telephones?) The ABA may well drop all law school testing requirements. Say what? Yup, that bastion of tradition may well toss the LSAT. Some law schools have already [substituted the GRE](https://www.bestcolleges.com/news/2022/05/11/aba-lsat-law-school-admissions/) for admission purposes.

The cottage industry of LSAT prep will probably fall by the wayside. There are a number of things to complain about the test, not the least of which is the cost of prep, done often more than once, to present an aspiring lawyer in the most alluring light for law school admissions deans. As a result, good, even great, potential candidates for law school can’t jump the first barrier, which is the LSAT prep costs. And an LSAT prep can cost thousands in addition to the usual and customary fees for taking the LSAT itself. For many peeps, standardized tests have been dreadful ways to determine success in the first year of law school. It’s not predicative of any lawyering ability except the ability to do well on a standardized test. Law school admissions officers may now think about candidates more holistically, instead of an LSAT score and a GPA that might only reflect “easy A’s.”

So, when do the horrors end? Now [19 children and two adults are dead](https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2022/05/24/chris-murphy-texas-elementary-school-shooting-vpx.cnn) in Uvalde, Texas. Screw “thoughts and prayers.” Screw “There are no words.” Remember Buffalo? Remember Orange County? And those two are just in the past week and a half. There are plenty of words, but too many people don’t want to say them. We lawyers earn our keep with words. We need to speak up and speak out.

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

# When People Start Writing About You Destroying Your Firm, Things Aren't Going Well
## The New York Law Journal asks if Marc Kasowitz is hurting his firm. That's never a good sign.

Marc Kasowitz (screenshot via YouTube)

The headline in the New York Law Journal is an ominous, but ultimately benign, “[Trump Case Leaves Marc Kasowitz’s Law Firm at a Crossroads.](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202789694971/Could-Marc-Kasowitz-Save-the-President-and-Lose-His-Law-Firm)” The URL, however, reveals that at some point in the life of the story it was titled “Could Marc Kasowitz Save the President and Lose His Law Firm?”

That’s… more ominous.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And the fact that this sentiment made the leap from “what we’re all thinking” to the relatively staid pages of the New York Law Journal should worry anyone associated with the Kasowitz firm. On the bright side, there are enough unfilled ambassadorships right now for the rest of the firm to [follow David Friedman’s lead](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/kasowitz-benson-loses-name-partner-lots-of-money/).

There’s a reason firms are [falling all over themselves](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/no-one-wants-these-jobs/) to avoid working for Donald Trump. A notoriously meddlesome client with a well-documented history of stiffing his vendors would be reason enough to [steer clear](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/the-biglaw-firms-that-said-no-to-trump/) before adding that he’s the [least popular person in the country](http://time.com/4816799/donald-trump-disapproval-ratings-poll/). No one wants the attention that comes with carrying water for this administration. When Marc Kasowitz took on this job, none were happier than Jones Day, who thrilled at the opportunity to slink out of that ignominious limelight.

But Kasowitz’s firm — already down almost 100 attorneys and facing an over 7 percent revenue hit — faces unique risks that his high-profile turn only exacerbates. As the New York Law Journal puts it:

Few firms in the Am Law 200 have first-generation partners still running their firms. “Transitioning from a first-generation partnership to second generation is probably the hardest thing any firm does,” said legal management consultant Peter Zeughauser, speaking generally on succession planning. “And only a small number of firms make it when they have a single dominant partner.”

As managing partner of a large firm, Kasowitz, 64, stands out for his close involvement in his firm’s operations, including many of its most high-profile cases. He’s not just a rainmaker who steps back after cases are brought in, said one attorney keenly familiar with the firm.
“He’s going to be involved in anything important,” the attorney said. “Even though it’s a partnership, it’s his firm and he’s the leader.”

“How long can this firm last beyond Marc? … Most people feel it would break apart,” the lawyer said.

And this doesn’t deal with the compounding embarrassments heaped on the firm from its… shall we say [“lackluster” drafting skills](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/marc-kasowitz-takes-break-from-partying-at-trump-hotel-to-talk-to-the-press/), questionable grasp of [ethical obligations to the unrepresented](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/is-marc-kasowitz-drunk-on-his-own-power/), and reports that Kasowitz is going around implying that there’s [fire underneath Trump’s smoke](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/kasowitz-supposedly-taking-credit-for-firing-preet-bharara/).

Thankfully for Marc Kasowitz, he’s got decades of results and existing client relationships that’ll keep business coming through the door despite these missteps. But new clients might get skittish when they start evaluating their options. Putting aside clients, why would any attorney want future potential employers scanning their résumé and wondering how they spell “Predisent”? Recruiting the next generation is a big part of midwifing a firm from its founders to the new guard, and this isn’t doing that process any favors. The reputational damage may be surmountable, but it is palpable.

Only time will tell where Kasowitz Benson goes from here. But it’s worth keeping an eye on the lateral market. The firm has already lost several key partners over the last year. It might just lose several more.

# Understanding The SEC’s Newly Proposed Climate Disclosure Requirements
## It’s crucial for today’s corporations and their lawyers to understand their obligations in relation to climate change, and how these latest proposed requirements might make those obligations more complex.

In a much-anticipated move last month, the SEC proposed adding sweeping new climate change disclosure and reporting requirements to a number of regulations and SEC forms. Among the required new disclosures are information about company climate change policies, Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, and attestation requirements for accelerated and large accelerated filers. 

Companies should begin planning now for more extensive and complex disclosure requirements likely to be enacted from this proposal. To help you understand the proposed disclosure requirements and how to plan for them, PLI is offering a one-hour program, [Climate Disclosures – A Deep Dive Into the SEC’s Proposed New Governance, Strategy and Risk Disclosures](https://www.pli.edu/programs/climate-disclosures---a-deep-dive-into-the-secs-proposed-new-governance-strategy-and-risk-disclosures?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2).

In this session, an expert panel will address a number of key issues, including:

- The rationale for the SEC’s proposed changes 
- The foundations for the proposed rules in the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures framework
- Governance-related disclosures relating to Board of Directors’ oversight, disclosure of directors’ expertise considerations, Board considerations for risk evaluation, targets, and goals, and management’s role and process disclosures
- Strategy, business model, and outlook disclosures relating to potential business and financial impacts of climate-related risks, physical risks, transition risks, short-, medium-, and long-term time horizons, and internal carbon prices
- Risk management disclosures, including disclosure of processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks
- Targets and goals disclosures
- Phase-in requirements 
- Recommended action steps 
You can register for the upcoming session [here](https://www.pli.edu/programs/climate-disclosures---a-deep-dive-into-the-secs-proposed-new-governance-strategy-and-risk-disclosures?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2). For another overview of the SEC’s proposed changes, you can access PLI’s previous one-hour program, [Climate Change – The SEC’s Proposed New Disclosures](https://www.pli.edu/programs/climate-change--the-secs-proposed-new-disclosures?t=ondemand&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2), on-demand.

# Latham Increases Its Partner Bonus Pool To 15% To Keep Rainmakers Happy And Stave Off Lateral Moves
## Will other firms be able to afford to make similar changes to their partner bonus pools?

As more and more Biglaw firms move toward black-box compensation systems for their partners, one elite firm is doing things a little differently. As Biglaw associates know all too well, the best way to keep a top-performer around is to offer big bonuses — and the same premise apparently works for partners.

Latham & Watkins — a firm that brought in $5,321,007,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 2 in the Am Law 100 — seems to have increased its bonus pool for partners, growing its profits reserved for this purpose to 15%, while at the same time limiting the number of partners who actually receive these bonuses. For what it’s worth, other firms tend to reserve about 7 to 8% of profits for partner bonuses. Here are some additional details from the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/03/26/latham-watkins-grows-bonus-pool-with-15-of-profits-as-firms-seek-flexibility-to-reward-top-earners/):

Latham’s growing profit pool has allowed the firm to pay some of its highest-performing partners in the range of $12 million to $15 million, the people said. Between 2018 and 2022, the firm grew net income from $1.68 billion to $2.86 billion, according to ALM data, an increase of 14.1%. That growth, combined with how the firm is engineering bonuses, has enabled a hefty spread from highest- to lowest-paid partners. Not only has the firm succeeded in the lateral market in recent years as a result, but this success has also likely helped catalyze changes at other firms with vestiges of a seniority-based lockstep system.

Rather than changing their share point system, as other firms have done, Latham has gradually shifted its profit reserves to allocate more money for partner bonuses. These increased bonuses are a way to pay partners what they — and perhaps more importantly, other rival firms eager to poach them — perceive to be their fair market value.

“The wider partnership is paying a little bit of money to competitively compensate the firm’s top people,” New York-based recruiter Mike Parrillo told Am Law — and in Latham’s favor, it seems to be working.

# Beyond Biglaw: Escape The Room
## What is ""escape the room,"" and what can lawyers and law firms learn from it?

Two weeks ago, I wrote about [skills testing](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/beyond-biglaw-testing-for-practical-intelligence/) that could be applicable to new or existing employees at law firms. The feedback I received on that column suggests at least two things to me. First, there is some discontent with the way law firms manage new hires, an observation that will probably not be a surprise to readers. Second, there is a hunger for battle-tested yet innovative ways of making sure that law firm employees have the skills they need to succeed in the competitive environments they work in. Again, that won’t be a surprise to many. At the same time, whenever there is a dissatisfaction with the status quo, it behooves us to look for ways to improve as an industry. Sometimes that means tweaking processes already in place, and sometimes radical new approaches — including those sourced from other industries — are necessary.

In a bit of a coincidence, I had an opportunity that same week to sample for the first time an “escape the room” game. For those who have no idea what these (popular, by the number of variants available in New York City at least) games are all about, here is a short primer.

You and your group (four to eight other people) go to a facility, where you choose or have already chosen a themed room for your experience. For instance, your room may have a detective theme, and provide a musty old study as a setting. Or you may be on a spaceship, or mental hospital, or your dad’s old garage. Either way, the challenge is to escape the room within a specified period of time, usually around 60 minutes. An attendant explains the rules, points out the emergency exit button, and locks you in — which sets off a mad scramble, as everyone tries to poke around the room for clues that will allow for the group to escape, ideally without using the provided telephone to obtain hints from the gamemaster.

Since my group escaped the room with around eight minutes to spare (without using any hints to boot), I can safely say that it was a fun experience. There is a fair bit of ingenuity in how the facilities elect to position the clues, as well as in the types of problems each clue presents. What quickly becomes clear to participants is that certain behaviors are rewarded in the game, while others can lead to failure — just like in life, or legal practice. Without spoiling the experience for anyone for anyone who has not yet tried it, the most apparent skill that is necessary to achieve a successful result is teamwork. Simply put, this is a group activity, and teams that work well together towards the common goal of escape have the best chance of success.

It was very apparent to me, even as I was working with my team to try and get out of the room, that this would be a great summer associate event, for example — particularly if a firm wanted to test out how well the summer associates would interact with each other, or with their superiors, in a fun yet challenging setting. Atmospherics are important, and a well-designed escape room will generate a certain amount of anxiety, especially in that critical period before the first clue is uncovered or the first problem solved. Even once that rubicon is crossed, the anxiety shifts — from thinking that escape would be a hopeless task to a worry about completing all the necessary steps in time. This stress is precisely what makes this experience such a great learning tool, both for participants and observers.

Just as an escape-the-room outing would be good, productive fun for a summer associate outing, I can also see it as a great bonding experience for a trial team or small law firm. We all know how important it is to get out of the office as a group for a fun activity, and based on the conversation amongst my group afterwards, if we had been inclined to treat our experience as a piece of professional learning, we could easily have done so and taken some good lessons from it. It is hard to find experiences that combine both fun and opportunities for professional growth, and I am very curious to learn whether or not any law firms, or smaller groups within firms, have tried an escape the room experience for that purpose.

Ultimately, we all enjoy experiences that challenge us, while also letting us learn a little more about ourselves and the people we work with. Even the most cynical and antisocial lawyer has an interest in learning how their team members will react under pressure, and law firms always have an interest in learning which of their employees have leadership potential. While summer associate and other law firm events can sometimes lean towards passive group activities such as a trip to the theater or a sporting event, I think that an activity like escape the room provides a great opportunity for firms to sponsor a productive, yet fun, outing. Especially considering that more strenuous physical activities may not be appropriate for all lawyers, and yet another trip to a local bar will be less likely to foster the types of interactions that a challenging experience like escape the room can lead to. So I recommend the experience, and for anyone wondering — no, you can’t leave anyone locked in the room permanently, irrespective of how annoying you find them.

Yep, lawyers are getting soaked in the current Trump tax proposal, and no one’s getting soaked worse than the first-year associates.

NPR’s John Ydstie [writes up the new Trump tax proposal](http://www.npr.org/2016/11/13/501739277/who-benefits-from-donald-trumps-tax-plan), and in the end it’s the upper-middle-class professionals getting it the worst.

Right now, single tax filers pay 28 percent on income from $91,150 to $190,150. Income beyond that up to $413,350 gets taxed at 33 percent.

Trump’s plan would move all income over $112,500 to the 33 percent rate. So those associates making $180K and expecting to pay in the 28 percent bracket (except, probably, for their bonuses) just saw over 60 grand of their salaries experience a 5 percent rate hike. Sorry. And those of you at firms paying below market who thought, “well at least I pay less in taxes,” you’re screwed too.

Obviously this is bad news for all lawyers because making the marginal income rate break at $112,500 is brutal for higher incomes. That said, if you make more than $413,350, you’re on easy street: Trump’s fully eliminating the brackets above 33 percent. So now someone earning $112,500 a year is now in the same bracket as someone pulling down a multimillion-dollar salary.

What a time to be alive!

In case you wanted more good news, he’s also eliminating the $4,000 exemption for each person living in a household. So try not to have any kids either.

OK, back to your drudgery folks. Midterms are only two years away.

# Tucker Carlson And The Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Texts

My bank client had no tolerance whatsoever for those employees who cost it money. If an employee in the retail branches couldn’t or wouldn’t balance at the end of the day on several separate occasions or paid out money in error, termination was the next step after one or more PIPs (performance improvement plans) didn’t have the desired response. If the loss was ginormous, termination was immediate.

The employee handbook — which no one read except legal, HR, and opposing counsel — clearly explained performance expectations, and if the employee missed the mark and cost the client money, bye-bye. I occasionally wondered if the bar was too high for de minimis mistakes, but that was not my call. Sometimes I verbally sparred with decision-makers; sometimes I won, sometimes I lost. Sometimes a little “walking away money” in exchange for a release made sense; sometimes it didn’t. Those decisions were always fact specific. De minimis mistakes can lead to big whopping mistakes. It’s always a matter of risk versus reward.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
So the news that Tucker Carlson is out at Fox News is really no surprise when you analyze the situation from an employment lawyer’s perspective. Carlson was not the only one in the hot seat in the Dominion lawsuit, but he was not a minor player. And his flame-thrower-on-air personality contrasted, to a lesser or greater degree, with revelations of his private thoughts not helping his credibility. Previewing [coming attractions](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/tucker-carlson-litigation-supernova/), there’s the Smartmatic case and Abby Grossberg’s litigation in New York (hostile work environment) and Delaware (defamation).

I would guess that Rupert Murdoch, in addition to having to cough up a ginormous sum of money (and I would imagine that insurance and excess coverage carriers may well have contributed, although to what extent is unclear, since there were reservation of rights letters flying all over the place), wanted to tidy up Fox News. My sense is that Carlson may well only be the first to be shown the door. After all, it’s only Thursday.

There was no way that Murdoch would give Carlson the chance to say goodbye on air. Whether he had enough time to clean out his office before that office was secured, who knows. In a sense, Fox News has indeed apologized implicitly [by tagging Carlson](https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/media/tucker-carlson-fox-news/index.html) and making sure that the door didn’t hit him on the way out. Could it be said that Murdoch was “tuckered out” about Tucker?  Sorry, I couldn’t resist.

My fellow Above the Law columnist Mark Herrmann is spot on. If there is any takeaway from the Dominion lawsuit, it is “[don’t write stupid emails](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/3-final-thoughts-on-dominion-v-fox/).” It’s the lawyer mantra or should be. The lawyer tells the client that they are discoverable (unless privileged), that the same goes for text messages, and every form of written communication that can be retrieved, whether purportedly deleted or not. That’s what forensic IT people do for a living. Any difference between private and discoverable? We had one client who wrote every single email as “attorney-client privileged,” even though he was not a lawyer, the communication was not addressed to a lawyer, no lawyer was on the email trail, and so the general counsel had to woodshed him for his transgressions.

However, I am always amazed (although I shouldn’t be) that smart people do such stupid things, blowing off spot-on legal advice because they think that they are smarter than the lawyers. Everyone thinks that until they sit in a courtroom cringing at the defense table, sit for a deposition with opposing counsel drooling over stacks of emails ready for the deponent to be questioned on, or think that they can handle a matter without counsel only to be gobsmacked when the opposing party troops in with counsel ready for bear. (The last scenario happened to a friend of mine in the early 90s, who coincidentally happened to work for Fox at the time.)

Also out the door is CNN’s Don Lemon. Fired. While I had admired his comments after George Floyd, I did not appreciate his ageist, sexist remarks. He needed to go, and obviously CNN agreed. Why do some people think that being on broadcast TV, cable, or any other outlet gives them permission to say whatever they think without regard to consequences? There’s way too much of “ready, fire, aim.” Whatever happened to the days when it was “just the facts,” and viewers could draw their own conclusions based on unbiased reportage?

All this leads to dumbing down, to the idea that people must be spoon-fed. To a certain extent, we, the audience, have permitted that, and so we must share some of the blame, but notice that I said “some,” not all. Ego often gets in the way, so whatever filter they may have had is gone. Whatever happened to STFU?

Both Carlson and Lemon have “[lawyered up](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/tucker-carlson-don-lemon-same-lawyer/),” using the same counsel to represent them separately. Terminations can make strange bedfellows. I wonder where one or both will land — and land they will — eventually.

Leave it to [the late great Dame Edna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r3S5UKP7ME) to have a word, but not the last one. And if you don’t know who Dame Edna was, you need to wake up or should I say, “woke up.” (Except in Florida, of course.)

# Everyone Should Have Had The Day Off On January 2nd
## Partners may want to begin the new year with a bang and start billing hours, but it's time to give lawyers a break.

To be completely honest, I was not always in favor of observing holidays that fell over a weekend on the first Monday following that weekend. It seemed odd to me that holidays which were tied to a specific date, like the Fourth of July and New Year’s Day would be commemorated on a day other than the specified date. However, I had a wild New Year’s Eve that set me back for a few days. I was extremely thankful that many people observed January 2nd as a day off so that I did not need to respond to emails or otherwise work as hard on that date as usual.

However, I heard that some partners forced attorneys and staff to work on January 2nd, even though New Year’s Day occurred over the weekend and many employers were observing January 2nd as a day off. Some attorneys and staff seemingly even needed to be in offices on this day, which seems completely unnecessary since we all learned during the pandemic how to perform work remotely and because many people within the legal profession were not working that day. Although I can understand the desire of partners to begin the new year with a bang and start billing hours, law firms should uniformly observe holidays on days other than the assigned date if that date falls on a weekend.

The main reason why employers should observe holidays on weekdays if they fall on a weekend is to preserve the number of days off employees get every year. When you look at a list of federally recognized holidays, the list is pretty short. Sure, some states observe more holidays like Patriots Day and Lincoln’s Birthday in New York, but there are still only a dozen or so holidays for which employers typically give employees the day off. It is unfair if the number of days an employee gets off is inconsistent because of the calendar. Some employees do not work for an employer for long, and they might work for an employer during a year when more holidays fall on the weekend. Observing all of the holidays regardless of whether they fall on a weekend or a weekday helps establish consistency in the amount of work an employee is expected to perform in a given year.

Moreover, giving employees the day off if a holiday falls on a weekend helps workers recharge and be prepared for work when they return. Some of the holidays that might fall on a weekend due to the calendar might involve the type of merriment which could impact that worker’s ability to function the next day. For instance, it is not uncommon for people to celebrate July 4th, New Year’s, and other holidays to such an extent that the worker is out of commission for a little while. If workers needed to return to their jobs directly after such holidays, the quality of their work might be impacted, and employers can suffer a number of adverse consequences if their workers are not at the top of their game. Accordingly, it makes sense to ensure that workers always get a day off for a holiday, whether it falls on the weekend or not.

Some might argue that since employees and staff are usually entitled to vacation time, there is less need to observe a holiday on a weekday if that holiday happens to fall on a weekend. However, this belief ignores the reality of taking vacation at a law firm. Many people who work at law firms do not take vacation time. This is mainly due to the fact that attorneys and staff want to look good for bosses and taking little or no vacation time shows that a worker is perhaps more dedicated to his or her job than someone who takes more vacation. In addition, there may be significant financial consequences to taking vacation time. Some law firms pay attorneys and staff for unused vacation time when they leave a firm, so taking vacation might mean that attorneys and staff eventually lose money.

However, observing a holiday does not count as vacation time, so more people are likely to take the day off. In addition, since everyone at a firm is taking the day off, it is more likely that someone will not work on a firm-wide vacation. Accordingly, observing holidays is still important even if law firms have generous vacation policies.

All told, it took me a little while to understand the value of observing holidays during the week if they happen to fall on the weekend. Even if law firms have vacation policies, they should still observe all recognized holidays regardless of whether they fall on the weekend or during the week so that attorneys and staff can have a break.

# The Latest Biglaw Merger Is Sure To Be A 'Home Run'
## The new combined firm will be an IP powerhouse.

The Biglaw firm Venable is combining with the intellectual property boutique Fitzpatrick, Cella, Harper & Scinto. The merger will be effective on November 1, and at that time, the newly enlarged Venable will have an IP practice with 175 attorneys, one of the largest in the country. (The 104 Fitzpatrick Cella attorneys moving over will initially practice under the name Venable Fitzpatrick, while Venable will not change its name.)

As Law.com [reports](https://www.law.com/2018/08/21/venable-adds-100-lawyers-in-merger-with-new-yorks-fitzpatrick-cella/), management at Venable is excited about what the merger means for the firm:

“We’ve got a longstanding commitment both to New York and to the IP practice,” said Stu Ingis, Venable chairman, calling the merger “a home run for us.”

And all sides of the merger are looking at the combined firm to become a powerhouse in the IP field:

“Almost every client has legal needs in the IP space” and Venable will capture more work as an IP powerhouse, Ingis said.

Venable can benefit from Fitzpatrick’s strong pharmaceutical practice, while Venable has a prominent products liability practice that will benefit from the merger, [Dominick Conde, chair of the Fitzpatrick’s management committee] said. “We looked at it at a pretty granular level to identify those opportunities,” he said.

The financials for the already strong Venable (it is one of the few Biglaw firms that has not declined in profitability or per-lawyer revenue for any year over the last decade) are stellar — the combined firm looks to have revenue of over $620 million. And, as Am Law notes, it’s sure to move them up in the Am Law 100 rankings.

The merger is the largest one ever for both Venable and Fitzpatrick.

# The Biglaw Lateral Market Is FIRE Right Now
## The lateral market favors associates.

How happy are you at your current firm? Are you sure you’re really happy? I ask because, WOW, the market for lateral associates — particularly corporate transactions attorneys — is absolutely absurd right now.

In an effort to capture this sought-after talent, Biglaw firms are pulling out all the stops. We’re talking big signing bonuses for associates (Above the Law has anecdotally heard they’ve hit six figures), same-day offers, and the opportunity to work remotely with no set date for return to in-person work (Goodwin Procter is even willing to hire associates on [a permanent remote basis](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/goodwin-procter-hiring-remote-associates-amid-talent-battle)).

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
So where is this associate battle taking place? According to data by Decipher, a competitive intelligence firm, lateral movement in the most active 10 markets is up double digits in the first two months of 2021 compared to the four-year average. As [Law.com notes](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/04/01/same-day-hiring-and-signing-bonuses-the-corporate-associate-market-is-on-fire/):

In New York, for example, there are an average of 249 moves in the first two months of the year. This year, 313 associates lateraled—a 26% uptick. Los Angeles averages roughly 136 laterals. But in 2021, 167 associates have moved, representing an increase of 23%.

“I definitely feel like corporate associate recruiting is the busiest I’ve seen since I’ve started my business,” said legal recruiter Jason McCann, founder of Gridline Search + Consulting.

And as mentioned, corporate associates are really the ones benefitting from the boom:

“It started in the capital markets space, but now that demand has increased to M&A and finance associates and pretty much anybody that touches corporate transactions. In some ways, what we’re seeing in New York City is that demand is higher than it was pre-pandemic,” Ru Bhatt, partner in Major, Lindsey & Africa’s New York associate practice group, said.

All of a sudden, Biglaw’s [spring bonus trend](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/special-bonus-tracker-2021/) starts to make a lot more sense. While we’ve seen firms mix up the way the money gets handed out, many firms are backloading the payments. Keeping the lion’s share of the cash until later in the year just may be the firms’ best way to keep valuable associates in the jobs they currently have.

# Special Bonuses Announced At Biglaw Firm Involved In What Could Be Biggest Merger Of 2021
## Exciting news all around at this firm!

In case you’ve been too busy billing to realize, Thompson & Knight has been in the news recently. The firm is reportedly [considering a merger](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/biglaw-firms-in-talks-for-merger-that-could-create-one-of-the-largest-firms-in-america/) with Holland & Knight. The combined firm would have nearly 1,600 lawyers across 30 offices, making it one of the largest law firms in the country. The potential merger is one of the largest announced in 2021 yet.

Holland & Knight, the firm’s prospective merger partner, [announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/hk-special-bonuses/) special bonuses last week, and so did Thompson & Knight, which ranked 141st on the Am Law 200 with $217,856,000 gross revenue in 2019.

The firm, which “has always punched above its weight in quality and still does,” matched the bonus scale set by Davis Polk in March. Special bonuses will be available for eligible U.S. associates, and will be in addition to the firm’s annual bonuses that will be paid in March 2022. Here’s what the bonus scale looks like:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Spring	Fall	Total
Class of 2020	$4,500	$7,500	$12,000
Class of 2019	$6,000	$10,000	$16,000
Class of 2018	$12,000	$20,000	$32,000
Class of 2017	$16,500	$27,500	$44,000
Class of 2016	$19,500	$32,500	$52,000
Class of 2015	$22,200	$37,000	$59,200
Class of 2014	$24,000	$40,000	$64,000
According to a representative from the firm, spring bonuses will be paid in June to those who are on track to meet or exceed 1900 annualized billable and creditable hours, while fall bonuses will be paid in November under the same criteria. At this time, we’re unsure if associates will receive an opportunity to be made whole if they catch up on their billable hours at a later time.

Congrats to everyone at the firm — on the bonuses and on the potential merger.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Top 20 Firm Shares The Love -- Money, That Is -- With Hardworking Associates
## What's better than one raise? TWO!

[Cravath deciding](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cravath-raises-22/) to come over the top of the Davis Polk salary scale, which had already come over the top of the Milbank salary scale, has resulted in a wave of  re-raises across Biglaw. And it makes sense, especially given the hot lateral market, that no elite firm wants to be left in the dust giving out less money to the hardworking associates who make the firm tick.

The latest entrant in the 2022 re-raise bonanza is Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, a firm ranked at No. 14 in the most recent Am Law 100, having brought in $1,844,627,000 gross revenue in 2020. The latest salary scale at Simpson is as follows:



As with the last round of raises, these numbers will also be applied to their London associates. Good news on both sides of the pond!

You can read the [full memo on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/simpson-re-raise-22/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

# On Michelin-Starred Restaurants In Small Cities And Good Small Firms
## A new way of using rankings statistics will give law firms something to advertise.

[Kyoto](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/most-michelin-stars-city_n_1174996).

Although the data is a little old, that’s the big city with the most Michelin-starred restaurants per capita.

[Courchevel](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/most-michelin-stars-city_n_1174996) (wherever that is).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
That’s the small town with the most Michelin-starred restaurants per capita.  (I was just kidding.  Everyone knows that Courchevel is a ski town in France.  Either everyone knows it, or Google is a wonderful thing.)

I was thinking about collecting similar data for law firms.

We all know that Bigg & Mediocre has 100 lawyers who are ranked in their field by Chambers or the Legal 500!  But Bigg & Mediocre has 3,000 lawyers, for heaven’s sake.  If you pick up the phone, call B&M, and ask for a lawyer, you have about a three percent chance of talking to someone who’s any good.

Okay, okay: I admit this is all silly.  First, Chambers and the Legal 500 call folks and ask respondents to identify lawyers who are good in their field.  That’s hardly a perfect system.  (Sometimes, it’s even worse than that.  The raters sometimes ask firms to identify in-house lawyers who can give feedback on the firm’s work.  How many lawyers at firms couldn’t identify at least a couple of in-house lawyers who would say something nice about them?  Name your brother-in-law, for heaven’s sake, or your cousin.)  This process creates a bias in favor of big firms, and it doesn’t necessarily extract information from anyone who’s in a position to judge lawyering skills.  Additionally, reputation is sticky: You might have been a great lawyer 10 years ago; the ratings guide may insist that you’re still good 30 years from now, long after you’ve retired and met your maker.

Second, nobody is silly enough to call Bigg & Mediocre and ask for a lawyer.  That’s a crapshoot if ever there was one.  The local managing partner to whom your call is directed will think, “Eureka!  Jarndyce hasn’t billed a minute of time in the last 18 months.  Now this clown is calling and asking me for the name of a lawyer!  I’ll sing the praises of Jarndyce and finally put Jarndyce to work after all this time.  I don’t really care about the new client anyway; it’s not a long-time institutional client, so I’ll give this client what it deserves.”

(Do you think I’ve been playing this game for too long, or what?)

In any event, why isn’t some firm advertising that it has the largest percentage of Chambers-ranked lawyer per capita?

That may not say much, but it says something.

To people who are convinced by the ratings system, that statistic says that the firm is the most consistently high-quality joint that you could hire.  If you get assigned a random lawyer at Small & Grate, the lawyer is likely to be pretty good.  If you hire a specific lawyer at Small & Grate, the randomly selected rest of the team is likely to be pretty good.

That statistic also gives law firms something to advertise.

Firms are regularly boasting that they have “100 Lawyers Ranked By Chambers” or “30 Illinois Super Lawyers” or “50 Lawyers In The Legal 500” or “We Recently Hired A Lateral Who You Never Heard Of In Some City You Don’t Care About.”

I think my boast is just as good: “Lawyer For Lawyer, We Were Just Rated The Best In The World!”

Come on, admit it: That’s not bad.

And my boast would work for lots of firms: The best in the country according to Chambers; the best in each of the 50 states according to Chambers; the best in the country according to the Legal 500; the best in each of the 50 states according to the Legal 500; the same for The Best Lawyers In America, and Super Lawyers, and probably a couple of other lawyer-rating outfits that aren’t coming to mind.

Come on, guys!  You’re missing a trick.

Count up the number of accolades per capita and start boasting!

# Biglaw Firm To Offer Counseling Services At The Office
## The firm should be applauded for this service.

In a great move for Biglaw, Akin Gump is offering employees access to a behavioral assistance counselor at the office. The pilot program offers on-site counseling one day a week and is currently only available in the firm’s D.C. headquarters, but there are plans to roll it out to all 20 of Akin’s offices.

The firm began the program last month, and it’s already a success. The counselor is already booked through June. As[ reported](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/05/15/akin-gump-adds-on-site-counseling-as-firms-fret-over-mental-health/) by Law.com, Akin Gump chief operating officer Sally King is pleased with how quickly everyone at the firm have taken to the new resource:

“I think it was a called-for resource and we responded to the call, and we’ve been very pleased with the uptake of it,” King said.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The firm has a personal motivation for the program since an associate [died by suicide in 2013,](http://www.daveneefoundation.org/programs/starr-initiative-on-character-and-fitness/) but the larger [mental health issues](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-struggle/) in the industry also compelled them to act:

“We recognize that it’s an issue not just for our firm but for the industry, and [we want to] be as transparent about this as we are about everything else,” King said.

Given how [notoriously busy](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/this-lawyer-probably-billed-more-hours-than-you/) lawyers are, this is a perfect opportunity to let employees prioritize their own mental health and let the entire firm know it’s prioritized by the powers that be, too.

This isn’t the first firm that has taken a bold move [in support of their employees’ mental health](https://www.wsj.com/articles/law-firms-finally-say-its-ok-to-see-a-therapist-1495381847); hopefully more Biglaw firms get on-board with this important service.

Layoffs are continuing to percolate through the legal industry. Will they stay contained to a few firms with hard hit clients or are we seeing the beginning of widespread firings?

Meanwhile, Jones Day has another brush with the Streisand Effect, leading the panel to have to explain who Barbra Streisand is to our youngest member.

# Smooth Sailings On The Lateral Partner Market
## The lateral partner market remains steady yet again.

Michael Allen

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://bit.ly/2KxFPa6) team of expert contributors. [Michael Allen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelallen/) is the CEO of Lateral Link. He is based in the Los Angeles office and focuses exclusively on Partner and General Counsel placements for top firms and companies. Prior to founding Lateral Link in 2006, he worked as an attorney at both Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and Irell & Manella LLP. Michael graduated summa cum laude from the University of California, San Diego before earning his JD, cum laude, from Harvard Law School.

In contrast to the chaos predominating the New York Times headlines over the last year, the lateral partner market remains steady yet again.

Corporate and Litigation practices make up the bulk of the movement given their comparative sizes, and both are up significantly, both by about 20 percent. Tax attorneys seem to in a holding pattern as they wait to see how Trump’s late 2017 tax revisions impact their practice. The Bankruptcy lateral partner is also significantly more active. Interestingly, bankruptcy filings are not up compared to the six-month period last year.


Partner departures from Biglaw has also decreased over the last year by 18 percent. Fewer partners are retiring or leaving Biglaw, which can create logjams for senior associates hoping to make partner as we’ve[ discussed before](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/mandatory-retirement-creates-succession-planning-problems-for-top-law-firms/). This jam could break at any moment though, creating a massive void and greatly increasing the demand for lateral partners in the coming years, but so far, things are holding steady.

Only 45 firms brought on more partners than they lost through retirement and lateral poaching in 2018. However, the year prior, only 32 firms performed the same feat. Akerman was the winner this year, growing their partner ranks by a net of 15 through the lateral market. On the other end of the spectrum, Hunton Andrews Kurth had 48 more partners depart the firm than they brought in, not surprising in the wake of their recently consummated merger.


Overall, DLA Piper had an impressive year, bring in 35 lateral partners, 4 standard deviations above the mean of 6.1 lateral acquisitions for Am Law 200 firms. However, they also lost 41 partners through lateral attrition, retirement, and more, but managed to quell their losses well. Polsinelli, Lewis Brisbois, and Akerman also had impressive years, bringing in 33 lateral partners each.

We expect the second half of the year to bring more moves, but not quite at the same frenetic pace as the first half of the year. Typically, we see lateral movement drop from summer to winter as partners hold on to collect year-end bonuses, which also makes it one of the best times to move. Firm demand for partners exceed the lateral supply in the second half of the year given bonus and profit distribution season, making it the most viable time to lateral to your dream firm. If you are looking to make a move our team at Lateral Link will leverage our contacts and market knowledge to get you to the firm you need to go to.

# Vaccine Mandates Are Trending Across Biglaw Firms
## Shots in arms to keep lawyers and staff safe from Delta's harms.

We keep saying that the times we’re living in now are “post-pandemic,” but that seems to be far from the truth. COVID-19 continues to rage on across the United States, and the Delta variant now accounts for about 93 percent of all coronavirus infections in the country. Biglaw firms are now getting serious about prevention and protection, and many are now mandating vaccines for all.

Thus far, the firms that have made vaccination a requirement for those returning to the office include [Akin Gump](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-will-require-employees-to-be-vaccinated-some-push-back-reopening-dates/), [Arent Fox](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Clifford Chance](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/elite-firm-will-require-vaccination-but-other-reopening-policies-are-very-flexible/), [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/top-20-biglaw-firm-wont-make-lawyers-return-to-office-in-2021-but-vaccines-will-be-required/), [Crowell & Moring](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-will-require-employees-to-be-vaccinated-some-push-back-reopening-dates/), [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/davis-polk-to-deactivate-building-id-cards-of-unvaccinated-lawyers-and-staff/), [Davis Wright Tremaine](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/the-first-biglaw-firm-to-announce-a-covid-19-vaccination-plan/), [Dickinson Wright](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Fenwick & West](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Fried Frank](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Goodwin](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-will-require-employees-to-be-vaccinated-some-push-back-reopening-dates/), [Hanson Bridgett](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Hueston Hennigan](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Lowenstein Sandler](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/lowenstein-covid-vaccine/), [McDermott Will & Emery](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-will-require-employees-to-be-vaccinated-some-push-back-reopening-dates/), [Mintz](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/unvaccinated-lawyers-will-not-be-allowed-to-enter-this-biglaw-firm/), [Paul Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/paul-weiss-vaccine/), [Reed Smith](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Ropes & Gray](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/top-biglaw-firms-chair-beseeches-lawyers-staff-to-get-vaccinated/), [Sanford Heisler](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/this-firm-will-require-lawyers-staff-to-be-vaccinated-before-returning-to-work-or-else/), [Schiff Hardin](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), and [Weil Gotshal](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/weil-reopening/). Now, we can add another two firms to the list. Norton Rose Fullbright and Patterson Belknap have both added a vaccination mandate to their safety protocols.

Patterson Belknap seems to have been ahead of the curve when it comes to vaccination requirements for its workforce, announcing that as of early last month (July 6, to be exact), everyone who entered the firm’s office “must be fully vaccinated subject to medical or religious accommodations under applicable law.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Norton Rose will be limiting U.S. office access to those “who are fully vaccinated.” Although the firm is sill planning to return to its office in September, it will be “continually monitoring the situation and evaluating this timeline.” NRF’s vaccine requirement is new as of this week, in response to “a dramatic increase in COVID-19 cases among unvaccinated individuals.”

Will your firm be changing its plans when it comes to vaccination for attorneys and staff thanks to the Delta variant? Please let us know. The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to the office.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# A Letter To A New Associate: 2022 Edition

It’s September, and the signs of autumn are here. Kids are back in school, pumpkin spice is back on the menu at Starbucks, and the latest crop of first-year associates are showing up for work at law firms across the country. And it’s to those new attorneys that this column is most directed.

If you can name an emotion, you’re probably going to be feeling it sometime in the next few months. Joy, confusion, anxiety, fear, stress, triumph. These first steps on the journey of your practice will be rich with experiences, many of which you’ll carry for the rest of your career. With that in mind, here are some thoughts from a former first-year associate on how to make this next year everything you want it to be.

Last summer was all about landing a job, and guess what? You did it. A law firm composed of experienced, successful attorneys has given you its vote of confidence and is willing to pay for your work. They’re going to train you to become a better lawyer, and, if everything goes well, they may one day offer you a share of the partnership. You’re through the first major challenge of any lawyer’s career — you’re getting paid.

These first few months are going to be filled with challenges, and you’re probably not going to crush it on every one of them. You’re going to be given a lot of opportunity to doubt yourself, and if you’re prone to imposter syndrome, the transition out of school and into the actual practice of law can be deeply difficult. Self-reflection is a useful tool, but self-doubt isn’t. Don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t do this, especially yourself. You’ve got a long way to go, but you’ve come a long way, too. Remember that, and trust yourself that you’re going to grow, get better, and make it through.

Become Someone’s Go-To

Success in the world of private law boils down to one essential question: when people have problems, which of those people calls you first? If enough of the right people think of you as their go-to solution for the challenges they’ll pay someone else to fix, then baby, you’ve got a book of business.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Chances are you’re not there quite yet, but the goal of becoming someone’s go-to person is still what you should be aiming for. Instead of paying clients, what you’re trying to develop now are relationships with the partners and senior associates within your firm. When they need research, briefing, or other work that’s in the first-year’s wheelhouse, you want them thinking of you as their first option. Even if you’re not charging them by the hour, your colleagues are your first clients. Be responsive, respectful, and attentive to their needs.

Once you’ve got those relationships established, you’ll naturally start moving on to the next phase of developing your go-to reputation: becoming a subject matter guru. As senior attorneys learn to trust you more, you can gain the experience necessary to take on more complex tasks. If you do that, then chances are you’re going to start developing expertise on topics that few in your firm, or potentially your entire bar, have experience with. Find those niches, develop your expertise, and then let the market know that anyone with questions in that area just needs to give you a call. Once the attorneys know you’re the person to handle a certain kind of problem, they’ll send their clients who need help with those problems over. And once the clients start calling you, you’re in control of your own destiny. All of that starts today. Be the one who people keep top of mind and rely on to solve their problems.

Be Deliberate About Your Work-Life Balance

The first years of private practice in law are notoriously demanding of young attorneys’ time, and discussions about the proper balance of work and home life have been part and parcel of Biglaw life for decades. Most of the financial and career incentives of law (and basically all of the business world) push attorneys to work extraordinarily hard, while few things besides ourselves are pushing us to take appropriate care of our outside lives or our mental and physical well-being. Burnout is real, but so are the benefits that come from getting off to a strong start. There are no one-size-fits-all answers when it comes to work-life balance.

The best you can do for yourself at this stage is to be deliberate and have a plan. Some people want to work all hours of the day, generate huge bonuses, and live the life of the hard-charging Biglaw attorney, and that’s OK if that’s their choice to do so. Some people want to work hard for a few years while they’re young, then transition to a more balanced lifestyle as their skill and experience have hopefully increased enough to compensate for those lower billables. Some people choose to prioritize their home lives out of the gate, even if it means their career development may be on a slower track, because that’s what matters the most to them. Any of those choices can be the right one for you, and they’re all approaches that I would hope your firms would be willing to support within reason.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Don’t drift along in your career wherever happenstance takes you. The key for you is to figure out your priorities, self-assess on whether you’re where you want to be, and communicate with your colleagues about where you want to go. If your home life or mental health are suffering and you need to step back, talk to the people who can make that happen. If you’re feeling fresh and want to dive in harder, let people know. You’ve worked hard to get this job, so keep working at making sure it’s the job you want.

Every Impression Matters

 The opportunity to make a first impression is a gift, and you’re about to be flooded with those opportunities. Now is when you start building your reputation as a professional, as an attorney, as a colleague, as opposing counsel, and it is entirely within your control to ensure the reputation you’re building is a good one. Treat people kindly and courteously. Do your homework. Treat everyone you meet like they might one day become one of the most important people in your lives because life is unpredictable and they very well might be.

We’re only clean slates at so many times in our lives. Now is when you get to build the story of who you are. It’s about to be one of the most exciting times in your career, and I hope you look back on it one day fondly. Until then, take care of yourself. The rest will follow.

# America's No. 2 Biglaw Firm Finally Gets On Board With Vaccination For All
## Almost 100% of employees are vaccinated, but almost isn't good enough for this firm.

COVID-19’s Delta variant has really changed what the legal landscape will look like this fall. Dozens of large law firms were hoping for a safe reopening of their offices, but now their proposed restart dates are being pushed back and vaccine mandates are on the table at firms across the country to stop the spread of the deadly virus.

Some firms have taken longer than others to make a move on the vaccination front. It was just last week that Dentons, the world’s largest law firm, decided to announce a [mandatory vaccination policy](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/dentons-vaccination/?rf=1) for all U.S. employees. Now, it looks like another Biglaw heavyweight has officially opted in for vaccination for all employees.

Latham — the No. 2 firm in the country, having taken home $4,333,763,000 gross revenue in 2020 — recently notified all U.S. employees must be vaccinated. According to a memo sent by the firm’s executive committee on September 1 (available in full on the next page), Latham attorneys and staff must have at least received either a single-dose vaccine or the first of a two-dose vaccine by September 13. All U.S. personnel must be fully vaccinated by October 18, and must provide proof of each vaccination dose to the firm.

The executive committee also reported on Latham personnel’s dedication to the health and wellness of their colleagues and communities:

Vaccinations are critical to providing a safe workplace for all, and we are pleased to share that 95% of the firm’s US personnel (including virtually 100% of US partners) have verified to the firm that they are fully vaccinated. Thank you to everyone who has contributed to the successful outcome.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to the office.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# The Biglaw Firms That Strike Fear In The Hearts Of Opposing Counsel (2023)
## These firms are home to the most cutthroat litigators out there.

If you’re working in-house and dealing with bet-the-company litigation, you want the very best litigators in the world to be on your side — especially during times like these. You want a firm with litigators so strong that opponents gasp in fear at the very mention of its name. You want a firm that is known internationally for going for the jugular and coming out on top.

But how can you ensure that you’ve picked the right firm? BTI Consulting Group just made it a little easier with the release of its annual ranking of the firms most likely to trigger dread in opposing counsel, as determined by a poll of in-house counsel. After reviewing all responses, BTI named the “Fearsome Foursome,” the most-feared litigation firms in the country. These are the firms you do not want to see on the other side.

So, which firms are being [honored this year](https://bticonsulting.com/themadclientist/the-46-firms-most-feared-in-litigation) for their ability to strike fear in their opponents’ hearts and minds?

Per BTI’s Michael Rynowecer, this is why these firms give GCs nightmares:

1. Valorous
Bringing great courage in the face of high risk, danger, and uncharted waters. They relish the challenge and opportunity.

2. Savvy and Super Smart
Thinking quickly, spotting patterns, able to decipher and launch multiple strategies and can bring together all they learn as they go.

3. Energized<
The fight brings out more energy. Increased challenge breathes new vitality into the Fearsome Foursome.

4. Mobilized
Acting expeditiously — swift but thought out. Always with the right resources. The ability to think on their feet helps makes this happen.

5. Unabating
The Fearsome Foursome just don’t give up.

The BTI report also named 16 firms as “Awesome Opponents” — firms with lawyers corporate counsel would prefer to steer clear of in litigation (in alphabetical order):

Congratulations to all of these hardworking firms, and good luck to those who oppose them in court — it certainly sounds like you’ll need it.

# The List Of Biglaw Firms At Least Trying To Care About Diversity
## Congratulations to the firms that are working to make the legal profession a little more diverse.

Year two of Mansfield certification has rolled around and it’s time to check in and see which firms have made a commitment to diversity. For those of you who might not be tracking the initiative, a brief history lesson.

[In 2017](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/get-ready-for-the-biglaw-rooney-rule-as-firms-try-to-actually-do-something-about-diversity/?rf=1), the idea was formed at a Diversity Lab event to really hold Biglaw firms accountable for their lofty diversity goals. Modeled after the NFL’s Rooney Rule, which requires teams to interview a minority candidate for head coach or general manager vacancies, the idea — first proposed by a team of Biglaw lawyers represented at the event by Mark Helm, a partner at Munger, Tolles & Olson — was to create a system to encourage Biglaw firms to consider women or minority candidates for leadership roles at the firm. The rule — named for Arabella Mansfield, the first woman admitted to practice law in the U.S. — asks firms to consider two or more candidates who are women, LGBTQ+, or attorneys of color when hiring for leadership and governance roles, promotions to equity partner, and hiring lateral attorneys. To be considered “Mansfield Certified” by Diversity Lab, a firm needs to show that 30 percent of the candidate pool for these positions are diverse.

For this second year of the certification process, Diversity Lab has added LGBTQ+ to its diverse designations, and in next year’s list, they plan to include disability into their definition of diversity. And they’re [reportedly](https://www.law.com/2019/09/03/diversity-initiative-names-64-firms-mansfield-2-0-certified/) pushing to become increasingly more diverse as the Mansfield Rule ages:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“Our plan is to raise the bar each year,” said Lisa Kirby, Diversity Lab chief intelligence and knowledge sharing officer, in a statement. “It’s especially meaningful to lead this initiative this year because it marks the 150th anniversary of Arabella Mansfield’s becoming the first woman admitted to a U.S. bar association.”

Last year, the[ inaugural list](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/these-biglaw-firms-are-officially-diversity-certified/?rf=1) of Mansfield Certified firms had 41 entries, though an additional 50 claimed to be in the process of obtaining certification. This year’s list sees 64 firms claim their certification:

Hilarie Bass

Co-president of Biglaw firm Greenberg Traurig, Hilarie Bass, is leaving the firm that began her career over 35 years ago to start a non-profit, the Bass Institute on Diversity and Inclusion, focused on issues facing women and minorities in the workplace. Bass, who just ended her one year term as President of the American Bar Association, will be concluding her tenure at Greenberg Traurig at the end of this year.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2018/09/12/bye-bye-big-law-greenberg-traurig-co-president-hilarie-bass-is-stepping-down-to-start-a-nonprofit/) Law.com, Bass is leaving a legacy at the firm she started at as a summer associate:

At Greenberg Traurig, Bass’ mentor was Mel Greenberg, one of the international law firm’s three co-founders. Over the course of her 37-year tenure, Bass served in a number of prestigious positions. Prior to being appointed as co-president in 2013, she spent eight years as the chair of the firm’s 600-member litigation department. She also founded the firm’s Women’s Initiative, aimed at empowering other women to excel in the legal field as she had. In total, she spent more than 20 years on Greenberg Traurig’s executive committee.

Despite the recent wave of prominent attorneys leaving Greenberg Traurig ([earlier this summer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/06/25/greenberg-traurig-restructuring-team-jumps-to-omelveny-in-ny/) three partners, including co-head of the restructuring and bankruptcy practice Nancy Mitchell, departed for O’Melveny & Meyers), Bass is leaving the firm on good terms — it probably doesn’t hurt that she’s leaving to start a non-profit, not going to a competitor:

“As one of the premier trial lawyers in the country, Hilarie has been a tremendous trailblazer and mentor throughout her career at Greenberg Traurig, while leading the largest practice group in the firm to great success,” Richard A. Rosenbaum, Greenberg Traurig’s executive chair, wrote in a statement released Wednesday. “She will be greatly missed, as we are extremely proud of the work Hilarie has done, and will continue to do as she takes on issues of great importance to the profession and really to all organizations where women and minorities face unique challenges. We are sure we will continue to collaborate and support each other for years to come.”

Bass’s statement on her career change focuses on the passion she has about diversity and inclusion issues, saying, “Speaking out on these topics and talking granularly about what we need to do is critical to ensure we are not having this discussion 37 years from now.” She also expressed appreciation for the support she’s gotten from her soon-to-be-former firm:

In the statement regarding her departure, Bass wrote, “As much as l love my clients, cases and colleagues, nothing is more important to me than this work. I will be forever grateful to the firm, and my friends and colleagues at Greenberg Traurig for the years of support and the many opportunities provided to me by them.”

Congratulations to Bass on her important new career path!

# alt.legal: Real Talk With Unilever's Head Of Legal Ops

Last week, I heard a general counsel give a talk about the radical things he’s done to shake up his legal department. I was really into his talk, but then he said that his first and perhaps most important hire was a head of legal operations.

Legal operations? Really?

Look, I’ve heard a lot about in-house departments and law firms operationalizing their work, bringing best practices from the business world to the practice, at long last. And I’m all about borrowing from business—[my company](http://legalsolutions.thomsonreuters.com/law-products/solutions/legal-outsourcing-services) implements Lean Six Sigma practices into our processes.

But sometimes, legal operations feels like more bark than bite. Are partners really going to bend their work schedules and deadlines to a law firm’s certified project management office? Are in-house counsel going to jam their strategic judgment into a GANTT chart? I’ve seen where legal ops can work, but I remained skeptical.

Fast forward to this week. I’ve been in London this week, meeting with clients, which gave me the chance to meet [Saswata Mukherjee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saswata-mukherjee-531902b), Global Legal Operations Director at the consumer products behemoth, [Unilever](https://www.unilever.com/) ([€53.3 b in 2015](https://www.unilever.com/Images/q4-2015-full-announcement_tcm244-470010_en.pdf)). I appreciated meeting him for his easygoing personality and candor. I asked him for this interview, and he agreed, which I also appreciated.

The next day, we met for coffee and I got to pick his brain. I now have an even greater appreciation for him, and for what legal operations can do.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Saswata Mukherjee: There’s always a lot of conversation around legal operations, but it’s tough to actually execute on it. I put my hand up for that job, and now I am the global head of legal operations and a member of the legal management team.

Ed Sohn: What are the ways you contribute to the legal department at Unilever?

SM: Let’s start with external provider management, like alternative services from providers like you. I look at who we work with, how to work with them, where we have opportunities, and importantly, how to get our law firms involved with them.

ES: Do outside counsel ever show any attitude about that? I expect that when you get law firms involved with alternative legal providers, you might get some friction.

SM: No real attitude, but sometimes people are reluctant. We need every firm and provider to be able to explain their value. And firms ultimately have to start to understand our priority on collaboration.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
ES: Collaboration? Not as easy as it sounds.

SM: We really do require and value collaboration. There will always be some people who may not want to collaborate, but ultimately, we still make it happen. For example, on a project a while back, we asked three different law firms to contribute to a single draft. They all worked on it and got it done. They all claimed some inefficiencies due to the arrangement, but I didn’t see that on the bills.

ES: How do you decide to do things like that? Just experimentation?

SM: Well, primarily, we look first at simplification. That’s another area my job covers: simplification and efficiency. That really means questioning everything you do, how it’s being done, and ultimately, whether the outcome is always providing value to our legal department.

It’s not about adding another layer. Usually we start with what we should stop doing. Do we really need to approve every time someone wants to put some kind of artwork on the back of any Unilever package? We’re happy to work with our branding people to establish broader legal guidance. What about RFPs? How often is that heavy process providing real value for legal?

After knowing what you should stop, you can then decide what you should outsource, and finally, what you should do more of.

ES: In the midst of that simplification exercise, how does the business play a role?

SM: People often don’t understand that the best in-house legal function is to be within the business. The business doesn’t come to you and look at you as a pure lawyer. The business requires business judgment from a legal perspective, then the pure lawyering comes next.

The business drives what legal needs to become. To that end, in-house teams have to keep innovation moving forward, and the support for that has to be there from outside counsel and providers.

ES: So in a sense, we’re back to collaboration again.

SM: Yes. Collaboration has to be internal, as well as external.

ES: How do you get your huge legal department to buy into all of this, including the collaborative effort?

SM: That leads me to a third area I cover in my job: training and learning. Here at Unilever, we’re very proud of our Legal Academy, which is a formal training and learning program. As part of it, we emphasize soft skills that lawyers need, including collaboration — internal collaboration with your teammates and collaboration that spans the globe.

People often say that lawyers don’t need to know what the law is all the time; they need to know where they can find it. Sometimes it’s not “where” the law is so much as “who” has it. Our legal team worldwide is around five hundred people, including compliance and patent professionals, so it’s very possible that someone else can help with what you’re working on.

ES: Is there space for technology to help?

SM: Ah, that’s my final area of coverage: evaluating and understanding technology. Technology can be a difficult thing for corporate legal departments, because it’s tough to get influence over where other areas of the business have a need. There’s a lot of uncertainty around whether we have the right technology to meet legal needs. Recently, we’re trying to reach out more to legal technology providers, to get solutions built specifically for legal.

But technology won’t solve everything. You need the right process and people around it. If you make investments into specific technology but don’t have the right people to operate it, it could really be a waste.

ES: What’s an example of something that’s worked for you?

SM: I’m not just saying this because you’re with Thomson Reuters, but [Serengeti](http://www.serengetilaw.com/Pages/default.aspx) [now Thomson Reuters Legal Tracker] has been really great for us. Getting visibility and data on spend changes how we can manage our firms and providers. I can now go to outside counsel and review how they are allocating their effort, because I have the data.

Overall, technology has the potential to be really disruptive, and it’s not moved at the pace that we’ve thought it would. I really am unsure of what’s possible, but whatever happens, it will be fast. It will happen in five years, not ten.

# Power Niche Marketing: Marketing Motivation -- And Where to Get It

I am interrupting my stream of articles on Power Niche Marketing to talk about something that is incredibly difficult for most people: developing the motivation to actually do the sales and marketing that is necessary to develop a successful legal career.

To start, consider the reason not to do anything:

If you work eight hours in a day on billable legal work, you get paid for the eight hours – end of story. No particular upside, but not much downside either.

If you don’t work that day on billable legal work but do work in the nature of marketing, it may turn out to be worth nothing or, if it is worth something, it is nebulous and off in the future. This means that at least on a short-term basis you probably aren’t going to get paid for your work that day.

So it seems like a no-brainer. If you have billable work to do, you should put that first, and if there is leftover time, then you should do some marketing.

However – alas – that is a sure-fire recipe to keep your “job” but have long-term career failure.

Now here I am not telling you anything you don’t already know. All of my prior articles have touched on this concept – I have told you things like “get out and about” – “don’t just sit there” – “build a power niche.”

And, intellectually, you know full well that you have to do this or you will end up not having clients and toiling away in the back room, etc. However, it has been a long day – you are tired – you want to see your family – and you could always do the marketing “tomorrow.”  And so the years pass……

What do you do about this?

Being honest, I have absolutely no idea…..

This is something you just have to decide to do and just do it.

And it is really hard to do – i.e., to change your behavior to exit what is likely a comfort zone into a place where you are uncomfortable.

Even though I don’t have anything to say here that is different from the typical “motivation” or “how-to” book, I will make one point, which is that it is a lot easier to train yourself to do what you need to do on marketing early in your career than later. The more you get set in your ways the harder it is to change behavior.

So maybe that is my advice here…. pretend that on the first day of work your boss told you “if you don’t bring in a client in the next twelve months, you will be fired…..”

Pretend that is what happened and act accordingly.

If you are more senior in your career, I guess you could do the exact same thing but it will just be harder to do. Pretend your boss/managing partner came in and said you have twelve months to bring in a client or you are out!

In either of these cases, of course you don’t know if you will actually be able to bring in a client; however, I suspect you will do what is most important; namely, change your behavior to be an appropriate mixture of legal work and marketing.

And your career will be enhanced.

If I were Tony Robbins, I would end by saying here, “You can do it!”

Former president Donald Trump has already been indicted twice this year– New York tagged him over financial crimes related to the Stormy Daniels hush money and he’s got a federal indictment over his handling of classified documents. But it is incredibly likely there’s at least one more coming. Trump announced to the world he got a target letter from special counsel Jack Smith’s investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol which pretty much means an [indictment is on the way.](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/biglaw-partner-gets-brutally-honest-about-donald-trumps-latest-legal-woes/)

But inquiring — and impatient — minds want to know WHEN it is coming.

Hogan Lovells partner and former acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal appeared on MSNBC to discuss the timing of a potential indictment. Given Trump’s trigger finger on social media he thinks Smith is pretty much ready to go on the indictment, saying, “So, I do think his ducks are probably all in a row.”

He continued:

“For Jack Smith to send that letter, he had to be pretty sure he was going to indict, and indict soon,” Katyal said. “So I expect this week. But look, could it be next week or the week after? You know, absolutely.”

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Biglaw Firms Better Match The New Salary Scale ASAP If They Want To Retain Their Talent
## The lateral hiring market is white-hot right now, so firms better give associates 200K+ reasons to stay.

Firms have been busier than ever and this is one way to demonstrate an appreciation for their associates, but also to show more broadly the long-term financial strength of the firm. Compensation increases are a permanent change and I expect that the firms that see long-term financial growth will increase their salaries as well.

On the other side of the coin, the competition for talent is fierce. The firms that are aggressively hiring will likely match so that they will be able to retain and attract talent. Associates take into consideration whether a firm matches salaries and/or bonuses when they are deciding to stay or leave their firm, as it speaks volumes of their long-term financial outlook and how these firms value their associates given the number of hours they have been putting in.

— [Summer Eberhard](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/summer-eberhard?byconsultantorauthor=summer-eberhard), West Coast-based managing director in the associate practice group at legal recruiter Major Lindsey & Africa, commenting on [Milbank’s move on associate compensation](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/milbank-raises-21/) that will bring first-year salaries to $200,000 and eighth-year salaries to $355,000. Two firms have [already](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/we-have-our-first-match-of-the-new-biglaw-compensation-scale/) [matched](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/cwt-match/) the new scale, but they’re not usually so quick so do so. What are peer firms waiting for? “Based on past precedent, I think that firms will wait for a response from some of the usual suspects that have been known to lead the charge,” Eberhard said. “They may come over the top or match. Once these firms respond, other firms will follow.”

# Elite Biglaw Firm Opens Suburban Offices As Part Of New 'Work-Near-Home' Strategy
## Say bye-bye to that long commute!

As the U.S. deals with yet another wave of COVID infections thanks to the omicron variant, Biglaw firms are trying to figure out what their “new normal” will look like. For some firms, it involves permanent work-from-home flexibility, and for others, it involves a hybrid theory of office work mixed with working from home. For other firms still, the “new normal” involves opening offices in the ‘burbs so that associates and partners alike need not worry about whether the commute is worth it — after all, they’ll be working near home.

This is the plan that Greenberg Traurig — ranked at No. 16 in the most recent Am Law 100, with $1,730,230,000 gross revenue in 2020 — currently has in the works. The elite firm will soon be opening two office locations in Long Island. According to the firm’s press release, its expansion will make it the first global firm to establish a substantial presence there. Greenberg Traurig’s new offices will be in Bridgehampton and Garden City, and each will be home to about 20 lawyers with strong ties to the area.

Richard A. Rosenbaum, the firm’s executive chairman, has said that in 2021, Greenberg Traurig had its “most successful year in … history by every measure,” with revenue topping $2 billion for the first time ever. The firm is celebrating with the introduction of its new “work-near-home” policy. As Rosenbaum explains in the firm’s press release:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“With the current expansion to Long Island, our five locations across the New York metropolitan area will now deliver a new kind of ‘hybrid’ model that will permit a better work-life experience for our attorneys and staff and greater convenience and value for our clients for the long term. We combine the benefits intrinsic to in-office work, such as camaraderie, collaboration, culture, innovation, and apprenticeship, with the flexibility and convenience to work-near-home. Additionally, our market professionals will have ready access to our state-of-the-art Manhattan office and its thoughtfully designed conference facility and visitors’ workspaces.”

If you’re considering making a move in this hot lateral market, would a firm that’s taking the commute out of your work day rank higher on your list? Let’s see if this new strategy works out well for Greenberg Traurig.

# Congratulations To Skadden's 12 New Partners

The new class of Skadden partners (via @SkaddenArps on Twitter).

This year seems to be off to a strong start for Skadden Arps. In the first quarter of 2017, the firm showed up near the top of the global and domestic M&A league tables of both [Thomson Reuters](http://dmi.thomsonreuters.com/Content/Files/1Q2017_Global_MA_Legal_Advisors.pdf) and [Mergermarket](https://www.mergermarket.com/pdf/MergermarketLegalLeagueTableReport.Q12017.pdf). And the second quarter is off to a good start, with Skadden advising JAB Holding Company in its recently announced [acquisition of Panera](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/business/dealbook/panera-bread-jab-.html) (try their celebrated [chocolate chip cookies](http://elitedaily.com/envision/paneras-chocolate-chip-cookie-recipe/1408149/)).

Continuing the good news, yesterday the firm welcomed [12 lawyers into its partnership](https://www.skadden.com/news-events/skadden-names-new-partners-2017):

We are pleased to announce that the following attorneys have become partners of the firm:

Faiz Ahmad – Mergers and Acquisitions – Wilmington
Ryan Dzierniejko – Corporate Finance – New York
Eytan Fisch – Financial Institutions Regulation and Enforcement – Washington, D.C.
Michael Hines – Litigation – Boston
Maxim Mayer-Cesiano – Mergers and Acquisitions – New York
James Mazza, Jr. – Corporate Restructuring – Chicago
Giorgio Motta – European Union/International Competition – Brussels
Sonia Nijjar – Mergers and Acquisitions – Palo Alto
Joseph Penko – Executive Compensation and Benefits – New York
Patrick Rideout – Complex Litigation and Trials – New York
Royce Tidwell – Tax – Washington, D.C.
B. Chase Wink – Tax – New York

The new partners exhibit the geographic diversity one would expect from a global law firm, with the 12 lawyers hailing from seven different offices. They don’t exhibit quite as much diversity in terms of practice areas; they are heavily skewed towards the transactional side of the ledger, with just two litigators among them (but this isn’t shocking, given Skadden’s status as an M&A powerhouse).

Alas, the new partner class does fall short in terms of gender diversity. Of the 12 new partners, 11 are men. That’s 92 percent male and 8 percent female — well below the [37 percent](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/cleary-gottliebs-new-partner-class-where-are-the-women/) that the Diversity & Flexibility Alliance reports to be the percentage of new partners who are women at large U.S. law firms over the past year.

Racial or ethnic diversity is a bit harder to ascertain, but this partner class doesn’t seem terribly diverse on that front either. [Faiz Ahmad](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/faiz-ahmad) and [Sonia Nijjar](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/sonia-k-nijjar) seem to be the only ones who fit the bill.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
We reached out to the firm, which provided this statement:

We’re excited about the tremendous talent of our newest partners – both those who came up through the ranks and those who joined us laterally over the past 12 months. More than 25 percent of this total group are women, and more than 25 percent are partners of color. Consistently doing better with the diversity of our through-the-ranks partners is a priority. Women comprise 29% of our promoted partners over the past three years and we remain committed to making greater progress.

As the statement indicates, Skadden’s record on partnership diversity is stronger than this latest crop of partners would suggest, and lateral hires should be considered as well as “homegrown” partners. Of the seven lateral partners who have joined Skadden over the past year, a majority — four out of seven — are women ([Amy Heller](https://www.skadden.com/news-events/prominent-trusts-and-estates-attorney-amy-heller-joins-skadden-new-york), [Tara Reinhart](https://www.skadden.com/news-events/senior-federal-trade-commission-official-tara-reinhart-rejoins-skadden), [Lisa Laukitis](https://www.skadden.com/news-events/prominent-restructuring-duo-join-skaddens-restructuring-practice-new-york), and [Elizabeth Robertson](https://www.skadden.com/news-events/white-collar-crime-and-investigations-lawyer-elizabeth-robertson-joins-skadden-london)).

So as we’ve [said before](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/gibson-dunn-names-13-new-partners-how-diverse-is-this-group/) on [multiple occasions](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/sullivan-cromwells-new-partners-impressive-yes-diverse-not-so-much/), one shouldn’t judge an entire firm by the diversity of a single partnership class. Diversity levels will fluctuate over the years. For example, back in 1987, Skadden’s new partner class was [one-third women](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/06/magazine/for-women-lawyers-an-uphill-struggle.html?pagewanted=all) — surely well above the average for that period.

Yes, a single year can be an aberration — but over the long haul, firms ignore diversity and inclusion at their peril, because clients are now demanding it. For example, Facebook recently [announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/02/business/dealbook/facebook-pushes-outside-law-firms-to-become-more-diverse.html) that it will require that women and ethnic minorities make up at least 33 percent of law firm teams working on its matters.

# Sam Bankman-Fried Wastes No Time Bashing Biglaw Firm Sullivan & Cromwell In Latest Filing
## SBF wants the Biglaw firm treated as part of the prosecution team.

FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is still facing a heaping helping of legal woes from the events that led to the crypto exchange’s collapse. In his latest filing, he’s asked the federal judge presiding over his case to throw out the majority of charges against him. The kindest thing that can be said about that strategy is you miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.

As Lewis Brisbois’s Sean P. Shecter [told Law360](https://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/1605756), “I think this is a lot of, ‘Ok we know there is going to be a lot of evidence, we’re weighing whether we can win at trial, let’s create a record to preserve our appellate rights even if it involves throwing spaghetti against the wall.'”

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

But the truly interesting tidbit in the filing is SBF’s request to have FTX’s current leadership and Sullivan & Cromwell —  the Biglaw firm advising FTX in bankruptcy who also represented the company on transactions and regulatory matters pre-collapse — designated as part of the “prosecution team.” He argues He argues FTX and S&C have offered so much cooperation that the government has “effectively deputized the company to aid the prosecution.”

The company has “already determined that Mr. Bankman-Fried is guilty and prematurely staked their reputations on it,” Bankman-Fried told the court.

“The FTX debtors have no incentive to look for or provide exculpatory material to the government, which is the only practical way the defense will ever receive it,” he said.

The filing went on to say the firm and FTX have become “public mouthpieces” for the prosecution, turning over “cherry-picked” documents that implicate Bankman-Fried. If the judge grants SBF’s request, both Sullivan & Cromwell and FTX will be obligated to turn over potentially exculpatory documents to Bankman-Fried, as if they were prosecutors themselves.

As [reported by](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ftxs-law-firm-back-cross-185102890.html) Yahoo!, while they haven’t offered comment about this specific filing, FTX and S&C have defended their cooperation:

FTX and its Sullivan & Cromwell team have accused Bankman-Fried of presiding over a shocking lack of internal corporate controls and said their cooperation with the government was crucial to securing a quick indictment against Bankman-Fried and guilty pleas from other FTX executives.

The role of cooperators has been hotly debated by the criminal defense bar. As Mark Kasten of Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney noted, “I think criminal defense attorneys are going to look at how the court rules on this motion.”

# Biglaw Partner Flouts Court's COVID Rules... Federal Judge Isn't Happy About That
## The court takes COVID protocols seriously -- no exceptions.

Listen, it’s a very nice thing to want to watch a colleague’s oral argument in person. But, when living through a plague, sometimes niceties fall by the wayside. Like when my mom had surgery, I wanted to walk her into the hospital, but COVID makes fools of us all.

And it turns out the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit takes their COVID protocols seriously. Last week, Judge Timothy Dyk [issued an opinion](https://cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions-orders/22-9000.ORDER.2-25-2022_1913847.pdf) criticizing a party for bringing four attorneys to an in-person hearing last fall. See, that’s two more than the protocols allow for. (The rules allow for only “arguing counsel and no more than one attendee whose presence is necessary to assist or supervise arguing counsel (e.g., a client, lawyer sitting second chair, or paralegal).”)

And, more to the point, the party had requested permission for extra folks to attend but were denied. However, they showed up the day of the argument — and were escorted out of the courtroom when they were spotted by a deputy clerk.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The opinion left the attorneys unnamed, but the [National Law Journal sussed out](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2022/03/01/these-are-the-3-lawyers-the-federal-circuit-chastised-last-week-for-violating-covid-protocols/) exactly who they are:

The National Law Journal has identified the case as MV3 Partners v. Roku, which was up for argument on Nov. 3, 2021. Kasowitz Benson Torres partner Jonathan Waldrop argued the appeal, which related to patent infringement. The two attorneys asked to leave the courtroom that day were Kasowitz partner Darcy Jones and special counsel ThucMinh Nguyen. (Associate Paul Williams, who second-chaired the argument with Waldrop, was absolved of any violation.)

According to the opinion, the attorneys “felt it was not unreasonable for special counsel and the non-arguing partner to come to the court on the day of argument so that respondents could seek permission and clarification on whether they could attend the argument.” But that was NOT AT ALL the panel’s take:

But Dyk, joined by Judges Evan Wallach and Kara Stoll, ruled the attorneys “clearly violated the Revised Protocols.” Dyk noted that each signed a form upon entering the courthouse that declared under penalty of perjury that they were “scheduled to appear in person for argument at the National Courts Building in Washington, D.C. either as (a) arguing counsel or (b) to assist or to supervise arguing counsel.”

This language put them on “clear notice” that they could not be present as “spectators or additional attendees,” Dyk wrote.

“Most troubling,” he added, was the violation of the explicit order the court had issued just two days earlier. The lawyers should have filed a written motion for reconsideration or clarification “rather than simply show up at the courthouse in violation of the protocols to again seek permission to attend argument.”

The court declined to impose sanctions on the attorneys, “because respondents express earnest remorse, have not previously been accused of misconduct, and because this situation has not arisen before.”

But now folks are on notice, and the court’s protocols have been amended to add in bold type: “All counsel are advised that the court will not entertain any motions to expand access to attend argument beyond arguing counsel and the one necessary attendee.”

# Former Partner Hits Biglaw Firm With Explosive Gender Discrimination Charge
## The partner alleged women were rewarded for 'agreeing to sexual relationships with Manatt's male leadership.'

A former partner at Manatt, Rebecca Torrey, filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing, on behalf of herself and those similarly situated alleging gender discrimination and retaliation at the Biglaw firm.

The charge, filed earlier this year, details an environment best described as a “boys’ club” that weighs “heavily in the favor of male partners.” As [reported](https://www.law360.com/articles/1083031/ex-partner-hits-manatt-phelps-with-sex-bias-charge) by Law360, Torrey alleges the compensation structure for partners is dictated by a group hand-selected by outgoing firm managing partner, William Quicksilver (earlier this year, the firm announced [Donna Wilson is taking over as managing partner](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/what-its-really-like-to-be-the-managing-partner-at-a-biglaw-firm/)), and who rarely challenge his recommendations.

The firm pays equity partners an “entitlement” at one of six levels based on their projected profitability, plus a discretionary bonus, she claimed. It frequently assigns women to the lower levels of the entitlement scale regardless of their performance while evenly distributing men across the range, and does not make up these gaps in bonuses, she said.

This structure resulted in Manatt paying Torrey hundreds of thousands of dollars less than several male partners despite her generating more revenue for the firm, she alleged. Torrey alerted Quicksilver to the alleged discrimination and quit soon after he told her it was beneath her to think she was a victim of bias and suggested the now 57-year-old attorney “step aside to give younger women opportunities,” she said.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The charge alleges the pay structure that systematically undervalues the contributions of female partners is “symptomatic of a broader firm culture that devalues women.” And, wow, the allegations about the firm’s culture are deeply unsettling.

Torrey claims women at the firm are treated as sexual objects that male partners “compete” over:

Throughout my tenure at Manatt, the Firm’s male leadership countenanced and participated in a culture where women were treated as sexual objects first, and attorneys second. Men in Manatt’s leadership openly discussed the physical attributes of women, sought to hire the most attractive women, and frequently and openly engaged in sexual relationships with subordinate female attorneys and staff. Two male Division chairs would “compete” with each other by attempting to have sex with certain female employees before the other. Female employees were rewarded for agreeing to sexual relationships with Manatt’s male leadership with favorable reviews and increased compensation. Sexual conduct with female subordinates was an “open secret” among Manatt’s partners.

The charge goes on to allege, “Inappropriate sexual behavior is never corrected; instead, the firm either quietly settles the claims without notifying the partnership, or intimidates the accuser.”

# Domestic Violence Awareness Month: Assisting Survivors During The Pandemic
## For survivors of domestic violence, legal assistance can change – or even save – a life. This is especially true for women living in poverty during the COVID-19 pandemic.

For survivors of domestic violence, legal assistance can change – or even save – a life. This is especially true for women living in poverty during the COVID-19 pandemic. We spoke with Hamra Ahmad, Director of Law and Policy with [Her Justice](https://herjustice.org/),  a nonprofit organization that stands with low-income women in New York City by training and mentoring volunteer lawyers to represent them and address individual and systemic barriers. 

Who does Her Justice serve? 

Our clients are the working poor with very limited resources. More than half are foreign-born, a quarter of them need interpreters in court, and most are mothers who are, or become, the heads of their households. We call them “survivors” for a reason; they have experienced unspeakable trauma and violence and have come through it because they are resilient, resourceful and focused on creating better futures for themselves and their children. 

What are some key concerns in the time of COVID-19?

The current crisis continues to create situations that force many of our clients over the edge of poverty and health – both mentally and physically. 

Many of them must engage with the New York City Family Courts to get legal relief that is critical to their safety and well-being, such as orders of protection, financial support from partners, or clear schedules for access to children, and the courts are operating with limited capacity.

Though remote access is essential, technology is often unaffordable for our clients. Paying for cell phones, often their only way to access the internet, is increasingly difficult. Without access to the internet or phone, and with libraries closed (where they previously used free computers) our clients can’t access food assistance, legal assistance, mental health support and health care for themselves and their children. Our clients need access to these services and support now more than ever. 

What don’t lawyers know about domestic violence that they should?

Domestic violence isn’t only physical abuse. Many of our clients experience financial abuse – the control by one intimate partner of the other’s access to economic resources, which diminishes the survivor’s capacity to support themselves and forces them to depend financially on the abuser. This makes it even more difficult for survivors to leave the relationship; for example, with a low credit score, women cannot rent an apartment, get a job or buy a house or car.

Survivors also often shoulder the burden of supporting children; fair and consistent child support can mean the difference between remaining safe and independent or returning to a dangerous situation. In ordinary times, there are more than 70,000 filings for child support in the New York City Family Courts each year. But during this crisis, court closures mean that many families have no access to this needed support.

Can you share tips for working with pro bono clients during the pandemic? 

Safety and confidentiality are key considerations when working with clients remotely. We encourage our staff and pro bono attorneys to ensure a safe, confidential, and comfortable meeting space and to ask the client if she is in a safe place where she has privacy. It’s critical to build trust, identify who you are, and make clear your role and expectations when you meet. For example, if you will be taking notes or typing, it’s important to explain why you are looking away from the camera. 

Determine the best method to speak with her – does she have a reliable phone number or access to a safe computer with a camera? Many clients have prepaid cell phones that may run out at a moment’s notice, so try to obtain a safe, alternate phone number. Can she be reached via a safe email address or through texting (using a secure, confidential platform)? Some clients, especially survivors of digital violence, may feel more comfortable communicating by phone rather than video. If she needs an interpreter, identify one available by the client’s preferred communication method (e.g., phone or video conference). 

Try to determine what times she is likely to be available, who else will be home, and if she can speak privately or if children will be around. It’s important to ask these questions before every conversation in which you anticipate discussing traumatic or sensitive matters.

If she doesn’t have safe access to technology, you may have to factor in time to send documents via regular mail to review and/or sign. Digital photographs of documents are acceptable as long as the quality is good enough for the document to be legible.

# Why We Stay At Our Firms, And What To Do When We Shouldn’t
## Ask any parent or caregiver almost two years into a pandemic the reason why they want to leave their firm, if you can find any conscious and standing upright.

There has been much ado about the [Thompson Reuter’s “2022 State of the Legal Market” report](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/legal/state-of-the-legal-market-2022/). Not immune to the Great Resignation, the legal market saw a record high 23.2% associate turnover rate in 2021. The authors speculated that it was not just compensation driving the high rate of turnover but that it was driven by more concern with flexibility and personal control over their working arrangements. Relatedly, a 2021 survey reported in The American Lawyer, found that 60% of associates would consider leaving their firm for a better work-life balance. Let that sink in … 60% would consider leaving and now almost a quarter of associates have done so.

Ask any parent or caregiver almost two years into a pandemic the reason for these results, if you can find any conscious and standing upright, and the answer is obvious. We. Are. Exhausted. Not the “pulled an all-nighter to finish that brief” type of exhausted, but the kind of exhausted from running on fumes for almost two years. The kind of exhausted from never having a break, the kind of exhausted from having to navigate a society that demands a return to normal without acknowledging the reality of shut-down classrooms and tracking down rapid tests to get your kid back to day care. The kind of exhausted from worrying about every sniffle and headache from your littlest not yet eligible for the vaccine. The kind of exhausted over and above the normal wear and tear of being a parent. The kind of exhausted not alleviated by being able to work from home two days a week.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The reason we haven’t left yet boils down to one thing: we are too exhausted to put energy into one more thing. We don’t have the mental bandwidth to network, update our resume, or even sit and figure out what it is that we want from our next gig. And so we stay … for now. Burnt out, stuck, without an ounce of energy to know what to do next.

This is where I found myself in the fall of 2021 — stuck between feeling burnt out from my current gig and the paralyzing fear to quit for something else. Add on top of that a complete lack of energy to do anything about either, and you have a recipe for a severe case of ennui. I wanted to quit it all and work at a dog park. Or work in a different field of law. Or not be a lawyer anymore. Or both, or neither. All I knew was that something needed to change — I either needed to fix the burn out I was feeling or find a way to make my exit stage right. Luckily, I stumbled upon an executive coach named Teresa Sabatine who specializes in women who are burnt out. Now, I am not a touchy-feely person. The idea of mindfulness, vision boards, and deep cleansing breaths is not my jam at all. Fortunately, Teresa’s program had none of that. Instead, through weekly small group discussions and individualized targeted homework she guided me through a number of practical exercises designed to get my inner analytic moving.

Through this program, I have not only learned to recognize when I am starting to feel burnt out, but I also learned how to set healthy boundaries to try to prevent it altogether. And because it involved small groups of other similarly situated bad-ass women, the work felt truly individualized and reflective of me and my needs while also building a sense of community. Her program cut out the fluff and got right to the heart of the issue. No long-winded articles or self-help podcasts (although, if that works for you — by all means, you do you), just nonjudgmental opportunities to get unstuck in a way that feels uniquely you. It was a highlight of my week.

If you are reading this at 2 a.m. because you can’t sleep, thinking about all the unfinished work on your plate, wanting a change but not knowing what, you may want to give executive coaching a try. At the very least, it’s a once-a-week time to shut the door, drink a glass of wine, and talk about what’s bothering you with other bad-ass women going through the same thing.

And as a final note, for you firms who do not find a way to embrace truly flexible work arrangements, once we do get that energy back, we might just be out the door with the rest of our colleagues. But for now, the dog park will have to wait. I’ve got more lawyering to do.

In this episode, I speak with Stephanie Wachman, CEO and founder of Symetree, about the evolution of her career and the founding of Symetree. We discuss pressing issues in the industry, such as balancing a law career and “real life,” dealing with the stress of career challenges, and strategies for business development. Stephanie also speaks about how she helps women lawyers grow their practices and achieve leadership roles in their firms.



The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

# Managing Partner Fired After Molestation Guilty Plea
## It all started as a night out with clients.

Devandran Karunakaran (Image via Ince)

The international law firm of Ince & Co. has parted ways with a parter after he found himself in legal hot water following a drunken night out with clients. Devandran Karunakaran, 40, was managing partner in the Singapore office of the firm with a practice in maritime law when he was charged with molesting three women at a bar.

According to [reports](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/law-firm-managing-partner-fined-s15000-molesting-3-women-bar), in May of last year after drinks with clients, Karunakaran went to a bar to continue drinking. There he groped three women, including the bar’s marketing director and DJ. When the manager of the bar asked him to leave, Karunakaran reportedly became irate and hurled profanities and shouted that he was a lawyer and could get the manager fired. Police were called and Karunakaran was arrested.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Last week, Karunakaran pleaded guilty to three charges of molestation. He was charged under the Protection from Harassment Act and was fined a total of S$15,000. For each of the molestation charges, he faced up to two years’ jail time, fines, caning, or any combination of the three.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/11/22/ince-fires-singapore-managing-partner-following-molestation-verdict-292-57647/) Law.com, following the verdict, the firm fired Karunakaran:

A spokesperson for Ince said in a statement: “Following the Singapore Court’s decision, Devandran Karunakaran’s position at Ince has been terminated with immediate effect and he no longer works at the firm.

“We take the behavior and ethical conduct of all of the Group’s Partners and staff extremely seriously.”

It sure seems like you wouldn’t want anyone who uses this kind of poor judgment as a representative of the firm.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# The Thing That Matters The Most In The Associate Lateral Market

We’ve talked… a bunch about the [hotness of the Biglaw lateral market](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/the-biglaw-lateral-market-is-fire-right-now/). By now, you know the drill — associate talent is at a premium and Biglaw has just been throwing money (in the form of special bonuses and raises) to ensure they have the personnel they need. Hell, [even Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/did-the-pandemic-break-the-cravath-system/) has changed the very model of their business to accommodate the changing environment.

With so much movement in the Biglaw market, it makes you wonder — what are associates actually looking for when they lateral? Over at [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/prestige-still-beats-quality-of-life-in-big-law-talent-war), Roy Strom takes a look at some data, comparing hiring and attrition trends over the last four years at the[ top 10 most prestigious firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/vault-100-rankings-the-most-prestigious-law-firms-in-america-2022/), as ranked by Vault and the[ top 10 quality of life firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/vault-quality-of-life-rankings-the-best-law-firms-to-work-for-in-america-2022/), also as ranked by Vault. Because here’s the thing — as pointed out by my colleague Staci Zaretsky — none of the firms on the quality of life list made it into the Top 10 of the Vault prestige ranking.

As Strom points out, the most prestigious firms are doing a lot more hiring right now:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The 10 firms voted as the most prestigious hired, on average, 28 lawyers from January through mid-July from 2017 to 2020, according to an analysis by Decipher, which provides lateral hiring due diligence services for law firms.

This year, those firms have hired 64 associates on average. It’s a 131% increase over the historical average. Meanwhile, the top 10 “Best Firms to Work For” have hired 37% more associates so far this year than they have on average over the previous four years (35 compared to 26).

Of course, that could just mean that the quality of life firms aren’t looking for as many associates. But it makes us wonder — what is more important to associates, prestige or quality of life?

So, dear readers, what do you think? Assuming money is the same (as most of Biglaw is on the same lockstep compensation grid), which is more important in considering a firm as a lateral?

Which is more important in considering a lateral position?

- Prestige (0%, 0 Votes)
- Quality of Life (0%, 0 Votes)
Total Voters: 0

[[DealBook / New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/technology/congress-moves-to-strike-internet-privacy-rules-from-obama-era.html)] * Being forced to resign from your position isn't so bad when you can land a sweet gig as a law professor. Barbara McQuade and Preet Bharara aren't the only U.S. Attorneys who found new homes at law schools in the wake of their recent ouster by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Paul Fishman, the former U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, is now a visiting fellow at Seton Hall University School of Law. Congrats! [[Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/03/22/prosecutors-find-refuge-in-law-school-posts/)] * Mary Yelenick, the third Chadbourne & Parke partner to join the $100 million gender bias class-action suit filed against the firm, claims she was pressured to disavow the allegations in a letter signed by fourteen of the firm's then-sixteen female partners. ""At least two of the partners who signed the letter subsequently expressed to me that they hesitated, but felt great pressure to sign the letter,"" she says. [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/chadbourne-lawyer-says-she-was-pressured-to-disavow-gender-bias-suit/)] * Gawker may be approaching a ""potential settlement"" with Peter Thiel relative to the tech billionaire's vendetta against the website. The feud led to Thiel's funding of several lawsuits against Gawker, including the one filed by wrestler Hulk Hogan which eventually bankrupted the site. Any deal between the parties would likely protect Gawker founder Nick Denton from any future Thiel-funded lawsuits. [[New York Post](http://nypost.com/2017/03/22/gawker-discussing-potential-settlement-with-peter-thiel-reps/)] * Illinois may be getting ready to puff, puff, pass some legislation that will legalize recreational marijuana. Senate Bill 316 and House Bill 2353 will allow adults to possess up to 28 grams of marijuana and regulate its sale, tax, cultivation, and use. The state already allows patients with certain ailments to use medical marijuana and decriminalized possession of up to 10 grams of marijuana last year.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs.

# Some Lawyers Are Unfairly Taking Advantage Of The Pandemic
## Certain legal matters have become a little like the Wild West because of the pandemic.

Most lawyers have acted admirably and worked together to move matters forward despite challenges posed by COVID-19. Indeed, many attorneys have served courtesy copies of papers through email since they know people are mostly working from home, reached compromises because courts are backlogged, and cooperated to solve problems throughout the pandemic. However, some lawyers have taken advantage of the pandemic to serve their own interests. While every lawyer has a duty to zealously represent their clients, some attorneys have used current conditions to their benefit in unfair ways.

For instance, some lawyers have made it more difficult for their adversaries to conduct work from their homes during this trying time. With almost all of my cases, lawyers are agreeing to loosen typical service requirements because it is far easier to accept service of motions and discovery documents through email than by mail like under normal circumstances. However, I recently heard a story of an adversary who circulated a notice conveying that the attorney’s office would be declining electronic service of motions, discovery papers, and the like. Forcing people to go to the post office or the office unnecessarily during a pandemic is extremely discourteous, and although there may be some circumstances in which electronic service should be declined, such flexibility can be critical right now.

Moreover, some people are seemingly using the fact that people are out of their offices to be sneaky about certain parts of the litigation process. In many jurisdictions, parties can serve notices to admit (also called requests for admission) on other parties asking them to admit or deny key facts about a case or if certain documents are complete and genuine. If the receiving party does not deny any of the requests in such discovery devices by a certain time, the requests may be deemed admitted. I have anecdotally heard of some lawyers mailing such requests to law offices even though they know that people are working from home, seemingly hoping that adversaries will not see the requests for admission and they will be deemed admitted. This is not a fair tactic, and a court would likely find as much if faced with a motion for a protective order or other relief by the party aggrieved by this tactic. Individuals should not be surreptitious because most people are working from home right now and should email courtesy copies of documents n such instances.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Attorneys seem to be using the pandemic to their advantage when delaying depositions in order to drag out litigation when it makes sense to do so. At the beginning the pandemic, lawyers rightfully argued that depositions should be adjourned because it was not safe to hold in-person depositions that might be easier to hold at a later date. As the months of the pandemic ticked by, it became clear that in-person depositions would not be advisable for some time, but people continued to argue that depositions should be held off until they can occur in person.

Of course, in-person depositions are usually better because it is easier to evaluate someone’s reactions when they are in the same room, and it is difficult to introduce exhibits during virtual depositions. In addition, depositions that require translators are often much easier to conduct in person because of the additional steps involved in translating testimony. However, attorneys have been holding virtual depositions just fine throughout the pandemic. Even though some lawyers may wish to delay cases, they should not be allowed to adjourn depositions so they can be held in person.

Moreover, many parties seem to be taking advantage of the fact that cases are not being managed as closely as they were before the pandemic and it is more difficult to get judicial intervention now than it was before the pandemic. The first time I drove a long distance during the pandemic, I was amazed at how few cops I saw on the road. Maybe police were called to help with the increased number of ambulances I saw in my area when New York City was the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, but suffice it to say that there were few cops around at that time to regulate traffic. This had a profound impact on drivers, and I saw people doing some unbelievable things on the road when my area was dealing with the worst of the pandemic. Maybe some motorists thought that since there were less cops on the road, and they were unlikely to receive a ticket, they could do whatever they wanted.

Some lawyers seem to be acting in a similar manner. Since they know that judges are dealing with a backlog of work, and it may take time to receive an order after a motion, some attorneys might be more zealous when denying discovery requests or reaching the types of compromises we all make during litigation. Certain legal matters have become a little like the Wild West because of the pandemic, and some lawyers are using the lack of judicial oversight to their advantage.

All told, although many lawyers have acted admirably during the pandemic, some lawyers have unfairly used present circumstances to their advantage. Hopefully, courts and colleagues have long memories for the people that it made it more difficult to handle legal matters during this challenging time.

Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# If You Haven't Already Gotten A Biglaw Fall Bonus, You Probably Won't

Waiting is the hardest part.

The more days that tick by, the less likely that any more Biglaw firms will offer their associates fall special bonuses, in recognition of their hard work during the pandemic. It’s nearly November, after all, and lots of firms would rather continue with their normal bonus schedule, even if they intend to eventually give special bonuses. In that way Cravath’s [wait-and-see approach](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cravath-is-not-offering-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-pissed/) has become a model for large swaths of Biglaw.

That certainly seems to be the case at Gibson Dunn. The super successful firm — ranked 11 on the latest Am Law ranking with $2,008,334,000 in gross revenue — will hold off until year end, “after completion of our normal associate/of counsel review process,” according to tipsters. The good news is that the firm seems to be signaling there will, in fact, be special COVID appreciation bonuses (an insider says the firm has referenced “both standard and special” bonuses) and “the firm is and remains fully committed to providing competitive compensation.” And those year-end bonuses will be paid no later than December 22nd, just in time to do a little last minute holiday shopping.

# World’s Wealthiest Law Firm Enters The Summer Salary Wars
## Has the firm shattered the market on salaries?

As expected, now that [Cravath has signed off](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/cravath-raises/) on the latest round of raises brought to us by [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/davis-polk-salary-21/), Biglaw firms of all stripes have waltzed in to shower their associates with piles of cash. Now, the most profitable Biglaw firm in the the world has decided to offer some input.

What is Kirkland & Ellis planning to bring to the table?

The No. 1 firm in the country — known for its above-market bonuses — brought in $4,830,000,000 gross revenue in 2020, but it’s not going to be shattering the market when it comes to raises. Here, the firm is not a leader but a follower. Kirkland is offering its associates a Davis Polk match. This is what the new salary scale looks like at K&E (full memo available on the next page):

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
- 2020: $205,000
- 2019: $215,000
- 2018: $240,000
- 2017: $275,000
- 2016: $305,000
- 2015: $330,000
The firm will also be throwing a bone to its [overworked and underpaid non-equity partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/01/kirkland-ellis-non-equity-partners-know-exactly-where-they-should-be-somewhere-else/) (“non-share partners” or “NSPs”). For these partners in name only, we certainly hope the juicy new salaries at K&E are worth the squeeze.

Congratulations to everyone at Kirkland!

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Kirkland.)

# Biglaw Firm Gives Associates An October Surprise In The Form Of Raises
## Very exciting and happy news!

Halloween is almost upon us, and one Biglaw firm recently gave its associates the best treat of all: raises. That’s right, the end of 2022 is nearly here, and law firms are still handing out raises.

Which firm is the latest to scare up an increase in compensation?

We’ve heard that Littler — the world’s largest employment firm, which ranked at No. 71 in the most recent Am Law 100, having brought home $658,578,000 gross revenue in 2021 — is offering its associates even more money. If you recall, Littler was the only firm to [hand out special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/biglaw-firm-announces-summer-special-bonuses/) this past summer (that we know of), so its salary increases are even more worthy of coverage.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
We’ve been told that during a video town hall presentation earlier this month, the firm announced raises for all U.S. associates. It should also be noted that professional staff at the firm received salary adjustments as well. The raises are based on market and associate level, and sources say that the increases range from about $10,000 to $65,000. We’ve reached out to the firm for comment, and will provide an update if and when we hear back.

UPDATE (1:00 p.m.): Erin Webber, Littler’s Managing Director and President, had this to say of the raises:

“We are pleased to reward the continued hard work of our attorneys and professional staff with well-deserved salary increases and bonuses. Offering competitive compensation is just one of the many ways we invest in our people and ensure that we continue to provide a platform that can best serve the sophisticated and wide-ranging needs of today’s employers.”

Salaries at he firm are highly individualized, and while Littler’s salary bump may not match the Cravath money that’s become the prevailing rate in most major markets ($215K for first-years and $415K for eighth-years, to be specific), money is money, so congratulations to everyone at the firm!

As a little reminder, we love covering associate salary increases and bonuses, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus/Raise) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus/Raise”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file.

Don’t forget, if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Salary and Bonus Alerts, please enter your email address in the box below. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish — including, of course, the first such announcement.

# Biglaw Firms Are Using 'Stay Interviews' To Keep Their Associates From Making Lateral Moves
## And it seems to be working!

With Biglaw firms facing overcapacity thanks to a lack of attrition, layoffs and deferrals are now at top of mind when it comes to Biglaw’s employment outlook for associates. The lateral frenzy that was 2021 now seems oh-so long ago, but if hiring picks up again, some firms simply aren’t interested in cutting ties with their associates — they want them to stay put.

Enter the “stay interview,” a new means for Biglaw firms to assess the needs of their associates and making necessary changes in the hope of keeping them on the payroll. Firms like Cozen O’Connor and Lathrop GPM have reported positive experiences after using these interviews among their ranks. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/08/11/stay-interviews-help-law-firms-adjust-to-young-lawyers-changing-needs/) has the details:

Having spoken with roughly 100 Cozen O’Connor associates to date—89% of associates asked to do voluntary interviews did so—[Mindy Herczfeld, chief legal talent officer at Cozen,] was able to glean valuable information about the firm’s associate population. Firm culture, work-life balance, and having their personal time respected were among the top reasons associates said they would stay at the firm, Herczfeld said.

She also learned some areas of improvement: the path to partner appeared opaque from the associates’ perspectives, and young lawyers wished for more professional development opportunities. As a result, the firm held sessions on the partnership path and offered individualized, one-on-one coaching for skills such as public speaking and communication—measures associates said they appreciated in subsequent stay interviews.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Through the use of stay interviews, Lathrop GPM has learned that associates need guidance on how to have “critical conversations” while working remotely. “When you’re not interacting with someone in person, some of those non-verbal queues may not be there,’ said Vanessa Vaughn West, director of diversity and inclusion at the firm. “Some of the things you might rely on in-person have evolved.”

As noted by Am Law, Cozen’s stay interviews — and the changes at the firm that occurred thereafter — have resulted in an increased associate retention rate, meaning that using innovative methods like these will not only help to improve associate satisfaction but will also convince associates to remain with their firms for the long haul.

Has your firm started using stay interviews to keep associates on board?  Please let us know. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Stay%20Interviews) or text us ([646-820-8477](tel:646-820-8477)). Thanks.

If you’re going to spend most of your life there, it’s worth considering what you want out of a law office. Stunning views, a full-service gym, a door that closes, a [sleep pod time machine thing](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/biglaw-firm-encourages-associates-to-sleep-during-working-hours/), a bar — all important considerations. After all, there’s no reason the modern Biglaw office can’t offer all these and more.

So when Biglaw opens up a brand new office, lawyers everywhere want to know what bells and whistles the firm snuck into the new design.

White & Case recently ditched its old digs for a new office a few blocks up the Avenue of the Americas, uncorking its bid to define the “modern” Biglaw office in the former home of McGraw Hill.

The results are pretty impressive.

First of all, there’s a lot of talk out there about what the “modern” law firm office — or the office of “the future” — might look like. Tradition is hard to buck in the legal community. Dark wood bookshelves, corner offices for rainmakers, private offices for all but the lowliest of professionals. For many, a new office should just replace the decor of yesteryear with… the exact same design. Lawyers generally don’t get a lot of points for originality. On the other hand, the rest of corporate America — and make no mistake, Biglaw firms are as much corporate entities as collegial partnerships of learned professionals — is embracing Silicon Valley’s culture of cool. Open! Collaborative! Games! GLASS! There’s a consulting community that swears this improves productivity, but can attorneys really work like programmers?

Will attorneys even want to work like programmers?

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“The influence of clients cannot be overstated,” said [Jack Pace](https://www.whitecase.com/people/jack-pace), Executive Partner of White & Case’s New York office. He was discussing the open lounge areas that lean into the present corporate trend, but split the difference with multiple lounges and open-concept gathering areas on every floor. At the end of the day, attorneys still have offices (even if the most junior have to share), but there’s a whole lot of glass.

While several firms have opted for the glass office in recent years, most offer some sort of frosted glass design to give at least quasi-privacy to an attorney working alone in their office. White & Case went full-bore, providing floor to ceiling glass offices for everyone. While it may be a bit of a culture shock, there is a logical reason beyond merely embracing the look that most clients are used to in their own workspaces: light. Footprints are tricky things. Too narrow and an office feels cramped, while too big and the firm is left with wasted square footage and depressing internal offices. The abundance of glass gives internal offices along one of the firm’s east-west “avenues” an exterior view (if through another’s office or a lounge) and keeps things bright.


Eric Laignel Photography

Not that this is much consolation if you’ve been working for 48 straight hours and everyone can look in to see your state of dishevelement, but there are showers!

As for the common areas, like most, we’ve [harbored skepticism](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/more-bad-news-for-biglaw-associates/) that hippie commune seating areas are appropriate for a Biglaw office. A couple years ago, when Paul Hastings announced that the most junior of associates would work in exclusively open environs, readers overwhelmingly balked at the idea in a poll.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
It may be hard to imagine that attorneys — of any generation — ditching the friendly confines of a private office to sit in couches in the middle of the floor, but Pace and associate [Julia Bell](https://www.whitecase.com/people/julia-bell), who served on the art committee, swear they get used. During my tour the areas were lightly populated, but certainly not unused. A pair of attorneys congregated in the communal work area for a lunch meeting, and at another table a computer and water bottle proved some temporarily absent lawyer was hard at work.

Perhaps there’s a measure of “if you build it, they will come” to the open concept. Pace said that the trick to building common areas that work is placing “open spaces in areas that will create neighborhoods.” A lone seat in the hallway outside a partner’s office isn’t going to get much traction. An area where a group might naturally gravitate will. He pointed out that the areas overlooking the Hudson become more crowded with attorneys as sunset approaches and lawyers can sit in a comfy chair and take in the spectacular westward views from over their computer screens.


Eric Laignel Photography

Now… obviously those are models placed there for marketing purposes — no one looks that cookie-cutter at a law firm these days — but you can see the general idea.

Here’s another shot of a corresponding area on a different floor:


Eric Laignel Photography

These pictures show two different takes on the two areas in the middle of the north and south sides of each floor, while the open areas on the east and west side are more of an atrium style. Practice groups had a little bit of freedom in designing their lounges. M&A has a TV lounge broadcasting CNBC. Antitrust has a mini-library and shrine to John Sherman.

Yes.



Pace, an antitrust litigator himself, revealed even more Sherman memorabilia — [personal letters](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Sherman-Letter.jpg) and even a baseball card for the lucky kid collecting all the great 19th Century Legislator Series.

And while the overwhelming majority of attorneys have their own offices, one prominent lawyer opts for an entirely open experience — White & Case Chair [Hugh Verrier](https://www.whitecase.com/people/hugh-verrier). About one-third of one of the firm’s six practice area floors is completely open concept, and Verrier placed his desk in this area.

That should squelch any whining from partners upset that there aren’t any corner offices.

Wait… there aren’t any corner offices? Well let’s discuss that on the next page….

# Elite Biglaw Firms Are Offering More Special Rewards To Keep Their Stressed-Out Associates Happy
## A kind way to thank associates and staff for their nonstop work during the pandemic.

Remember last spring, when Biglaw firms were not only offering their associates [piles of special bonus cash](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/special-bonus-tracker-2021/), but some were also offering additional perks like [free food](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/kirkland-sweetens-associate-perks-with-free-food/), up to [$15K for any purchase toward rest, recreation, and relaxation](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/fenwick-spring-bonus-2021/), and a [curated selection of high-end items and experiences](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-tells-associates-thank-you-with-extra-special-gifts/?rf=1)? Rewards like this definitely help with recruiting and retaining associates during white-hot lateral markets, and with associates still working harder than ever, those special thank-you gifts are making a big return.

Kirkland & Ellis, for example, recently announced that it would be offering $1,000 vouchers for both associates and nonequity partners around the world to spend on activities outside of work. Staff received a bonus and an additional holiday as their rewards for working so hard. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/08/24/whats-driving-top-firms-to-pay-lawyers-more-to-do-less/) has more details:

In a statement, firm chairman Jon A. Ballis said time off is “essential,” and that the firm also intended it as a thank-you for its lawyers’ hard work during a difficult time.

“We are committed to their wellbeing and focused on offering innovative benefits and initiatives to support their lives both at work and at home. We are really pleased to see them taking time to connect with family and friends, travel, pursue hobbies, and rest and recharge,” Ballis said.

Wilson Sonsini, on the other hand, is offering both lawyers and staff up to two weeks of special paid time off (time off that comes in addition to their regular vacation days). Perhaps most importantly for lawyers, that special time off will count towards their billable hours. The firm is also offering free, on-demand support for employees’ mental health needs in the form of virtual appointments with behavioral health coaches.

“All of those things tie into retention too, because if people are going to burn out, they’ll feel compelled to go somewhere else or leave the workforce,” [Cherie Beffa, director of attorney recruiting at the firm,] said. “Especially in this hyper-competitive recruiting market right now, people are reexamining: ‘Do I want to keep doing this? Or go in-house?’ So taking time you need and time to have conversations, I think, absolutely does help with recruiting and retention.”

When cash isn’t enough, it’s time to show associates that the firm actually cares about their well-being during these unprecedented times. What will your firm do to compete in the intense hunt for attorney talent?

The Biglaw firm of Dentons is facing a $25 million lawsuit alleging self dealing, conflict of interest, and gross overbilling. The case, filed last week in Calgary, was brought by Laurie Venning and the Venning Group of companies. They alleged that Venning paid Dentons $22 million for legal services and ~$12 million in disbursements since 2010, with $7.4 million of the fees for the period of time surrounding Venning’s 2014 sale of Regent Energy to a private equity firm.

As [reported by](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/edmonton-lawyer-drunk-driving-lawsuit-1.5452118) CBC News, the lawsuit alleges that both Dentons and partner Shane Stevenson told Venning that “within a short period of time” of the Regent Energy sale, Stevenson would come in-house at Venning Group. While that move never materialized, the complaint alleges that in anticipation of the move, Stevenson became involved as a shareholder or director in numerous of its companies. That’s when Venning alleges the self-dealing and conflicts of interest began:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“Dentons and Stevenson represented to [Venning] that it was standard industry practice to grant legal counsel with equity participation in the companies for whom they acted,” the lawsuit states.

Stevenson eventually became involved in 22 of Venning’s companies or trusts, and the lawsuit claims that Stevenson issued shares in several companies to himself, including some instances “without the knowledge or consent of the plaintiffs.”

Venning claims that Dentons never recommended he get independent legal advice in relation to these transactions, “despite the conflicts of interest that necessarily resulted, and despite the fact that some or all of these transactions were not fair and reasonable to the Venning Group.”

Additionally, the complaint alleges that Stevenson has a substance abuse problem and that Dentons was aware of the issue and failed to provide proper supervision of his legal work. The allegations against Stevenson include ones that he provided legal advice under the influence of alcohol and cocaine and that Venning was not warned the legal work they got from Stevenson may be under the influence:

The lawsuit alleges Dentons failed “to ensure its partners were properly serving the Venning Group, in light of Stevenson’s ongoing substance abuse issues, despite their knowledge including having sent Stevenson to multiple stays in a rehabilitation facility and that Stevenson’s substance abuse was re-emerging in an alarming manner.

“Stevenson was providing advice to the Venning Group while under the influence of intoxicants and narcotics including alcohol and cocaine,” the lawsuit states, adding that Dentons owed a duty to Venning to monitor the work Stevenson was doing for Venning “given Stevenson’s known substance abuse history.

“[Dentons] were aware at all times that Stevenson had a heightened risk to relapse, but failed to monitor the advice he was giving, and failed to warn [Venning] they should not rely upon Stevenson’s advice,” the lawsuit states.

A Dentons spokesperson had the following statement about the lawsuit: “[N]othing means more to us than the integrity of our lawyers and the trust our clients have in Dentons. We intend to mount a vigorous defen[s]e to these allegations.”

Those charges were later dropped. Then, in 2018,[ he was arrested ](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/biglaw-partner-arrested-after-deadly-hit-and-run-crash/)on charges of drunk driving that resulted in the death of a 16-year-old girl.

Several years ago, I rekindled my passion for photography, a hobby from my youth. I dusted off my old film camera and spent countless hours capturing moments, reveling in the tangible feel of the film and the anticipation of developing pictures. This analog process was slow and deliberate, much like the traditional methods in legal practice. However, the digital photography revolution intrigued me, leading to a journey paralleling my exploration of legal technology, especially AI.

Embracing Digital Photography: A Legal Tech Integration

Efficiency And Innovation

Trading my film camera for a digital one was like stepping into a new era. Legal tech did the same for the profession’s practice, promising efficiency and innovation that transformed the way we approached legal work.

Quality And Accuracy

Digital photography brought precision to my fingertips. Legal tech, especially AI, mirrored this with data-driven insights and accuracy in analytics and document management.

Adaptation And Learning Curve

Just like mastering digital photography required a learning curve, integrating legal tech into our practice demanded adaptation and continuous learning. It’s all about staying on your toes!

Navigating The Risks: Challenges In The Legal And Digital Worlds

Dependence On Technology

Just as too many digital tools could erode basic photography skills, there’s a risk of becoming overly dependent on AI in legal practice. Gotta keep those legal fundamentals sharp!

Data Security And Privacy

Digital files in photography face hacking risks; legal tech encounters similar concerns with client data. Security first, always!

Cost And Accessibility

Quality digital cameras came with a price tag. Legal tech? Same story. It’s an investment, my friends, but one that pays off in the long run.

Evaluating Legal Tech: Lessons From Photography

Balancing Old And New

Finding the sweet spot between analog and digital photography techniques, we aimed to balance traditional legal methods with shiny new AI tools. It’s about harmonizing the old and the innovative.

Risk Assessment

Just as I backed up my digital photos, we implemented strict data security measures for our legal tech. Protecting what matters most, one digital byte at a time.

Training And Adaptation

Learning new skills and software was par for the course in digital photography. The same goes for legal tech — ensuring the team is always ready for the next challenge.

Cost-Benefit Analysis

Evaluating the cost and benefits of legal tech solutions? It’s a dance we know well from scrutinizing digital photography gear. Efficiency gains versus investment, always.

Continuous Learning And Updating

Photography tech evolves, and so does legal tech. We stay updated always ready to embrace the latest developments. No cobwebs in this digital domain!

A New Landscape Of Legal Practice

From the darkroom to the digital world, adopting legal tech transformed our practice, much like how digital photography revolutionized my approach to capturing moments.

The lesson here? Embrace innovation, but keep your feet on solid ground.

As we go through the evolving legal technology landscape, remember the wisdom gained from my photography hobby: adapt, innovate, and never lose sight of the fundamentals. The fusion of old and new, analog and digital, tradition and innovation, creates a dynamic and effective approach. Here’s to navigating the legal tech seas with the spirit of a photographer — capturing moments, embracing change, and preserving the essence of our noble profession!

# Latham's Managing Partner Finalists Offer A Diverse Collection Of Hairstyles
## If you lose one white male to a cloud of sexual impropriety, try, try again.

I don’t think it would surprise anybody if the next managing partner of Latham & Watkins ended up being white. I don’t think it would surprise anybody if the next managing partner ended up being a white male. Sure, former managing partner Bill Voge [resigned under a cloud of sexually inappropriate messaging](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/latham-chiefs-undoing-began-by-offering-christian-reconciliation-help/), but this is Biglaw we’re talking about. Whenever one white man falls, two others rise to crowd out all others and take his place.

But, even though the story’s conclusion would not have surprised anybody, especially if it were announced as a fait accompli, Latham took the unusual step of unveiling eight “finalists” for the position. [It’s a total white-out](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/04/30/eight-latham-partners-named-as-potential-successors-to-bill-voge/).

Pathetic.

Voge left for inappropriate behavior in the middle of a moment that is raising awareness about barriers to women, and Latham is going roll out a finalists list with only two women. There are no people of color that I can see, though I suppose Latham will tell me that one of them is Irish and that the Irish are the blacks of Europe.

I really would support something like the [“Rooney Rule”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooney_Rule) for managing partners. You don’t have to hire a woman or minority to be the head coach of your firm. But you have to at least interview them. You have to put them through the process. One of the things we know about the success of the Rooney Rule in actual football is that candidates who wouldn’t have otherwise been considered get to go through the process, learn something, and become stronger candidates for the next opportunity. Yes, you hope that somebody is just going to waltz in there and knock your socks off. But, more often than not, people like head coaches and managing partners are groomed.

In any event, this list of finalists, given who Latham is coming off of, is an incredibly bad look. It looks like a list of potential Trump appointees, not a list of potential leaders of a global powerhouse law firm.

# Milbank's Reopening Plan Includes More Mandatory In-Office Days For Younger Associates
## Are any other firms requiring younger associates to spend more time in the office than their peers?

When will lawyers at some of the largest firms in America have to head back to the office after their prolonged absence due to COVID-19? More and more, the answer seems to be the first week of November. At least half a dozen firms have settled on the first or second week of November, and one more prominent firm is about to join them.

Late last week, the executive committee at Milbank — a firm that was once referred to as Thrillbank for taking the lead on Biglaw’s 2018 move to the [$190K salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) — notified attorneys in New York, D.C., and Los Angeles that November 8 would be their mandatory return date. What will that entail? Here’s a relevant excerpt from the memo (emphasis added; available in full on the next page):

Starting November 8, associates in classes 2021 and 2020 are expected to return to the office four days a week.  All other lawyers are expected to return to the office three days a week.  However, all lawyers will be permitted to work on a fully remote basis the weeks of November 22 (Thanksgiving holiday) and December 27 (Christmas/New Year’s holiday).

We will remain flexible in accommodating lawyers with specific personal health risks or circumstances that would impact their return to the office at this time.  Extended full-time remote working arrangements are still permitted for those with extenuating circumstances through January 2022 and should be discussed with and approved by legal personnel and your practice group leader.

First- and second-year associates are required to be in the office more than their elder colleagues, and further down in the memo, we see that first-year associates will actually be starting their time in the office next week, on October 21. To our immediate knowledge, Milbank may be one of the only firms requiring younger associates to spend more days per week in the office than their peers. Is this the “nice” thing to do, since thus far, both class years have been deprived of the true experience of working at the firm? Sure, we suppose. Is this the necessary thing to do? That’s another question entirely….

Many Biglaw firms — including Milbank (per the firm’s memo) — are all about getting back to their “culture of collaboration, mentoring, and teamwork,” while the new generation of lawyers is all about work-life balance, health, wellness, and safety during the pandemic. Milbank looks a little less thrilling when its attendance requirements include more work for younger associates in the form of an avoidable commute and the anxiety that could be caused by having more required in-office time than their colleagues.

We suppose we’ll see how this works out for the firm but right now, folks don’t seem too pleased.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

[](http://bit.ly/2N1nLWH)Millennials currently make up the largest portion of the U.S. workforce. Their unique working style is contributing to a shift in workplace dynamics and it would be prudent for your law firm to understand what makes this cohort tick.

As such, and in partnership with our friends at [Major Lindsey & Africa](http://bit.ly/2ptVOJW), we have launched a series of surveys intended to dig deeper into cultural shifts in priorities and goals at law firms, as well as general generational differences that may exist between younger lawyers and more seasoned attorneys. Please take a couple minutes and share your thoughts regarding [Priorities](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_79S5zZLTTNTlXNj), [Goals](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_7WIkBLDVlyWgIa9), and [Generational Differences](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_e2Ofa0qPgXOvR6R) with us! (And please note that lawyers of all ages are encouraged to take these surveys!)

# Mega Firm Announces More Austerity Measures -- This Time Salary Cuts Are The Name Of The Game
## The hits just keep on coming.

Biglaw austerity measures just don’t take a break. And it makes sense since time is meaningless during quarantine, so if COVID-19 cost-cutting measures pile on ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

Mega firm Dentons has already made some COVID-19 austerity measures ([they’re delaying partial payment of 2019 bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/mega-firm-announces-bonus-delays-amid-covid-19-uncertainty/?rf=1)) and today the firm announced that wasn’t the end of their cost-cutting. Starting on May 1st, the firm will institute compensation cuts across the board for all employees making $60,000+.

So what are the exact cuts being made? In a four page memo ([available on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/dentons-salary-cuts/2/)) that, in addition to detailing the current cuts explains the firm’s guiding principles that they’ll use to govern during the pandemic, the firm’s Chief Executive Officer Mike McNamara explains:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
• For Partners, all will see reductions in draws of at least 20%, with reductions for many including the most highly compensated Partners much higher than 20%.
• For employees, both timekeepers and business services staff, these reductions will be progressive starting at 0% and reaching 20% for those earning in excess of $190,000. There will be no reduction for team members who earn $60,000 or less.
• Consistent with our performance culture and our guiding principles, there will be a bonus mechanism process to ensure that individual high performers – lawyers, professionals and business services staff – will be able to recover some or all of these reductions, dependent on the Firm’s overall 2020 economic performance.

Good luck to the firm as it navigates these COVID-19 waters.

# Biglaw Firm Announces New Bonus Structure, And Associates Don't Seem Happy
## Underwhelming to say the least.

When a Biglaw firm starts teasing changes to their bonus structure months before they’re actually ready to release it, they (knowingly or not) are building hype. So when the new scale finally drops, it’d best be stellar, otherwise Above the Law is gonna get tips like this:

Another disappointed Seyfarth Shaw associate here.

Let’s back up just a smidge. Sources at Seyfarth Shaw tell us the talk about the bigger, better bonus pool started in October with an email from managing partner Pete Miller. Then earlier this month, associates were promised the “enhanced” bonus policy by the end of the month, but when the details were finally released, they were underwhelming:

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Today we received the email with details of the “enhanced” policy, which is basically a guaranteed minimum bonus (which is so far below market I’m surprised they sent a memo) and a new “discretionary” bonus based on a vague set of criteria. Nobody is putting any weight in the discretionary bonus, so basically there is no change at all.

The full policy is available below, but it provides bonus minimums based on billable targets. And one of the most… interesting points is that bonuses are tiered by levels — associate, managing associate, and senior associate — without the additional levels of class year distinctions that are typical at Biglaw firms. Also, while these are intended to only be a floor on bonuses, many associates aren’t confident they’ll see much more.

To say associates are miffed would be an understatement. The most galling part of the email is the claim that the firm’s compensation package “is equivalent to or greater than our competitors in the market.” REALLY??!!! What competitors? Seyfarth brings in about $1,000,000 PPP. There’s no way other firms in that range are paying bonuses this low. $12,000 for billing over 2000 hours for sixth years?!! None of us are expecting to be paid on the Cravath scale, but this is awful.

Here’s hoping when bonuses based on the policy are finally paid out associates are pleasantly surprised by the firm’s largess.

Cy Vance has been doing some really top-notch things as a prosecutor. But he’s also been criticized for overreaching, for trying cases that he shouldn’t be trying. This may be another one of those cases where the question is: Why is he pushing ahead?

— [Bennett Gershman](http://www.law.pace.edu/faculty/bennett-l-gershman), Pace Law School professor and former prosecutor with the Manhattan DA’s office, wondering exactly why there’s a retrial in the prosecution of Stephen DiCarmine and Joel Sanders for their roles in the demise of Biglaw firm Dewey & LeBoeuf. Read more about how this case may be Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance’s “White Whale” [here](https://www.law360.com/articles/884999?series=dewey_retrial).

[Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/morning-docket/)
# Morning Docket: 02.02.18
## * In case you missed it, Linda Greenhouse of the New York Times has noticed a trend when it comes to Chief Justice Roberts and who he's been aligning himself with at the Supreme Court. He may not yet be a moderate, but he seems to be shying away from ""the reliably right-wing triumvirate"" of Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch. [[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/opinion/chief-justice-roberts-middle.html)] * “The document speaks for itself.” All three of former Trump campaign aide Rick Gates’s lawyers are withdrawing as counsel, and will only explain why in documents filed under seal. Only his Biglaw attorney who is known for his plea deals remains. Gates is under indictment in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. [[POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/amp/story/2018/02/01/lawyers-for-rick-gates-withdraw-from-russia-case-383422)] * According to the latest year-end report from the Wells Fargo Private Bank’s Legal Specialty Group, law firm revenue and profits were up in 2017, and demand had increased for legal services. As usual, the most profitable firms at the top of the market outperformed their smaller counterparts. [[American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2018/01/31/law-firm-revenue-profits-up-in-2017-wells-fargo-report/)] * Trump administration policies having to do with immigration, specifically the H-1B visa program for foreign workers, may force many Biglaw firms to move to their practices to the cloud sooner than they would have liked. In times of ""political uncertainty"" like these, Biglaw can't rely on ""offshore labor arbitrage"" for IT outsourcing. [[TechTarget](http://searchcio.techtarget.com/news/252434227/Law-firm-Trump-administration-policies-may-reshape-IT-outsourcing)] * The GC of the American Red Cross has resigned following the publication of a report that he praised a former colleague who was the subject of an internal investigation and pushed out of the organization for alleged instances sexual misconduct. [[Corporate Counsel](https://www.law.com/sites/corpcounsel/2018/02/01/020118meltzer/)] * Disgusting: A Georgia lawyer who asked a witness to recant an eyewitness account of her son's molestation has politely gave up his license to practice law after pleading guilty to felony witness tampering and attempting to suborn perjury.

Chief Justice Roberts would like you to simmer down. (Nati Harnik/AP)

* In case you missed it, Linda Greenhouse of the New York Times has noticed a trend when it comes to Chief Justice Roberts and who he’s been aligning himself with at the Supreme Court. He may not yet be a moderate, but he seems to be shying away from “the reliably right-wing triumvirate” of Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch. [[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/opinion/chief-justice-roberts-middle.html)]

* “The document speaks for itself.” All three of former Trump campaign aide Rick Gates’s lawyers are withdrawing as counsel, and will only explain why in documents filed under seal. Only his Biglaw attorney who is known for his plea deals remains. Gates is under indictment in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.

* According to the latest year-end report from the Wells Fargo Private Bank’s Legal Specialty Group, law firm revenue and profits were up in 2017, and demand had increased for legal services. As usual, the most profitable firms at the top of the market outperformed their smaller counterparts. [[American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2018/01/31/law-firm-revenue-profits-up-in-2017-wells-fargo-report/)]


* Trump administration policies having to do with immigration, specifically the H-1B visa program for foreign workers, may force many Biglaw firms to move to their practices to the cloud sooner than they would have liked. In times of “political uncertainty” like these, Biglaw can’t rely on “offshore labor arbitrage” for IT outsourcing. [[TechTarget](http://searchcio.techtarget.com/news/252434227/Law-firm-Trump-administration-policies-may-reshape-IT-outsourcing)]

* The GC of the American Red Cross has resigned following the publication of a report that he praised a former colleague who was the subject of an internal investigation and pushed out of the organization for alleged instances sexual misconduct.

# We Needed A Whole 'Spotlight' Investigation To Figure Out Boston Is Still Racist?

I’ve lived in Boston (well, near Boston), and New York and Indianapolis. I unflinchingly saw that Boston is more like Indianapolis than New York in terms of opportunities and equality for people of color. I didn’t need an entire Boston Globe “Spotlight” investigation to tell me that Massachusetts is a terrible place to be black, they make it really obvious all the time.

[But, apparently some people do](http://apps.bostonglobe.com/spotlight/boston-racism-image-reality/series/power/).

The Globe’s Spotlight Team examined whether Boston still deserves its longstanding reputation as an inhospitable place for blacks. It found that in the corridors of power, blacks have failed to gain commensurate economic and political clout in a city where they make up nearly one-quarter of the population…

Despite Boston’s reputation as a liberal bastion, the region’s power base remains largely white men. Blacks’ political achievements are more occasional than institutional. There are no black faces in Massachusetts’ congressional delegation, nor among statewide officeholders, and the only black to win election to statewide office since 1972 is former governor Deval Patrick. Such infrequent electoral victories are different from an ongoing voice in all the affairs of a city.

Honestly, if I have to hear one more New Englander tell me Boston has “changed” because of Deval Patrick and David Ortiz, I’m going to kidnap one of the Wahlbergs and Pygmalion his ass until his own people reject him.

There are a number of ways Boston has managed to reduce the political and social power of its large minority population, and the Spotlight piece gives attention to all of them. Of particular note, Spotlight focuses on how Boston’s lack of minority business power leads to the lack of political power for minorities.

That’s how the piece ends up on law firms. It’s obvious that there are very few minority Biglaw partners working out of Boston’s top firms. But when you put that obvious reality into a helpful chart, it’s really stark:

That is a JOKE.

And, of course, that problem compounds on itself. If you have a rep for not being good for black people, and you don’t hire black people, up-and-coming black people are going to stay the hell away, thus making it even more difficult for you to hire black people even if you are so inclined.

Take me: I, you know, give career advice to young lawyers of color trying to figure out how to start their careers. You want to know how many times I advise a young attorney to go to Boston? To work? Forever? NOT OFTEN! You’ve got to show up in my inbox with some very special circumstances before I say “yeah, that offer from Ropes & Gray is the one you want to take.”

“Elie, should I work in Boston?”
“No.”
“But the firm…”
“Doesn’t matter.”
“Also, I literally only eat shellfish, and actively enjoy getting my ass kicked on Saint Patrick’s Day.”
“… fine. Live in Jamaica Plain though.”

Boston is the guy that gets drunk, punches you, compliments your ability to take the punch, then starts crying. It’s too racist to change, but secretly wishes it actually wanted to.

And look, it’s not like Boston doesn’t have an opportunity to attract talented black and brown professionals. It has, like, ALL THE SCHOOLS. It’s the gravitational center of every institution of higher learning north of Yale. Lots of minorities have had the opportunity to sample what Boston has to offer, and most of them FLEE as soon as the ink is dry on their diplomas.

But that’s also why it’s impossible to talk about Boston without talking about New York. New York has many flaws, but it feels more like a “meritocracy” than Boston. Boston is an insular city. It’s parochial. Power is doled out along the lines of who went to freaking grade school with who. NYC doles out power based on whoever has the most money. Oh sure, actually having the most money relies on a non-meritorious network of insular connections. But the allure of New York is the legal fiction that you can make enough money that you can’t be ignored. You can carpetbag New York, and minorities rightly see that as an opportunity. Boston feels like a gated community, by comparison.

And white Boston is still pretty happy with things being that way. We’re talking about a city that had a crisis of identity when its baseball team actually DIDN’T SUCK for once. It’ll have a “black mayor” eventually, but he’ll be a former Beanpot champion who can trace his roots back to Crispus Attucks or something.

* There’s a lot to say about Brett Kavanaugh’s speech at Notre Dame Law School, but he used the opportunity to bash the US News rankings blasting the idea that the publication’s reputation survey can capture the quality of an education. His clerks this Term all went to Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. [[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/26/politics/brett-kavanaugh-notre-dame-speech/index.html)]

* Shearman & Sterling used to be a top 5 earning firm. Now it’s banking on a merger — that feels more like a takeover — to save it. What happened? [[American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/01/27/shearmans-long-road-from-wall-street-darling-to-merger-partner-405-116391/)]

* Ted Lieu proposes resolution to regulate AI written by AI. I guess we already let oil companies write environmental laws so this isn’t much different. [[NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/ted-lieu-artificial-intelligence-bill-congress-chatgpt-rcna67752)]

* John Eastman disbarment proceedings coming soon. [[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/26/trump-lawyer-john-eastman-california-disbar-2020-election)]

* Republicans target ESG rules. It’s one thing to complain about the SEC, but these proposals would bar investment funds from making demands on companies they own. So much for the free market!

# The Hottest Biglaw Practice Areas For Lateral Moves And More
## It's still a great time to make a lateral move.

I am running out of words to describe how utterly bonkers the Biglaw lateral market is. I mean, yes, [fire is still accurate](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/the-biglaw-lateral-market-is-fire-right-now/) or [red hot](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/biglaws-throwing-around-500000-signing-bonuses-in-red-hot-lateral-market/) if you prefer and yeah, it’s going to[ keep on going](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/biglaws-hiring-blitz-is-far-from-over/). And law firms are emptying their arsenals: [raises](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2021-associate-salary-increase/), [special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/biglaw-bonus-tracker-2021/), [signing bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/biglaws-throwing-around-500000-signing-bonuses-in-red-hot-lateral-market/), [retention bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/is-skadden-arps-handing-out-retention-bonuses-to-only-some-associates/), and even [non-comp-related perks](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/not-all-law-firms-think-they-need-to-hand-out-big-raises-and-bonuses-to-attract-the-best-talent/) in the fight to compete for the best and brightest associates (or at least [ones that are available](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/biglaw-job-offers-without-interviews-what-hath-the-hot-lateral-market-wrought/)).

And now there are some hard data points to put with the[ Great Lateralization](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/stat-of-the-week-the-great-lateralization/). The legal data company Decipher, which provides firms with due diligence on lateral hires, as[ reported by](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/lateral-associate-moves-increased-51-compared-to-prior-four-years-according-to-due-diligence-firm) ABA Journal, has quantified the lateral moves. And, the high-level numbers are eye-popping: through September 30th, 13,987 associates moved to new firms, a 51 percent increase over the previous four-year average for that time period.

They’ve also broken down where and in which practice areas most of the moves are coming from:

The two most active practice areas for lateral associate moves were data privacy, which saw a 116% increase, and corporate, which experienced a 91% increase over the four-year average. Insurance also saw a 66% increase in lateral associate moves.

Decipher reports that all the major markets saw at least double-digit increases in associates moves compared to the previous four-year average. The markets leading the way were Miami (64% increase), Chicago (62% increase) and New York (56% increase).

Lateral partner moves were also up over the four-year average, but only by 8 percent. Here’s how those moves shook out:

Data privacy was also the most active practice area for partner moves, with a 58% increase compared to the previous four-year average. Additionally, the energy sector saw a 48% increase in lateral partner moves.

Leading the way among practice areas that saw decreases in lateral partner moves were bankruptcy (-26%) and environmental law (-15%).

Orange County, California, saw the largest increase in lateral partner moves, experiencing a 75% increase compared to the previous four-year average for the first three quarters of the year. The District of Columbia (33%) and Denver (31%) were the other two major markets to see more than 30% increases.

So, there you have it. It’s still a great time to explore your options in Biglaw.

# Leadership Blaming Working From Home For Its Own Data Privacy Failures
## Get ready for executives to blame the next big cyberattack on all you pesky kids working from home.

From the earliest days of the pandemic, a certain class of business leaders have ripped the concept of remote work. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon is an [outspoken critic of working from home](https://fortune.com/2022/10/19/goldman-sachs-ceo-david-solomon-brought-office-working-back-to-pre-pandemic-levels/) even though Goldman Sachs research data proved [working from home increased productivity](https://www.businessinsider.com/worker-productivity-increased-during-pandemic-remote-work-goldman-sachs-2021-7). He’s not alone. A number of prominent executives bemoan the hybrid work model even as multiple studies confirm its work and the financial returns their own companies reaped from that era should remove all doubt. Other than businesses that [care a lot more about commercial real estate holdings](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/we-need-all-lawyers-in-the-office-says-bank-definitely-not-freaking-out-about-commercial-real-estate-portfolio/) than productivity, working from home — at least some of the week — is a sound business strategy.

Law firms aren’t immune to the warrantless obsession with offices. Some firms are [descending into paranoia](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/biglaw-firms-three-day-office-workweek-descending-into-paranoid-surveillance/) and [retaliating through bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/associates-hit-with-unannounced-bonus-reductions-for-not-being-in-the-office-enough/). Hybrid work models carry risk, especially when it comes to training because the employees most capable of working from home are also the most valuable employees for delivering in-person training to the next generation. But the fear of a complete training collapse seems overblown at this juncture.

Alas, this makes working from home the perfect excuse! If your boss cannot be shaken from the belief that working from home hurts the bottom line despite mountains of empirical data, then there’s no limit to the failures you can pin on working from home. The boss will buy it!

FTI Consulting just released [The Most Valuable, Vulnerable Commodity](https://www.ftitechnology.com/resources/white-papers/digital-insights-and-risk-management), a report exploring data and cybersecurity concerns across major businesses. The report is based on a survey of senior-level executives and supplemental one-on-one interviews between analyst Brad Blickstein and senior leaders. As a reflection of perception, the report is a critical guide to the pain points business leaders want addressed and the marketing opportunities available to vendors — including law firms — over the short-term.

But it also, by its nature, carries any false assumptions and biases taking root in corporate groupthink about data. Unsurprisingly, the folks responsible for protecting data are already laying the groundwork to pin any future blame on those pesky kids working from home:

Remote and hybrid work have made data privacy and security more challenging. Nearly half (41%) of respondents stated that data is being shared on devices and through systems that are not sanctioned or covered within the organization’s data privacy policies. Over one-third (38%) stated that remote and hybrid work have made it more difficult for the organization to monitor compliance with or enforce data privacy policies. And even more stated that remote work has increased their potential breach/attack surface.

These people realize that there are multiple proven solutions on the market to keep offsite work in a secure environment, right? Remote desktops are not even particularly new technology.

In fairness, the 41 percent who said data is being shared on unapproved devices didn’t specifically tie that to working from home. But the 38 percent claiming that remote work has complicated monitoring data makes you wonder how the hell they’re storing the data in the first place.

But the line “even more stated that remote work has increased their potential breach/attack surface” goes in the pantheon of corporate buck passing. The 45 percent of respondents with this answer aren’t saying that working from home has caused a breach or attack, but that it has increased the potential in a wholly unspecified manner. A convenient excuse in an atmosphere of increasing risk! With the risk increasing for any number of reasons, why not preemptively blame everyone else if something goes wrong?



This answer is especially disingenuous in the legal space. Lawyers have worked from the home or on the road for years. When lawyers used to pile into the office for 12 hours a day, it’s not like they stopped working when they went home. This industry has not offered attorneys a cleanly demarcated “clock out” in decades. Increasing the hours that lawyers work remotely has not introduced any new risk that hasn’t been there when lawyers logged on from their kids’ soccer games on Saturday mornings in 2004. If a firm hadn’t allocated resources to protect data from the risks of remote work already, then it has bigger problems.

# Clients Sometimes Give Gifts To Their Lawyers
## But clients should never feel obliged to provide gifts to lawyers.

There are certain professionals who typically receive gifts on an annual or otherwise regular basis. For instance, many people give a gift to their doorman or mail person around the holidays, and people regularly provide gifts to other professionals with whom they are close. Clients also sometimes provide gifts to lawyers, and although this is in no way expected (and lawyers need to follow ethical rules), receiving a gift can be really special for legal professionals.

There are certain situations in which clients are more likely to provide a gift to a lawyer. Perhaps the most common reason a client would provide a gift to a lawyer is after the lawyer secures a victory or completes a project for a client. If a client received a particularly good result from a lawyer, it is possible that a client will think that a lawyer should be rewarded with a little something extra. This helps memorialize a victory and can help lawyers and clients solidify their connection.

Earlier in my career, I worked for a partner who handled a number of high-profile cases. Many of his former clients provided him gifts to celebrate victories. Some of the gifts were pretty particular to the case at hand, and I seem to remember that this partner had a model train in his office that was gifted to him by a client whose case involved trains. Another partner I once worked with showed off a trophy that his client had made up conveying that this lawyer was a rock star for securing a victory for that particular client.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Some of the gifts provided to former partners with whom I worked were pretty luxurious. One partner told me that he was gifted a bottle of brandy worth over a thousand dollars by a doctor client of his after successfully defending a medical malpractice lawsuit. Other lawyers I have worked for got treated to really expensive dinners, and if I remember correctly, vacations as a result of securing a victory for a client.

Another situation in which clients sometimes give gifts to lawyers is when the attorney goes above and beyond for a client in a situation. Of course, being paid is enough of a reward for lawyers, and there are many painstaking parts of being an attorney. However, sometimes clients want to give lawyers something extra to make up for discomfort or other burdens borne by lawyers.

One time, I was handling a closing for a client, and the closing was much more complex than usual. There were title issues, and COVID-19 and other factors made it more difficult to get the necessary municipal approvals for the closing. I probably spent twice or maybe three times more energy on this closing than usual, which I was fine doing. Closings are sometimes luck of the draw, and some closings are super easy while others are more difficult, and it is impossible to predict which closings will be simple and which may be complicated.

In any event, I think my client felt bad that I had to work harder than usual, and the client sent me a really nice gift basket. It was completely unnecessary, but it felt good to be recognized by my client for my hard work. It is not too uncommon for all types of professionals to be gifted items if they are working especially hard for someone, and this can also occur with lawyers.

It is also not uncommon for lawyers to be gifted items around the holidays. As discussed in a prior article, lawyers routinely [receive gifts from vendors](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/thank-you-vendors-for-providing-holiday-gifts-to-legal-professionals/) around the holidays, and this makes the holiday season a little more cheerful. Clients do, although less frequently, sometimes provide holidays gifts to their lawyers. I once worked at a law firm that handled a huge portfolio of work for one client. Even though we owed a lot to this client, it was the client that sent us holiday treats every year. One year, I distinctly remember this client sending a bunch of pies to our office along with a note thanking the firm and its lawyers for all of our hard work the previous year. Lawyers usually need to give gifts to clients and express their gratitude for the patronage of clients, and it meant a lot to have a client acknowledge the hard work of our firm and give us treats that made the holiday season even better.

Of course, clients should never feel obliged to provide gifts to lawyers. I once had a boss who said that clients will rarely give you a pat on the back, and it was enough of a reward just to be paid by a client. I agree with this sentiment. However, some clients do provide gifts to their lawyers in a number of situations, and this can positively impact the attorney-client connection.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Disgraced Former Biglaw Chair Caught In College Admissions Scandal Escapes Disbarment
## Did Biglaw play a role in why he committed the crime?

Gordon Caplan will, eventually, be allowed to practice law again. The onetime [co-managing partner at Willkie Farr](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/willkie-farr-ditches-gordon-caplan-nabbed-in-varsity-blues-scandal/) found himself[ caught in the “Varsity Blues”](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/willkie-farr-chair-caught-in-college-admissions-scandal/) college admissions scandal, eventually [pleading guilty](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/suspended-co-chair-of-biglaw-firm-charged-in-college-admissions-scandal-will-plead-guilty/) to paying $75,000 to “college coaches” turned government cooperating witnesses in a scheme to have a professional alter his daughter’s answers on the ACT in order to get her a higher score. He was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani to[ one month of jail time](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/disgraced-former-biglaw-chair-gets-jail-time-for-his-role-in-college-admissions-scandal/). But he knew that, even after serving his time, there were still potential consequences for his blind ambition that had become focused on his daughter’s college admission. His license to practice law was suspended on an interim basis, and the fight to stop disbarment, the so-called death penalty of the legal profession, was on.

Yesterday, Caplan learned he’d avoided disbarment. As [reported by](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2021/02/18/avoiding-disbarment-ex-willkie-co-chair-caplan-gets-2-year-suspension-over-college-admissions-scandal/) Law.com, Caplan instead received a two-year suspension, retroactive to his November 2019 interim suspension:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
On Thursday, the First Department released an [extensive opinion](http://www.nycourts.gov/reporter/3dseries/2021/2021_01125.htm) laying out the history of Caplan’s wrongdoing along with numerous factors that “mitigated” in his favor. The court wrote that “a two-year suspension retroactive to [Caplan’s] 2019 [interim] suspension [from practicing law in New York] properly balances [Caplan’s] criminal conduct with the substantial evidence in mitigation, the protection of the public, maintaining the honor and integrity of the profession and as a deterrence to others from committing similar misconduct.”

In making this call, the opinion lasered in on Caplan’s remorse, charitable work, the high esteem his legal career was held in (before the scandal broke), and the unlikely chance of a repeat offense:

“The Referee noted that the record itself showed that respondent’s [Caplan’s] criminal actions were ‘out of character with his professional life and his desire to make amends,’” the First Department panel of justices wrote in their decision.

Caplan “presented his pre-sentencing memorandum with some 70 letters of support from, among others, family, friends, former colleagues and Greenwich[, Connecticut] policemen, all of which showed ‘the breadth and depth of Caplan’s extensive pro bono activities, his help to others in need, his millions of dollars in financial contributions and hours of personal service to Fordham Law School and Cornell University and his numerous acts of generosity and kindness throughout his career,’” the justices also wrote while in part quoting the referee.

“At the [referee’s] hearing, the former Chairman of [Willkie] where [Caplan] worked testified that, inter alia, he had worked with respondent for nearly 20 years and knew him quite well due to their management positions, and there was ‘universal respect and affection’ for him,” the justices further wrote.

The former Willkie chairman, who was not named in the opinion, “explained that anybody who knows [Caplan] saw his misconduct as ‘a real aberration, understood by everyone to be an act of zealousness and protectiveness for his daughter. But it doesn’t change anybody’s views who know him as to his reputation,’” they wrote.

Also of interest is a quote from Caplan, made during the criminal case, in the ethics opinion. While still taking responsibility for his actions, Caplan notes the role Biglaw may have played in his actions:

“This was hubris. It was arrogant. It was about me, not about my child. That took a lot of self-realization. It was deep insecurity, I think. I frankly think a lot of people in my former [legal] profession have this notion of having to prove yourself all the time. It overwhelmed me and it destroyed my life. I destroyed my life.”

So let that be a warning to others out there — don’t let the culture of the legal profession lead you down a path that could destroy your life.

# Biglaw Associates May Be Getting Paid Less, But Shouldn't Take Their Good Fortune For Granted

[A]ssociates at Big Law have an advantage compared to a decade ago: job stability. Letting people go is expensive, and when business picks up and you are missing people, you now have to train someone from scratch. It is fair for associates to be concerned? Yes, but we need to keep things in perspective. Things could have been a lot worse.

— Professor [Eli Wald](https://www.law.du.edu/about/people/eli-wald) of the University of Denver Sturm College of Law, commenting on the fact that Biglaw associates have [largely lucked out during the economic downturn caused by the pandemic](https://www.law.com/2020/08/18/associates-are-getting-squeezed-but-not-like-during-the-great-recession/) compared to what happened during the Great Recession when associates were subject to layoffs. Wald went on to note that associates shouldn’t worry about the pay cuts their firms have instituted since normal pay structures will likely resume in 2021.

# Are Biglaw Leaders Doing 'Irreparable Harm' To Their Firms By Delaying Full Reopenings?
## Some are starting to wonder how long this waiting game can last.

How long can we wait ‘til we start doing irreparable harm to your culture, to training, to all those value propositions from in-person interaction?

Once you get past the beginning of November, you’re looking at Thanksgiving, and then the December holidays. If you miss that window, you’re probably talking about sometime early in 2022, which is a really daunting thing to think about.

I don’t think [voluntary office attendance] is sustainable in the long run. The question is: How long can the short run be?

— [Paul Schmidt](https://www.bakerlaw.com/PaulMSchmidt), chairman of BakerHostetler, offering his thoughts on Biglaw firms that have [delayed their “post”-pandemic reopenings](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/firms-delay-office-returns-raising-fear-of-irreparable-harm) and are encouraging voluntary office attendance. Schmidt’s firm was supposed to officially reopen on September 8, but those plans were scrapped thanks to the Delta variant. BakerHostetler has not announced a new reopening date.

# The 2022 Biglaw Diversity Scorecard: Record-Breaking Progress Has Been Made!
## There is finally some news worth celebrating when it comes to law firm diversity.

Year in and year out, we watch law firm after law firm pay lip service to their commitment to diversity in the legal profession, with promises to recruit, retain, and promote more minority attorneys. If there’s ever going to be any real change in the legal industry, diversity has to be more than just a buzzword — it must be a priority at every law firm. And last year, it was. There is finally some news worth celebrating when it comes to law firm diversity.

According to the American Lawyer’s 2022 Diversity Scorecard — a ranking that tracks racial and ethnic diversity across firm leadership, equity partners, and other attorneys at Am Law 200 and National Law Journal 250 law firms — there was [record-breaking progress](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/05/31/big-laws-record-breaking-diversity-gains-show-industrys-commitment-to-progress/) over the past year. In fact, it was the biggest year-over-year improvement since 2001. Let’s take a look at the numbers:

The total number of minority attorneys rose to 20.2%, up from 18.5% last year and 17.8% in 2020. The number of minority partners also climbed, reaching 11.9%, up from 10.9% in 2021, and the percentage of minority nonpartners hit 26.7%, up from 24.6% in 2021. …

Firms embraced innovation with DEI in mind, in part due to the lasting impact of the murder of George Floyd in May 2020 and the racial justice protests that followed. Clients also played a major role in the movement, as they took steps to refine their DEI goals and hold law firms accountable.

This is meaningful, says Caren Ulrich Stacy, founder and chief experimentation officer at Diversity Lab. “More than 1% growth is at least worth celebrating. We did move,” she said. “We didn’t backslide at a time when everyone was thrown through a loop—organizationally, professionally and personally.”

Thanks to a [new methodology](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/05/31/why-we-changed-the-diversity-scorecard-methodology/) for this ranking, the firm that took top honors this year — immigration firm Fragomen, Del Rey, Bernsen & Loewy — is new to being the nation’s most diverse firm (but it usually places well within the top five firms). At Fragomen, 41% of the firm’s head count is made up of minority attorneys, and 27% of its US equity partners are minorities.

Following Fragomen, the rest of the top five on this year’s Diversity Scorecard, in order, were White & Case; Kasowitz Benson Torres; Munger, Tolles & Olson; and Clearly Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. Hanson Bridgett; Morrison & Foerster; Baker McKenzie; Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr; and Berry Appleman & Leiden rounded out the top 10. Berry Appleman had placed first two years in a row under the previous methodology.

Kasowitz and Cleary were both among the top five based on African American attorney representation. Berry Appleman ranked in the top five for both Asian American and Hispanic attorney representation.

On the whole, lawyers in each ethnic minority group saw a modest amount of growth in 2021, according to this year’s Diversity Scorecard.

Which law firms are the best for diversity in 2022? Here’s the crowded Top 25 (technically the Top 27 thanks to some ties):

# A Crisis Of Confidence In Law Firms
## A new survey shows lawyers doubting their ability to manage change.

Are law firm leaders across the industry paying attention to what’s happening in the legal market? Apparently not, at least according to the tenth edition of the [Law Firms In Transition Survey](http://www.altmanweil.com/LFiT2018/) published by Altman Weil. The survey, started in the wake of the legal market nosedive precipitated by the Great Recession, polls firms of 50 or more lawyers across the U.S. and asks a broad slate of questions about the general state of the industry.

Lawyers Questioning Their Own Abilities

The Altman Weil survey offers a wealth of insights on the thinking of large law firms and their clients, too many for a single column to digest, but one of the more pressing results is the abysmal numbers on law firm leadership’s confidence in their partners to change, adapt, and thrive in the coming years.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
How abysmal? Take a look at the numbers on lawyers’ confidence in their law firm leadership in tackling the issues facing the industry. Back in 2011, optimism was abounding as the economy started clawing its way back. Only 7.8 percent of 2011’s survey respondents had low confidence in their leadership’s ability to navigate the new legal landscape, while 23.9 percent had high confidence. In 2018, the mood has gotten black. A full third of respondents indicated low confidence in their firm’s leadership, while only 5.6 percent had high confidence.

And the statistics only get worse from there. How do lawyers rate their partners’ awareness of the challenges of the new legal market? About 50 percent voted “low,” while only 2 percent voted “high.”

When asked how serious law firms were about changing their legal models to provide greater value, 57 percent of law firm respondents responded “low” compared to 2.6 percent “high.” But if you think attorneys have a poor view of their desire to innovate, our clients have an even poorer one.

A whopping 90 percent of clients rated their law firms’ seriousness about innovating their legal service model as “low.” You read that right. Despite the innovation-related buzzwords that fill the pages of law firm marketing materials across the country, clients aren’t buying it.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Perhaps the most dispiriting figure of them all: when asked why their firm isn’t doing more to change the way it provides legal services, lawyers pointed to one thing more than anything else. Nearly 70 percent said their firms weren’t changing because their partners are resisting.

Let that sink in.

We know we need to innovate, we know the legal market is changing, yet we continue to watch ourselves and our colleagues do nothing about the problem. How is this happening? I’ve [said it before,](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/biglaws-blockbuster-moment/) and I’ll say it again: law firms that fail to innovate do so at their own peril. As of today, the Altman Weil survey suggests the only firms that appear truly committed to innovating their product are the firms that are already in the top 1/3 of the market. [There’s already](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/in-defense-of-more-sizzle-less-steak/) a trend in the legal market of the rich getting richer while the rest of us fight over a shrinking pool of work. Failure to innovate among the legal industry’s middle class is only going to accelerate that trend.

I think it’s entirely possible that the problem with law firm innovation is that law firms are made up of lawyers. We tend to be a risk-averse breed, trained since our 1L year to spot potential problems and try to mitigate our way around them rather than chart bold new courses. If you want to make a lawyer’s eyes light up, give them a bright line rule to work with, or tried-and-true safe harbor language to include in an agreement. We’re so used to cautiously piloting our clients through ambiguous, dangerous waters that many of us probably can’t help but be overcautious in managing our own practices.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Some firms have been trying to mitigate this fundamental problem by introducing non-attorneys into the management structure. Non-attorney input is invaluable, but it’s often tricky and cumbersome to structure in a way that makes sense to folks from the larger business world. While ethics rules vary state-to-state, they typically prevent any sort of arrangement that looks like fee-splitting with a non-attorney. We don’t want non-attorneys, who don’t know the law and aren’t bound by our ethical rules, potentially influencing attorney decision-making.

The rationale is valid, but it nevertheless makes it hard or impossible to provide non-attorney managers a real equity stake in their firm, which limits their upside. If high-level managers can’t be rewarded with equity for working at law firms, why would they work at those firms to provide their innovations and business perspectives?

Luckily for us in the USA, we have some data to work with. Since 2011, the United Kingdom has been experimenting with allowing non-attorneys to have actual equity ownership in law firms. We’re dealing with a limited sample size, but so far the ethical apocalypse some predicted has yet to pass. One firm that took on non-lawyer ownership and investment, [Knights Solicitors](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/nonlawyer_ownership_laws_in_uk_allow_some_firms_to_thrive), has seen five-fold revenue growth and ten-fold profitability growth since bringing in non-attorneys. Another firm, Gately, had an IPO in 2015 and raised $45 million to invest into growth. That investment paid off, and its stock is up nearly 70% today compared to its debut three years back. That’s the kind of return even the stodgiest law firm partners would give a second look to.

The U.S. had a chance to jump onboard the experiment back in 2016, but [the ABA quietly let the concept die](https://biglawbusiness.com/the-debate-over-non-lawyer-firm-ownership-is-officially-closed-for-now/) without further discussion after the comments period yielded steep resistance from, unsurprisingly, attorneys. Once again, lawyers stood as the single greatest impediment to change in their own industry.

We can’t continue like this forever. Non-attorney-owned legal service providers like [LegalZoom, Axiom, and the Big Four](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/king-kong-is-coming-to-crush-your-practice-with-a-calculator/) accounting firms are ascendant. The public is increasingly turning to non-attorneys for their legal problems, and if the Altman Weil survey is accurate, nine out of 10 legal clients already think their attorneys aren’t doing enough to try to provide them more bang for their buck. The genie’s out of the bottle. We can either keep fighting a battle that we’re so far losing, or we can admit that the time has come to try a different approach.

The ethical conundrums of firm ownership by non-lawyers have to be taken seriously and dealt with, but we’re not starting from scratch. The U.K. experiment is providing us valuable data that we would be remiss to ignore. We don’t necessarily need Kirkland & Ellis listed on the NASDAQ, but we do need, as an industry, to make ourselves competitive at hiring the best, most innovative minds available. We can start by opening ourselves up to the idea that not all great law firm managers need a name that ends in “Esq.”

# Rules Are Still Rules, Even Now

Tuesday was Groundhog Day; every February 2, Punxsutawney Phil sticks his head up out his hiding place to proclaim whether winter is almost over or there will be another six weeks of it. Given that Pennsylvania, along with other locations, is digging out from a massive snowstorm, I wondered if Phil would even bother to poke his head out, but he did and there’s another six weeks of winter still to go.

The pandemic has lasted for almost a year and there is no quick end to the monotony. Many, if not all, of us are suffering from Groundhog Day syndrome, that every day is pretty much the same and looks to be that way for the foreseeable future; it doesn’t help that the whole vaccination procedure has been totally FUBAR.

As a diversion, here are several stories of colleagues behaving badly. They should take your mind off your troubles and make you glad that you don’t have any of these problems. Careers have gone up (down?) in flames when they didn’t think.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
If you ever harbor aspirations to the bench, here’s the cautionary story of Justice Jeffrey Johnson of the Second District Court of Appeal here in Los Angeles, a justice who lost his way. The California Commission on Judicial Performance, after extensive evidence and hearings, removed Justice Johnson from the bench for incidents of misconduct, sexual harassment, and [other behavior](https://cjp.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2020/06/Johnson_PR_DO_6-02-20.pdf) not befitting a judicial officer. Johnson appealed that decision to the California Supreme Court, which let stand the Commission’s [order of removal](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-27/top-california-court-oks-ouster-of-judge-for-sexual-misconduct).

The Commission’s decision to remove the justice was clearly the right decision, as it was his conduct that led to the removal. Did he, like Icarus, fly [too close to the sun](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Icarus#:~:text=%3A%20the%20son%20of%20Daedalus%20who,flies%20too%20near%20the%20sun)?

Johnson is the first appellate justice to be removed from the bench. There have been other justices here in California who have resigned, retired, whatever name you choose, especially when their behavior was scrutinized closely after the rise of the long overdue MeToo movement, which has empowered women to speak up and speak out.

Some recent examples of lawyers behaving badly: the Tennessee Supreme Court suspended an attorney for advice [he gave on Facebook](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/lawyer-suspended-for-facebook-post-explaining-how-to-shoot-an-abuser-without-getting-caught/). As alert readers know, I am not a fan of social media, one reason being ethical issues that arise.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The Tennessee Supreme Court doesn’t like social media use when it leads an attorney to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct. The first line of the Court’s opinion gets right to the heart of the dilemma of attorneys [using social media](https://www.tncourts.gov/sites/default/files/in_rewinstonbranshawsitton.opn_.pdf). “This case is a cautionary tale on the ethical problems that can befall lawyers on social media.”

The attorney gave advice to a Facebook “friend” who was seeking advice, essentially, on how to get away with murder. (Where is Viola Davis when you need her?) The attorney suggested that the friend delete the Facebook thread. And how many might have seen the thread before its purported deletion?

The court acknowledged “there is nothing wrong with lawyers participating in social media. Indeed, much good can come of it. Lawyers can establish an online presence, engage in their communities, show their personalities and interests outside the law, develop relationships on social-media platforms, and market their legal services. Lawyers participating in social media can do much to de-mystify the legal system.”

However, the court reminded attorneys that they are still bound by the Rules of Professional Conduct. It found that the attorney’s advice promoted exactly the wrong image of the legal profession and the administration of justice as “something to be manipulated, rather than respected.” The court said that the attorney’s “comments, posted for all the world to see, depict lawyers as fixers who manufacture fake defenses to evade criminal conviction.”

Does giving advice on Facebook or other social media create [an attorney/client relationship](https://www.martindale-avvo.com/blog/social-media-ethics/)? What do you think?

A Florida lawyer’s online posts [got him disbarred](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/lawyer-is-arrested-and-disbarred-after-he-accuses-judges-of-relying-on-witchcraft?utm_source=maestro&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=weekly_email), as well they should have. He was already on suspension at the time.

Witchcraft, satanism, and threats were outrageous posts the attorney made. Sexism still ran rampant through them when the attorney called one judge a “dumb satanic slut,” and bar counsel as inept and worthless and a “satanic slut.” The attorney also said that the chief justice of the Florida Supreme Court should be executed for allegedly tolerating hate crimes and witchcraft. Double, double, toil and trouble, which is exactly what this lawyer got.

A Texas judge hammered both a lawyer and his client for $150,000 (not a typo) for [sanctions arising from their conduct](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/judge-sanctions-lawyer-and-client-150k-citing-mountain-of-evasiveness-and-outright-lies?utm_source=maestro&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=weekly_email) in a foreclosure lawsuit.

The lawyer filed a lawsuit that had no basis in fact. (Has that ever happened to you?) The attorney never did his due diligence in investigating the facts before filing the lawsuit, even though that’s his job. Newbies: don’t just take what your client tells you as the truth. It often isn’t and even if it’s largely truthful, clients just naturally shade the truth for the sake of how they appear. It’s a normal human trait to want to position yourself in the best possible light.

The Texas court found that [the lawsuit was an abuse](https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/documents/401/47413/Zhang-v-Peterson-New-Territory-Investors-order-granting-sanctions.pdf) of the judicial process and that the abuses were willful and deliberate in an effort to perpetuate a fraud on the court. The court said that the case was a “mountain of evasiveness, lack of candor, concealment, numerous outright lies, and a total disregard for truth, which is the foundation of our judicial system.” A well-deserved benchslap here.

Take comfort that there are lawyers out there who behave badly and bear the consequences. Remember that even in these monotonous times, you still need to observe the rules.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Prominent Supreme Court Lawyer Jumps From Kirkland & Ellis To Quinn Emanuel

Quinn Emanuel strikes again. Not long after hiring one of the nation’s top trial lawyers, [Alex Spiro](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/spiro-alex), [away from Ben Brafman](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/quinn-emanuel-pulls-off-coup-with-big-time-criminal-defense-hire/), the litigation powerhouse has snagged a leading Supreme Court and appellate advocate. Longtime Kirkland & Ellis partner [Christopher Landau](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=8991) is leaving K&E to join Quinn.

Landau is a familiar figure to SCOTUS and appellate lawyers. A Harvard Law School graduate and former law clerk to then-Judge Clarence Thomas (on the D.C. Circuit) and Justice Antonin Scalia, Landau is a leading Supreme Court lawyer, with [eight nine arguments](https://www.oyez.org/advocates/christopher_landau) under his belt. That’s an extremely impressive number, especially for someone who has never served in the Office of the Solicitor General.

Speaking of OSG, longtime Above the Law readers might recall that Landau was a [prominent contender](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/breaking-chuck-cooper-withdraws-from-the-solicitor-general-sweepstakes/) to serve as the Trump Administration’s first Solicitor General (before Noel Francisco of Jones Day got the job). Landau was also talked about as a [possible appointment](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/circuit-court-nominees-in-the-trump-administration-the-latest-news-and-rumor-part-1/) to the circuit court for which he once clerked (before Greg Katsas, another Jones Day alum, got the D.C. Circuit spot).

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It’s not often that partners leave the incredibly prestigious and profitable Kirkland & Ellis. In recent years, K&E has been more the raider than the raided, using its deep coffers to hire superstars away from other top-tier Biglaw firms.

The obscenely profitable Quinn Emanuel — routinely the [second-most-profitable Biglaw firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/the-2017-am-law-100-a-turning-point-for-biglaw/2/) after Wachtell Lipton, with $5 million in profits per partner in 2016 — surely gave Landau a good financial deal. But I can’t help wondering whether more than money might be the issue here. (And as a partner at Kirkland, which boasts $4 million in PPP, Landau surely wasn’t starving.)


Christopher Landau (via Kirkland & Ellis)

For many years, Chris Landau was the big fish in K&E’s appellate pond. But in [September 2016](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/kirkland-ellis-hires-paul-clement-viet-dinh-and-all-of-bancrofts-lawyers/), former Solicitor General Paul Clement, viewed by many as the finest Supreme Court advocate of his generation, [joined Kirkland](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/a-closer-look-at-kirkland-elliss-pickup-of-the-bancroft-lawyers/). It’s quite possible that Landau wanted to escape from the shadow of Clement.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
(To be sure, Quinn Emanuel already has a top appellate lawyer in its ranks — name partner [Kathleen Sullivan](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/sullivan-kathleen-m/), who has argued [nine eleven cases before SCOTUS](https://www.oyez.org/advocates/kathleen_m_sullivan) — but she’s based out of New York and therefore less likely to take the D.C. spotlight away from Landau).

We reached out to Chris Landau and to Quinn Emanuel for comment but have not yet heard back. We’ll update this story if and when we do. In the meantime, congratulations to Landau on his new perch and to QE on its latest high-profile hire!

UPDATE (3:07 p.m.): Quinn Emanuel has been on quite the hiring spree in recent weeks. A reader just reminded me of another major pickup by QE: commercial litigator [Luke Nikas](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/nikas-luke), known especially for his expertise in disputes in the art world, who joined from Boies Schiller. (For more about Nikas’s move, see the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2017/12/13/boies-schiller-partner-nikas-jumps-to-quinn-emanuel/), [Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/994413/quinn-emanuel-hires-boies-schiller-litigator-in-nyc), and [Lawdragon](http://www.lawdragon.com/2017/12/13/quinn-emanuel-nabs-litigation-star-luke-nikas/).)

UPDATE (11:13 p.m.): Chris Landau reached out to me to confirm his move and provide the following statement:

I’m excited and delighted to confirm that I intend to join Quinn Emanuel. The firm’s appellate practice has grown tremendously since Kathleen Sullivan launched it a dozen years ago, and I look forward to helping continue that growth in the years to come. Kathleen was once my teacher in law school, and in the years since I haven’t met a finer lawyer or person. She and I share the belief that a successful appellate practice must be part and parcel of a firm’s overall litigation practice, and Quinn Emanuel provides a unparalleled platform for litigation at the highest level.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Very true. This is why QE is the firm of choice for many companies and individuals (most recently [Steve Bannon](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/quinn-emanuel-racks-up-another-former-trump-administration-client-steve-bannon/)) who find themselves in major litigation, high-stakes investigations, and — with talent like Sullivan and Landau — big-ticket appellate matters.

UPDATE (1/12/2018, 3:39 p.m.): Additional coverage of Landau’s hiring is available at [Big Law Business](https://biglawbusiness.com/quinn-emanuel-lands-lauded-top-court-litigator-landau/) (noting that he successfully represented a group of federal judges who sued over unconstitutional deprivation of salary adjustments) and [Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/1001318/high-court-vet-joins-quinn-emanuel-after-25-years-at-kirkland) (noting that Landau spent 25 years at Kirkland, and quoting Kathleen Sullivan as “thrilled” about his arrival and eager to begin their work together.)

Also, the SCOTUS argument counts for Landau and Sullivan have been corrected to reflect updated tallies.

More bonus news! The good folks at Schulte Roth & Zabel announced their bonuses last week, and as many at the firm expected, they matched the going rate for end-of-the-year bonuses set by Cravath last month.

Plus the firm is ponying up extra cash for associates who billed big hours this year:

In addition the firm will again reward associates who have made extraordinary contributions to the Firm and our clients by recording 2,300 and 2,500 eligible hours with additional bonuses of $20,000 for attaining each threshold (for a total of $40,000 for associates satisfying both).

Not a bad thank you for a busy year!

Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Above The Law's Top 10 Most Popular Posts Of 2016

Whether you loved it or hated it, there’s no denying that 2016 was a banner year for legal news. Every year has its big stories, of course, but those of 2016 were particularly yuge. Thanks to all this news, Above the Law experienced an increase in traffic in 2016 over 2015, in terms of both pageviews and unique visitors, as well as a record for monthly uniques (almost 1.5 million visitors).

What were the biggest stories of 2016? Here are my four personal picks.

In February, we learned of the [passing of Justice Antonin Scalia](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/antonin-scalia-reported-dead-of-natural-causes-in-west-texas/) — a justice who was, at least in [my opinion](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/justice-scalia-and-me-a-love-story/), one of the greatest to ever grace the Supreme Court. (Yes, progressives, your dissent is [duly noted](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/controversy-erupts-at-a-t14-law-school-over-how-or-even-whether-to-mourn-justice-scalia/).) President-elect Donald Trump has promised us a SCOTUS nominee [“pretty soon,”](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/trump-to-make-scotus-great-again-pretty-soon/) and that person will probably get confirmed by the Republican Senate, but there’s truly no replacing Justice Scalia.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
In June, Cravath Swaine & Moore, the archetypal Biglaw firm, [raised associate base salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/), to a new scale starting at $180,000. This pay hike — the first salary increase in almost a decade, since Simpson Thacher’s [move to the $160,000 scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/01/breaking-simpson-thacher-raises-associate-base-salaries/) in January 2007 — quickly reverberated [throughout the industry](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises/) and [across the country](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/).

In November, Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the presidential election, scoring a surprise win that stunned many (including [veteran pollsters](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/polling-and-election-2016-what-the-heck-happened-an-interview-with-pollster-charles-franklin/)). Some might say this is more of a political than legal story, but there’s no denying that Trump’s election will have major consequences for the legal world, affecting everything from who will replace Justice Scalia (hint: probably one of these [21](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/donald-trumps-supreme-court-shortlist/) [people](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/making-scotus-even-greater-trumps-supplemental-supreme-court-shortlist/)) to [how much lawyers pay in taxes](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/first-year-associates-getting-totally-hosed-by-trumps-tax-plan/) to diversity in the legal profession (at least in the eyes of my more [pessimistic colleagues](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/for-minority-and-women-elites-this-is-an-utter-repudiation/)).

Later on in November, Cravath announced its [2016 associate bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2016-associate-bonuses/). Cravath used the [2015 bonus scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2015-associate-bonuses/), and many other firms followed suit. This move was more important than it might have seemed at first glance because it reified the raises from June. Some associates feared that their firms would raise base salaries but then reduce bonuses, but after Cravath rejected that approach, it closed off that option (at least for firms that consider themselves peer firms — and everyone likes to consider themselves a Cravath peer).

So those are my choices for the big stories of 2016. But that’s just me; what about you, the readers of Above the Law? You voted with your clicks, and we will now share with you the 10 biggest stories at ATL from last year (an annual tradition we’ve done in [2015](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/above-the-laws-top-10-most-popular-posts-of-2015/), [2014](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/above-the-laws-top-10-most-popular-posts-of-2014/), [2013](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/12/above-the-laws-top-10-most-popular-posts-of-2013/), [2012](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/12/above-the-laws-top-ten-most-popular-posts-of-2012/), [2011](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/12/above-the-laws-top-ten-most-popular-stories-of-2011/), [2010](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/12/above-the-laws-top-ten-most-popular-stories-of-2010/), and [2009](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/12/above-the-laws-top-ten-most-popular-stories-of-2009/)).

Before turning to individual stories, let’s review the top general discussion topics here at Above the Law. After the homepage, our next most-visited destination was the category page for [Biglaw](http://www.abovethelaw.com/biglaw/) — not surprising, given that this was a big year for Biglaw. This was followed by our [2016 law school rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/2016-law-school-rankings/), the page devoted to the [2016 salary increase](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2016-salary-increase/), the category page of [law schools](https://abovethelaw.com/law-schools/), and the category page for [small law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/small-law-firms/) (which beat out the category page for [bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/bonuses/), reflecting our increased focus on small and boutique firms here at ATL).

This brings us to our top 10 individual stories for 2016,[[1]](#f1) in ascending order of popularity, measured in pageviews as reported by Google Analytics. Click on the title of each post to be taken to the original story. Note that pageviews do not necessarily match up with importance or seriousness. For example, you won’t see any mention of Justice Scalia’s passing, even though that was one of the biggest legal news stories of the year (but also one where we had a lot of competition; most of the stories below are ones that we either broke or took the lead on).

10. [The 2017 U.S. News Law School Rankings Leak: The Top 50](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/the-2017-u-s-news-law-school-rankings-leak-the-top-50/). Status-obsessed lawyers love their rankings, and the U.S. News law school rankings are some of the most loved — and [loathed](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/the-real-reason-law-school-deans-want-al-qaeda-to-attack-u-s-news/) — in the entire legal profession.

9. [BREAKING: The 2017 U.S. News Law School Rankings Leak!](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/breaking-the-2017-u-s-news-law-school-rankings-leak/) What were we just saying about lawyers loving law school rankings?

8. [Which Vault Top 25 Firms Have Not Yet Announced Raises?](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/which-vault-top-25-firms-have-not-yet-announced-raises/) Also catnip to lawyers: money and prestige. A few days after Cravath announced its pay raise, we called out the most prestigious firms that had not yet followed suit.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
7. [The Best Transcript Of All Time? You Be The Judge.](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-best-transcript-of-all-time-you-be-the-judge/) Readers increasingly come to ATL for industry news (see most of the other top 10 stories) and career advice, but there’s still a place for hilarity and insanity, to help make those billable hours pass more quickly. Take this amazing transcript. How often do you hear a defendant tell a judge to go f**k himself — and, perhaps more stunningly, hear the judge tell the defendant that he “look[s] like a queer,” before urging the defendant to “jack off” in open court?

6. [Associate Bonus Watch: Cravath Announces Its 2016 Associate Bonuses!](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2016-associate-bonuses/) I heard a funny story about a Biglaw partner speaking at a “town hall” and telling irate associates something like “every firm does bonuses differently” and “there isn’t really a ‘market scale’ for bonuses.” Sorry, but there is such a scale, and it’s this one.

5. [Here’s Why You Don’t Deserve The Same Raise… In Pictures](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/). My colleague Joe Patrice made the controversial case against nationwide adoption of the Cravath base salary scale (controversial to, for example, Texas associates, who enjoy salaries of $180,000-plus along with no state income tax and reasonably priced housing).

4. [The 2017 U.S. News Law School Rankings Leak: The Top 100](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/the-2017-u-s-news-law-school-rankings-leak-the-top-100/). See #10 and #9, supra.

3. [Salary Wars Scorecard: Which Firms Have Announced Raises?](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises/) As a service to Biglaw associates (and hiring partners and recruiting coordinators), my colleague Staci Zaretsky prepared this handy chart listing which firms raised salaries post-Cravath and by how much.

2. [City Attorney Spraying Anti-Trump Graffiti While Drinking Wine Is All We Have Left](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/city-attorney-spraying-anti-trump-graffiti-while-drinking-wine-is-all-we-have-left/). In the wake of Donald Trump’s election, my colleague Elie Mystal penned this eloquent column, simultaneously sad and hilarious, about a city lawyer, “wearing an ascot, holding a glass of wine, who tagged an upscale supermarket.” The post went viral on social media, with more than 61,000 shares.

1. [Breaking: NY To $180K!!! Cravath Raises Associate Base Salaries!!!](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) It’s no surprise that the Cravath pay raise was our biggest story of the year. It’s the biggest Biglaw news in a long, long time, with widespread implications for law firm recruiting, associate career paths, and partner profits. It also demonstrated Cravath’s continued leadership in the legal profession, reflected in its #1 ranking in both [Above the Law’s Biglaw firm rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/the-atl-2017-law-firm-rankings-raises-make-you-number-1/) and the [Vault 100 prestige rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/move-over-wachtell-theres-a-new-firm-at-the-top-vault-top-100-firms-2017/) (where CSM ended Wachtell Lipton’s thirteen-year reign at the top).

So those were the 10 most popular stories on Above the Law for 2016. Will 2017 be quite as exciting? Probably not.

But what kind of year 2017 shapes up to be will depend in large part upon you, our readers. Many of our biggest and best stories over the years have come from tipsters telling us what’s going on at their law firm, law school, or other setting within the legal profession. In the year ahead, please help us to enlighten and entertain lawyers and law students, and to bring transparency to an often opaque profession, by [emailing us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Story%20Idea) or texting us (646-820-8477) with noteworthy news.

Speaking of the number 10, last year Above the Law celebrated its [tenth anniversary](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/above-the-law-turns-ten-today-atl-celebrities-where-are-they-now/). As we start the new year, we’d like to extend our thanks to the readers, sources, and sponsors who have brought us to this milestone. With your continued support, our second decade will be even more fun and fabulous than the first.

# Paul Weiss Creates Non-Equity Partnership Tier To Remain 'Competitive' In The Market
## Paul Weiss had an all-equity partnership for nearly 100 years, but times have changed, and now the firm needs to change too.

Surf’s up, Biglaw! More big-name firms are now ready to ride the two-tier partnership wave, and other firms may be testing the waters soon.

Cravath was one of the first longtime holdouts to cut bait and create a [“salaried partner tier”](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/cravath-cracks-on-non-equity-partnerships/) (i.e., non-equity partners) back in November. Now, Paul Weiss — a firm that’s ranked near the tippy top of the Am Law 100 — is ready to do the same.

According to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/03/12/paul-weiss-seeing-record-year-in-revenue-and-profits-plans-compensation-partnership-changes/), Paul Weiss saw its overall revenue soar to $2 billion in 2023, an all-time record for the firm. Profits per equity partner at Paul Weiss also passed $6.5 million, another first for the firm, with average profits per equity partner up 14.8%. With all of this cash freely flowing, the firm has decided that now is the time to move forward with a two-tier partnership — on top of its now confirmed [black box compensation system for partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/01/paul-weiss-goes-dark-on-compensation/).

Why is the firm moving in this direction? Paul Weiss chair Brad Karp told Am Law that it was “to address head-on the competitive realities of the current marketplace,” and that he would “put both of those things [black box compensation and the creation of a non-equity tier] in the same category.” Here are some additional details:

While Law.com previously reported that Paul Weiss was considering a move to a two-tier partnership of equity and nonequity partners, Karp on Tuesday confirmed that the firm will implement it, following most of the Am Law 100 with the two-tier structure.

Karp said that, as of Tuesday afternoon, the firm does not have any non-equity partners, but that will change, noting the firm was “just in the process of starting” the two-tier system.

“It is critical for law firms, including Paul Weiss, to address head-on the competitive realities of the current marketplace rather than avoid the hard issues,” Karp said. “We had an all-equity partnership for close to a century, but things have shifted, and we don’t want to put ourselves at a competitive disadvantage.”

Biglaw firms like Cravath and Paul Weiss are making major moves on partnership and compensation in order to recruit and retain rainmakers and to calm dissension within their ranks — and we can expect more firms to follow the leader in the years to come. According to the 2024 Client Advisory from Hildebrandt Consulting and Citi’s Global Wealth at Work Law Firm Group, 83% of Biglaw firms expect to [increase the size of their income partner roles](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/biglaw-firms-planning-to-expand-their-nonequity-partner-ranks-in-a-big-way/) in the next two years.

Is your firm planning to move to a black-box compensation system for partners or increase its non-equity partnership ranks? Please please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com) and let us know. Thanks.

# Great Bonuses At A Great Trial Firm
## The top bonuses exceeded $200,000 -- wow!

Susman Godfrey, a leading litigation boutique with a [colorful history](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/a-deep-dive-into-the-history-of-one-of-americas-premier-law-firms/), was recently dubbed [“America’s leading trial firm.”](http://www.lawdragon.com/2017/12/03/dont-mess-texas-susman-godfrey-became-americas-leading-trial-firm/) And there’s no doubt that Susman Godfrey is in the top tier — especially when it comes to associate bonuses.

When we reported on the [2016 SG bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/associate-bonus-and-new-partner-watch-susman-godfrey/), we shared the minimum amounts. This year, we have the median amounts, which are arguably more revealing. From the firm:

Susman Godfrey announced today that in recognition of its associates’ outstanding efforts and the firm’s extremely successful year, its associates would receive bonuses that far exceed what has become known as the “Cravath scale.” With some adjustments based on quantity and quality of work, the median 2017 bonuses for each class of Susman Godfrey associates are:

Class of 2015: $45,000
Class of 2014: $85,000
Class of 2013: $100,000
Class of 2012: $120,000
Class of 2011: $150,000
Class of 2010 (or earlier): $170,000

Two associates received additional bonuses in recognition of their success in business development that brought their total bonuses to more than $220,000.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Wow. By way of comparison, the top bonus on the [2017 Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2017-associate-bonuses/) is $100,000, or less than half the top bonus at Susman Godfrey.

Erica Harris, Susman Godfrey’s current recruiting partner, said that “when you hire the very best associates, you get the very best performance, and just like Susman Godfrey partners, our associates are rewarded for performance.” Steven Sklaver, the firm’s partner in charge of practice development, added that “2017 has been another fantastic year for the firm, and our tradition is that our associates share in the firm’s success.”

Sharing the work and sharing the rewards are hallmarks of Susman Godfrey’s teamwork-oriented model. Congratulations to both the firm and its associates on a superb 2017.

# Biglaw Firms Offering Paid Time Off For Lawyers, Staff To Get COVID Vaccines
## Some firms are willing to pay extra to get back to business as usual.

With the COVID-19 vaccine rollout underway across the country, lawyers and staff members alike are still wondering what their Biglaw firms are planning to do. The move to work remotely due to the spread of the deadly novel coronavirus came quickly, but decisions related to vaccination plans seem to be moving in reverse warp speed.

At the moment, it seems as if many firms will be encouraging, not requiring (like [Davis Wright Tremaine](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/the-first-biglaw-firm-to-announce-a-covid-19-vaccination-plan/)), employees to receive vaccinations before returning to the office. Some of those firms will even offer paid time off to make it easier for people to get the job done for their own and others’ safety.

Dechert is offering lawyers and staff across the globe up to eight hours of paid leave to get their shots, and Norton Rose Fulbright is offering the same to its U.S. personnel. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/03/26/dechert-norton-rose-fulbright-to-offer-paid-leave-for-covid-shots/) has additional details:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“Health and safety is a priority for us, so we are giving our people up to eight hours of paid time off to get their COVID-19 vaccinations,” Norton Rose U.S. managing partner Jeff Cody said in a statement. …

Dechert CEO Henry Nassau and policy committee chair Andy Levander put the vaccine news in the context of a wider update about the firm’s plans for returning to the office.

“The widening availability of vaccines, along with the improving overall trends in COVID-19 cases, have us optimistic that we’ll be able to start getting together in person again soon,” the pair said. “This will be a gradual and thoughtful process and will be specific to each individual location, but we know many of you are looking forward to meeting again with friends, clients and colleagues.”

Other firms, like Hogan Lovells and Robinson & Cole, have said employees need not use paid time off, or existing time off, to get their vaccinations (R&C will allocate an additional four hours of PTO in New York and two hours in other state offices). If this is the way that the legal profession can finally return to business as usual, then it’s no wonder that firms are willing to allow personnel to take their time to do it.

What are your law firm’s plans when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines? Let us know.

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)
Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Big Firm Announces Big Bonuses
## One more late mover.

While the bulk of top-tier firms announced their bonuses before the holidays — you know, like you’re supposed to with an annual bonus — others drag out the suspense and keep their associates in limbo until well into the new year. This practice is usually explained away as an end-of-year receivables issue, which makes sense until the firm matches the market like they were always going to.

But [Latham & Watkins](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/latham-watkins/), which announced bonuses yesterday, may really have held out to get a more thorough view of their finances, because while their “base” bonus matches the market, most associates are getting a little bit extra. The full memo, featuring the median bonuses by class as well as the top bonus received within the class, is [available on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/big-firm-announces-big-bonuses/2/).

LW announced its bonuses today (query why they still wait 2 months after its “peer” firms announce). Main theme is significant compression for junior bonuses. Senior bonuses seem to be a beneficiary (130K!).

Junior associate, 2300+ hours, good reviews, about 1.25x Cravath (a similarly situated person in last year’s class would have received 1.67x, so I’m left wondering the reason for the dropoff).

Indeed, looking back [at last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/associate-bonus-watch-latham-watkins-2/), the top bonuses of the most senior associates are getting healthy boosts at the expense of the top-performing juniors, but juniors overall came out a little better. Last year the first-year class received a “median bonus” of $16,000, while this year’s young’uns are getting $16,500. That said, the top bonus for a first-year last year was $25K, while this year it’s $18K.

And the beneficiary is absolutely the top seniors. Last year, the top senior class got a $100K bonus without exception, and the next most-senior boasted a $105K median and a $125K top. This year, the top bonus for the class in this position is $130K.

Whether this was just a good year for the senior folks or some kind of course correct from last year is anyone’s guess.

Most folks seem happy — if reservedly so:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
- “Latham’s bonuses were announced today. I billed a lot of hours this year and got about 25% above market. I’m very happy. It’s nice to work at a firm that rewards high billers.”
- They’re out, and they’re the same as last year – so the long held tradition of following (but never beating) the market continues!
One tipster, though, has a message for Latham about basic business tact:

The Latham bonus memo really needs to drop the “We continue to pay bonuses at 1900 hours even though many of our competitors use higher hours thresholds for bonus eligibility.” It is tacky. I get it; you are not the worst. But I would also point out that you are not the best.

Always remember that your obligation isn’t just to do your job, it’s to lavish praise on your employer as the beneficent philosopher-kings who make your meager existence possible. Latham is merciful and mighty. Never forget that.

(Check out the full memo on the next page…)

# Senior Associate At DLA Piper Just Happened To Be Fired Within A Week Of Asking For Maternity Leave
## This will likely be brought up at DLA's next Women's Summit. Awkward.

They do know that’s illegal, right?

Becoming a mother is hard. There is the obvious stuff like morning sickness and complete strangers thinking it’s acceptable to touch your stomach without asking. Then there are those unexpected hardships that would have been nice for someone to give you a heads-up on — [loss of teeth](https://www.today.com/health/can-you-lose-teeth-during-pregnancy-what-dentists-want-people-t230313), loss of [balance](https://www.parents.com/pregnancy/my-body/pregnancy-health/loss-of-balance-and-pregnancy/#:~:text=The%20pregnancy%20hormone%20relaxin%20can,any%20concerns%20you%20may%20have.), and, in some cases, loss of employment. From the American Lawyer:

A complaint filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleges DLA Piper fired a senior associate in New York because she requested maternity leave.

Former senior associate Anisha Mehta, represented by employment litigation firm Wigdor, claimed she had received no adverse performance reviews or criticism prior to her firing. To the contrary, Mehta left a job at K&L Gates in Chicago to join the firm, relocated to New York and received a $54,600 signing bonus, and also garnered a six-figure year-end bonus and three substantial raises by October 2022, according to the complaint, which was filed in December and circulated by the associate’s attorney this week.

Yet in early October 2022, Mehta was fired six days after she submitted her formal request for maternity leave, which occurred while she was six months pregnant. Reached by phone, Wigdor partner Jeanne Christensen said DLA Piper fired Mehta to avoid paying 18 to 20 weeks of her salary while she took maternity leave, leaving Mehta with scarce options to attain a job while already six months pregnant. To date, Mehta is still unemployed.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Talk about a crappy baby shower present. As most people (should) know, firing a person for asking to take maternity leave is retaliatory. This may still be news to law firms — remember that partner who characterized maternity leave as “[sitting on your ass](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/collecting-salary-from-the-firm-while-sitting-on-your-ass-is-certainly-one-way-for-a-partner-to-describe-maternity-leave/)” not too long ago? It is still early to say who was or was not in the wrong here, but the facts do look to be in Mehta’s favor.

Mehta’s supervisor Gina Durham, partner and deputy practice leader of the intellectual property and technology group, cited Mehta’s lack of preparation for a March 2022 client call and a sloppy brief as grounds for her termination. Refuting Durham’s alleged rationale, Mehta’s complaint states Durham hadn’t adequately communicated Mehta’s responsibilities for the client call and noted the sloppy brief was in fact the work of a different associate. Meanwhile, partners such as Chicago intellectual property practice co-chair Keith Medansky praised Mehta for her work, per the complaint.

We will keep you up to date as the case develops.
