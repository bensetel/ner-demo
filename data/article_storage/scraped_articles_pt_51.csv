# When Judges Attack
## A bad week to cross a judge.

Irritating judges isn’t recommended, but it really went off the rails for a couple of lawyers in the past few days. In Missouri, an attorney told off a judge and landed himself a week in jail. In New York, a lawyer kept picking at a federal judge long enough that the judge absolutely lost it on him. We also talk about the pervert calling libraries across the country asking them to read him a Supreme Court case while he masturbates. And we talk about firm office reopenings — is it time for firms to pull the trigger and start mandating vaccines?

# Managing Across The Delta
## How law firm leaders can manage internal tensions caused by delta variant policies.

In science, math, and engineering, the delta symbol represents change. Law firms are now facing their own potent symbol of change, division, and difference. By unhappy coincidence, we also call it the delta. Managing a law firm through the COVID-19 crisis has been one of the most difficult tasks I’ve done in my career. Based on my own experiences and my conversations with management team members at other firms, it appears the greatest challenges are still ahead.

Uniting Against COVID-19

When the pandemic began picking up speed in March 2020, and the lockdowns started, the slim silver lining in the situation was how it seemed to unite us. In the face of all the fears and unknowns, we banded together as teams to keep one another safe, get people out of physical danger, and move our firms onto a remote-supporting model. As the months ticked by, we seemed to stand strong together, working hard to battle against a disease that was poised to ravage us.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
By fall, pandemic fatigue was clearly beginning to kick in, but with a vaccine seemingly on the horizon, most of us buckled down and kept the faith. Knowing there was light at the end of the tunnel gave us the strength to push through a long winter that took a huge emotional and physical toll on most. With springtime came the vaccine, as hoped, and as nature renewed itself, it seemed we did too. The world opened back up, and a sense of safety and peace seemed to return.

And then came delta. Just as it seemed like we were winning the war on COVID-19, this [drastically more transmissible and virulent](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/the-danger-of-the-delta-variant/) variant of the original COVID-19 virus has changed the game. [Cases are once again spiking.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/delta-variant.html) Some states are experiencing [more new cases and hospitalizations now than they did last winter](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/08/why-pandemic-so-bad-florida/619761/), before the vaccine was available. While vaccinated people could rest assured they wouldn’t transmit earlier strains, Delta appears to be transmissible [even by the fully vaccinated](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/5-things-to-know-delta-variant-covid). Children appear more likely to catch delta and [more likely to be hospitalized](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/09/health/coronavirus-children-delta.html).

The Long Haul

In the face of changing circumstances, the CDC is urging that everyone resume masking indoors, whether vaccinated or not. Firms across the country have reinstated safety measures they had begun to phase out and either delayed their return to the office or sent physical employees back to their homes to work remotely again.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

But this time around, the unity that defined our first response to COVID-19 is starkly absent. We’re all exhausted, and many of us thought we were done and safe. We don’t know when or how the delta variant will come under control. Some would even disagree about whether COVID-19 is even something that still needs to be dealt with on a collective level.

Politics and the workplace are typically anathema, but it’s usually easy enough to keep them separate. Most of us just don’t talk politics in the office or only do so when we know it’s acceptable. Yet how we respond individually and collectively to COVID-19 has developed over the past year into a deeply politicized issue. Even the basic facts underlying the pandemic are in dispute, and acceptance of one model over another can seem to signal where we fall on a host of other sensitive topics best left outside the firm doors. As law firm leaders charged with overseeing our firms’ responses to delta, we can’t help but take an inherently political stance. No matter what we do, we’re bound to risk alienating and excluding members of our teams.

How To Succeed In Impossible Circumstances

There isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer to this challenge, but there are guiding principles that can help you and your firm navigate these seemingly intractable differences.

Acknowledge the issue. If there are strong opposing viewpoints on how to deal with delta in your firm, don’t pretend they don’t exist. Be open about those differences, and help those who are disappointed in the ultimate decision made understand that even if they don’t agree with the outcome, they have been heard and considered.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Announce a philosophy. Don’t just give your teams a list of what’s acceptable and what’s not. You need to explain why. Develop a philosophy and a set of goals. If you’re putting return-to-office plans on ice, give people a sense of what will guide your decision about when those plans might be reinstated. Maybe you plan to reconsider when new infections fall below 10,000 daily on a national level. Maybe you’re going to re-evaluate if the total vaccination rate in your firm gets above 95%. If your firm’s philosophy is to follow the CDC’s recommendations, then tell people that. The worst thing you can do is not offer any explanation and leave people feeling uncertain about what’s guiding your thinking.

Allow tailoring for your specific needs. Some states, counties, or firms will simply have different needs or goals. A firm in Florida, the current epicenter of the delta variant spike, may need more stringent measures than a firm in a less-affected region. A firm with 100% vaccination rates might need a different plan than one with lower vaccination rates or particularly vulnerable firm members.

Lay the groundwork for more change. We’re all sick and tired of COVID-19 and wish it would just go away already, but we as leaders know that it won’t. Whatever policies we put in place, they’ll probably change in the coming weeks and months as we learn more and as circumstances shift. Do whatever you can to ensure your teammates know that this isn’t over. It might get worse, but it will definitely at some point get better. No matter what happens, you’ll be keeping an eye on them and will make changes as the situation (and your firm’s philosophy) merit them.

Give yourself a break. No matter what you do as a law firm manager, from COVID-19 policies to what snacks are in the break room, any change you make is going to tick someone off. We need to give ourselves permission to not keep everyone happy. There’s no perfect answer, so don’t lose sleep over failing to find one.

Sadly, in the world we’re in today, we as law firm leaders are in many ways choosing the best of a plethora of bad options. Educate yourself, listen to your people, and make the best calls you can.

Trust your gut, counsel. You’ve got this.

# Branch Office Raises Push Texas Firm To Match $180K
## Young lawyers in Texas get big news.

With [Kirkland](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/chicago-based-biglaw-giant-gives-raises-to-all-u-s-associates/), [Skadden](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/top-5-firm-smacks-its-associates-across-the-face-with-money/), and [Willkie](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-day-another-biglaw-salary-bump/) moving their Houston-based associates to the $180K Cravath scale — cost of living be damned! — a tipster raised a good question last night:

Any chance you can do a story on the Cravath model in Houston? Very interesting legal market. You have Baker Botts and Vinson & Elkins trying to protect their turf while Sidley, Latham and Kirkland are making a run at their market share. Kirkland has upped salaries across all offices. Will the others follow? Will V&E/BB begrudgingly follow also or develop a super secret pay structure of their own.

As we’ve been saying, this salary bump is a crucible moment for firms. Those outside the Biglaw elite can jump on board and [send a strong signal](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/top-boutiques-continue-to-match-cravath/) that they are players, or those inside the Biglaw ranks [can flinch](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/ny-to-180k-the-bad-news-who-wont-be-matching/) and announce to the world that they’re no longer deserving of top-of-the-mountain status.

Vinson & Elkins opted to keep running with the peloton. In [a memo](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/branch-office-raises-push-texas-firm-to-match-180k/2/) from Chairman [Mark Kelly](http://www.velaw.com/Who-We-Are/Find-a-Lawyer/Kelly--Mark/) and Managing Partner [Scott Wulfe](http://www.velaw.com/Who-we-are/Find-a-lawyer/Wulfe--Scott/) released minutes ago, the firm announced that it would not let those Biglaw carpetbaggers poach all the hotshot associates.

The firm will match Cravath nationwide up through $315K for associates in the Class of ’08 and higher. Like many firms, counsel compensation is being bracketed for separate consideration and summer associates are getting moved up accordingly.

Congratulations to the V&E team. Your move, Baker Botts.

You can read the full memo [on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/branch-office-raises-push-texas-firm-to-match-180k/2/).

# Is The Metaverse A Solution For Declining Trial Experience?
## The 'industrial Metaverse' found the spotlight at CES. Here's one way it could apply to lawyers.

On Monday night, CES, the massive consumer electronics show in Las Vegas, kicked off in high gear with a keynote address by [Dr. Roland Busch](https://www.siemens.com/global/en/company/about/leadership/management/roland-busch.html), the CEO of [Siemens AG](https://www.siemens.com/global/en.html). Siemens is a leader in various technological areas, including automation, healthcare, and mobility, and has always been at the forefront of cutting-edge solutions. It is a technology company in every sense of the word.

That’s why when its CEO talks about how Siemens solves problems and develops innovative solutions, you take notice. The thrust of Dr. Busch’s presentation was the opportunity the Metaverse, or as he called it, the [industrial Metaverse](https://www.siemens.com/global/en/company/digital-transformation/industrial-metaverse/what-is-the-industrial-metaverse-and-why-should-i-care.html), presents. Dr. Busch’s keynote highlighted three key elements of the industrial Metaverse: digital twins, software-defined automation, and AI-powered data analysis.

The Industrial Metaverse

The concept of the industrial Metaverse involves creating virtual models to test and refine projects before actual implementation. Coupled with Gen AI’s rapid software modification capabilities and data analysis, this approach allows for the perfection of designs in a virtual space, leading to efficient and cost-effective real-world applications. This methodology isn’t just theoretical; it has practical applications as seen in the accelerated development of COVID-19 vaccines.

Because the model is virtual and can be easily manipulated, it is easy, quick, and cheap to test, iterate, and perfect. Problems can be found, analyzed, and fixed quickly — or, better yet, discovered before they arise. And without serious consequences. The Metaverse provides a unique platform for both testing and training, enhancing performance in reality.

So, this works great with products and tangible things, but can it work with personal performance? Could we use the Metaverse to enable lawyers, for example, to perfect their courtroom performance before they go live in the real world?

For lawyers, the implications and opportunities are significant. As I have [discussed before](https://www.techlawcrossroads.com/2023/06/more-judges-recognize-the-need-for-younger-lawyers-to-get-courtroom-experience/), young lawyers simply aren’t getting the courtroom and trial experience that litigators used to get. There are simply fewer trials. And when there are trials, the costs are so high that letting inexperienced lawyers do much is too great a risk. So, the more experienced lawyers take over.

The problem, of course, is that at some point, there won’t be enough older lawyers to do what trial work and litigation there is. At that point, we will have even fewer trials.  Having fewer trials is a problem since you can’t assess trial exposure without current trial data. 

Without trial data, there is no accurate way to determine the risk of the case and its true value. Without knowing the trial risk, you can’t evaluate settlement value or even know what resources should be allocated to the case. 

Sound familiar? Just as the use of the industrial Metaverse can be used to test out an actual product, it could also be used to test and hone the courtroom skills of younger lawyers. It could provide a safe place where they could practice, and gain experience and confidence.

Creation of the Courtroom Metaverse

To create this courtroom Metaverse, we would first need a realistic digital courtroom. Dr. Busch described technology developed by Pixar that creates realistic digital places. It should not be hard to do the same thing for courtrooms. Given access, a digital courtroom, just like the courtroom where a particular trial or hearing would take place, could be created.

Next, it would be necessary to create realistic avatars of the judge, perhaps a jury, opposing counsel, etc. While these avatars might not be a particular person but a composite, the technology already exists to create realistic avatars. As I [previously wrote](https://www.techlawcrossroads.com/2023/10/the-metaverse-and-blockchain-for-legal-were-back/), Meta has already developed the technology that can create avatars that closely resemble what we really look like. Watch a [video podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYrJJNdrEg&t=138s) interview of Mark Zuckerberg by Lex Friedman to see how this works. Friedman and Zuckerberg were not in the exact physical location, but when they were videoed in the Metaverse, it was almost like they were together. The faces were realistic, down to the movement of eyes and eyebrows and facial movements.

Then, it would be a matter of placing the avatars in the virtual courtroom. This approach isn’t just conjecture; I witnessed a product demonstration at CES showcasing realistic avatars in a virtual board meeting.

I asked [Mitch Jackson](https://mitchjackson.com), a California trial lawyer and mediator who uses the Metaverse extensively, about the present day capability of the technology. Mitch told me that even today the technology exists. “The courtroom is very real and the avatars are amazing. The tools to collaborate work just like a real court room… While you can access the venue from a laptop or desktop it feels 99% real with a headset on.”

Honing Skills in the Metaverse

Imagine a realistic digital courtroom in which young lawyers could hone their skills within a true-to-life setting. Younger lawyers could practice making an opening in a case. Or examining a witness on direct or even cross. 

And with Gen AI and analytics, lawyers could craft arguments that could resonate with a jury or judge and identify weaknesses in opposition strategies. The lawyers could then practice applying this knowledge in the virtual courtroom.

Of course, having a full-blown trial simulation may be more than could be realistically accomplished in one sitting. But targeted practice sessions in bite sized increments could easily be achieved. And real time feedback by more experienced lawyers could be provided in ways simply not achievable in the real world.

The same tools could be used by more experienced lawyers as well. Despite thorough preparation, trials are always a roll of the dice. Lawyers don’t get do-overs when it comes to the court. But using a courtroom Metaverse would provide just that.

For example, it is easy to see how a witness could be mock examined in a virtual courtroom setting with a jury present. Both lawyer and witness could practice in front of a jury, gauging jurors’ reaction and then tweaking the examination. According to Jackson, “add AI voice venue creation (‘bring up exhibit 1’or  ‘take us to the location of the building where the matter took place’) and things get really interesting.”

The same could be done with opening and closing statements.

All too often, lawyers, out of hubris or just shortsightedness, fail to iterate and adapt what other industries have developed. Here’s a chance to do just that and solve the inexperience problem. Borrowing from what companies like Siemens are doing and then applying the concepts to legal may be an effective way to train lawyers and get better results for clients.

There is no shortage of stories about lawyers and judges acting badly. But what about clients who act badly? And what about the lawyers who defend these clients? For example, criminal defense lawyers routinely are asked, “How can you defend these people?” Perhaps if the questioners had taken any civics course, history course, poli sci course, or had even the most smattering knowledge about the Constitution, they would not have to ask the question.

The same question is asked of lawyers who represent government, banking, insurance, and other similar clients of similar ilk. The answer is still the same. Every client has the right to a zealous defense; if any doubt, consult the Rules of Professional Responsibility. However, that doesn’t mean that the role of a defense attorney, in whatever area, is easy. And there are instances in which being a defense lawyer sucks. (Readers nod in agreement.)

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Schadenfreude is a word that says, in essence, “better you than me,” “thank goodness it’s not my client,” and the like. That’s exactly what I think some lawyers are experiencing, given various antics by their clients that they then must defend.

Let’s start with the Village of Melrose Park. How would you like to represent a town in which the mayor doesn’t have any anger management skills or the temperament required to be a decent public servant and who also has other less-than-stellar qualities? A federal district judge for the Northern District of Illinois [called out this public “servant” for conduct unbecoming](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2022/03/MTD.pdf) not only to him but to the village he represents. Lots of harassment, cursing, threats, and other misconduct.

Pretend you are the attorney who must defend the village and the mayor’s conduct and language. What would be your defense strategy? What defenses would be available to counter the free speech and other allegations raised by the family that found itself the target of such harassment. Is this a case that you would want to try? If you do, go for it. If not, as a deputy public defender friend of mine used to sing “[Disco Duck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COmqigLG0GI).” A disco song from the late 1970s for all those of you too young to remember.

And then there is the attorney for Alex Jones. It’s not fun when your client plays the old switcheroo game, claiming to be too sick to be deposed, and yet broadcasting, [not from his sickbed at home](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/alex-joness-lawyers-and-the-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-day/), but from his usual and customary broadcast station. How do you make a representation to the court when your client is acting in a manner diametrically contra to that representation? Whoops. And after the court reminded Jones’s counsel about his obligations under the Rules of Professional Responsibility, the attorney filed a [declaration with the court](https://civilinquiry.jud.ct.gov/DocumentInquiry/DocumentInquiry.aspx?DocumentNo=22437384) that he was unaware of his client’s conduct. How much longer do you think the defense firm will represent Jones without getting further egg on the firm’s face? Nonlawyers don’t usually understand that lawyers have dual responsibilities to the client and to the court.

So, here’s another case that is a [lawyer’s worst nightmare](https://www.startribune.com/bankruptcy-judge-orders-trial-for-bmo-harris-bank-in-tom-petters-case/512193262/). BMO Harris Bank has announced plans to acquire Bank of the West from BNP Paribas. (Full disclosure, I was in-house at Bank of the West until 2007.) BMO Harris is defending a lawsuit from the bankruptcy trustee managing the estate of Thomas Petters, whose Ponzi scheme collapsed some years back and was a customer of a predecessor bank that BMO Harris acquired.

The bankruptcy court in charge of the Petters estate has handed down [some rulings in the litigation](https://www.americanbanker.com/news/high-stakes-trial-could-complicate-bmos-deal-for-bank-of-the-west) against BMO Harris. Here are the kinds of things that keep lawyers up at night, especially bank lawyers. Do the terms “spoliation of evidence” and “sanctions” strike terror into a lawyer’s heart? What about the bankruptcy judge’s ruling that the civil jury can be told about the destruction of evidence? What about the court’s use of the verbs “lied” and “destroyed?” Uh-oh.

One Biglaw firm may be thinking twice [about its representation](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/oh-look-at-the-biglaw-firm-representing-oan/) of One American Network (OAN). Yes, representation is important of course, but so is getting paid. Can I tell you the number of times that courts relieved defense counsel because “Mr. Green” had not arrived? Or that the attorney-client relationship was irretrievably broken? More examples of schadenfreude?

And last but not least in the sh-tshow department was the smack heard round the world at what was supposed to be Tinseltown’s finest hour, aka the Oscars. Hardly. I ran through my checklist of available defenses for Will Smith’s conduct and came up empty for defenses to a misdemeanor battery.

A letter to the editor in the New York Times outlined what could have been the perfect way to manage this situation: Will Smith could have walked up to Chris Rock and whispered about his wife’s condition. (I wonder if the author of the letter was a mediator.) Who knows how Rock would have responded, but I doubt that Smith would have acted as he did, which was a classic case of “ready, fire, aim.” Remember the neuralyzer that Smith and Tommy Lee Jones used in the “Men in Black” movies? That [handy little gadget](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWFQn6o4FfY) wiped out the memory of a target. Smith could use one now. Schadenfreude indeed.

What could possibly be better than bonus news? Even more of it!

Yet another Biglaw firm has announced its year-end bonuses, and this time, it’s none other than Shearman & Sterling, one of the few firms that went out of its way to [shower its associates with cash](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/shearman-sterling-the-latest-biglaw-firm-to-throw-their-hat-into-the-fall-special-bonus-ring/) earlier this fall during the special bonus wars. What does Shearman have in store for associates in terms of their year-end bonus hauls?

It’s a Cravath match, of course. Here’s what the scale looks like at the firm:

Class of 2019 – $15,000

Class of 2018 – $25,000

Class of 2017 – $50,000

Class of 2016 – $65,000

Class of 2015 – $80,000

Class of 2014 – $90,000

Class of 2013 and above – $100,000

It should be noted, however, that these are just “standard” bonus amounts; individual bonus amounts at Shearman are discretionary and based on performance. Hopefully that turns out well for associates during a pandemic.

Bonus money at the firm will be paid out on December 18. Congratulations to all!

# A Look At Boies Schiller's Brand New Offices In New York's Hottest New Neighborhood
## Hudson Yards quickly becoming the go-to location for attorneys.

Less than a week after moving into its new offices, Boies Schiller & Flexner are still trying to get accustomed to a radical shift in law firm layout. Partners with interior offices? Flex-use space as far as the eye can see? High-tech boards guiding visitors around the halls? It’s a lot for a firm to adjust to. But perhaps the biggest point of adjustment is to the location of the office itself.

For the generations of aspiring New York attorneys who traipsed from Penn Station across 11th Avenue to the cavernous halls of the Javits Center to take the bar exam, the trek to the hinterlands of West Manhattan was a rite of passage. Transportation was useless, there wasn’t a decent lunch place for blocks, and the nearby trainyard felt eerily like a rejected Fallout map. There had been a plan to develop the area by moving the NY Jets here, but officials decided the place was already dreary enough.

If that describes the last pilgrimage you made to the Hudson Yards area, it may be time to take another look. Despite [botching the opening in typical Cuomo administration fashion](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/30/nyregion/documents-reveal-early-concerns-about-leaks-at-hudson-yards-subway-station.html), the 7 Train now drops passengers off in the heart of the neighborhood. Amenities are trickling into the area with more set to open in the coming months. You can even [hop a helicopter to the airport](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/the-smartest-trip-youll-ever-take-in-your-biglaw-career/).

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
While the area is still heavily under construction, with multiple high-rise offices in the early stages, Boies Schiller & Flexner has already made the area its new home.

Unlike those of us who saw the area as a wasteland for years, BSF embraced the vision of what it could be. The firm committed to making Hudson Yards its new home in 2015, long before there was much to suggest what the area would become. But the firm that began its life as David Boies and Associates working out of Armonk, NY to become an uber-prestigious Am Law 100 litigation firm with 15 offices across the country and in London couldn’t be accused of a lack of vision. Partner Philip Korologos, told me that when BSF signed on as the first tenant in 55 Hudson Yards they held their breath for a minute but that their vision has paid off as tenants have flocked to the new development, with 55 Hudson Yards fully leased with other buildings still being built. By the middle of next month, the area will celebrate its grand opening with restaurants, retail, and the curious landmark known as [The Vessel](https://ny.curbed.com/2017/12/6/16742336/hudson-yards-vessel-construction-top-out) all opening to the public.

Soon, they’ll be joined in their Westside haunt by both [Cooley LLP](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/another-biglaw-firm-moving-to-hudson-yards/), leaving the Grace Building, and [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/the-hot-new-location-for-biglaw/), decamping from the Wall Street environs its occupied for 150 years. [Skadden is already planning to make the move next year](https://commercialobserver.com/2014/10/law-firm-to-make-big-hudson-yards-move-in-2020/). And now rumors swirl that [Debevoise will soon follow](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2018/12/20/3-firms-heading-to-hudson-yards-in-early-2019-could-debevoise-follow/). The firms will join a plethora of financial entities calling the new development home. In fact, the neighborhood is seeing the largest influx of tenant square footage and the financial sector is leading the way. Some are even suggesting that the new development will be a callback to a bygone era when Biglaw and its biggest clients rubbed shoulders [in the narrow caverns of Wall Street](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-manhattan-office-migrations/).

David Boies definitely shares this vision. He describes Hudson Yards as the first opportunity to recapture the spirit of the old Wall Street where lawyers and their clients could work in close proximity and meet up to discuss the case (or just network) without having to lose half a day at the whim of crosstown traffic.

The firm’s offices — designed by [Schiller Projects](http://schillerprojects.com) — open into a main reception area with views of midtown Manhattan and a sweeping staircase connecting the additional offices above and the cafeteria below.

Sadly, these are all my pictures taken by me with a mere iPhone, but hopefully they can convey a sliver of what these offices look like.



Overhead, a grand sculpture of beaded cables droops and flows throughout the atrium. The striking piece visually connects the entryway to the office space above.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The cafeteria downstairs includes a staffed coffee bar for anyone looking for a pick-me-up as well as a ton of open space for chatting with colleagues over a bite and some futuristic chairs to hop into in case of a mid-meal call that can shield your conversation from the bustle of the rest of the firm’s lunch.

Before we get too far into this tour, looking for your way around? Every floor is decked out with an interactive touch screen that allows you to look up attorneys to find a map to their office or to book one of the firm’s ample conference rooms — helpfully shown below as either open or booked. If you’re looking for Boies himself, he’s in the southwest corner in a glass office with walls that frost over on command.



The formal conference rooms are joined by a gaggle of lounges, small corner cubbyholes, and a “library” (without books) that aren’t for booking as much affording attorneys flexible spaces to work unchained to their desk. The firm massively invested in these unassigned workspaces, building so many that on the firm’s busiest day of meetings… there would be conference space left over. Following a trend we’ve seen at other firms, many of these workspaces occupy the desirable corner office space once reserved for partners:



Meanwhile, the partners — with the exception of Boies and Schiller, who maintain large corner offices suitable for large work sessions — have migrated to the interior offices. These internal offices resemble the [White & Case offices](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/white-case-has-built-the-new-modern-law-firm-office-and-its-awesome/), but instead of paired up associates, these house partners. As Boies explained, BSF has always prided itself on being an “associate forward firm” as seen in their potentially super lucrative compensation structure. But moving the partners inside while giving associates and paralegals exterior views reflects this focus in design as well. Rather than potentially snap something confidential, you can see some partner offices from this shot taken within yet another of the firm’s conference rooms.



Which brings us to the controversial aspect of the new firm layout. Associates may have exterior offices, but they are also arranged in carrels of four, equipped with high-end adjustable sit/stand desks. For an associate used to having an office alone with a door that closes, this will definitely be a culture shock. But the goal is to encourage more collaborative work, nudging attorneys to spend more time in one of the high-tech conference rooms, projecting their laptop upon a big screen with the push of a button and reviewing documents or discussing opposing filings in a group. In time, the associates will learn their favorite side room or lounge space to work from when they want to grab a bit of privacy — from the right perspective, it’s like picking your own office. It’s fitting that one of the rooms is called the library because even though it lacks books, it’s reminiscent of your favorite law library nook that you toiled in most of your 1L year. Personally, there was a glass seating area only slightly bigger than a closet looking out over the Hudson River that I would absolutely commandeer as my private refuge when I needed to make a call or get away from it all.

Checking in today, three weeks removed from my office visit, Korologos told me that he sits across from a small workroom and that he’s seen exponential growth in the room’s usage as the days have gone by.

Still, it’s an adjustment. But it’s one that attorneys are going to be faced with more and more as real estate prices climb and folks find themselves out of the office (whether for travel or telecommuting) more and more. The giant, private office is increasingly falling out of favor and how attorneys build the future office to be an inviting workspace within these new constraints will rest on the sort of natural integration of communal and unassigned private spaces that BSF’s design has done.

To the point that every attorney is going to find their favorite little office space to work from, Boies showed me his favorite “home away from home” side room, an informal lounge on the Northeast corner of the building looking out upon the grand concourse of 11th Avenue to the north and the Midtown skyline to the east.



It’s probably a cheap device to try and connect a firm’s new office to [their recent transition plans](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/david-boies-dishes-on-firms-transition-strategy/). “A new office portends a firm moving on to the next generation” or something like that. And I’m certainly not above the cheap, hokey rhetorical device from time to time. The problem is, it’s not really accurate here. To try and tie those together would be to suggest that Boies and Schiller aren’t as active today as they’ve been at any time in the firm’s relatively young life. But the firm’s leadership transition speaks as much to the eagerness of the named partners to get back to the business of lawyering by passing the administrative baton. And maybe that’s the rhetorical tie-in, if we must have one: BSF’s new offices, like its leadership transition, are all about challenging conventional wisdom. Shouldn’t the name on the door be running the business-side of the firm? Shouldn’t the lawyers have corner offices?

BSF doesn’t have time for conventional wisdom. They’ve got lawyering to do.

# Lawyers Sometimes Hold Other Lawyers To Unreasonable Expectations
## And while we're at it, lawyers should limit the expectations of friends and family that seek legal advice.

Many lawyers, at some point in their lives, may be asked to judge the work of another lawyer who is handling a matter for family or friends. This usually happens because someone wants a second opinion, and they may feel that a friend who is a lawyer will give them an honest opinion of how well another lawyer is performing. Often, lawyers are harsh when judging other attorneys, either because they think that their family or friend deserves “white glove” treatment or because they do not practice in the relevant field. For a variety of reasons, lawyers should not hold other attorneys to unreasonable expectations and should limit the expectations of friends and family that seek advice.

I fully admit that, in the past, I have held lawyers to unreasonable expectations. Earlier in my career, a relative of mine needed a personal injury lawyer. Since this relative was elderly, and because I was an attorney myself, my relative asked that I coordinate with his attorney to ensure that my relative was getting the best legal representation possible. Throughout the course of the representation, I frequently called and emailed the attorney to ensure that he was on top of the work. I also judged the lawyer pretty harshly when he failed to respond to messages or failed to take certain advantages in the case.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In my own defense, I also did a fair amount of work on the case to alleviate my relative’s lawyer of some of the burdens associated with the handling of the matter. For instance, I answered some of the discovery requests, did some legal research, and helped draft some of the papers. This is different than in the many situations in which lawyers critique the conduct of attorneys for friends and relatives without handling some of the work themselves.

However, as I have progressed in my career, and opened a practice that handles a wide variety of matters, I realized that I may have been a little hard on my relative’s lawyer. Attorneys often have dozens or even hundreds of matters that they need to handle at any given time. Each of these matters requires varying levels of attention at any given time in a case, and it is balancing act for lawyers to manage all of the work. Attorneys often need to conduct triage to handle all of the emergent matters first before tending to matters that can wait.

However, when a relative has a legal matter that a lawyer is handling, it may seem as if that is one of the most important things in their life at that time. When relatives or friends who are attorneys look into matters, they may also see the legal matter as extremely critical and not consider the fact that a lawyer may have a lot of different tasks that they need to handle all at once. However, lawyers should be empathetic to attorneys who are handling matters for friends and family and not hold these attorneys to unreasonable expectations.

Sometimes, lawyers may recommend that their friend or relative take steps that could harm their case because they have unreasonable expectations for a lawyer who is handling a friend’s or relative’s matter. One time, I took a call from a prospective client who was a relative of someone with whom I used to work. The prospective client told me that he had spoken to his lawyer relative and the relative suggested that the prospective client seek new counsel. The prospective client’s current counsel did not return phone calls and emails too quickly and gave an adversary an extension of the time to answer on a matter, which upset the client.

However, when I looked at the docket of the case, and did a little digging, it seemed that the lawyer was doing a decent job on the case. It was perhaps true that the lawyer did not return phone calls or emails as quickly as the client would have liked, but this is an issue with numerous lawyers since attorneys have many matters to handle and may prioritize emergent cases. Moreover, it is common for lawyers to grant extensions to adversaries without consulting their clients, and such extensions can go a long way toward building rapport with the other side during a representation. Changing counsel is a serious consideration that can have profound consequences on a matter, and the factors likely did not warrant the client changing attorneys in this matter.

Of course, everyone wants the best for their friends and family members, and when lawyers are asked to review the work of another attorney, they may judge that lawyer’s performance harshly. However, lawyers should not hold other lawyers to unreasonable expectations out of fairness and because this can have a negative impact on a representation.

# After Matching Milbank Months Ago, Biglaw Firm Finally Gets Around To Offering Cravath Cash To Associates
## Some things are worth the wait -- like money!

Biglaw firms are continuing to make it rain on their associates this spring. Although much of the Am Law 100 and beyond have already adopted the generous Cravath salary scale, some firms just haven’t gotten there yet. Up until today, one of those firms was McKool Smith.

If you recall, the firm was one of the very first to [match the Milbank salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/more-money-incoming-this-biglaw-firm-just-matched-milbank/), way back in January. Today, the firm finally announced that it would be raising associate salaries yet again. Here’s what their Cravath match looks like:



The new salaries are retroactive to January 1, and associates will see their raises in their upcoming paychecks. Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from McKool Smith.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# The Best Bonus Of Them All: Premium Cash Plus Extra Money To Take A Vacation
## This firm is offering associates the chance to invest in their careers and in work-life balance.

This year’s bonus announcements have come at a slower pace than usual, and we suppose that [Milbank’s incredibly early first move](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/breaking-biglaw-bonuses-are-here/) during the first week of November is to blame. Speaking of slowing down the pace, just before Thanksgiving, one firm decided to give all of its big billers a chance to take a break by offering them above-market bonuses plus even more cash so they would be able to take some much-needed vacations.

Once again, Orrick has matched the market for bonuses for those who worked at least 2000 hours. If you’ve somehow forgotten what the 2019 year-end bonus scale looked like over the long holiday weekend, here’s a little reminder:

Class of 2019 – $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2018 – $15,000
Class of 2017 – $25,000
Class of 2016 – $50,000
Class of 2015 – $65,000
Class of 2014 – $80,000
Class of 2013 – $90,000
Class of 2012 – $100,000
Class of 2011 – $100,000

Orrick, known for awarding premium bonuses of up to 10 percent to some of its hardest-working associates, has decided to up the ante this year and offer bonus premiums of up to 35 percent on top of its regular cash payouts.

In addition, the firm will be continuing its unique Unplug on Us program, by offering up to $15,000 for associates and counsel with over 2400 hours billed — including pro bono, training and shadowing, innovation time, and work for the firm — to take a week off from work to unwind and spend time with friends and family. (Dedicated career associates, project attorneys, and legal assistants may also participate.)

In the year to come, Orrick plans to make “unplugging” part of its firm culture by offering wellness dollars whenever employees work 250+ billable hours in a month. If associates continue to work this intensively for a three-month period, $1,000 in wellness awards will be offered at the end of the third month. Career associates, project analysts, and paralegals will also be eligible for newfound wellness wealth.

Last, but definitely not least, Orrick will be changing its billable hours targets for 2020 to 1850 client billable hours (client billable, pro bono, Orrick as a client) plus up to 100 firm billable hours (up to 35 hours of training/shadowing; up to 50 hours of innovation; up to 20 hours of diversity & inclusion work; and/or up to 50 hours of substantive business development), for a total of 1950 billable hours.

Congratulations to everyone at Orrick who may be able to take advantage of these new perks. Offering associates the chance to invest in their careers and in work-life balance each and every month is just one of the things that really sets this firm apart from all others. Orrick is a firm that’s doing its best to make concrete steps in its commitment to wellness, and it’s an incredibly positive change that we hope more firms adopt.

Read the full memo on Orrick’s changes to its bonus eligibility structure and its wellness initiatives on the next page.

# Knowing As In-House Counsel When To Call In The Biglaw Guns

If you are unfamiliar with the in-house world, there is a pretty tried and true negotiation formula that takes place between opposing in-house counsels.

Once an issue has been referred to legal, we generally attempt to sniff out our opponent. After the standard Linkedin stalking, we break the ice with a phone call. Nothing too adversarial at this point. Generally, a quick, “what can we do to make this right” type of conversation.

If that fails to resolve the matter, a battle of the legal letters generally follows.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Each in-house team spends hours parsing every word of a well-crafted letter that attempts to prove to the other side they learned more Latin in law school. These will remain professional at all times, but will generally start to grow more terse with each round until finally an impasse is reached.

During the impasse, the party with the better case generally tires of this ritual dance and taps in their Biglaw partner to fire of the next series of letters. Most of the time this act is enough to get the other party to budge. It will either scare them into a settlement or force them to call in their own Biglaw reinforcements, and then it’s off to the races we go.

Given the effectiveness of using the nuclear Biglaw option, I have faced off against some opposing in-house counsels who prefer to skip the ritual altogether and opt to go Biglaw from the start.

While this has admittedly caused me to push for a settlement quicker on my end in the past, be warned, when I think I have the stronger case, I will gladly take advantage of the new pressure point you unknowingly just gave me: the billable hour.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
If you are a small- or medium-sized business that went straight for the Biglaw knock-out punch, you can bet I will do everything I can to slow walk negotiations.

Nothing gives me greater pleasure than to call your new Biglaw representation on a weekly basis to check for updates. I will happily send trivial letters that ask for a reply — all the while knowing your CFO is likely growing increasingly uncomfortable signing yet another check for an inflated Biglaw invoice.

We recently had a dispute with a comparatively small vendor of ours. They claimed their interpretation of the contract entitled them to an automatic annual rate increase while our interpretation, the correct one mind you, was that the increases were subject to a performance review that would have yielded them substantially less.

All told, we had a little more than a half-million dollars in dispute — for their company, a gargantuan sum they desperately wanted. Before our internal contract manager could refer the dispute my way, I received a letter from one of the largest firms in the city demanding we honor the new rates.

Having dealt with this firm in the past, I was confident the vendor did not fully appreciate how much their new representation would cost them, and I felt it was my duty to help them realize how quickly billable hours can add up.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
After several months of letters, meetings, and phone calls with their Biglaw representation, we received an unprompted acceptance of our performance-based rates. Their in-house counsel called me and explained they had reached a business decision that it was in their best interest to accept our proposal and end this legal back and forth.

Or as I roughly interpreted it, “Holy smokes, things got expensive fast, and we need to take whatever you are offering before this thing completely swallows our profit margin.”

Dropping Biglaw into an in-house negotiation can be an invaluable card, but think carefully before you play it — and be sure your CFO has the stomach for it.  Otherwise, it can be an expensive proposition that can leave you in the same position as before, albeit a little — or a lot — poorer.

Legal transactions are complicated — and only growing moreso.

Webs of documents that need to be negotiated and signed continue to expand, while the timelines to execute a deal continue to tighten. And on top of that, clients still expect real-time visibility on how a deal is progressing.

Fortunately, there are tools and techniques legal staff can use to overcome these types of challenges.

We’re pleased to present “How Transactional Lawyers Can Better Serve (And Maintain) Their Clients,” a CLE-eligible webinar, in partnership with our friends at iManage. Sign up and be a part of the conversation on May 15th at 1 p.m. ET.

This program will guide you through ways to better serve clients in real estate, M&A, and other transactional practice areas.

You’ll learn:

- How you can guard against litigation risk by preventing critical errors
- How you can ease varied organizational and logistical challenges
- How you can improve all of your client interactions throughout the process
From importing your checklist to delivering the closing book, you can bolster client service throughout the entirety of a transaction.

Register below and join us to learn how.  CLE credit is available for attendees!

# Criminal Indictments Threaten Jail For Trump, But Carroll's Civil Case Starts Next Month
## None of the testimony in the E. Jean Carroll case is likely to reflect well on Trump.

Donald Trump of course feels most threatened by the criminal cases that will likely soon be brought against him; those cases threaten time behind bars. But Trump has not yet been indicted in those cases, and the pretrial proceedings will take time.

Consider, however, the case brought by E. Jean Carroll, trial of which is scheduled to begin on April 25 — less than a month from now.

E. Jean Carroll says that, years ago, Trump raped her. While he was president, Trump denied committing rape, and he made some allegedly defamatory statements about Carroll. Carroll sued. That lawsuit is now delayed on appeal, while a court decides whether Trump’s statements were in the course of his presidential duties. If Trump wins that appeal, Carroll’s lawsuit will have hit a serious — and perhaps fatal — speed bump.

After Trump left the presidency, he made more allegedly defamatory statements about Carroll. A New York law also permitted plaintiffs to assert previously time-barred accusations of sexual battery. Carroll then filed a second lawsuit. Trial of that second lawsuit — asserting post-presidency defamation and the previously time-barred battery — is scheduled to begin on April 25.

The judge presiding over that second lawsuit has held that Carroll will be permitted to offer as evidence both the “Access Hollywood” tape in which Trump brags about grabbing women by the genitals and the testimony of two other women who have made similar claims of sexual assault against Trump.

That’s a tough case for Trump. You can win a case in which one person accuses you of something; you argue that the one person is an untrustworthy, vindictive nutcase.

But it’s harder when the testimony of three people comes in against you. When you argue that three different people are all untrustworthy, vindictive nutcases, the jury may start to question exactly who is the nutcase.

Remember too that juries must be unanimous in criminal cases. If one die-hard Trump loyalist sits on the jury in a criminal case against Trump, then the jury will hang. Trump will not be convicted.

But juries in civil cases do not need to be unanimous. Thus, a lone Trump die-hard could sit on the Carroll jury, and Trump could still be found liable.

It’s unlikely that an adverse verdict in a defamation and battery case will do serious damage to Trump’s finances. Even an award of substantial damages (for claims such as these) is unlikely to affect an extraordinarily rich man’s wallet in a significant way.

But the trial will still hurt Trump. Every day, for weeks, the press will report on the testimony in the E. Jean Carroll case, and none of that testimony will reflect well on Trump. There will, naturally, be evidence that reflects poorly on E. Jean Carroll (as Trump launches his counterattack), but that evidence is not nearly as newsworthy.

The likely indictments for criminal misconduct threaten Trump with time behind bars. But the E. Jean Carroll case will go to trial first, and the press coverage of that trial will be both massive and harmful to Trump.

‘Your firm is HUGE!’ (Image via Getty)

What’s next for your law firm when it’s already one of the most profitable in America, one of the highest grossing in the world, and one of the biggest on the planet? If you’re the global co-chair of DLA Piper, a Biglaw firm that handily ticks off each of those accomplishments, the answer is do even better by getting even bigger.

In a wide-ranging interview with [Bloomberg that touched on everything from office life in a post-COVID world to diversity and inclusion,](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/dla-pipers-new-chair-wants-his-giant-firm-to-get-even-bigger) DLA’s [Frank Ryan](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/people/r/ryan-frank-w/) said he wants the firm to be able to provide “full-service” to all of its clients while at the same time working on high-end projects.

Growing revenue by taking market share is how Ryan said he will measure the firm’s success.

“The real opportunity for us is to drive that top revenue line, and to really build business,” Ryan said, adding, “We want to fight for more work.” …

Last year, he said the firm’s U.S. business grew revenue and profits per equity partner in the high single digits.

With about 90 offices in more than 40 countries and roughly 4,500 lawyers, the firm’s $3,112,130,000 gross revenue in 2019 is just the beginning. “For us, the theme of 2021 is unlocking value in the institution: breaking down walls and building teams to compete for the best work around the world,” Ryan said. That means associates at the firm should get ready for more work — and more varied kinds of work — in the future.

Will other Biglaw firms follow DLA Piper’s intrepid new strategy for success in 2021?

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

It’s a wait-and-see. There are some [firms] that may move with New York, once they see about success. When your peers are back in the office, that can make a difference. And New York is often a leader.

— [Laura Terrell](https://www.lauraterrell.com/about), a former Biglaw partner turned executive coach and consultant, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/07/14/new-york-law-firms-could-prompt-more-4-day-office-policies/) on the likelihood that more Biglaw firms will move to a mandatory four-day in-office work policy in the wake of [Skadden](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/you-didnt-see-your-kids-before-the-pandemic-you-shouldnt-expect-to-see-them-now-says-elite-law-firm-partner/), [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/davis-polk-4-day-office/), and [Wei](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/weil-gotshal-4-days-in-office/)l recently making similar announcements.

# Top 10 Biglaw Firm Reveals Bonus Scale

What’s the best way for Biglaw firms to tell associates how much they appreciate them (read: the hours they bill)? Is it a one-year membership to the Jelly of the Month Club — the gift that keeps on giving the whole year? Nope, it’s cold, hard cash. And it’s one of the very best Biglaw traditions.

White & Case, a firm that made $2,869,800,000 in gross revenue last year making them 6th on the Am Law 100, announced bonuses today. Of course, they matched the prevailing market rate set last month by Baker McKenzie.

The bonuses at the firm are as follows:

- Class of 2022: $15,000 (pro-rated)
- Class of 2021: $20,000
- Class of 2020: $30,000
- Class of 2019: $57,500
- Class of 2018: $75,000

# Associates And Staff Should Have Off For MLK Day
## To my surprise, this past Monday was almost as busy as any other Monday,

As pretty much everyone already knows, this past Monday was Martin Luther King Jr. Day. As such, stock markets were closed, the courts were shuttered, and the mail was not delivered. I am pretty sure there wasn’t free parking in New York City that day, but that’s another story! I expected that the day would be quiet since attorneys and staff presumably get the day off. However, to my surprise, many associates and staff with whom I interact needed to work on MLK Day, and more law firms should give attorneys and staff the day off in honor of the holiday.

I wrote an article a few weeks ago about how more people should have been able to [observe New Year’s Day on January 2nd](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/everyone-should-have-had-the-day-off-on-january-2nd/) since New Year’s Day fell on a weekend this year. Workers do not have too many work holidays during the year, so it is important that law firms honor the holidays and give people the day off so that people can get a break from work in regular intervals throughout the year. What’s interesting to me is that more people seemed to observe January 2nd as a holiday than did MLK Day this week! Of course, it makes sense that people might need an extra day to recover from their New Year’s Eve festivities, and this could explain why more people took off on January 2nd than seemingly took off for MLK Day.

However, MLK Day is an actual holiday that has been on the books longer than people have seemingly observed holidays on the Monday following the weekend in which a holiday falls. People have likely observed MLK Day for decades as they progressed through grade school, college, and law school. Accordingly, it was perplexing to me that so many associates had to work on MLK Day even though so many government offices and other workplaces were closed.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In my experience, lawyers and staff from almost each part of the legal profession worked on MLK Day. I thought that this day would be quiet, which I was looking forward to so that I could catch up on work that I had been delaying for some time. To my surprise, this past Monday was almost as busy as any other Monday, and I got phone calls and emails all day from different types of lawyers.

I interacted with some lawyers in Biglaw who were in their offices despite the fact that this past Monday was a federal holiday. I also communicated with some lawyers who work at smaller law firms that had to work this past Monday. The only lawyers who did not seem to work this past Monday were government lawyers. I had oral argument last week, and I was wondering when the court would upload an order. The court did not upload the order on Monday, likely because it was observing MLK Day. After the holiday, the court did get to uploading the order, and it was clear that court staff had the day off, which is great since this is a recognized holiday.

Law firm management might explicitly or implicitly require associates and staff to work on MLK Day for a number of reasons. Perhaps most importantly, we are at the beginning of the year, and partners may want associates to bill as many hours as possible early on so that they can get off to a good start when it comes to generating revenue for a firm. Moreover, law firms may want to have their associates be available to clients who might not be observing the holiday. It is true that many businesses might not celebrate MLK Day, and they may want to reach out to their counsel on that day since some legal needs cannot wait. However, associates often do not need to be at an office or actively working at home to answer emergent questions that a client might have.

All told, it is definitely difficult to maintain work-life balance in the modern workplace, and this is even more difficult when managers do not respect traditional holidays and give associates and staff the day off. Accordingly, more law firms should give their employees the day off for holidays like MLK Day.

# It Takes Longer Than Ever To Make It To Biglaw Partner
## But that's not necessarily a bad thing.

It’s not just your imagination (or just your firm,) the path to Biglaw partnership has lengthened in recent years. [According to](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/11/08/survey-suggests-the-path-to-law-firm-partnership-is-getting-longer/) ALM’s 2021 New Partners Survey (which polls 350 attorneys that made partner between 2018 and present), 42 percent of respondents said the partnership track at their firm had gotten longer in recent years. About 38 percent said it hadn’t changed, with less than 3 percent saying it was a shorter timeframe.

So how long *does* it take to make partner? Almost 60 percent said they worked 5-10 years before making partner, and 31 percent said it took 11 to 15 years. And even when they do make partner, most polled — ~64 percent — said they are nonequity partners.

All of which qualifies as a bona fide trend:

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“The partnership tracks have certainly gotten longer across the board,” said Rob Delicate, co-founder of Erica Robert Associates, a legal recruiting firm in New York. He said sometimes elite firms create nonequity or counsel tiers as a proving ground “because it’s very difficult to bring in first-year partners at a firm that’s incredibly profitable.”

But is that a bad thing? Not necessarily. Turns out, not everyone is super enamored with making partner. And even if it is on their personal to-do list, they’re balancing other things in their lives, so it’s okay if it takes a little longer:

“There are a couple of firms I can think of that say, ‘Listen, you can work a reduced hour schedule and still make partner. It’s just going to take a bit longer.’ Or for parents, ‘You can take parental leave and still make partner,’” [Michelle Fivel, a partner at Major, Lindsey & Africa] said. “I think those firms are sort of outliers, frankly, but certainly people are curious about those and asking about them when they make lateral moves.”

Seems like any trend that puts a focus on work/life balance is a good one.

# Trump's Lawyers Are Probably Right: Campaigns Can Kick Out Protestors
## Trump lawyers say ""no right"" to protest at rallies -- they're mostly right.

Overnight last night, media outlets started slowly picking up a story about Donald Trump’s attorneys — Jones Day, obviously — filing a brief in a lawsuit against the President that claimed protestors have “no right” to protest at his campaign events because allowing hippies to hold signs criticizing the Donald would impair his First Amendment rights. As one might imagine, the stories written about this argument convey pearl-clutching disdain. One post danced around calling this downright totalitarian.

The problem is Trump’s lawyers are probably right. But Trump’s lawyers are still making a dumb argument.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.

To set the stage, this is the case of three protesters, Henry Brousseau, Kashiya Nwanguma, and Molly Shah, who filed suit after they were allegedly roughed up at a Trump rally they attended. When they held up their sign, Trump called from the stage, “Get ’em out of here,” and that’s when the plaintiffs allege they were assaulted by Trump’s brownshirt brigade. The plaintiffs suggest that this amounted to “inciting a riot” and, ugh, trumps Donald’s speech rights. Trump’s been trying to get the case dismissed, arguing that he only intended to have security remove the protestors, not to turn the crowd on them. But Judge [David Hale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._Hale) recently [questioned this argument](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/trump-incitement-violence-lawsuit-236802), noting that Trump’s comment from the stage was “stated in the imperative; it was an order, an instruction, a command.”

Which brings us to the present motion. On the same day that a gaggle of Jones Day lawyers put in their pro hac motions, they [put forth this argument](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/trumps-lawyers-are-right-campaigns-can-kick-out-protestors/2/) (emphasis added):

At the threshold, the forum for this speech was a political campaign rally. Like any other private assembly to achieve ideological goals, political campaigns have a core First Amendment right to associate for the purpose of expressing a particular message, which necessarily includes the right to “exclu[de] … views [that] [a]re at odds with positions [the campaign] espouse[s].” Hurley v. Irish-Am. Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual Grp. of Boston, 515 U.S. 557, 580 (1995). Accordingly, when a campaign has “decided to exclude a message it d[oes] not like” from a campaign rally, “that is enough to invoke [the campaign’s] right as a private speaker to shape its expression” by excluding or expelling demonstrators who express contrary viewpoints. Id. at 574. Of course, protestors have their own First Amendment right to express dissenting views, but they have no right to do so as part of the campaign rally of the political candidates they oppose. Indeed, forcing the “private organizers” of a political rally to accept everyone “who wish[es] to join in with some expressive demonstration of their own” would “violate[] the fundamental rule of protection under the First Amendment, that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own message.” Id. at 573.

The Jones Day argument is that Trump had every right to expel protestors from his campaign rally and therefore when he said, “get ’em out of here,” he was talking to security, not authorizing vigilante beatings. While Jones Day faces an uphill battle to explain why those are necessarily mutually exclusive, the point is they’re right that campaigns can expel protestors. Despite the exasperation of liberal bloggers, the Supreme Court unanimously held in the Hurley case cited above that private groups holding public gatherings can choose speech to exclude. This isn’t some Trumpian twist, Hillary had Black Lives Matter protesters [removed from her rallies all the time](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/258704-black-lives-matter-protesters-interrupt-hillary-rally).

But this is still a good lesson in why brief writing matters, especially if you’re representing the most visible man on the planet. What could ever possess someone whose client boasts an authoritarian streak and deep appreciation of a world leader with an ever-dwindling population of dissenters to write “they have no right to do so as part of the campaign rally of the political candidates they oppose”? State everything in the affirmative! Say, “Trump and his campaign have every right to expel people from the confines organized rallies” but don’t even go near protestors have “no right” to do anything.

And it’s not entirely true. Hurley doesn’t argue that the protestors don’t have a right to speak, just that the organizers can choose to exclude them from the event they’ve organized. In fact, critical to these cases is protecting the rights of protestors to speak from public areas outside the zone permitted for the private group’s event. For example, Sistrunk v. Strongsville, which dealt with the precise issue of protestors at a presidential campaign rally, made the point that the protestors have every right to schedule a counter-protest or to protest from outside the area permitted to the campaign. It’s just not fair to say that protestors have “no right” to speak, just that Trump can exclude them from a political rally.

Now, do these linguistic choices matter? That’s what actually interests me. One could argue that the brief works hard to express a fundamental disdain for the rights of those who disagree with Trump, when positing a simple “time, place, manner” quibble would have sufficed. Could Trump himself be shaping the contemptuous tone of briefs like this? There’s something to be said for a deconstructionist take on brief writing because what ends up in a brief can end up in an opinion. The law is one long game of telephone and even if they convey the same substantive point in the first instance, “no right to protest” can do a lot more mischief down the road that “a private event can exclude speech it does not intend to convey.”

Or maybe Jones Day just made a dumb drafting mistake and inadvertently invited a lot of unnecessary attention to their client. Anything’s possible.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Steptoe Loses Its Johnson

I can’t even take credit for this headline — it was suggested by an Above the Law tipster, insisting that they’d be disappointed if it *wasn’t* the headline. And you know what? They’re right. The Biglaw firm f/k/a Steptoe & Johnson is going through a rebranding, and Maude Lebowski is about all I can think about.


The firm, which has gone by the full moniker since 1916, decided the time is right to use the Steptoe nickname as its formal, registered legal name. Now, Colonel Louis Johnson, the former Secretary of Defense, is losing naming rights to the Biglaw firm (#101 on the Am Law list), but he still gets an eponymous law firm. For years — since 1980 — there have been two Steptoe & Johnsons, created by an [“amicable” split](https://www.steptoe.com/en/about/history.html#:~:text=Steptoe%20formed%20a%20partnership%20with,has%20endured%20since%20that%20time.) between the West Virginia and Washington D.C. offices of the original firm. The West Virginia-based firm will remain Steptoe & Johnson.

# Building Bridges And Not Walls
## The challenge for lawyers, however, is how they communicate with their internal business partners.

Last year, I wrote an article called “[The Secret To In-House Life: A Gladiator No More](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/the-secret-to-in-house-life-a-gladiator-no-more/).” In that article, I wrote about the need for lawyers who worked as in-house lawyers to be more collaborative and less combative. How? I suggested that in-house lawyers take the time to learn the business and their role in it; I suggested that they devote time to building relationships; and I suggested that they stop talking like lawyers. Recently, I spoke with Jon Jelenko, director of sales for the software company Docket, and we discussed just that. What does all this really mean for in-house lawyers interested in improving collaboration?

From my conversation with Jon, I think that we would both agree that learning the business and building relationships among business partners is fairly straightforward. The challenge for lawyers, however, is how they communicate with their internal business partners. Let’s face it. Lawyers talk like lawyers and the legal department speaks a language that is too often foreign to the legal department’s internal business partners and supporting business units. The legal department, however, is not alone in this regard. Legal speaks Legal, Sales speaks Sales, IT speaks IT, and Finance speaks Finance. When internal business partners don’t speak the same language, it should come as no surprise that communication becomes muddled and frustration and inefficiencies result for everyone.

Assuming that communication is key, what can in-house lawyers and legal department do? They can put aside the urge to build walls and work to build bridges between business units. Legal department, its internal business partners, and the supporting business units need to work together for the good of the company as a whole. Each unit plays a different part in supporting the success of the company. Each role is vital, but no one role is more important than another role. Different business units have different priorities, but understanding the different priorities for each business unit helps drive better communication and collaboration: the legal department is trying to minimize liability and risk; the sales department is trying to maximize revenue; the IT department is trying to drive technological efficiency; and the finance department is trying to limit cost. If you understand each of these perspectives and priorities, it’s much easier to effectively collaborate with them.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In my experience, in-house lawyers and legal departments can be in the best position to tear down walls and build bridges because of the amount of information to which they become privy. Why? An in-house counsel who has done a good job of learning the business and forging strong relationships with internal business partners and supporting business units is the person other company employees seek out when they are dealing with an issue and do not know how to proceed. An in-house counsel who takes the time for that meeting or call can learn so much about the company’s operations, unit priorities, and unit challenges. Armed with that unique knowledge and perspective, the in-house counsel is uniquely situated to act as a bridge between units that are dealing with a similar business issue.

What’s the value of that for an in-house lawyer? Information is your currency.  Meyling “Mey” Ly Ortiz summed it up nicely in her article “[Random Important Things You Need To Know When You’re In-House](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/random-important-things-you-need-to-know-when-youre-in-house/)”:

I have seen how knowing what’s going on in different parts of the business, fostering collaboration, and ensuring that your leadership is in the know can be powerful ways for you to exponentially demonstrate your value, set you apart from your peers by building trust and credibility, and have influence at the company.

As Sir Isaac Newton once said about people in general, “We build too many walls and not enough bridges.” As in-house lawyers, let’s not let this be our legacy. Let’s tear down walls and build bridges.

# 3 Tips For Awards Submissions

Candidly, I feel a little sheepish that I chose to write about this topic. It feels inconsequential and fake — why should anyone care about receiving awards or recognition? Isn’t doing good work enough? And the very idea that there could be strategy to submitting entries can be off-putting. Merit should be paramount.

At the same time, as someone who is often asked to review cover letters, letters of recommendations, scholarship applications and essays, and awards submissions — and as a person who is often asked to make decisions based on what I read, I would submit to you that being intentional is the first step in setting yourself apart.

Because, honestly, based on what I read, most of the time, most people don’t care, or don’t care enough about their submissions. It begs the question of why submit in the first place, but I digress. My point is that if you are willing to take a little bit of time to be intentional about awards submissions, success is more likely.

Obviously, this topic is not limited to in-house counsel or even lawyers (although I find that lawyers as a group tend to have a lot of award opportunities).

Public Service Announcement: if you are outside counsel and haven’t thought about how nominating your client (or colleagues) and winning could deepen your relationships, you are missing out.

My first tip with submitting competitive nominations for awards submissions is to start early and approach it with a project management mindset. Review the requirements. Get a feel for how heavy of a lift they may be. Calendar the submission deadline and set a reminder. Calendar a block of time to collate and put all the pieces together before the deadline. Calendar some time to dedicate to the submission itself. If the submission requires letters of recommendations, reach out to sources early and calendar reminders to follow up with them.

Consider The Sources

My second tip is to strategically consider who the award nominator should be. This comes down to your why as well as your credibility and influence. Should the nominator be you? If your why is to further a relationship with a client, then yes, it should. If you don’t need or want the “credit,” should it be someone with more influence? Someone who is well known within that community or who has a stronger brand? Should the award nomination come from an individual or should the submission be on behalf of an organization? Ask yourself these same questions with respect to who should submit letters of recommendations (if required).

Show and Tell

My last and most important tip is to remember to show and tell — not just tell. Too many submissions are conclusory statements followed by more conclusory statements. Recall from law school writing class how conclusory statements are not very persuasive.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As a trial lawyer, I was taught to tell the fact-finder what I wanted them to take away, show it to them, and explain that I just showed them and why it is important. The same approach is helpful with award submissions.

For example, if the prompt is to share how your nominee exemplifies leadership — then don’t simply tell me that the nominee is a great leader, that they have been recognized previously as a great leader, and that everyone they know admires them and agrees that they are a great leader. It doesn’t answer the question.

Rather, tell me that they are a great leader, and then take the time to show me with a specific example or story that will demonstrate how your nominee exercised their leadership skills. Follow up with an example of the impact their leadership had. And if you want to show me how much other people agree, then you can have them cosubmit the award or cosign a recommendation letter.

Hopefully, these tips are helpful and if nothing else, here’s to hoping that I get better submissions to read.

# Expanding Your Value As In-House Counsel
## Consider how you could better develop in-house roles to grow your impact and influence at your company.

Now that I have been in-house counsel for almost eight years, I have an expanded view of our value. Of course, we are lawyers first and foremost — and necessarily must help our clients navigate and mitigate legal risk by understanding and helping our clients comply with the law. But from my observation, our value transcends the transactional. We are more than Siri or Alexa on the law for our clients — or, at least, I submit to you that we should be. Otherwise, why would companies want in-house counsel if they could go to any excellent firm lawyer? Here are some of my thoughts on how in-house counsel can provide particular value to their companies.

Legalese Translator

While being able to translate legalese from firm lawyers to business clients may seem like a trivial talent, I submit to you that our nonlawyer business clients would strongly disagree. I have witnessed firsthand how their eyes have glazed over during calls, at best, but at worst, I will receive a frustrated call from an exasperated client who is overwhelmed by the receipt of a very long email that looks more like a legal memo with citations and capitulation than the yes or no response they were expecting. While I don’t personally love reading long legal memos either, I find that clients deeply appreciate when you can translate the legalese into tangible choices for the business to consider. I find that the business folks also appreciate it if you have a recommendation and can explain why simply. Points if you know all the company acronyms and can leverage your company values and connect to the company culture.

Connector

Candidly, I don’t know if the experience is different if you are in-house counsel at a smaller company, so take this observation with a grain of salt, but as in-house counsel at a larger company, I find that I often act as a connector between different parts of our company — and help create synergy. As much as we do not want silos, if you work for a very large company, it’s inevitable that the right hand may not always know what the left hand is doing. But if you have a great partnership with the business, and they habitually invite you to business meetings, you will often hear opportunities in which you can create efficiencies by encouraging various parts of the business to collaborate.

Benchmarking

I didn’t realize how much companies like to “benchmark” or see what other companies are doing until becoming a corporate lawyer. No, I’m not talking about corporate espionage or trade secret type stuff. I mean the run-of-the-mill “I wonder how they’re handling [insert new law or regulation here]” stuff. For example, not all states require mandatory anti-harassment training. A benchmarking question might be “Do you know how other companies roll out their anti-harassment training — whether it goes out to everyone or just the employees in the states that require it?” If you are in-house counsel and have a network of other in-house counsel, you can provide value by helping your clients benchmark informally. (Disclaimer: please consider any antitrust implications before doing so.)

If you have been in-house for awhile, all three of these “roles” may sound very familiar. But if you are new to in-house, I encourage you to consider how you could better develop these roles to grow your impact and influence at your company. And if you are not in-house counsel but are considering making the move and feel like these tasks are banal, you may want to reconsider.

Back in 2018 at the Academy Awards ceremony, Francis McDormand called attention to something called an inclusion rider as a way to increase diversity in Hollywood during her acceptance speech for Best Actress. In the latest episode of The Jabot podcast, I chat with [Kalpana Kotagal](https://www.cohenmilstein.com/professional/kalpana-kotagal), partner at[ Cohen Milstein](https://www.cohenmilstein.com/), and co-author of the Hollywood “inclusion rider.”

We talk about what it was like when her work was suddenly thrust onto the national stage, the importance of networking, how the principles behind the rider can be applied to other industries (particularly the legal industry), and practical tips for dealing with inequality in the workplace.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wears when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

# Will All Of This Bonus Money Be Enough To Keep Associates From Burning Out?

Levels of mental health issues, stress, and burnout in the legal profession are arguably at an all-time high. The question is will bonuses in any way offset the challenges around mental health and burnout? That is far from clear. And I would argue that in many instances they won’t. Compensation does not create capacity.

— [Patrick Krill](https://www.prkrill.com/about), an attorney who works as a consultant to numerous law firms on mental health and substance abuse issues, commenting on the [round of special bonus announcements](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/big-laws-bonus-spree-fails-to-curtail-risk-of-associate-burnout) that have been making their way through Biglaw, and how they could affect lawyer burnout. Click [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/special-bonus-tracker-2021/) to see which firms have offered special bonuses to associates thus far.

# It's Fine To Represent Oil Companies As An Associate

“Everyone deserves a lawyer” is one of the dumbest things lawyers say.

Not that there aren’t situations where the justice system demands that litigants have competent, zealous representation — criminal defendants being the most obvious example — it’s that lawyers rarely deploy this as a spirited defense of Gideon, but as a vapid ethical shield to make their work drawing up commodities contracts for Vladimir Putin of a moral kind with exonerating innocent death row inmates.

It’s not.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Because even if everyone did deserve a lawyer for every legal issue under the sun, they certainly don’t deserve you to be their lawyer. You can take on whatever case you want, but everyone else is free to judge you for it and — most importantly — other clients are free to decide if they want to get mixed up with you for it.

The Ethicist feature in the New York Times Magazine just tackled this issue in the article “[Is It OK to Take a Law-Firm Job Defending Climate Villains?](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/06/magazine/law-firm-job-ethics.html)” The piece concludes that it’s perfectly fine for the indebted law school graduate to take this Biglaw job.

And that’s right… but not necessarily for the reasons in the article.

Here’s the story:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
While I entered law school hoping to work in the public interest, I now face the reality of paying back my loans. I took an internship at a big law firm where I am paid very well, and I’ve been invited to work for them once I graduate. The salary would be enough for me to pay off my loans, help my family and establish a basic standard of living for myself — plus maybe own a house or even save for retirement, which would be impossible for me on a public-interest or government salary.

Surprisingly, the ethics expert never points the finger at law schools in the response, though that’s definitely where I’m starting. Social media critics of this article blithely suggest that this working-class student facing $150K in debt could just go work for a public interest cause. Oh! It’s just that easy, huh?

Here in reality, law schools are outrageously too expensive. Complain that the schools are structurally designed to funnel students into corporate jobs in tacit cooperation with the major firms if you want, but that’s where we are. More loan forgiveness programs would be great, but my public interest friends struggled even with that help… it’s just not going to comfortably get over the hump created by the law school industrial complex. And not for nothing but public interest jobs are actually competitive! More competitive than catching on at a firm at some schools.

Frankly, the underlying article’s diversions into moral accounting and Peter Singer could be cut entirely in favor of a GIF of Robin Williams in Good Will Hunting repeating “it’s not your fault” while handing Matt Damon a tuition bill.

This person has an offer in hand, doesn’t seem to have other options at the moment, and needs the money. That doesn’t excuse everything in this world, but it reduces a lot of the ethical weight in this equation.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Anyway, there’s an additional catch:

But the firm’s work entails defending large corporations that I’m ethically opposed to, including many polluters and companies that I feel are making the apocalyptic climate situation even worse. Even if I only stay at the firm for a short time to pay off my loans, I would be helping in these efforts for some time.

There’s a sliding scale when it comes to these questions and it depends on seniority, role, and the issue involved.

Normally when we talk about a lawyer’s responsibility for the client, we’re talking about partners. Agency matters. Partners can choose to turn down work, but associates can’t. Hanging out at a big firm for three or four years as the very definition of a cog in the wheel is not in the same complicity ballpark as winning the “poison death clouds are awesome” business.

Obviously juniors bear some measure of complicity, but they’re on the very lowest rung of the sliding scale. Which brings us to the next factor…

What is the attorney’s role? Litigators going to court to argue that people should just toughen up when their tap water catches fire are more compromised than someone drafting forward contracts so energy companies can play hot potato with ownership of future natural gas deliveries. In a vague way, all this work is “helping” the oil company, but it matters what brand of aid and comfort the associate offers. Critics seem to assume this graduate will be the villains from Erin Brockovich, when they could be writing up stock options clauses in executive agreements. There’s a LOT more of the latter work out there than the former.

Finally, the issue involved matters. Joining a voter suppression firm — [ahem](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/jones-day-is-divided-between-maga-jones-day-and-lawyers-who-enable-maga-jones-day/) — where the firm’s courtroom antics directly deprive people of their rights is different than working with an energy company because — with a few exceptions like joining some SCOTUS bound assault on the Clean Air Act — the courts aren’t where most of this damage is done. The article kind of hints at this…

Even if what your clients are doing is legal, you may still feel uncomfortable supplying guidance and representation, because the activities shouldn’t be legal. We ought to have laws and regulations that treat the climate crisis with full seriousness, and we don’t.

Unfortunately, the author takes this in a “it’s not like the firm isn’t going to keep doing this work without you” direction. But the better takeaway is that outside of lobbying firms, the work being done for energy companies isn’t where the battle for climate justice is won or lost. Statutory and regulatory change is where it’s at.

This doesn’t alleviate the firm and its partners from bearing the full weight of judgment for doing this work, but a first-year associate, possibly doing generic corporate work, for a sector that will only be corralled by new laws not new lawsuits? Nah.

So, yes, it’s fine to spend a few years working for a firm representing climate villains. After that… consider your lateraling options.

Is this just a waste of prosecutorial resources or do the cops have a point? Joe Patrice and Elie Mystal discuss this question and the implications for law firm boating excursions everywhere.


Also, it’s a little late now, but go back and check out what we got right and wrong in our pre-Kavanaugh selection show! Elie and Joe talk with David Lat about Justice Kennedy’s retirement and what it means for the Court.

# What Great Lawyers Write Down When Depositions End

A deposition ends.

On the one hand, you could think: I took (or defended) a deposition. It’s over. I have to know the details of the case; the client is largely irrelevant. Why bother reporting anything to the client? So I won’t.

That’s the wrong way to think.

Instead:  I took (or defended) a deposition. It’s over. I spent the client’s money on this event. It’s the client’s case, not mine. So I’ll send a short report to the client about what I learned, my impressions of the witness, etc.

That’s the right way to think.

Some clients want detailed reports about what happened at depositions. So give that to them.

Other clients are happy with a very few sentences: “We deposed Jarndyce, plaintiff’s product manager, today. The deposition went well. Jarndyce admitted X and Y, which is what we were after. Let me know if you’d like more details.”

Good lawyers know their clients and send appropriate reports about what happened at a deposition.

But great lawyers make another set of notes immediately after a depositions ends.

Great lawyers record both what happened at the deposition and what did not happen.

A factual report is easy, and nice, and doesn’t strain you too much. It simply requires that somebody take notes (or remember what was said) during the deposition or read the transcript later.

But great lawyers are actually cognizant during depositions. Those lawyers have unspoken thoughts going through their minds. Those unspoken thoughts are not recorded in the transcript, and the thoughts are ephemeral. Wait even a few hours to record those ideas and those thoughts will vanish, never to resurface.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Immediately after a deposition ends — immediately; not after you travel home, or have dinner with the witness, or come back from the bar, or whatever —  immediately, write down the thoughts that occurred to you that will not appear in the transcript, and that you’ll have forgotten by tomorrow morning. Write that stuff down while you still remember things, in a note to yourself.

What am I talking about?

When you asked one question, the witness and opposing counsel became visibly nervous, but nothing came of this. At the next deposition, or when you’re sending out interrogatories, or when folks are reviewing documents, you should probe.  There’s something there; find it.

Or perhaps the witness evaded your questions on some topic. Or opposing counsel started objecting repeatedly. You sense that there’s something there, but you didn’t uncover it today. What’s up? Write a note that you should investigate topic A, so that you don’t forget this (which you will, if you don’t write it down).

On another subject, you were surprised by something. Counsel didn’t explore it, but the subject could veer in a funny direction in the future. Write it down: On topic B, check how it played out in the end, so you’ll know what’s lurking there.

On another subject, your witness was inadequately prepared. Make a note of it: I should have prepared the witness more thoroughly on topic C. Maybe you’ll actually remember to prepare the next witness more thoroughly on that point.

Something else triggers a thought that you hadn’t considered before. Write it down: I’d never before thought about topic D, but it strikes me that topic D could matter. Set up a call with a relevant witness to explore topic D.

The witness’s testimony opens up topic E. That’s a new line of inquiry. Don’t forget to look into it.

You didn’t get admissible evidence on topic F, but the topic is going to be important. Write this down, and don’t forget about it. This may not be immediately evident from the transcript, but it’s an important point.

Deposition transcripts are filled with dogs that are not barking. If you don’t record those silences, they’ll soon be gone forever.

Report to your client at the end of a deposition.

Of course.

But report to yourself about what you learned at the deposition that will not appear in the transcript.

Protesters are unhappy with something.

They’re going to set up shop outside your building next Tuesday.

What do you do?

The conventional wisdom screams: Alert building security. Alert the public relations folks. Alert key business people. And, when the protesters show up, ignore them.

The first three items are no-brainers; the last stems from universal experience: If you send somebody downstairs to talk to the protesters, you’ll have created a viral moment. Instead, let a dozen people with signs march around for a while. Let them get tired. They’ll go home. And you’ll have done your job: Minimized the disruption, and kept a small public relations issue from becoming a larger one.

But the protesters are coming, so someone schedules a call.

On the call, you’ll hear all the usual ideas:

“We should hand out pieces of paper that explain our position. That will make the protesters go home.”

But: “The protesters are coming to protest. They’re not coming to go home. If you hand out pieces of paper explaining our position, the protesters will set the pieces of paper on fire, creating a viral moment.  Do not hand out pieces of paper.”

Or:

“The other tenants in the building will complain. We really must invite the protesters inside.”

But: “The other tenants have no basis to complain. If the protesters are on public property, then they have the right to protest. And bringing protesters inside the building compounds the security problem and escalates the situation.”

Or:

“Why don’t we tell the protesters to meet with our lawyers at the lawyers’ office?” Followed by: “The lawyers will never let all the protesters into the lawyers’ office.”

A bunch of pablum. You put your head in your hands; you put the phone on mute; you start to cry. You wait for the others to figure out that the law firm would invite only one, not all, of the protesters into the law firm’s offices.  Finally, somebody says something that resembles the truth: “That probably won’t cause the protesters to go away, but it’s better than having them protest outside our offices. Before the protesters arrive, we could extend an invitation for their lawyer to meet with our lawyer at our lawyer’s office. If there’s any negotiating to be done, it could be done there.”

That’s plausible.

It probably won’t work, because the protesters want to protest; they don’t want to negotiate. But it may be worth a try.

You think to yourself: “The conventional wisdom is occasionally wrong. But often there’s a reason for it. If protesters are going to appear outside your office, let them have at it. If you’re lucky, few people will notice, and eventually the protesters will get bored and go away. At a minimum, your actions won’t have made a bad situation worse.”

# Biglaw Business Is Booming. Obviously, It's Time To Talk About Layoffs.
## Pessimistic? Maybe. But feels all too real.

The Am Law 100 [was recently announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/all-the-billion-dollar-biglaw-firms-a-look-at-the-am-law-100/), ranking the top Biglaw firms by 2021 gross revenue. And it was a banger year in Biglaw. Every single Am Law 100 firm saw and increase in revenue. All. Of. Them. Plus 52(!) firms crossed over into the billion dollars in revenue world.

And we know that Biglaw firms are struggling to keep up with the demand on their legal services. They’re in need of qualified lawyers to staff the deals/cases that are filling up their books of business. So, yes, the[ lateral market’s been intense](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/the-biglaw-lateral-market-is-fire-right-now/) with all manner of repercussions like [special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/davis-polk-bonuses-21/), [signing bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/biglaws-throwing-around-500000-signing-bonuses-in-red-hot-lateral-market/), [retention bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/is-skadden-arps-handing-out-retention-bonuses-to-only-some-associates/), [raises](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2021-associate-salary-increase/), [offers without interviews](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/biglaw-job-offers-without-interviews-what-hath-the-hot-lateral-market-wrought/), and making[ senior associates lateral partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/one-way-to-get-senior-associates-to-lateral-biglaw-firms-offer-them-partnership/).

But, some Biglaw watchers are cautioning there’s a potential downside lurking in this frenetic market. That’s right… it’s time to talk about stealth layoffs.

For those who might only be hearing the term for the first time,[ stealth layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/stealth-layoffs/) are disturbingly popular in Biglaw and they allow firms to cut headcount without confirming that there were economic-based layoffs. So, they’ll give the associates X number of months/weeks to find a new job and the firm frequently couches the reductions in performance review terms, that just, purely coincidentally, happen in the midst of a downturn — whether economic- or demand-related — making those let go doubt their lawyering skills. By their secretive nature, they can be challenging to confirm in specific numbers, but insiders slowly find out something is amiss.

But the market’s good right now — why the layoff talk?

California recruiter Larry Watanabe [told Law.com](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/04/26/lawyers-burned-the-candle-at-both-ends-in-2021-faltering-demand-could-cost-jobs-anyway/) that the current lateral market is simply not sustainable. So, yeah, stealth layoffs ahoy:

Watanabe says that includes firms that over-hired in corporate, firms that made multi-year compensation guarantees for equity partners regardless of firm performance, and firms that merged for market share and then raised billing rates after they climbed the Am Law 100.

“It’s not feasible for them to catch the more elite firms. Their profitability levels are almost less than half,” Watanabe says of the latter group. “With billing rates of $1,500 to $1,600 an hour, in a more modest economy, clients are going to be more careful about bills and how they pay their lawyers.”

Already, Watanabe says, firms are looking at stealth layoffs as demand tails off.

As law firm consultant Tim Corcoran noted, firms that overplayed their hand in the lateral market are likely to turn to layoffs, and the old standby stealth layoffs are on deck:

“Your hours are down, shame on you, you didn’t hit your numbers,” Corcoran says firms will tell lawyers. “They’ll call it a performance discussion when, in fact, it’s really an economic discussion.”

So enjoy the skyrocketing demand while you can (and pay down your student loans). Because the good times? They don’t last.

I’m fully aware of the absurdity of my actions right now. I don’t think it’s worth putting my family’s safety or friends’ or colleagues’ safety in jeopardy with me getting sick. But at some point, I think it’s going to be a necessity for everybody.

— [Jessica Tillipman](https://www.law.gwu.edu/jessica-tillipman), assistant dean for field placement at George Washington University Law School, commenting on the [new precautions she takes while dining out](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp/2020/03/10/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-dining-out-in-the-age-of-coronavirus/) thanks to the spread of coronavirus, including avoiding shared serving spoons and condiment shakers, and signing her name on electronic touch screens with single dots made with a pinky. She says she may start bringing her own lunch to work after eating out for more than a decade.

(Take our poll below. Will it be dining out or delivery?)

Do you plan to limit your time in restaurants due to the coronavirus outbreak?

- If it's on my firm's or law school's dime, I'll eat out.
- I never dine out anyway. Seamless is life.
- Yes. It's just too risky.
- No. I want to watch the world burn.

# Top 30 Am Law Firm That Once Refused Special Bonuses Now Offers Them As Part Of Year-End Bonus Scale
## And there's an hours requirement for all bonuses -- but associates at this firm aren't complaining.

Lawyers across much of the Northeast portion of the country find themselves buried in snow today, but we know just the thing that’ll inspire everyone to dig themselves out: bonus news.

Please note the UPDATE below.

Yesterday afternoon, Covington & Burling announced its 2020 year-end bonuses, and the firm has matched the [Baker McKenzie bonus scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/) that was later adopted by [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/cravath-bonuses/). The good news for associates at the firm doesn’t stop there. After originally [refusing to get on board](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/hope-for-fall-special-bonuses-is-fading-fast/) with the fall bonuses that were offered by the most elite Biglaw firms, Covington has now decided to match the [Davis Polk scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/) for those as well. Here’s the Covington bonus scale for 2020:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  


Sources at the firm tell us that while an hours requirement applies to both bonuses (i.e., 1,950 hours, including unlimited pro bono hours), associates reportedly aren’t as up in arms about it as they are at other firms. “Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise, people are pleased and understanding about the hours requirement,” says one tipster. “Can’t understand why that’s been an issue at other firms.”

UPDATE: It seems that not everyone at the firm is pleased about these hours requirements. Here’s a different perspective from a source:

Some associates think the decision unfairly ties the supplemental bonus, which the firm stated was to recognize contributions during COVID, to hours billed. Many people have not billed the target hours because they are dealing with children and virtual school or dealing with mental health issues, among other things. The tie to hours doesn’t acknowledge the contributions of those associates, who may have been close to the target even with these additional challenges.

# Time Is The New Black
## Alternative fee arrangements don't mean you can stop tracking hours.

Recording activity for business purposes is different from timekeeping solely for billing purposes. Most solo and small firms understand the need to capture all their effort as they strive to spend more time working on client matters. However, some firms have moved to flat fees and stopped recording hours. As many Biglaw firms shift to alternative fees, they need to continue to record hours. Regardless of the reason for flat fees, it’s not good practice to stop keeping track of hours. Also, all should reject the value billing theory that recording time is unnecessary. Timekeeping is not dead for Biglaw or any law firm.

My law firm work experience is limited to Canadian Biglaw, where I was a finance director about fifteen years ago prior to attending law school in Arizona. However, I have spent the past seven years talking with law firms of all sizes, mainly for Traklight and Evolve Law but also for my key performance indicator (KPI) writing. The KPI work has focused on solos and small law firms. I believe that Biglaw can learn from their best practices, particularly with respect to timekeeping for budgeting, costing, and pricing. In addition, considering that the Big 4 accounting firms track time, Biglaw should pay attention.

To start, for practical purposes, Biglaw can be viewed as many small firms within one large partnership. Attorneys working in mid-size firms often compare their practice to that of a solo or small firm. Therefore, from a matter and practice area point of view, Biglaw practice areas within a geographic location can be treated as a smaller department for measurement process.

Next, keeping track of your time when you are selling a service or a product is just good business practice. And law is a business, particularly Biglaw. I will not even touch upon the ethical side of tracking time for fee disputes because I am advocating timekeeping of all billable and non-billable time. Do not confuse timekeeping to bill by the hour with recording time for business purposes.

Timekeeping is the key to understanding your costs and pricing because human effort is still the law’s largest expense. I am not saying to ignore the other direct costs of serving clients, such as technology, but capture what people are doing, for how long. I recently presented on key performance indicators (KPIs) at a Thomson Reuters Canada small law seminar with a Toronto solo lawyer, who realized that he needed to record his time as a ‘raw material’ to his offerings for pricing and performance measurement. An analogy is that Ford knows precisely how much it costs to build my F150 for both materials and labor. Costing, budgeting, and pricing are management accounting principles that are used for products and service businesses, including the law.

The basic approach for costing and pricing in Biglaw is the same as small law, just as was discussed here around technology and process improvement. To decide how much a matter contributes to the overhead of the firm and the bottom line, the correct number of hours spent must be available to do calculations. By reviewing these hours, an attorney (or accountant or anyone) can evaluate whether the correct flat fee is charged or even if the billable hour rate is covering the expenses. This approach should even be used for contingency matter profitability calculations.

Recording the non-billable or non-client hours can also help evaluate the efficiency of the department or practice administration. For example, use time reporting information to evaluate out how many hours, and therefore dollars, are spent acquiring clients.

Finally, the hour information will help you identify where attorneys and paralegals might be struggling or have gaps in their training. Encouraging full and accurate reporting is good for all aspects of running your practice or department. Knowledge is power and without the actual hour information, you are left to guess on pricing and efficiency.

# Biglaw Partners Are Trying To Collect Client Cash Before Year's End, Not Getting Far
## Eek. Is this why bonuses are a little delayed this year?

I’ve seen firms ask their partners to really focus on what their year-end is going to look like based on their current trajectory. So, I do think we always see a big push for collections at year-end, and it will be crucial to this year.

— Gretta Rusanow, head of advisory services for Citi’s Global Wealth at Work Law Firm Group, commenting on [client payment delays during Biglaw’s year-end collection season](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/11/29/law-firms-see-payment-delays-amid-challenging-collection-season/). Rusanow said that partners are now asking clients for progress payments, and mentioned that firms have said “if it used to take 30 days for a payment, it’s now taking 60; if it used to take 60 days, it’s taking 90.” Through the first three quarters of 2022, Biglaw’s collections cycle has grown by 3.7%, which has led to a 10.4% growth in accounts receivable.

# Greenberg Traurig Distances Itself From Rudy Giuliani
## Giuliani obviously put the firm in a delicate situation, and the firm responded in the best way they could.

What’s a Biglaw firm to do when a partner goes on television and announces his integral role in constructing a “Muslim ban”? Especially when the firm was not hired to work on the thorny legal issue, airport protests against the executive order from around the country have dominated the news, and said shareholder is going viral in less than flattering terms?

Distance yo’self.

That’s just what the good folks at Greenberg Traurig did over the weekend.

Sure, Rudy Giuliani may be on a [leave of absence](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/rudy-giuliani-taking-break-from-embarrassing-greenberg-traurig-to-focus-on-embarrassing-himself/) from the firm but that doesn’t mean the embarrassment doesn’t linger. And Rudy remains a shareholder at the firm, so when he appeared on Fox News proudly proclaiming that he was an essential part of making Trump’s immigration executive order see the light of day, well something had to be done.

The firm’s Executive Chairman, [Richard Rosenbaum](http://www.gtlaw.com/People/Richard-A-Rosenbaum), acted quickly. On Sunday, he sent a firm wide email disavowing the firm’s involvement in the creation of the executive order. But more than that, he told of his own family’s history of immigration and closed with a quote from Malala Yousafzai, all of which gives it a much more authentic vibe than pure lawyerese.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As a side note, one has to imagine, that separate and apart from the substance of the order, Rosenbaum has to be chagrined over the [shoddy legal work](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/court-hits-pause-on-muslim-ban-but-nation-remains-on-a-precipice/) on it. Important questions, such as the status of permanent residents, dual citizens, and previously approved refugees remain unclear and subject to misinformation.

While the firm doesn’t come right out and condemn the order, likely cautious to avoid alienating conservative employees or clients, it is still an important step for those that may think Giuliani is representative of all of Greenberg. Indeed, the firm CEO, [Brian Duffy](http://www.gtlaw.com/People/Brian-L-Duffy), followed up Rosenbaum’s email with one of his own, offering legal assistance for any firm employees (or their family members) affected by the order and noting the firm’s upcoming training with the International Refugee Assistance Project.

When reached for comment, a spokesperson for the firm said:

Greenberg Traurig was not retained as to this Executive Order, and had no involvement in it. Last year, during the Presidential campaign, Mr. Giuliani, in his personal capacity as a volunteer for the campaign, along with other volunteer lawyers, made recommendations to now President Trump on this topic. He has advised that his involvement concluded at the end of the campaign.

Giuliani obviously put the firm in a delicate situation, and the firm responded in the best way they could.

# Business Planning for Senior Associates: Laying The Groundwork For Revenue Generation
## If you’re a mid-level or senior associate with aspirations to remain in private practice long term, you already know that business development will be a factor in your ability to advance in the profession.

If you’re a mid-level or senior associate with aspirations to remain in private practice long term, you already know that business development will be a factor in your ability to advance in the profession.  The early associate years are primarily about acquiring the core legal skills that enable you to practice competently and with relative independence.  But as you approach the window for promotion to counsel — and, ultimately, partner —  a solid legal toolkit is not enough.  Your firm must have confidence that you can make a material contribution to generating new business.

The good news is that business development doesn’t have to be intimidating.  If you lay the right foundation, it’s something that will start to happen naturally.  But the foundation is critical, and it requires a proactive investment on your part.  Business development planning is an iterative process, so the sooner you give it serious attention, the better placed you will be when your firm is considering you for promotion.  Do not wait until you are up for Counsel or Partner to get started.  To that end, here are some helpful tips.

Write a business plan and update it regularly.

Even as a mid-level associate, you need a business plan.  This is a living document that you should update at least annually.  Don’t wait until you are in the promotion window to do this!

A solid business plan will include details on what you have achieved to date, prospects you are actively working on, and your goals for the future.  List and quantify any matters you have originated, noting which business or client relationships would likely be portable in the event you switched firms.  List your business contacts, distinguishing between those to whom you are actively marketing and others in your broader network.  You should also make a list of attorneys who may be sources of referrals.

If you’re writing a business plan for the first time, you may have little to say about your (still nonexistent) book of business.  That’s totally fine!  Focus instead on spelling out the things you are doing to build your professional profile and lay the groundwork for future business development.  What organizations are you involved in?  Which articles have you published?  What about speaking opportunities?  If you don’t yet have experience in each of these categories, commit to building some in the next six months.

Foster a strong network, both in person and online.

It’s never too early to get serious about networking.  Relationships compound over time, often in unexpected ways, so there is substantial benefit to putting yourself out there early and maintaining an ongoing presence in the various communities with which you’re affiliated.  The range of opportunities for effective networking is wider than ever, both in person and online.  Remember that networking is about meeting and talking to people, without an immediate expectation of any concrete payoff.  So try to relax and be human about it!

One easy place to network is LinkedIn.  You can do it from anywhere, whenever you have a free moment.  LinkedIn is a great platform for marketing yourself as an expert in your field and making connections with prospective clients.  Low-effort ways to get started include sharing news about your firm and commenting on your connections’ posts.  As you grow more comfortable on the platform, start sharing your own insights relevant to your area of expertise.  In the process, you’ll find yourself staying in better touch with existing contacts, as well as expanding your network with new contacts.

And don’t forget about “internal networking” within your own law firm.  Getting to know attorneys outside of your practice group is key.  By gaining exposure to different practice areas, you lay the groundwork for future cross-selling.  A colleague who knows and trusts you is more likely to introduce you to clients and invite you on pitches.

If the concept of networking gives you anxiety, set yourself some small, achievable goals to help get more comfortable.  For example, if you go to a happy hour event, commit to making three new contacts and to making one LinkedIn post about the event.  And then vow to follow up with them.  The most important thing is to get started!

Leverage your mentors and learn from their experience.

If you’re a mid-level or senior associate, you likely have at least one or two mentors whom you trust to provide career advice.  (If you don’t, you should consider a lateral move to a firm more committed to mentorship!)  Business development is a great topic to explore with your mentors.  Ask about their experience generating revenue and the strategies that have worked best for them.  Share your business plan and ask for feedback.  Ask your mentors to include you in business development activities and pitches, where possible.  If you show that you’re committed to the business side of the firm, most partners will be happy to help you build the skills needed to become a revenue generator.

In addition to a mentor within your firm, assembling a group of other advisors who know the legal market and the profession is never a bad idea.  Forming a [relationship with an experienced recruiter](https://laterallink.com/why-you-should-build-a-relationship-with-a-recruiter-now/) (even if you aren’t looking to lateral at this time), who knows the market, and will check in with you every six months or so to update you and provide advice, can only help you.  A good recruiter can provide you with solid business development tips, a business plan template, and can even offer edits to your plan.

Commit to stepping out of your comfort zone.

Many associates find business development intimidating because it is new and requires you to put yourself out there and risk rejection.  However, please rest assured that these are learnable skills, provided you have the right mindset.  Start by acknowledging that you must step out of your comfort zone to achieve success and move forward.  And keep in mind that building a book of business doesn’t happen overnight.  Good luck and remember that there are many experts eager to help you put yourself out there!

# Former Sidley Partner's Mental Health Struggle Resonates With Attorneys
## People share the very real price of a Biglaw career.

[Back in January,](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/former-sidley-partner-opens-up-about-depression-and-washing-out-of-biglaw/) Kent Halkett, a former partner at Sidley Austin, wrote a piece for the Tennessee Bar Association urging the profession take mental health seriously, particularly in the wake of COVID-19. It’s a sensitive subject and Halkett’s article’s had a tremendous impact, not just because mental health has historically been verboten, particularly at high-powered law firms, but because of the death by suicide of Sidley partner Gabe MacConaill.

MacConaill was found in the firm’s parking garage with a[ self-inflicted gunshot wound.](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/10/biglaw-partners-death-due-to-self-inflicted-gunshot-wound/) After his death, his widow, Joanna Litt, [wrote a provocative op-ed](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/biglaw-widow-blames-firm-for-husbands-suicide/?rf=1) titled “Big Law Killed My Husband,” detailing the stress and “maladaptive perfectionism” MacConaill dealt with and it has struck a nerve among lawyers everywhere. When Halkett opened up about his own experience, at the same Biglaw firm no less, it had a cascade effect.

Now the Tennessee Bar Association[ has shared](https://www.tba.org/?pg=TBJSelect&pubAction=viewIssue&pubIssueID=8096&pubIssueItemID=11214) some of the responses to Halkett’s original piece. In combing through the reactions, a recurring theme jumps out — the legal industry has to reckon with mental health issues. Take a look at some of the reader reactions Halkett’s article has sparked:

- What brave words. What you said and Gabe’s widow said about the culture of BigLaw totally disregarding mental health and depression is correct.
- As you point out in your article, lawyer mental health is still taboo and I’m not sure anyone has written about it so nakedly before. We can tell our firms when we need parental leave or medical leave, or even when we have a body ailment. No one feels like we can tell our firm(s) that the pressure of the job is affecting our mental health.   
- Your article makes me reflect on the harm I actually may have done some unsuspecting associate, and I sincerely hope I have not been even a partial cause of depression or related illness in any of my colleagues. But the truth is, our desire to do things right and spare clients from the slightest oversights exacts a price, and your article wisely asks our colleagues at the bar to reflect on the potential for dire consequences of obsessing over a desire for perfection.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
- Law in general, and Big Law in particular, has become a VERY hard way to earn a living. The problem you discuss is real, both in the practice’s effect on individuals and especially the culture that views “medical” issues so differently from “mental” issues and you have done a wonderful job explaining that.
- I am proud of your courage. I am gladdened by your adaption and survival.  I am ashamed that I have been part of firms that generated such outcomes. I got out of big law. Not because it is inherently evil, but because the pain within was becoming oppressive. .. I have had my own issues with depression. You have opened the topic. I pray others will read and begin to deal with it in their lives.
- This is powerful. Thank you for authentically sharing your experience and insights. It is so critical to emphasize that just as there is no shame in diabetes, there should be no shame in mental illness. Unfortunately, shame becomes a prison that traps many from asking for help. I agree serious change is necessary to create a safe environment within law firms for attorneys to feel safe in asking for help.
Hopefully, this is the first step in Biglaw doing better.

# Trendspotting? Major U.K. Client Refuses To Pay Junior Biglaw Attorneys
## Are junior associates really this ""worthless""?

For almost a decade, major corporate clients in the United States have outright refused to pay full freight for inexperienced first- and second-year attorneys to work on their legal matters. In fact, according to a 2011 survey conducted by the Association of Corporate Counsel, [more than 20 percent](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2011/10/17/first-year-associates-are-they-worth-it/) of respondents simply refused to pay for the work of junior attorneys on some matters. After all, some in-house counsel believe that first- and second-year associates are [essentially “worthless,”](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/04/corporate-general-counsel-puts-fear-of-god-into-legal-educators-and-you-should-be-worried-too/) and have no desire to fund their on-the-job training.

It now seems that the unwillingness to pay for junior associates’ work has spread across the pond to not-so-jolly old England. Legal Week reports via the [Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/top-stories/id=1202781722437/In-a-First-Major-UK-Client-Says-No-to-Paying-for-Junior-Lawyers?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=4) that for the first time ever, a major client has refused to pay its outside counsel for work performed by newly qualified lawyers (i.e., first-year associates) and trainees.

Which client is making Biglaw firms feel the pain? That would be Deutsche Bank, which made the decision as part of a panel review process when choosing the firms that will remain on its roster to represent the bank in various legal matters for the next two years.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
According to [Legal Week](http://www.legalweek.com/sites/legalweek/2017/03/21/deutsche-bank-to-refuse-to-pay-for-trainees-and-nq-lawyers-after-panel-overhaul/), Biglaw partners are far from pleased with bank’s decision:

The new payment plans—set out in the terms of the tender process, according to partners at panel firms—have upset some of those pitching for the roster.

One partner told Legal Week: “It has annoyed a lot of people. The process was more aggressive.”

Another partner said that this was the first time he’d seen something like this happen, and went on to comment on the policy’s unfairness: “I think it is fair enough for trainees, but for NQs it seems very unfair—they are proper solicitors, so why should they not be paid? I have heard about this at other banks; usually in the U.S., but never in Europe.” One wonders if this partner is genuinely upset that junior attorneys at his firm won’t receive their due even though they’re fully qualified to practice law, or if he’s genuinely upset that his firm will lose out on a significant chunk of change thanks to the implementation of Deutsche Bank’s new policy. Sadly, it’s perhaps the latter.

Either way, we’d like to welcome U.K. Biglaw firms to the world that U.S. Biglaw firms have been living in since 2008. Will more of your clients decide that your junior lawyers aren’t up to snuff and refuse to pay for their “worthless” efforts? Only time will tell.

With Thanksgiving and [bonus (and raise!) season](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/milbank-raises-associate-salaries-and-announces-year-end-bonuses/) nearly upon us, the holiday season has officially arrived but lawyers are still looking for something to be thankful for — it’s the perfect time for rankings and awards to be handed out. Luckily for us, the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/11/16/the-american-lawyer-names-attorney-of-the-year-law-firm-of-the-year-and-more-2/) just held its industry awards gala, honoring the best and brightest among the largest law firms in the world. One of the awards up for grabs at this festive evening of excellence was the American Lawyer’s top prize for Law Firm of the Year.

So, which firms made the cut?

Before we get to that, we’ll discuss [Am Law’s methodology](https://www.event.law.com/americanlawyer-industryawards/categories) for choosing the best law firm of 2023, out of all Am Law 200 and Global 100 firms:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
This prestigious award goes to a law firm that has had an exceptional year across its service offerings, netting big wins but also showing a commitment to and progress in an area not solely related to their practice, such as pro bono, diversity or innovation in how legal services are delivered.

Without further ado, here is this year’s winner, as well as the firm’s fellow honorees:

LAW FIRM OF THE YEAR

Winners: King & Spalding

Highly Commended: Holland & Knight

Finalists: Husch Blackwell; O’Melveny & Myers; Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan; Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom; Spencer Fane; Susman Godfrey.

Congratulations to all of the firms that made the list of finalists and highly commended firms — and even bigger congratulations to King & Spalding for coming away with such a meaningful win. Well done!

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs.

# When Biglaw's Statements On Racial Justice Ring Hollow
## Biglaw needs to go beyond saying the right thing.

Since the murder of George Floyd last month, I’ve read [a lot of Biglaw statements about racial justice](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd). And in compiling what I’m sure is a non-exhaustive list of statements, it’s clear that not every statement is a great one — or even a good one. While some have been well received, others have been criticized as shallow or even cringeworthy.

What makes a good statement from Biglaw? Well, as Lia Dorsey, newly elected President of the Association of Law Firm Diversity Professionals and Director of Diversity and Inclusion at Dentons, noted, [it should come from the actual leadership from the firm since a firm’s culture](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/how-biglaw-should-be-responding-to-the-black-lives-matter-protests/), particularly as it applies to diversity issues, comes from the top down. The more successful statements were also earnest and spoke from the heart instead of being a “very special message from the firm.”

There are also some seemingly small things the convey a lot — like a firm’s [unwillingness to come out and say Black Lives Matter](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/51/) (or even mention the names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Armaud Arbery, or any other victim of racial violence). Or [only using quotes](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/63/) from white men about the importance of racial justice (talk about centering the wrong thing). Or statements that focus on the ways [everyone is diverse](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/22/) instead of the very specific issue at hand. Or statements that place[ undue focus on property damage](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/10/) instead of the life and death fight.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.

Covington’s [response](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/72/) to the recent protests has also been publicly called out as ringing hollow compared to the experiences of lawyers at the firm. Yolanda Young, who [unsuccessfully sued the firm](https://www.abajournal.com/files/SJMemOp.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2aW4RN1N-0yBO8WyVhLIZFKf77R7YG_jQcSNHfj6GB0q2wA1-rMQ5-3OE) for racial discrimination, pointed out on Twitter that the firm’s statement in the wake of the George Floyd protests was very different than what she experienced working at Covington.

When I reported racial slurs, a [@CovingtonLLP](https://twitter.com/CovingtonLLP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) partner treated me badly, eventually firing me, not the white woman who used the n-word. This was emotionally and financially devastating. To amend, pay me what you paid the woman who spewed hateful words.1/ [https://t.co/L3iFZ3mDqG](https://t.co/L3iFZ3mDqG)

— Yolanda Young (@yolandayoungesq) [June 7, 2020](https://twitter.com/yolandayoungesq/status/1269642733687312385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

I sued. The Court found that I was “laid-off” in spite of high billables & part of a group of black attys from top law schools who the firm wouldn’t consider promoting. Read more about the group here: 2/[https://t.co/Pi2qiVxOLs](https://t.co/Pi2qiVxOLs)

Cleary’s response to the Black Lives Matter protests was criticized by its New York black associates, who sent an office-wide email in response ([available here in full — and it’s absolutely something you should read](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/49/)). It called out the firm’s response as lackluster rhetoric that failed to provide concrete steps to directly support black associates at the firm. The associates recommended the following: acknowledge the pain of black associates, actively check-in and adjust, give grace, provide targeted mental health support, targeted pro bono efforts, effective mechanisms for addressing anti-blackness, educate, listen, and take action.

And concrete action is definitely a good thing, like specific dollar amounts firms are donating or their pro bono hours, for example Pillsbury’s[ impressive commitment](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2020/06/15/pillsbury-commits-11-million-over-3-years-in-cash-pro-bono-work-to-equal-justice-causes/) to donate $1 million in cash and $10 million in pro bono and volunteer work to social justice causes over the next three years. And Sidley is already doing some [high-profile pro bono work](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/sidley-partner-on-why-pro-bono-is-so-important-in-the-wake-of-the-george-floyd-protests/) on this subject.

Today is Juneteenth and [a record number of Biglaw firms have declared the day a firm holiday](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/skadden-declares-juneteeth-a-firmwide-holiday/), which is a great step in the right direction. But Above the Law is also hearing at that at a bunch of these firms, after the fanfare of the announcement, associates are being pressured by the partners they work for to not take the day off, quite literally making it a second-class holiday. It’s a poignant reminder that saying the right thing simply must be followed by doing the right thing.

# Skadden Rolls Out A Flexible Reopening Plan, Will Require Unvaccinated Employees To Be Tested For COVID-19
## This is the first Biglaw firm we know of to put a testing requirement in writing.

As time continues to tick down to summer’s arrival, Biglaw firms continue to announce their plans to return to their offices, and now Skadden, one of the most prestigious firms of them all, has joined the party. What’s particularly notable about Skadden’s announcement? To our knowledge, Skadden is the first firm to memorialize that unvaccinated personnel must undergo COVID-19 testing prior to entering the office.

The No. 5 firm in America, with $2,662,890,000 gross revenue in 2020, is setting its sights on a September 13 formal reopening of its U.S. offices, with a hybrid work model that will include at least three days of in-office experiences. According to a video message and a memo that was sent out earlier today, the firm “expect[s] remote work flexibility will be part of our work routine going forward.” Of course, sometimes attorneys will have to be in the office more often due to client needs, and sometimes attorneys’ personal circumstances will necessitate less time in the office, but the three-day model should be looked at as a “guidepost,” and not a hard and fast requirement. Once again, flexibility is king when it comes to office reopenings.

What it an attorney took the chance to move to a new location during the pandemic during the real estate boom? Not to worry, because Skadden is willing to work with you. If you’d like to be reassigned to another office, the firm will “consider such requests and will explore the feasibility of accommodations that support both your interests and the needs of your practice.”

Skadden will not be requiring vaccinations for employees to work in the office, but the firm urges everyone to do so, and will continue to provide time off so that everyone can receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Anyone in the office will be required to complete a daily health check certification. In the Safety & Protocols portion of its return to office memo, Skadden is the first firm to put in writing that unvaccinated employees must be tested for COVID-19 prior to entering the office:

Unvaccinated attorneys and professional staff, who have not had COVID-19 within the previous 90 days, will be required to have tested negative for COVID-19 within 48 hours of their arrival to the office or any in-person offsite location. More information about Firm-provided COVID-19 tests will be available in the coming weeks.

Should attorneys decide to return to the office during the firm’s transition period this summer, the dress code will be relaxed, and jeans will be permitted. Starting on June 1, snacks and coffee will be available on a 24/7 basis in the firm’s cafe. Congratulations to Skadden for putting together a plan that’s sure to please.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

(Turn to the next page to see the full memo from Skadden.)

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# Biglaw Firm Announces 'Industry-Leading' Parental Leave Policy
## A handful of firms may offer a few more weeks of fully paid, gender-neutral leave, but this is still fantastic.

If it wasn’t already clear, Biglaw firms should now know they must offer excellent parental leave policies in order to stay competitive with their peer firms. We continue to see more and more firms offering their attorneys generous paid leave, and the programs are increasingly gender neutral and offered without a primary caregiver stipulation.

The latest Am Law 200 firm increasing its parental leave is Benesch. The firm’s plan had always been gender neutral, but today it announced its adoption of a reportedly industry-leading 20 weeks of fully paid leave for new parents, up from 12 weeks of paid leave, plus the ability to take an additional six weeks of leave without pay. (We believe a handful of firms may offer a few more weeks of fully paid, gender-neutral parental leave.)

Liz Gillmore, Benesch’s Chief Human Resources Officer, noted that the firm’s new policy is designed to support attorneys as they attempt to balance their career with parenthood:

We are thrilled to roll out our new parental leave policy. It is directly aligned with our unwavering commitment to support our team and their families. As Benesch’s exponential growth across the country continues, we need to be flexible and supportive for our attorneys. We believe this is the longest paid parental leave in the law firm world and we are proud to be leading the industry.

Kudos to Benesch on its new parental leave benefits. Firms stepping up their family-friendly policies is something we’ll continue to pay attention to — particularly as we head into recruiting season. Hopefully your firm is changing its ways when it comes to important policies like parental leave. Please [let us know](mailto:staci@abovethelaw.com) when it happens.

# Associates Left Searching For Billable Hours After Partners Take Them All
## What will this mean with bonus season comes around?

The coronavirus crisis has wreaked havoc upon the legal profession and brought about changes that made working environments chaotic at best. From the the rapid transition from working in offices to working at home to the austerity measures that brought salary cuts, furloughs, and even layoffs to some law firms, associates have been put through the wringer. Now, associates are facing off against the very partners they work for in a battle for billable hours.

It seems that thanks to the pandemic, there’s been a downturn in work, and partners are taking on a lot of the work that associates and paralegals used to do. According to Bill Josten, manager of enterprise content for Thomson Reuters, there’s now a 2.7 percentage point difference between the hours partners and associates are working. “There has consistently been a gap,” he said, “but it got really wide, really quickly in conjunction with the pandemic.” The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/08/13/partners-are-taking-a-larger-share-of-available-work-during-pandemic-and-that-has-consequences-for-associates/) has some additional details on the new phenomenon that’s making associates cringe:

While hours are down across the board, Josten said the hourly dip for associates in Q2 of 2020 was significantly higher than that of partners. During Q2 of 2018, associates worked an average of 139 hours per month; in Q2 2019, it was 138 hours; and in Q2 2020, that number dropped to 126, a 10% drop from 2018.

Partners also saw a drop in hours, according to Josten. Q2 of 2018 saw partners work 124 hours per month; Q2 of 2019 was at 123; and Q2 of 2020 was 118, a 5% drop from 2018.

Whether this is due to client demand or partners simply hoarding the work that they do have, associates will be the ones who suffer in the long run. Never mind the fact that they’re not getting the professional development through challenging work that they would have in normal times, but when the holiday season comes, many associates won’t have been able to meet their minimum requirements for bonus eligibility.

Some firms are offering bonuses for extraordinary performance during the pandemic based on hours billed, but when there are fewer billable hours to be had overall, how are associates supposed to rise to the occasion (or attempt to do so)? It’s yet another unfair situation that’s been thrust upon associates during these turbulent times.

What’s the hours situation like at your firm? Are you on track to bill your usual number of hours in 2020? Please let us know in the poll below.

Will you meet your billable hours in 2020?

# Why Did Skadden Hire Paul Manafort's Daughter? The Government Has A Theory
## The firm allegedly didn't want to hire her until Paul Manafort got involved.

The details being revealed as part of the government’s case against former Skadden counsel Greg Craig are getting juicy. Craig earned himself the [dubious distinction](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/ex-skadden-counsel-has-honor-of-being-first-prominent-democrat-charged-in-mueller-probe/) of being the first prominent Democrat to face charges as part of the Mueller probe in April when he was indicted for making false statements to the Department of Justice in connection with his work at Skadden Arps.

Paul Manafort engaged Skadden on behalf of the Ukrainian government. As part of that representation, the firm wrote a report (which has been [a featured part](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/the-biglaw-bill-taking-center-stage-at-the-second-manafort-trial/) of the Mueller investigation’s case against Manafort) justifying the prosecution of former Russian-aligned Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych’s political rivals. Former Skadden associate, Alex van der Zwaan, [pleaded guilty](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/former-skadden-associate-who-pleaded-guilty-in-mueller-probe-begs-for-no-jail-time/) to lying to investigators in the Russia probe about his communications with former Trump campaign aide Rick Gates.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In court documents filed May 10th, prosecutors said Craig argued Skadden should hire a relative of Manafort after the firm had already rejected her application. According to [reporting by Big Law Business](https://biglawbusiness.com/ex-skadden-lawyer-craig-seeks-dismissal-of-illegal-lobbying-case), that relative appears to match the description of one of Manafort’s daughters, Andrea Shand.

Manafort allegedly viewed the work on the behalf of the Ukrainians as the prize he could bring to the firm that hired his relative:

It “goes without saying that I will push all future business to wherever [my relative] lands,” Manafort allegedly told Craig in an email, adding that a $4 million fee Skadden earned on its earlier work for the Ukrainians “can be viewed as just the beginning.”

After receiving this incentive from Manafort, Craig allegedly tried to convince Skadden to hire the relative, as [reported by](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/10/greg-craig-hire-manaforts-relative-1317600) Politico:

After Manafort emailed him, Craig told a senior partner at Skadden that he wanted the firm to make her an offer.

He drafted a memo outlining her strengths as a lawyer but noted that “perhaps one of the most important” reasons to hire her was the “potential for significant future business” with Manafort, according to prosecutors. While Manafort was already likely to steer more work to the firm, if Skadden hired his relative it would “[become] a certainty,” Craig wrote.

The government argues his actions on behalf of Manafort’s family member demonstrates how far Craig was willing to go to keep Manafort’s business:

“Craig’s desire to keep Manafort’s business—as demonstrated in detail in his efforts on behalf of Manafort’s relative—is probative of his motive and intent to mislead the [Foreign Agents Registration Act] Unit and avoid registering under FARA,” prosecutors write in the filing.

According to her [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-shand-75760835/), Shand began working at Skadden in the fall of 2012, after summering the year before at the doomed [Dewey & LeBoeuf](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/dewey-leboeuf/). Shand left Skadden in 2016, and is currently associate general counsel at Fort L.P.

# Firm Finally Announces Raises And Associates Are Less Than Excited

Back in the first week of January, Blank Rome forced all their associates to take time out of their day to call in to a pre-recorded conference call only to learn that they’d be hearing about raises… [in February](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/firm-announces-raises-coming-in-february/). Well, it’s now the very end of February and we know what Blank Rome is paying everyone.

Or, at least we have a good guess what they’re paying. Like a lot of firms in Blank Rome’s tier, they’ll crow about matching the $180K salary figure for first-years and then go really silent when it comes to salaries up the ladder.

A tipster is… not pleased with all this:

Nine months after the rest of Big Law got their new salary numbers and five months after being told that all associates would be given “significant” raises., we finally found out what that meant. Blank Rome does this bullshit where everything is “merit based” (e.g., we will find any little thing we can to screw you over), varies salaries across offices, and does not acknowledge their salary scale either internally or externally…..

So we’ve got another black box situation here, but we think we’ve worked out the averages by class:

Class	Salary
First	$180,000
Second	$185,000
Third	$185,000
Fourth	$205,000
Fifth	$220,000
Sixth	$240,000
Seventh	$250,000
Eighth	$260,000
UPDATE: See below for an update on these figures.

Again, these figures aren’t official but based on intel gathered from associates. So take them with the appropriate grains of salt, but associates are really good about blowing open black boxes when they put their minds to it:

How the firm is justifying paying second and third years the same amount is beyond any of us. It’s like they think we will not talk and find out what others are making…. The firm knows that we are not happy about these “significant” increases, but does not care. They considered the raises significant and think we are being “entitled” and “spoiled millennials” for wanting to be paid according to the new industry standard (or at least close to it).

No one has expressed more reservations about the wisdom of widespread associate raises than those of us here at Above the Law. With miserably stagnant demand, most firms just weren’t in a position to parrot Cravath’s move. But at this point the Cravath scale has achieved critical mass and if associates aren’t happy it’s not because they’re “spoiled,” it’s because they understand their value. Nothing’s more pathetically disingenuous than firing scores of lawyers without a second thought [when the market turns against you](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/03/nationwide-layoff-watch-blank-rome-cuts-79/) and then whining about disloyalty when the associates look to do what’s right for their bottom line.

By the way, you know [who’s really pissed about this](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/one-more-angel-in-law-firm-heaven/)?

Dickstein Shapiro associates and partners are particularly incensed by the new numbers. Dickstein Shapiro used to be on the old scale and now many of them are making less than what they would have been making if they left before the merger.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Well, this is why you’ve got to stay on top of your career and make sure you’re putting yourself in the best possible position to succeed.

Speaking of which….

People are planning to call recruiters all week long (and recruiters should be contacting Blank Rome talent in needed practice areas) and are ready to move immediately.

Yeah, no kidding.

UPDATE: Another tipster wrote in and told us that our averages for junior to mid-level associates may be too high:

What I can tell you is that there are a handful of 4th years and below that got paid less than our NY FIRST YEAR ASSOCIATE.  I don’t think there are any third years that got paid more than the NY first year base.  And most of us billed over 2000 hours or quite close to it.   And I work at one of the busier and lucrative (for the firm) practice groups.
FURTHER UPDATE: Yet another tipster chimed in to say the chart may be too generous:

It has become quite clear that the average salaries you listed definitely does not apply to my office. Many of my colleagues that I’ve spoken to make far less that the average salaries you’ve listed.

We look in the mirrors and see the changes (good, bad, and rarely good from an aging perspective unless there’s been “work done,”) over the last decade. We’ve gotten older (we’ll stipulate that such applies to everyone), perhaps broader (sigh), hopefully wiser (debatable) and a little (or a lot) wealthier (we can dream).

However, what’s one thing that has barely changed over the past decade? This is not final Jeopardy but perhaps it should be: the percentage of women equity partners in the top 200 law firms.

The National Association of Women Lawyers has released its [2017 survey](http://www.nawl.org/p/cm/ld/fid=1163) on promotion and retention of women in law firms and, while not surprising based on many conversations I’ve had with other women lawyers, the results are still disappointing and frustrating:

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
1. The more established women’s initiatives are at a firm, the higher the percentage of women equity partners. However, that percentage (nudging close to 20% but not there yet) only confers bragging rights as to firms that have newer initiatives (12%). When NAWL first did its survey in 2007, it found that the percentage of women equity partners was 16%. I don’t even need to use all the fingers on one hand to count the increase in ten years.

2. Even though men and women are hired pretty much equally on the associate level, as the years progress, disparities become more apparent. Women make up 19% of equity partners and 30% of non-equity partners. This even though law schools are cranking out women graduates, and for the first time, women first year law students [compose the majority](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/16/business/dealbook/women-majority-of-us-law-students-first-time.html?mcubz=3) of the incoming classes.

3. If you’re a woman equity partner in a firm that has had an established women’s initiative for some time, then the median earnings for you are 94% of what they are for your male equity partner colleague. Close, but not good enough. However, if the firm is late to establishing a women’s initiative, e.g. only recently, then the woman equity partner earns only 82% of the male equity partner’s earnings. Interview tip: make sure that you find out whether the firm has a women’s initiative and when it was established. Useful intel to factor in when making a career choice.

4. 97% of the firms reported that their top earner is a male (no surprise there) and nearly 70% of the firms have only one or zero, zip, zilch women in the top ten earners. Why is this not a surprise?

5. Remember being at the kids’ table for holiday meals and what it meant to “graduate,” so to speak, to the adults’ table? That was a big deal in my family. So, while women have a “seat at the adults’ table,” so to speak, they don’t have a lot of chairs at that table. There’s some improvement in the number of women who now make up 25% of law firm highest governance roles, compensation committees, managing partner or practice leader. That 25% is nearly double what it was a decade ago. As one of my woman lawyer friends would say, “That’s a big whoop.” Indeed.

6. As dismal as these numbers are for women, they’re worse for people of color, who compose only 6% of equity partners, and women of color make up only 2%. Openly LGBTQ people represent only 2% of equity partners, and people with disabilities represent less than 1%. (So, just what was the purpose of the Americans with Disabilities Act? I would hazard a guess that if lawyers would identify health issues, that number would be higher than one percent, but we all know the stigma attached to self-identification or being outed.)

7. Women equity partners work just as many hours as men, but their billings are 92% of their male colleagues.

Federal Reserve Board Chair Dr. Janet Yellen [spoke last spring](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20170505a.htm) at her alma mater, Brown University, and talked about the 125 years that women have been in the labor market.

She pointed out that in the 1970s, when I and other dinosaur women lawyers graduated law school, we expected that we would spend the majority of our lives in the work force and we prepared for it, focusing on “…careers as opposed to just jobs.” Ask any lawyer, male or female, and I would think that, to a person, law school students/graduates look at the profession as a career, not just a job, perhaps with the possible exception of document review.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
A diverse work force makes business sense, although you wouldn’t know it based on the NAWL survey results. Dr.Yellen pointed out that “A number of studies on how groups perform indicate that workforces that vary on dimensions such as gender, race, and ethnicity produce better decision-making processes and better outcomes.”

Here are some statistics Dr. Yellen mentioned: in 1990, the rate of participation of prime working age women in the United States was 74 percent, higher than all but a few of the industrialized nations. A pop quiz here: by 2010, out of 22 advanced economies with respect to female labor force participation, in what place was the United States? (A hint: we were not in the top half.) We were 17th.

The lack of success in climbing the professional ladder, such as in law, medicine, and Dr. Yellen’s field, economics, can be attributed, to a certain extent, to what is required in these careers: longer workweeks and penalties for taking time off, whether it be for vacation, child care, elder care, or the broad range of non-work responsibilities that fall to women. In our profession, failure to meet billable hours results in damage, both direct monetary loss and collateral reputational risk.

Dr. Yellen’s speech quoted [Malala Yousafzai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malala_Yousafzai), “We cannot all succeed when half of us are held back.” Couple that with the NAWL 2017 survey results. There is still a lot of “holding back.” Whether dinosaurial or millennial or anywhere in between, women lawyers know all too well what Malala is talking about. It’s like being on that interminable road trip pestering our parents with “are we there yet?” Nope, we’re not even close.

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

Bruce Stachenfeld

In my last article, entitled [Succession Planning – Yuck](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/reinventing-the-law-business-succession-planning-yuck/), I pointed out that many firms started in the past twenty or thirty years – both within and without the legal world – are facing this situation, and it is not an easy one. This is especially true for firms that had a dynamic leader/founder (probably a huge rainmaker) who created the firm on her back, possibly in a manner in which others were not properly groomed to take over. When the founder is at the point of retirement, the firm faces a choice of an orderly and even positive succession or decline and even extinction. This article gives my thoughts on how to handle this. (I note that I am not dealing here with the death, dementia, or incapacity of Jane, which presents some similar issues but obviously is quite different.)

In the prior article, I noted that it was likely that: the firm was founded ten to thirty years ago – there was a founding partner who started the business (who I called “Jane”) who was special somehow and built the firm with her indomitable spirit, extraordinary talent, and insanely hard work – those around her were pulled forward in the slipstream as she raised the organization to incredible levels – others with superstar potential were (inadvertently and unintentionally) marginalized and left the firm – the firm is doing very well with a great base of clients, investors and/or customers – but Jane is now 66 years old and, although people are very comfortable with her leadership, people are wondering what is going to happen when Jane moves on. Lawyers are disquieted for the reasons I outlined in the prior article and something needs to be done, since it is obvious that no one can really fill Jane’s shoes.

I thank those who were good enough to send me their ideas and/or compliment the prior article as raising a critical issue for consumption. I have a fair number of thoughts, and I am just going to give them in no special order.

(Since ATL only lets me write about 1,200 words per article, I have realized that this is going to take two more articles to finish – as I have 15 suggestions — so this is now the second in a three-article series – sorry about that…..)

Before going into what you “should” do, I ask you to consider something a bit heretical, and that is the question of whether the firm “should” be continued in the first place. What I mean here: does the firm have a “reason to exist”? Why do people come to work in the first place?

In this regard, you might ask, does the firm have a competitive niche in the marketplace? Is the firm doing things that will help it succeed as the legal world changes over the next ten years or, even with Jane at the helm, is the firm just clinging to a few long-time clients and there is really no game plan for the future? Do the partners like, trust, and respect each other, or are some “mailing it in,” others resenting that, and there is nothing really holding people together other than Jane’s forceful personality plus the money everyone is taking home? Keep in mind that there is no moral or other reason that all law firms should continue indefinitely in the first place. Perhaps Jane’s retirement is time to throw a party and celebrate all the good things that occurred and it is in fact a good time to dissolve the firm?

Along these lines, another solution might be to try to “sell” the firm to another law firm, which is euphemistically usually referred to as a “merger.” If the firm is going strong with Jane at the helm and there is really no great succession plan, maybe the best thing to do is to merge into another firm that is likely eager to get Jane’s firm’s clients and talent. There are a zillion issues that arise from [law firm mergers](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/law-firm-mergers/) that I don’t have room to get into, and I think there are a ton of other articles on this subject as well. I will say that it is not necessarily an easy thing to accomplish, and some partners tend to end up better and some worse in the course of a merger.

In any case, if you have a firm worth continuing, the reason will probably lie in the strong culture, the powerful work ethic, the fact that the people like each other and like coming to work, and that there is something special “in the ether” that is hard to define but bonds people together. If you are lucky, the partners couldn’t conceive of being at another firm because your firm is so special and different and even wonderful.

So, what should you do or not do to preserve this amazing place to work? Here are my thoughts:

- Don’t split the job between multiple parties, perhaps with the view that there are two people whose ego can only be satisfied in this way, or perhaps with the view that Jane’s shoes are just too big for one person to fill. I would guess that this would be a huge mistake as the firm will end up with two “camps” instead of one harmonious culture. Although there are always unique exceptions to this, I would strongly urge that there needs to be a single managing partner who is backed by everyone.
- Don’t have the former leader just leave or stay out of things to let the “new guy,” who I will call “Toby” (my go-to moniker), have a clean slate to take control and run things her way. I don’t think this is a good idea. Have Jane stick around – even for several years – grooming Toby into place. When difficult issues come up, at first Jane will effectively decide things like always, but then – gradually – say things like “well, this is Toby’s decision.” Over time, people will see two people in charge, and then gradually Toby instead of Jane. If this is done smoothly, people won’t consider the changeover as being that dramatic and traumatic.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
- Jane should have a major role in picking Toby – and in grooming her. In doing so, Jane should be thinking 100 percent of Toby’s leadership skills. Key leadership skills to me are:
Super-duper unswerving integrity, honor, and honesty, and a reputation of thinking of the firm first (always) rather than putting herself first.

Willingness to accept – eagerly – criticism. She is not “always right.”

Emotiveness – effectively love for the others at the firm and the firm itself.

Willingness to try – and fail – with new innovations and ideas. Here is a link to my prior ATL article, [The-Importance-of-Failure](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/04/reinventing-the-law-business-the-importance-of-failure/).

Initiative – the firm can’t just sit there – the world constantly changes, and the firm has to be ahead of the game rather than playing catch-up.

Emotional security – for example, Toby should be thinking of who will take over for her and think about grooming the next Toby for someday, instead of killing off potential rivals.

A powerful work ethic, most likely earned over years of experience.

And, finally, an ability to push, inspire, and somehow bring out the talents of those around her.

- I am not sure about this, but I think I would avoid a “succession committee.” I have a feeling that this will sound like a great idea but just will end up with more divisiveness than intended. Like it or not, the strength (and weakness) of the firm is that it was largely built by Jane. Jane has to largely solve this problem by engineering a smooth succession. Once Toby takes over, it is possible that the succession plan after Toby could indeed be handled by a committee, but my sense is not for the (first) succession after Jane.
- The succession plan should ideally be put in place many years before Jane is even near retirement, if possible. This way the whole “succession problem” might not even come up in the first place, as everyone just assumes – vaguely, in the backs of their minds – “oh, when Jane leaves, then Toby will just take over.” This is because they already see Toby starting to run things anyway.
- I would avoid having a brutally contested election with two egomaniacal rainmakers fighting for supremacy – yikes, that sounds awful.
- I would avoid picking the biggest rainmaker – this is painfully stupid. The rainmaker most likely should be out making rain and not running the firm. Plus, rainmaking skills are not necessarily the skills needed to run a law firm. This is a danger spot since in the law business, as everyone knows (whether they like it or not):
Rain = power

Hopefully your firm’s culture doesn’t run this way – and my Firm certainly strives mightily against it – but it is there in the minds of the lawyers, especially those who depend on a major rainmaker for work. This can possibly be sidestepped if Jane gradually transitions her “rain” to Toby and/or other partners. If Jane is that big a rainmaker, as is often the case in these situations, this problem can be avoided.

Okay – I am going to stop this article here and finish in Part III.

Thabo Sefolosha (left) and his lawyer, Alex Spiro

If you caught [The Daily Show](http://www.cc.com/shows/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah) last night, then you probably saw a great segment that we’ve been talking about here in the Above the Law offices. It’s the story of NBA player [Thabo Sefolosha’s](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/thabo-sefolosha/?rf=1) successful legal battle against the New York Police Department.

Last April, Sefolosha and his Atlanta Hawks teammate, Pero Antić, were arrested outside a nightclub and charged with resisting arrest, disorderly conduct, and “obstructing governmental administration.” As my colleague Elie Mystal [explained](http://www.atlredline.com/that-time-when-nypd-broke-an-nba-player-s-leg-for-no-re-1735681503):

Here’s what happened: there was a stabbing at a club. Outside the club, unrelated to the stabbing, Sefolosha was giving a homeless man some money. NYPD was trying to clear the area. Sefolosha was moving along, but took issue with the tone of some of the officers. Sefolosha (who is 6’6’’) admits that he called an officer (who is 5’7’’) a “midget.”

Then… NYPD threw him to the ground, broke his leg, and charged him with all kinds of crap in order to justify breaking a dude’s leg. The jury found that he wasn’t resisting arrest, and that he wasn’t obstructing justice. Instead, it seems like Sefolosha’s only crime was being verbally dismissive of a New York police officer.

The Daily Show clip offers a behind-the-scenes look at the legal strategy for the case. Defense lawyer [Alex Spiro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-spiro-57858b78) — an interesting character in his own right, a Harvard Law grad who worked for the CIA and as a Manhattan prosecutor before joining up with lawyer to the stars Ben Brafman — actually urged Sefolosha to consider the prosecution’s proposal. It involved no prison time, no fine, and dismissal of charges after six months if Sefolosha stayed out of trouble.

But Sefolosha, insisting on his innocence, demanded to go to trial. My colleague Elie’s theory: “Sefolosha’s not from here — he’s Swiss — so he might actually have expected a ‘fair trial.'” And in the end, it appears that he got one. The trial lasted four days; the jury deliberated for under an hour before acquitting Sefolosha of all charges.

Being factually innocent helped, of course. But as longtime observers of the criminal justice system know, innocence isn’t always enough.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As noted in the Daily Show clip, Sefolosha was not your average African-American defendant going up against the police. He retained — and he could afford to retain — top-notch legal talent. He had a fellow professional athlete to serve as a witness supporting his version of events. And, quite crucially, there was video footage of the altercation.

Sefolosha won a resounding victory at his criminal trial — but, as Elie observed, “I’d hardly say Thabo ‘beat’ the system. They broke his leg, and he got called a thug in the tabloids for several days.”

Well, that’s what civil lawsuits are for. Sefolosha previously announced his intention to file a [multimillion-dollar lawsuit against the NYPD](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2015/10/27/hawks-thabo-sefolosha-plans-to-file-50-million-lawsuit-against-nypd/). We reached out to Alex Spiro, who said that he’s ready and able to file such a suit very soon (ahead of the statute of limitations expiring early next month).

The Daily Show clip appears below. If you’re not in a place where you can watch video right now, you can read more about the case in this [Vice Sports piece](https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/the-ugly-truths-revealed-in-thabo-sefoloshas-trial).

# Biglaw Firm Announces Special Bonuses, But Associates Don't Seem Too Thrilled
## Eek. But at least they're getting bonuses at all....

Biglaw bonus season doesn’t just mean it’s time for year-end bonuses — some firms are handing out “special” bonuses too. Or, in the case of this Am Law 100 firm, not-so-special bonuses. At least that’s the vibe we’re getting from associates on this offering.

Cozen O’Connor brought home $584,802,000 gross revenue in 2021, and just like in years past, the firm is handing out special bonuses during the holidays. This time around, associates aren’t too thrilled with the numbers, which range from $5,000 to $10,000 across all class years. Here’s an excerpt from the memo sent by firm leadership, explaining why the bonuses are smaller this year:

We obviously recognize that these extraordinary bonuses are not as large as last year, and that is for a host of reasons, not the least of which is that the extraordinary fees collected this year were substantially lower than prior years.

Here’s the scale for Cozen’s special bonuses:

- Class of 2022: $5,000
- Class of 2021: $5,000
- Class of 2020: $7,500
- Class of 2019: $7,500
- Class of 2018: $7,500
- Class of 2017: $7,500
- Class of 2016+: $10,000
Associates we’ve heard from at the firm had a range of reactions, none of them happy. Here are a select few:

• “I work for Cozen O’Connor and we just got our year-end bonuses that are insanely low for an Am Law firm. No match here.”

• “‘Special’ bonus announcement from Cozen. What is even more annoying is the retreat they just required us to go to in Florida cost more than $3m. Would’ve rather seen that money go to my bonus rather than an open bar for 3 days straight….”

Yikes. While it should be noted that these special bonuses are separate from the firm’s merit bonuses (which will be announced in January and paid in February), associates aren’t holding out hope that those will be market matches.

We’re not complete Grinches here at Above the Law, so we’ll be kind and say that smaller special bonuses are better than no special bonuses at all.

(Flip to the next page to see the memo from Cozen O’Connor.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Client-First Focus Keeps Locke Lord Ahead Of The Competition

[](http://bit.ly/2DRHUxh)Locke Lord LLP recognizes that running a profitable business and putting clients first are not mutually exclusive. Nowhere is that clearer than in the firm’s mission statement, which states, “We will serve our clients’ interests first. Our firm’s success will follow.”

Achieving both goals can be a delicate balance. It requires all contributors to be at the top of their games at all times. That means working smarter while finding ways to minimize wasted time and effort. The other half of that equation is the need for the firm to deliver services in a manner that creates maximum value to their clients and keeps them coming back.

Locke Lord, a respected national law firm with global reach, serves clients around the world in a wide range of litigation and transactional issues. Knowing that technology is one key method of attracting and retaining clients, the firm recently invested in Westlaw Edge™, an AI-powered legal research platform.

Procuring the Right Tools to Meet the Firm’s Goals and Accommodate Client Demands

The team at Locke Lord was among the first to realize the power of technologies powered by artificial intelligence. AI-powered technology, such as Westlaw Edge, provides the efficiencies necessary to help them accomplish routine tasks faster so their professionals can focus on higher value activities. Art Anthony, a partner in the firm’s litigation group, explains, “My primary consideration in evaluating new technologies is the value-add to the firm and to the client in terms of efficiency. Clients are looking for their law firms to be efficient with the delivery of legal services and to minimize costs where possible.”

# Associate Bonus Watch: A Silicon Valley Bellwether Weighs In
## A lockstep system matching the market doesn't sound very thrilling, but associates seem content.

Last year, Silicon Valley powerhouse [Wilson Sonsini](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/wilson-sonsini-goodrich-rosati/) announced a new approach to bonuses. In short, it replaced its tiered structure, based on 1900-, 2100-, and 2400-hour levels, with lockstep bonuses on the New York/Cravath scale for everyone hitting 1900 “bonus-eligible” hours (a generous metric, including up to 100 hours of firm work and unlimited pro bono).

This system went over well with WSGR associates, who appreciated the transparency and the keeping up with New York. So the firm did it again this time around, using the following familiar scale:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Yup, that’s right: “Just a [Cravath match](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2016-associate-bonuses/), as expected.”

So this news isn’t exactly thrilling. But the Wilson Sonsini associates we’ve heard from are definitely not complaining.

What’s going on at WSGR peer firms, like Cooley and Fenwick & West? If you have information, we’re all ears.

As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Am Law 50 Firm Offers Market-Busting Bonuses On Top Of Bonuses On Top Of Bonuses
## Amazing!

Biglaw’s 2020 bonus season is getting repetitive. Firm after firm is announcing the same bonuses, with little differentiation save for billable hours requirements for associates to take home their cash.

Today, we’ve got a bit of a game changer.

What could possibly be better than bonuses? Bonuses on top of bonuses, of course. And what could be better than bonuses on top of bonuses? Bonuses to the third power (i.e., bonuses on top of bonuses on top of bonuses), and that’s exactly what Orrick — a firm that brought in $1,158,537,000 in 2019 gross revenue, placing in at No. 31 in the most recent Am Law 100 rankings — is offering to its associates this year.

First and foremost, the firm will be matching the year-end bonus scale offered by Cravath and the special bonus scale offered by Davis Polk. What’s needed for associates to get a full market bonus? At the beginning of the year, the firm lowered its billable hours threshold to 1,950, including 100 hours of time spent on areas like diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), innovation, and business development (BD), plus unlimited pro bono hours.

In addition to those bonuses, Orrick is once again offering premium overmarket bonuses to its hardest-working associates on top of its regular bonuses. Last, but certainly not least, the firm is offering another special bonus to associates to reward the “grit and dedication” that was needed from them to succeed during the pandemic. Those with hours in the range of 1,850 to 1,949 will be eligible for a special merit bonus award ranging from $5,000 to $15,000, depending on class year.

Check out the Orrick bonus scale:

First-year associates at Orrick could receive up to $26,250 in bonus cash ($3,750 more than market) and senior associates at the firm could receive up to $165,000 in bonus cash ($25,000 more than market). That’s pretty amazing!

As if the firm’s generosity to associates wasn’t enough, Orrick is also offering special bonuses to its career associates, its analytics team, and its paralegals.

In addition to all of this bonus news, the firm’s family caregiver relief program — a benefit that will allow associates and counsel who were thrust into caregiving positions (for children, elderly parents, or both) during the pandemic to work an 80 percent schedule at full compensation for up to three months — is now underway.

Congratulations to everyone at Orrick! This is a fantastic way to boost morale for all at the firm as 2020 finally comes to an end.

(Flip to the next page to read the Orrick bonus memo in full.)

# Simpson Thacher Won't Delay Its U.S. Office Reopenings, But Adjusts Its Face-Time Expectations For Attorneys
## Three to four days per week in the office will no longer be required.

When we last checked in with Simpson Thacher — a firm ranked 14th on the latest Am Law 100, with $1,844,627,000 in 2020 gross revenue — they were planning to [reopen their U.S. offices on September 13](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/stb-reopening/), with “the ultimate goal” of having lawyers in the office three or four days each week. This plan was announced in late May, and since then, many firms have walked back their original plans, delaying their reopening dates until later in the fall due to the spread of the Delta variant. What is STB planning to do?

Earlier this month, the firm scrapped its plans to reopen on September 13, settling on October 18 instead. Many other Biglaw firms have chosen the same date, but there’s still time for them to change their minds. In fact, some firms have already decided to forgo reopening this year at all.

Today, Simpson Thacher confirmed that it will stay the course with its planned October 18 reopening date for its U.S. offices — but with a few adjustments. Of note now is the fact that STB will no longer require lawyers to come to the office three or four days per week. Here’s an excerpt from a memo that was sent out this morning by Jennifer Hobbs and Thomas Wuchinech, members of the firm’s executive committee (emphasis added; full memo available on the next page):

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
While our U.S. offices will be fully open as of October 18th, we recognize that there remains anxiety and uncertainty related to the Delta variant. As such, we will be more flexible regarding the number of days lawyers would ideally be in the office for the remainder of the year. To that end, it is our hope that lawyers will join us back in the office to the extent they are comfortable, at least one or two days per week beginning on October 18th.

Hobbs and Wuchinech go on to mention that the firm is reopening on schedule to provide important career opportunities like “reestablishing physical connectedness with our colleagues” because “informal social interactions are critical to fostering collegiality and camaraderie and in building trust in our teams.”

Insiders at the firm seem less-than thrilled with the reopening plan, with one telling us: “This is an incredibly disappointing decision in the face of a pandemic that is clearly not over. I can’t believe I am forced to choose between between ensuring my family’s safety or meeting the firm’s ‘expectations.'”

Perhaps recognizing that not everyone would be pleased with this plan, Simpson Thacher is instituting a specific period of remote work for the winter holidays:

Finally, we are cognizant of avoiding unnecessary stress and friction during this transition period, so it is our intention to encourage all U.S. lawyers to work remotely Thanksgiving week and the last two weeks of the year (December 20th-January 2nd). We will revisit our reopening plans again later this year to provide further guidance for 2022.

Simpson Thacher will soon provide additional information on health and safety protocols that will be in place upon its formal reopening. The firm has already [barred the unvaccinated from its offices](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-delay-openings-lay-down-strong-vaccination-policies/?rf=1). Perks like free breakfast and lunch will remain in place for all personnel through the end of the year.

There’s still a month to go before the firm is scheduled to reopen, and as we all know far too well, anything can happen between now and then. Let’s see if Simpson Thacher’s plans actually come to fruition.

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Simpson Thacher.)

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

[Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/morning-docket/)
# Morning Docket: 09.29.16
## * “The ballot-selfie prohibition is like 'burn[ing down] the house to roast the pig.'"" Just in time for Election 2016, the First Circuit has struck down New Hampshire's ballot selfie ban as unconstitutional, citing the fact that it curtailed voters' free speech, and on top of that, the state was unable to identify any complaints of vote buying or intimidation. [[POLITICO](http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2016/09/voters-selfie-ban-new-hampshire-unconstitutional-228852)] * Suspended Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore, who instructed probate judges to adhere to the state's ban on same-sex marriage, even after the Supreme Court's Obergefell ruling, says the ethics charges he faces are ""ridiculous"" since he never ""encourage[d] anyone to defy a federal court or state court order."" [[WSJ Law Blog](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/09/28/anti-gay-marriage-alabama-chief-justice-denies-defying-rule-of-law/)] * Wiley Rein lost two practice group leaders to DLA Piper this week. The firm, known for its media, telecom, government contracts, and IP practices, no longer has partners in charge of its telecom group or its wireless group, but it claims these departures were anticipated, and the practice groups were merged ahead of time. [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/wiley-rein-hit-with-two-exits-in-washington-d-c/)] * Cha-ching! The Caesars bankruptcy is ending, which means the ""fee frenzy"" for lawyers who were working on the case is about to dry up as well. Nine law firms have been involved in the case since the company first filed for bankruptcy in January 2015, and hundreds of millions of dollars of legal fees have already been assessed. [[Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/top-stories/id=1202768687962/Caesars-Deal-Means-End-of-Fee-Frenzy-for-Bankruptcy-Lawyers?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=1)] * Many jurisdictions adopted the Uniform Bar Exam for the July 2016 administration of the bar exam, and it seems like it may have had the opposite effect on test-takers than what was intended. Graduates of this law school saw their bar exam passage rate drop by 13 percent since last year. We'll have more on this later today.

* “The ballot-selfie prohibition is like ‘burn[ing down] the house to roast the pig.'” Just in time for Election 2016, the First Circuit has struck down New Hampshire’s ballot selfie ban as unconstitutional, citing the fact that it curtailed voters’ free speech, and on top of that, the state was unable to identify any complaints of vote buying or intimidation.

* Suspended Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore, who instructed probate judges to adhere to the state’s ban on same-sex marriage, even after the Supreme Court’s Obergefell ruling, says the ethics charges he faces are “ridiculous” since he never “encourage[d] anyone to defy a federal court or state court order.” [[WSJ Law Blog](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/09/28/anti-gay-marriage-alabama-chief-justice-denies-defying-rule-of-law/)]

* Wiley Rein lost two practice group leaders to DLA Piper this week. The firm, known for its media, telecom, government contracts, and IP practices, no longer has partners in charge of its telecom group or its wireless group, but it claims these departures were anticipated, and the practice groups were merged ahead of time. [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/wiley-rein-hit-with-two-exits-in-washington-d-c/)]

* Cha-ching! The Caesars bankruptcy is ending, which means the “fee frenzy” for lawyers who were working on the case is about to dry up as well. Nine law firms have been involved in the case since the company first filed for bankruptcy in January 2015, and hundreds of millions of dollars of legal fees have already been assessed. [[Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/top-stories/id=1202768687962/Caesars-Deal-Means-End-of-Fee-Frenzy-for-Bankruptcy-Lawyers?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=1)]

* Many jurisdictions adopted the Uniform Bar Exam for the July 2016 administration of the bar exam, and it seems like it may have had the opposite effect on test-takers than what was intended. Graduates of this law school saw their bar exam passage rate drop by 13 percent since last year. We’ll have more on this later today.

# Will Tech-Focused Biglaw Firms Be Forced To Conduct Layoffs This Year?

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

I don’t think any bubble has burst. The work will return, but it may not be coming simply fast enough for these firms to keep up, especially with the pay raises that were given.

— [Kate Reder Sheikh](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/kate-reder-sheikh?byconsultantorauthor=kate-reder-sheikh), a California legal recruiter for Major, Lindsey & Africa, in comments given to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/fenwick-layoffs-show-pressure-on-firms-with-eggs-in-one-basket) on the recent [layoffs announced by Fenwick & West](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/02/layoffs-literally-decimate-am-law-100-firm/). She named several reasons why Fenwick may be having difficulties, ranging from how interest rates are affecting venture work, overhiring, and associate salary raises. Reder Sheikh went on to note that tech-focused firms that didn’t announce layoffs last year “unfortunately have good odds of having to do them in 2024.”

Whether they want to admit it or not, Biglaw firms are in the midst of a relatively slow-moving race to see which firms are willing to pay their associates at the top of the market rate. Above the Law is committed to documenting all of the compensation machinations, and the recent advent of spring special bonuses has kept us all busy.

Sidley has gotten into the bonus game. Yesterday, the elite firm — ranked number 6 in the Am Law 200 with $2,337,803,000 gross revenue in 2019 — announced they’d be matching the prevailing market rate (set by the good folks at Davis Polk). They’re going with June and November disbursements, with the second payment larded up in comparison to the more modest first payday.

Associates in good standing will receive bonuses according to the following schedule:

# The Incredible Shrinking Equity Ranks
## As making equity partner becomes more elusive, smart firms will think beyond the numbers.

For most lawyers, they have a goal in mind before they even take their LSAT: making partner at a firm. Making partner at a prestigious firm is the gold standard achievement for a young attorney looking to signal to the world that they’ve arrived. For many, the day they made partner felt like the day their practice of law truly began.

But partnership ain’t what it used to be. Making the transition from associate to partner in today’s legal market usually means new business cards, a press release, maybe an upgraded office. It almost certainly means a slew of new mandatory meetings and committee assignments. But at firms across the globe, it rarely means taking a share of ownership in the business.

What’s in a Name?

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Most Biglaw firms have switched to a two-tier — or more — system of partnership. At the top of the system are the equity partners, the ones who take the firm’s leftover profits at the end of the year. The equity partners are generally the rainmakers of the firm, the profit-generators with the big books of business and working attorney collections. They’re also the ones who shoulder much of the firm’s heavy business lifting, generally waiting for payment until the end of the year, signing personal guarantees, and otherwise bearing the risk of loss.

Then there are nonequity partners. Some of these are young partners building their books, on their way to the equity ranks. Others are talented attorneys without significant books of their own, but whose work commands enough respect to merit calling them a partner. Still others are former equity partners who may be winding down their careers or working part time.

Despite the similar titles, there can be a world of difference between the tiers. Aside from the economics, some firms have cultures where nonequity partners are treated as second-class citizens — excluded from key meetings, not given access to key financial information, and not granted voting rights. This cultural divide is not always the case, and the firm I work at has gone to great lengths not to draw distinctions between its equity and nonequity ranks. But lawyers notoriously love hierarchy, and I suspect that our firm is probably more the exception than the rule on this point.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The concept of nonequity partnership is nothing new, but it truly came to prominence in the wake of the Great Recession. As firm revenues fell and competition became increasingly cutthroat, rainmakers became more valuable than ever. The overall pie was shrinking, so firms, desperate for revenue, took extreme steps to keep business generators or attract new ones. Once the first firm made the move, others had to follow to avoid being raided by firms willing to throw gobs of money at lawyers with big books of business.

You can’t have a redistribution of wealth without someone going hungry. The way most firms came up with the premiums to pay the rainmakers was to shrink their equity ranks. If you divvy up the same profits with a smaller number of people, each person gets more. To accomplish this, some firms stripped equity from partners who were underperforming, or just not performing as well as the others. Still others dramatically cut back on the number of lawyers they promoted to the equity ranks. But most employed some combination of both changes, quickly realigning their partner ratios and profit distribution.

No matter how correct the decision to reallocate equity might be from an economic and competitive standpoint, it’s an unavoidably ugly process. It’s no secret that lawyers have big egos and that many, if not most, are driven by status. Almost by definition, these equity concentration moves have winners and losers. And when someone isn’t able to proudly wear the equity badge, they will often have a difficult time accepting it. From the outside, and even perhaps from within, it can look like the haves are getting greedy at the expense of the have-nots.

A Necessary Evil?

Trust me, I get why many disdain the two-tier structure. Why can’t firms just be more egalitarian, inviting everyone into the equity ranks to work together for the common good of the firm? There’s a real part of me that wishes this model could exist. But I also wish I could fly and shoot laser beams out of my eyes. In both cases, my wishes don’t matter. In the case of flying, gravitational forces keep me grounded. In the case of a single-tier system, market forces have dictated how firms need to adapt.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The truth is prudent firms do not have a real choice when it comes to whether or not they need to follow the market trend of embracing a two-tiered system. Like it or not, firms that fail to make their rainmakers happy will pay a high price. One of the chief problems defunct [LeClairRyan](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/09/the-accidental-ponzi-scheme/) faced in the years leading up to its spectacular collapse was its failure to de-equitize non-producing partners. That left the firm’s actual rainmakers feeling like they were subsidizing a favored few, which primed them to be poached by the competition. Those rainmakers then left, and the firm collapsed on itself.

But wait. What about firms like Cravath, which has a single partnership tier and seems to be doing just fine — consistently topping the Am Law profits-per-partner charts? Doesn’t Cravath’s success prove that a firm can thrive without having to adopt a two-tier system? In a word, no. Cravath has a unique brand that allows it to command market-topping rates that immunize it to the market pressures that most firms face. In fact, the Cravath model is even more draconian than the two-tiered approach. The stats tell the story. [Cravath](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=71&name=Cravath,-Swaine-%26-Moore-LLP) has 500+ lawyers, only 83 of whom are partners. So rather than pushing quality lawyers into nonequity ranks, Cravath refuses to even nominally promote any but the best of the best. Ouch.

Biglaw’s Challenge

The challenge for Biglaw management is how to keep both the firm’s biggest earners and its developing prospects content. Efficiently allocating the equity pool is an essential component of this process, but it cannot be the final word. Biglaw needs to understand and leverage the non-monetary benefits it can provide its partnership. There’s [almost always going to be someone willing to pay more for any given partner’s book](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/dont-just-show-me-the-money/), but if that partner is getting paid decently in addition to receiving support they couldn’t get anywhere else, dislodging them is going to be a tricky task.

The path to equity partnership is a long one, and it’s only getting longer. Good managers will try to get their colleagues to the end of that path. Great managers will get those colleagues to enjoy the journey.

As is becoming standard among the firms at the top of the Biglaw hierarchy, yet another firm has matched what’s become the new prevailing salary scale. It’s always our pleasure to welcome a new firm full of bright-eyed associates to the land of the $205K market rate. Thanks for joining your peers, Mayer Brown!

At the end of the day yesterday, the No. 22 firm on the most recent Am Law 100 ranking notified associates that it would be matching the Davis Polk scale for U.S. associates, effective July 1. Once again, here’s the new salary scale, in case you’ve somehow forgotten:

- 2020: $205,000
- 2019: $215,000
- 2018: $240,000
- 2017: $275,000
- 2016: $305,000
- 2015: $330,000
- 2014: $350,000
- 2013+: $365,000

# All Hail These Bonuses
## Where there's a Wilmer, there's a way (and a bonus).

WilmerHale, that is! The firm traditionally announces bonuses on the later side — sometimes in January of the new year — but upped its timeline this year to announce matching bonuses.

The marriage of Washington mainstay Wilmer Cutler and Boston’s Hale & Dorr now sits WilmerHale at 29th in the Am Law ranking with $1,243,384,000 in gross revenue for 2020 — an early 2000s proof of concept that sometimes law firm mergers can create a juggernaut that’s even more than the sum of its more than capable parts.

The bonus is a full DPW match, including the “special bonus” that’s less “special” than “the market premium over Cravath’s original announcement” but why get hung up on semantics. That said, WilmerHale will be offering additional bonuses to those associates who turned with “extraordinary” performance and productivity.

Class	Base Bonus	Special Bonus
Class of 2021	$15,000 (pro-rated)	N/A
Class of 2020	$20,000	$4,000
Class of 2019	$30,000	$6,000
Class of 2018	$57,500	$11,500
Class of 2017	$75,000	$15,000
Class of 2016	$90,000	$18,000
Class of 2015	$105,000	$21,000
Class of 2014+	$115,000	$23,000
Associates will need to be in good standing and posting 2000 hours (annualized) by December 31, 2021, to get the bonus, which the firm will pay out in January.

Congrats. Memo on the next page.

While a slew of the biggest Biglaw firms [have yet to weigh in](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/screw-cravath-whats-kirkland-going-to-do/) on the question of the appropriate associate compensation for 2018, there’s increasing momentum for the [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/)/[Simpson](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/)/[Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) scale. That’s especially true now that Davis Polk has officially gotten on board with these numbers.

That’s right, drinks are on Davis Polk associates tonight. That’s the latest firm to announce they’re giving raises — and special summer bonuses — for all U.S. associates. That puts the compensation scale at these enviable rates:

This season of salary raises has been more volatile then usual, but it seems — at least for the elite Biglaw firms — there’s consensus growing around these numbers. It remains to be seen how salaries will shake out in [those firms outside the Am Law 50](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/the-am-law-200-is-out-what-does-it-tell-us-about-the-legal-landscape/) (excepting, of course, [select](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/the-first-firm-has-matched-the-new-milbank-scale/) elite [boutiques](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/first-firm-matches-the-new-and-improved-cravath-pay-scale/)).

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

I think what the economy is responding to is uncertainty. The less uncertainty, the better a lot of transactional practices perform. And I think with law firms this year, it is going to be the most challenging year in many years.

— Kent Zimmermann, legal consultant at Zeughauser Group, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/04/18/a-step-back-but-still-ahead-an-analysis-of-the-2023-am-law-100/), on what Biglaw firms have ahead of them in 2023, compared to the rough ride that many already faced in 2022. Quite a few Biglaw firms have already [conducted layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/layoffs/) this year, while others are [deferring](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/biglaw-firm-lays-off-10-of-its-workforce-may-defer-incoming-associates/) incoming [associate classes](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/after-layoffs-last-year-cooley-delays-start-date-for-first-year-associates/).

Consider how executives, department leaders, and employees feel about your legal department. Do they view it as a critical business partner? When these individuals trust and respect your legal team: 

- They consistently seek and confidently follow your team’s legal advice, guidance, and decisions.
- You help the company avoid costly litigation or regulatory penalties as lawyers spot and prevent potential legal issues through closer collaborations with other business functions.
- You receive resources such as funding, personnel, and technology to effectively pursue the legal department’s mission. 
- Legal professionals develop a sense of pride and purpose, which leads to greater job satisfaction and retention.
If you’re not quite there yet, don’t worry. Here’s how you can cultivate trust and respect to improve your legal department’s reputation and achieve the goals above.

Because proactive legal departments look out for the organization’s best interests, they often prevent costly disasters. There’s nothing like saving hundreds of thousands of dollars to show company leaders you’re in their corner. Ways to be proactive include: 

- Conduct regular legal audits. You know what they say about an ounce of prevention. Regularly review contracts, policies, and procedures to mitigate areas of risk before they lead to legal disputes or regulatory penalties. This is how you obtain a pound of cure. 
- Train and educate. Teach colleagues and employees about the legal issues specific to their roles. For example, IT teams must know about data privacy laws to help manage data compliantly. Anti-discrimination education helps HR leaders navigate and prevent discrimination claims. Knowledge is power when you share it far and wide. 
- Implement strategic policies and procedures. Provide guidance to address legal risks and instruct employees on complying with applicable laws and regulations. For example, create a document retention policy that prevents the permanent loss of essential documents. Or, establish a procedure for employees to report potential discrimination and harassment so your team take appropriate action quickly. 
- Embed compliance into everyday work. Using legal technology, you can embed legal guidance into daily automated workflows — set triggers that automatically escalate legal issues to the appropriate lawyer for resolution. This is one way the transformational power of legal technology can help you be more effective and compliant.
Strengthen Confidence In Your Department

Executives, colleagues, and employees may assume lawyers are too busy to help them. They may fear their legal matters will get lost or receive an automatic “No” stamp. To prevent such concerns:

- Respond to every request for assistance. To do so efficiently, optimize your legal intake workflow to digitally track every request, [automatically respond to inquiries, and reroute irrelevant tasks.](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/legal-workflow-optimization-say-no-to-irrelevant-requests/) 
- Use technology to ensure the legal team follows through on all commitments and delivers automatic status updates to keep all stakeholders informed.
- Use clear and concise language in writing and in person. Avoid legal jargon and explain complex legal concepts in terms nonlawyers understand.

Foster Relationships Across The Company

Legal teams can’t provide value as isolated groups. Lawyers must be active in the business, working with others to identify and solve problems and anticipate needs.

Coworkers and employees will be more likely to ask for help when they trust that your lawyers are quick and helpful. But someday, you may find they call less often because you’ve preemptively solved many potential problems. 

That’s when you’ll know you’ve built the two-way street needed to boost your legal department’s reputation in the organization. 

What is your legal department’s reputation in your organization?

Are you already taking steps to be proactive?

How many Davis Polk matches will Biglaw see today? Firms of all stripes are finally coming out of hiding to adopt the compensation leader’s brand new pay scale, and they can’t seem to match it quickly enough.

The latest entrant in the 2022 salary wars is Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, a firm ranked at No. 14 in the most recent Am Law 100. Having brought in $1,844,627,000 gross revenue in 2020, the firm can definitely afford these raises. Here’s what the DPW salary scale looks like at STB:



As a little cherry on top, Simpson seems to be taking this cash across the pond to its office in London, where English law qualified associates with sterling-based compensation will receive proportionate salary increases.

Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Simpson Thacher.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

# Biglaw Firm Shares The Love (Read: Cash) With More Than Just Associates

Everyone who has spent some time in Biglaw knows it takes more than just associates to make a successful firm. There’s an entire infrastructure in Biglaw, though sometimes, with all the excitement surrounding associate raises, it can be easy to forget that.

One firm that hasn’t forgotten all the people it takes is Sheppard Mullin. The firm recently announced a recognition bonus for staff attorneys and special counsel. The bonus will be equal to 8 percent of their annual salary and payable in November.

Let’s hope this becomes as big a trend as associate raises.

# Biglaw Raises Come To Texas
## Howdy! And welcome to the raise party!

Shares[](https://twitter.com/share?url=https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/baker-botts-compensation-23/&text=Biglaw%20Raises%20Come%20To%20Texas)[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/baker-botts-compensation-23/&display=popup&ref=plugin&src=share_button)[](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/baker-botts-compensation-23/)[](javascript:void(""#ea-share-count-email""))


Despite the flurry of Biglaw [raise announcements this week](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2023-associate-salary-increase/), there’s a [general suspicion](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/is-your-biglaw-firm-ill-positioned-to-match-cravaths-salary-raises/) that not every firm will be able to match. But it remains to be seen where that raise cutoff will land. Will the top 50 Biglaw firms all be able to easily match? The top 100? Will the raise haves and havenots be[ decided on geography](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/)?

Well, at least one firm isn’t letting location stop them from matching the top of the Biglaw compensation market. Baker Botts, a Texas-based firm with $752,495,000 in gross revenue last year, has brought the new Biglaw raises to the Lone Star State (and, of course, all seven of the firm’s U.S. offices). To be clear, other firms with offices in Texas have matched, but this is the first Texas-based firm Above the Law has heard of making $225,000 their new starting salary.

Effective January 1, the following compensation grid will be applied at Baker Botts:

Deem Date	Salary
2023	$225,000
2022	$235,000
2021	$260,000
2020	$310,000
2019	$365,000
2018	$390,000
2017	$420,000
2016+	$435,000
Plus there are bonuses at the firm, subject to the firm’s productivity and performance requirements, on the following scale:

Deem Date	Bonus Amount
2022	$20,000
2021	$30,000
2020	$57,500
2019	$75,000
2018	$90,000
2017	$105,000
2016+	$115,000
And as an extra thank you to the best associates, the firm will offer “enhanced bonuses” for “exceptional contributions.”

You can read the full memo on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/baker-botts-compensation-23/2/).

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# How To Cope With A Biglaw Partner Who's An Alcoholic
## The stressful, high-pressure environment of Biglaw is the dank puddle of water in which all sorts of nasty stuff is able to grow.

We spend quite a bit of time on this website documenting the problems that seem to plague the legal industry: alcoholism, [addiction issues](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/law-firm-life-is-terrible-for-your-health/), [depression](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/can-we-finally-talk-about-the-elephant-in-the-room-mental-health-of-lawyers/)… it doesn’t look good. The [stats](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/stat-of-the-week-lawyers-more-hungover-than-surgeons/) certainly bear that out, but so do the actual experiences of our readers. So the following question comes to us from a Biglaw associate schlepping in the service of a partner with a problem:

You should write about how to deal when the partner you work for is an alcoholic. I’m put in the position of constantly covering for this partner, and dealing with erratic behavior. My position at the firm is tenuous since it is in the hands of a man in a downward spiral.

That’s an excellent question. When dealing with issue of addiction, the majority of the coverage tends to focus on how to recognize that you need help or how to deal with a loved one with an issue. But the dynamic is different when it is your boss. You can’t just slip in a casual question about their consumption of alcohol no matter how sloppy they are when they come back from lunch.

It is important to recognize that there is nothing about the title of lawyer — or even partner — that somehow insulates them from the problems of addiction. And the stressful, high-pressure environment of Biglaw is the dank puddle of water in which all sorts of nasty stuff is able to grow.

While it is true that WebMD is mostly used for diagnosing yourself with the cancer you almost certainly do not have, it can also [provide](http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/features/high-functioning-alcoholic) some useful information:

A functional alcoholic might not act the way you would expect, [Sarah Allen Benton, a licensed mental health counselor and author of [Understanding the High-Functioning Alcoholic](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1442203900/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1442203900&linkCode=as2&tag=dealbreaker-20&linkId=53F3SNLSEXOFVVXR) (affiliate link),] says. You might think he’s responsible and productive because he works every day. He could even be high achieving or powerful. In fact, his success might lead people to overlook his drinking.

He could also be in denial about drinking. He might think, “‘I have a great job, pay my bills, and have lots of friends; therefore I am not an alcoholic,’” Benton says. Or he might make excuses like, “I only drink expensive wine” or “I haven’t lost everything or suffered setbacks because of drinking.”

An alcoholic lawyer’s office doesn’t have to smell like regret and bad decisions; the degrees on the wall, the deals closed, and the formidable book of business can all mask a real problem.

So what do you do if you find yourself on a case with someone you suspect has a problem? The advice that’s out there seems… out of touch within the context of a law firm. Take, for example, this [nugget](http://alcoholrehab.com/alcoholism/alcoholic-co-worker/):

It is often necessary to confront the co-worker with concerns about their behavior. This should occur in a non-judgmental and non-accusatory manner where only facts are presented. As well as mentioning the causes of concern, it is also helpful to offer possible solutions. This can be a good opportunity for co-workers to mention how people they know have dealt with alcohol problems by seeking help.

LOL. That would go over well at a law firm. Even if you were talking to a fellow associate rather than a dealing with the power dynamics of trying to confront a partner, the competitive and cutthroat environment of Biglaw means “a non-judgmental and non-accusatory manner” would be nearly impossible to achieve.

Even the [advice](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/03/23/is-your-boss-alcoholic-or-addict.html) geared toward having the awkward conversation with your boss, in this case written by Dr. Nicholas Kardaras, a professor at Stony Brook University’s Health Sciences Center, doesn’t read as particularly useful:

What can you do if your boss is indeed a closet drug addict? Depending on what kind of relationship you have with them, you can suggest that they get help. If they seem receptive, you can even help them find a good clinician or treatment program.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Nope. Still not happening.

If you don’t have that kind of relationship with your boss, you can alert Human Resources—while you may feel uncomfortable reporting your bosses problematic behavior, understand that addiction is a life and death issue and getting the addict help is of utmost importance.

This is still a difficult road. The relationship between HR and the partnership can be convoluted and the big players have been around a lot longer than you, a lowly associate; they have relationships with all the key players, and this may well be a known issue that the powers that be have decided to ignore. Think about this: Biglaw shops are frequently places that tolerate, or even lionize the “screamers” — people who are well-known in the firm for taking frustrations large and small out on their juniors — and all the attendant HR issues. If you have concerns or suspicions about a rainmaker’s ability to hold their liquor, how seriously will that really be taken?

So that leaves our reader in quite the quandary. I’d try to avoid working with that partner, perhaps seeking work from another partner in your group or developing a sudden interest in a different practice area. While this may not be a guarantee — and may have lasting repercussions on your career — it should be a band-aid on the problem.

And if your addicted boss is unwilling to get help? It may not be a bad idea to start sending out your resume, because there are few things worse than working for a boss with an untreated drug problem as it will eventually adversely affect your emotional and even physical well-being as well.

BOOM. Great advice. That’s the real deal, treat it like any other “bad boss” scenario. Even if there are moments when working for the addicted partner are a delight, it is a real risk that you’ll be collateral damage when the partner nears rock bottom. And while it might be nice to get a favor when the partner finally circles around to [Step 9](http://www.hazeldenbettyford.org/articles/making-amends-is-more-than-an-apology), the havoc it wreaks on your career isn’t worth it.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

The basis of some counterclaims is obvious: Maybe you actually wronged the other party. That would be a good reason for the other party to sue you.

Or maybe you have a 100-page, single-spaced contract, and both parties are obligated to do many things for the other. If you sue them, they’ll sue you back. That’s the way it works.

But human nature may reveal the less obvious bases for counterclaims.

Fire someone.

All of a sudden, that person is likely to realize that your joint engaged in rampant discrimination against the former employee’s protected class.

Fire someone.

If the person isn’t a member of a protected class, then the person will suddenly realize that people at your joint routinely violated the law, or breached the rules of ethics, or otherwise acted improperly.

It really doesn’t matter that the employee never mentioned ethics problems during the 20 years they worked for you.

I’m not talking about reality here; I’m talking about human nature.

File a collection action.

You’re about to get sued for malpractice.

I don’t care if the client seemed happy during your five-year retention. The client is about to become very unhappy with the work you did.

I’m not limiting my analysis to individuals. Have a corporation decide to eliminate someone’s job as a result of a reorganization. All of a sudden, everyone will start criticizing the eliminated employee’s performance. It doesn’t matter that this is a position elimination, and performance is irrelevant. It doesn’t matter that the employee always received a performance rating of “3,” suggesting that the employee’s performance was satisfactory. If the employee’s position has been eliminated, then the employee was no good. It’s human nature.

Consider the partner who leaves your law firm and goes to work for a competitor. Before the office door has swung shut, your colleagues will be scoffing: “Jarndyce — he was never any good anyway. I’m delighted he left.” (Others may be silently thinking: “Gee, I’m old enough to remember when Jarndyce was a good lawyer.” But they’ll never have the courage to speak up.)

When you’re considering the possibility of counterclaims, think about human nature.

Some counterclaims are based on the law, but many are based on primal instincts. Either way, you’ll have to pay for your defense.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Could The Worst Part About Biglaw Life Actually Change?
## The next evolution of Biglaw could make it more humane.

Working in Biglaw is not for the faint of heart. The hours are a beast, the work can be both challenging and tedious, and the management? Well, that’s laughable. [I’m on record](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/this-is-why-working-in-biglaw-sucks-so-hard/) as saying the lack of actual management skills or training is the very worst part of Biglaw. Putting a lawyer — yes, even a very smart lawyer — in charge of large groups of people with [no blueprint on how to manage them](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/lawyers-arent-necessarily-good-managers-so-why-do-we-let-them-manage-firms/) or real incentive to cultivate employee satisfaction is a recipe for disaster (or at least unhappiness).

The good news is that this might be changing. In a [detailed analysis](https://www.law360.com/articles/973592) for Law360, Peter Zeughauser argues that a new model of Biglaw partner compensation — spurred, in part, by the 2008 recession — that prioritizes collaborative teams is poised to take over the industry. While the details of Biglaw partner compensation can be [fuzzy](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/a-look-at-the-money-jones-day-partners-really-make/), the two main components of it are general origination — a partner’s book of business — and the hours they work. But that model is increasingly outdated. Clients are wisening up to the, ahem, inefficiencies of the [billable hour](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/should-law-firms-still-use-the-billable-hour/). Don’t get too excited, it isn’t happening tomorrow, but with more and more clients demanding alternative fee arrangements, something’s got to give.

Zeughauser sees a future Biglaw model where partners must work together to create high-functioning teams that must work together on a diverse set of client issues efficiently and effectively. No longer dependent on the plug-and-play faceless cogs in Biglaw to churn hours for the firm who are easily replaceable, the legal teams of the future are more curated and therefore associate satisfaction may actually become a priority:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Partners who can assemble, lead and work together on teams to land these matters are, of course, important. More so, partners who can lead and work together on a diverse team to produce an outcome that highly satisfies clients and meets or exceeds the client’s expectations for results and service at a cost that the client perceives to be aligned with value enough so to come back for another matter is a still more rare bird. And, the rarest bird of all is a partner who can do this at a level of profitability that enables the firm to attract, train and retain more partners who can repeatedly perform the same trick. In an era of flat demand, aligning partner metrics for success so that compensation is tied to successful teamwork and collaboration will likely differentiate winners from languishers and losers.

Movement toward a compensation model that rewards collaboration and leadership of highly successful collaborative teams and away from the book-of-business model has evidenced itself in the increased level of discussion and focus in firms and the industry about matter profitability.

Woo-hoo! The new metric for partner compensation Zeughauser identifies seems designed to appeal to millennials — and well, any employee who isn’t a robot — and attorney satisfaction actually makes the list:

- Client satisfaction, including with results, cost, service, and ease of use
- Client profitability, retention, and growth across the firm’s platform
- Partner profitability
- Matter profitability
- Associate profitability
- Attorney satisfaction
- Attorney skills (soft and technical)
Partners’ paychecks tied to (even in some small way) the notion that the associates who work for them have to be treated like real life people. That’s so revolutionary it might just work.

In this episode, I welcome [Michelle Kallen](https://www.jenner.com/en/people/michelle-s-kallen), a Partner at Jenner & Block, and we speak about her journey to becoming an appellate lawyer. She explains that the more she learned about law, the more she was drawn to the field. She then goes on to talk about the appellate practice and how it can be a difficult one to enter. Finally, Michelle shares her advice on how to get into the field of appellate law, including the importance of continuing to educate yourself on the legal field.



The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

# From The Obvious Files: Male Biglaw Partners Make More Than Female Ones
## Are you surprised?

This sh*t isn’t even surprising anymore. Amid a backdrop of lawsuits filed by women partners at Biglaw firms alleging pay discrimination comes a new survey from Major, Lindsey & Africa that indicates male partners average a whopping 44% more in compensation than their female colleagues. Male partners are averaging $949,000 while female partners make about $659,000.

The inequity is largely masked in their objective-seeming, origination-based compensation, as[ noted by](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/10/12/male-partners-make-44-percent-more-than-women-survey-shows/) Law.com:

Much of the inequity is due to origination, said Jeffrey Lowe, managing partner in Major, Lindsey & Africa’s Washington, D.C., office and author of the study. On the survey, male partners reported average origination of $2.59 million, and female partners $1.73 million. Origination and working attorney receipts have become the main determinants of partner compensation, he said.

“That’s the crux of the issue: Why are men generating more business than women?” Lowe said. “Is there some boys club aspect or not?”

Though it should be noted the disparity does seem to slowly be decreasing — in the 2014 survey, men made 47% more — it is also true that dissatisfaction with compensation is growing among women as well.

The percentage of women partners who are dissatisfied with their compensation has grown, according to the Major, Lindsey & Africa survey. In 2016, 8 percent of women said they were not at all satisfied with their compensation, compared to 5 percent in 2014. Nineteen percent of the women partners said they were not very satisfied. But 27 percent said they were very satisfied, which showed an increase from 23 percent in 2014. Forty-six percent said they were somewhat satisfied.

It may seem like the very pinnacle of first-world problems to complain about a high six-figure salary, and to some extent that is true — this issue will never be as poignant as more dire examples of inequality. But the sheer scale of the shortchanging here really drives home how much work remains to be done.

# Covington Reportedly Paying Settlement Over Leak Of Les Moonves Sexual Misconduct Report

Covington was one of two Biglaw firms — the other being Debevoise & Plimpton — that wrote a 59-page report detailing the results of an internal investigation, done on behalf of CBS, into the sexual misconduct allegations against former CEO Les Moonves. Then, in December of 2018, a draft of the report was leaked to The New York Times. Now, CNBC [is reporting](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/14/moonves-drops-legal-pursuit-to-recoup-120-million-cbs-severance-package.html) that Covington is on the hook for a settlement with Moonves.

According to reports, it was found that Covington failed to protect the identities of witnesses interviewed during the course of the investigation. The settlement is [thought to be](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/03/bombshell-cbs-investigation-leak-caused-multimillion-dollar-settlement) in the low eight figures, and the parties have confirmed at least some of the details, as [reported by](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/05/17/reports-say-covington-paid-settlement-to-moonves-over-alleged-breach-of-confidentiality/) Law.com:

CBS and Moonves issued a joint statement on May 14 saying “Leslie Moonves, CBS and a contractor to CBS have​ resolved their disputes” and that “The cost of the settlement will be borne by the contractor. Mr. Moonves has decided to contribute the entire settlement amount to various charities. There will be no further comment regarding this settlement by Mr. Moonves or CBS.”

Moonves has also dropped his lawsuit against CBS seeking $120 million in severance.

Lest you think the other Biglaw firm that was part of the investigation may be the “contractor” bearing the cost of the settlement, Debevoise has a statement of their own:

Debevoise issued a statement that the firm “is not party to any agreements with any parties concerning its work for CBS, and no one connected to the firm leaked any confidential information related to our work for CBS.”

Covington has, thus far, remained surprisingly mum on the issue.

In the ever-evolving legal technology landscape, the journey to innovation is both exhilarating and daunting. Central to this journey is the discovery of use cases, a process that melds the art of understanding human needs with the science of applying technology. This crucial step is not merely about adopting new tools; it’s about uncovering the precise ways these tools can transform the legal profession for the better. It’s about finding the gold in a vast landscape of possibilities.

The Dual Pathways To Discovery

Uncovering use cases in legal tech follows two main pathways: serendipitous discovery and deliberate design. Each pathway has its merits, challenges, and strategies for success.

Serendipitous Discovery: Embracing The Unexpected

Serendipity plays a fascinating role in the evolution of legal tech. It represents the unexpected discoveries that occur when legal professionals interact with technology in unanticipated ways. These moments of serendipity can lead to innovative applications of technology not initially envisaged by developers.

- Cultivate An Environment For Exploration: Encouraging legal professionals to explore and experiment with technology can spark serendipitous discoveries. This requires creating a culture that values innovation and allows trial and error.
- Observation And Feedback: Collecting feedback and observing how legal professionals use technology daily can highlight unexpected use cases. These insights can guide the refinement and development of legal tech tools.
Deliberate Design: Crafting With Purpose

While serendipity relies on chance, deliberate design is a structured approach to identifying use cases. It involves systematically examining legal workflows, pain points, and opportunities for improvement.

- Collaborative Workshops: Involving legal professionals, technologists, and clients for ideation sessions can unearth specific needs and innovative solutions. These workshops facilitate a deep dive into the challenges and opportunities within legal processes.
- Needs Analysis And Process Mapping: Analyzing existing workflows and identifying inefficiencies or areas for enhancement can reveal potential use cases. This methodical approach ensures that technology addresses real and significant needs.
The Interplay Of Art And Science

The discovery of use cases in legal tech is an interplay between the art of understanding human behavior and the science of technological application. It requires a nuanced appreciation of the legal profession’s complexities and a solid grasp of technology’s capabilities.

Leveraging Data And Analytics

Data and analytics play a crucial role in serendipitous discovery and deliberate design. Legal tech developers can gain insights into effective and potentially transformative use cases by analyzing usage patterns, performance metrics, and user feedback.

User-Centric Design Thinking

At the core of discovering use cases is the principle of user-centric design. This approach focuses on empathizing with the end-users — legal professionals and their clients — to ensure that technology solutions are accessible, intuitive, and impactful.

Navigating The Challenges

Despite the potential for innovation, the discovery of use cases has challenges. These include overcoming resistance to change, bridging the gap between legal professionals and technologists, and ensuring that discovered use cases align with ethical standards and regulatory compliance.

A Continuous Journey

The discovery of use cases in legal tech is a continuous journey, not a destination. As the legal profession evolves and new technologies emerge, the landscape of potential use cases will also change. Staying agile, keeping the lines of communication open, and fostering a culture of innovation are crucial to navigating this ever-changing terrain.

The Path Forward

In the quest to harness the power of legal technology, the discovery of use cases is a critical milestone. It represents the convergence of possibility and practicality, where the potential of technology meets the real-world needs of the legal profession. By embracing serendipitous discovery and deliberate design, we can uncover not just any use cases. Still, the correct use cases drive meaningful change, enhance the practice of law, and ultimately serve the cause of justice more effectively.

# Weil Gotshal Has A Big, Big MeToo Problem
## Yeah, this seems like material information.

Sometimes when you’re representing a company, it can be a challenge to remember that your client is the board and not the individual occupying the CEO job that you might work with day-to-day. It shouldn’t be a challenge of course, but it apparently can be a real struggle for some lawyers.

Maybe invest in a Post-It note if you need it.

According to the New York Times, CBS board members are hopping mad that Weil Gotshal and partner Michael Aiello failed to keep this relationship straight and could end up costing them big. Moonves was unceremoniously shitcanned over sexual harassment allegations earlier this year, triggering a hefty severance package unless the board can prove that he misled the company in its internal inquiries. That’s where Weil comes in:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Squarely in the middle of that question is Michael Aiello, who leads the corporate department at the law firm Weil Gotshal & Manges. Mr. Aiello advised CBS’s independent directors amid those investigations. And, at the request of two members of the board’s nominating and governance committee, questioned Mr. Moonves by telephone in January about whether he, and therefore the company, had a #MeToo problem.

A lawyer for Mr. Moonves and other Weil Gotshal lawyers representing the board members were listening to that interview and taking notes. According to the four people, both sets of notes say Mr. Moonves disclosed that a police complaint had been filed against him last year by a woman who said he had sexually assaulted her. (The police complaint was pending when Mr. Aiello interviewed Mr. Moonves, but it was later dropped because the statute of limitations had expired.)

Mr. Moonves also told Mr. Aiello that an actress’s manager had privately contacted Mr. Moonves and had accused him of sexually assaulting the actress, the four people said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the active legal matter.

That sounds like a cooperative CEO. Certainly, Aiello advised the nominating and governance committee — his client — about this. No? Well then!

Yes, apparently Aiello advised the board that there had been some “rebuffed advances” in the distant past but nothing to presently worry about. Unfortunately, one year is hardly the “distant past” and, as NYU’s ethics guru Stephen Gillers points out, even a dropped complaint is material information that the committee needed to properly evaluate the whole picture.

Sources for the Times claim that the board relied on Weil’s clean bill of health and now finds itself against a wall in trying to prove they fired Moonves for cause given his candor with the committee’s attorney. That’s could amount to $120 million, or roughly the cost of an episode of the entertainment abortion called The Big Bang Theory.

For its part, Weil Gotshal is saying they stand by their advice but cannot go into details because of confidentiality and privilege. We’ll see how long those stay unwaived when the board comes looking for their money back.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs.

# Morning Docket: 10.29.18
## * Robert Bowers, the suspect in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting that left 11 dead and six wounded, has been charged with 29 federal criminal counts including hate crimes and using a firearm to commit murder and 36 state criminal counts including homicide and ethnic intimidation. Our thoughts are with the family and friends of those who lost their lives this weekend. [[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/27/us/active-shooter-pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting.html)] * According to the criminal complaint filed against Cesar Sayoc, the pipe bomb he allegedly tried to mail to former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder was addressed to his office at a ""certain law firm"" -- a certain law firm that's better known as Covington & Burling. Good thing the package never made it there. [[National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/10/26/complaint-bomb-targeting-holder-was-addressed-to-dc-law-firm-office/)] * When asked to reflect on the misconduct allegations against Yale Law School Professor Jed Rubenfeld, alumni from the school are not the least bit shocked. ""It was not a surprise to basically any woman in my class that this investigation is going on,"" said one 2015 graduate. Will the school take appropriate action? [[Yale Daily News](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2018/10/26/yls-alumni-reflect-on-rubenfeld-allegations/)] * Partners from Allen & Overy and O'Melveny & Myers are cozying up to each other as merger talks between the two firms continue, but there may be trouble in paradise. ""There is some opposition in London,"" said a former A&O partner, ""but it’s fairly disorganised—there’s a lot of moaning but nobody leading a charge."" [[International](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/10/26/allen-overy-and-omelveny-partners-meet-as-merger-inches-closer-396-8484/)] * In case you missed it, after the involuntary revocation of its accreditation, Arizona Summit Law School will eventually close its doors. But first, the school must finalize a teach-out plan for its remaining students, and when it's all over, ""that would be the life of the school."" What a sad little life. Farewell to AZ Summit Law. [[Arizona Republic](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-education/2018/10/25/arizona-summit-law-school-details-plans-close-its-doors/1763964002/)] * You might not have known it, but the Michigan State University College of Law has been operating as a private school for all these years. Soon, the school will be fully integrated into the university, and you know what that means: in-state tuition costs will be coming to the MSU Law. Congratulations! [[Lansing State Journal](https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/local/2018/10/26/msu-law-school-engler/1764114002/)] * RBG is my Patronus, and a course on Harry Potter and the Law is coming to a law school near you -- if you live in India, that is. The National University of Juridical Sciences will be teaching the class, and muggles students are ""expected [to] have already read all the books at least twice, if not more.""

* You might not have known it, but the Michigan State University College of Law has been operating as a private school for all these years. Soon, the school will be fully integrated into the university, and you know what that means: in-state tuition costs will be coming to the MSU Law. Congratulations!

* RBG is my Patronus, and a course on Harry Potter and the Law is coming to a law school near you — if you live in India, that is. The National University of Juridical Sciences will be teaching the class, and muggles students are “expected [to] have already read all the books at least twice, if not more.” [[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/25/indian-law-school-offers-course-harry-potter-universe)]

# Clients Shouldn't Automatically Fire Attorneys After A Bad Outcome
## Besides the inefficiencies of new counsel getting up to speed on the case, switching lawyers can be seen as a sign of weakness.

No one likes to get bad news, especially if that someone is paying tons of money for services aimed at protecting the interests of an individual or business. Even the best lawyers will lose motions or entire cases either because the facts are bad for their client, the law is against them, or for numerous other reasons. When a client receives a bad outcome during a representation, their first instinct might be to fire the lawyer that represented them when that bad outcome materialized. However, unless the lawyer really messed up in a representation, clients should not automatically terminate counsel.

Earlier in my career, I was working on a high-stakes matter involving complicated legal issues. My adversary, along with being a nice guy, was also a very competent lawyer. He prepared solid papers for a motion that we argued, and he definitely presented the best arguments for his client. I also did my best when preparing papers so that my client advanced the best arguments for why they should win on a given issue.

Eventually, my adversary lost the motion. This was not due to insufficiencies with my adversary’s legal arguments. More likely, as explained in the court’s decision, this was due to the court deciding to rule on the matter using reasoning that neither of us had spent too much time briefing in our papers. I spoke to my adversary after the decision came down, and I could tell that something was brewing on his end, since he was delaying taking the next steps in the case, and he was being evasive about what his client was thinking about how to proceed with this matter.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Out of the blue one day, I got a notification that my adversary had been fired from the case and that a new lawyer was taking over. I was frustrated by this development, since I had created a solid amount of rapport with my original adversary, which could go a long way toward reaching a resolution in the matter, and I would need to start from scratch with new counsel. I also knew that when a lawyer takes over a case from predecessor counsel, they have a tendency to make big moves to show to the client that it was correct to terminate prior counsel and hire the new lawyer.

Eventually, the new lawyer filed papers in the case. Those papers were solid but not stellar. I wonder how much time the new lawyer needed to spend to get up to speed on the matter and replace the understanding of the case that was simply known by predecessor counsel since he had been involved in the matter since its inception. It was not altogether clear to me that the new lawyer did any better job than predecessor counsel, and there were definitely inefficiencies associated with having new counsel parachute into a case that had been pending for some time when the substitution of counsel was made.

As the old saying goes, you shouldn’t change horses midstream, and as detailed in prior articles, there are [many issues with replacing counsel in the middle of a representation](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/clients-and-lawyers-should-be-wary-of-changing-attorneys/). Besides inefficiencies, it typically does not look good, since this can indicate turmoil with a litigant, and this could also be a sign of weakness. Moreover, substituting counsel almost always means that a client will need to pay more money in legal costs than if they kept their original counsel. This is because replacement counsel will need to spend time reviewing case materials and getting up to speed on the happenings of a representation.

This is not to say that clients should never replace the lawyers that they originally hired to handle a matter. There are, indeed, very good reasons to substitute counsel in a variety of circumstances. Some lawyers are just bad, and they should be replaced with more competent counsel who can better represent a client. Moreover, clients might not have a solid working relationship with some lawyers, and they might be better off working with counsel with whom they have a better connection. However, client should rarely substitute counsel merely because they received a negative decision, since the outcome could have been due to circumstances beyond the lawyer’s control, and this does not necessarily mean the lawyer cannot adequately represent a client.

Above the Law is putting together our fourth annual [list](https://abovethelaw.com/top-outside-counsel-2020/) of the best law firms, according to you, the in-house counsel who have to work with them.

There are myriad ways of rating and ranking law firms, from deal tables to “profits-per-partner” to “prestige.” But there is no more crucial issue to firms than what clients — or potential clients — think of them. For Biglaw firms, the clients that truly matter are GCs and legal departments at America’s top companies.

So, in-house counsel, please give us your input. Please take this very brief [survey](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_e8MutYkqn3mdW29) and tell us which outside firms you use, and why they’re great (or… not).

# DLA Piper Makes Major Money Moves With Its Bonus Announcement, And Associates Are Thrilled
## No more black-box bonuses at this Biglaw firm!

Well, well, well, what do have we here? Could it be? Is it … a Cravath match? Yes, finally. And not only is it a Cravath match, but it’s a “Cravath Match+” (a new term, let’s go with it) from a firm that used to issue black-box bonuses.

Welcome to December, Biglaw!

DLA Piper — a Biglaw behemoth that brought in $3,133,829,000 gross revenue in 2020, putting it in 3rd place in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — announced bonuses earlier this afternoon, and associates are quite pleased. This is a major change from last year, when associates described the firm’s year-end bonuses as [“absolute horseshit.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/dla-piper-bonuses-2020/)

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In 2021, DLA Piper is matching the Cravath scale, and offering even more money on top for associates who really went above and beyond during 2021. But wait, there’s more. The firm is decreasing its “production hours” threshold from 150 to 100 hours and making adjustments to its incremental hours bonus increases, upping them from 2020 levels and escalating them on a cumulative basis.

As co-managing U.S. partners Jackie Park and Rick Chesley note in the firm’s bonus memo, “The net effect of these modifications are potential bonus awards for our highest-rated and most productive associates of up to 50 percent or more overmarket.” Yowza! Here’s what the bonus scale looks like at DLA Piper:



We weren’t kidding when we said associates were pleased with the firm’s money moves this year. Here’s what a few of them had to say about DLA Piper’s bonuses.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
- “Great to see this kind of transparency from a firm that has been pretty black box in the past. And yes, DLA associates in Phoenix are making at least as much as Cravath associates in NYC.”
- “We received our bonus announcement today, and I cannot overstate how pleasantly surprised we all are. As many will recall, we took a hit last year with the way bonuses were rolled out. The firm listened and adjusted. Normally, our bonuses are never announced until mid-January at the earliest and often the system is not transparent. Times have changed. We are now clearly a market plus firm. The management is not just talking the talk about being elite and competing with the best. We are now walking the walk.”
- “We are a firm on the rise that wants to and is competing with the elite, and this reflects that reality. Associates are thrilled at how management has adjusted from last year. The firm has been doing great and this just reaffirms to everyone that this is a great place to be moving forward. Tremendous job by our leadership.”
Congratulations to everyone at DLA Piper for finally escaping the black box and cashing in on these hefty bonus awards. Well done!

# A Detailed Breakdown Of The 2022 Am Law 100 Rankings
## So how did Biglaw do in 2021, coming off its shockingly strong performance in 2020? In short: better. A lot better.

So how did Biglaw do in 2021, coming off its shockingly strong [performance in 2020](https://laterallink.com/a-deep-dive-into-the-2021-am-law-100-rankings/)? In short: better. A lot better. Based on the financial metrics reported this week in the [latest edition](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/04/26/the-2022-am-law-100-report/) of the Am Law 100, the recent round of Biglaw salary increases makes perfect sense. Sure, most firms achieved record gross revenue, revenue per lawyer, and profits per equity partner. But that’s true in a typical good year. What made 2021 such a blowout is that many firms dramatically accelerated their growth rates on those metrics as compared to 2020 — a year that was itself hailed as a stunning success. Any way you look at it, 2021 was truly a year to remember for the Biglaw elite.

Collectively, here’s what the [Am Law 100 achieved](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/04/26/the-am-law-100-caught-a-wave-in-2021-but-sustaining-the-ride-will-be-a-challenge/) in 2021 (as noted by Patrick Smith in his summary of the data):

- Total revenue: $127.4 billion, up by 14.8%.
- Average revenue per lawyer: $1.18 million, up by 12.5%.
- Profits per equity partner: $2.66 million, up by 19.4%.
To appreciate just how good those growth rates are, let’s compare them to the strong growth of 2020 and the more typical rates in 2019:

[](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WJqnobFdCmjyd4VEBqtFdQ_ECufuAyKdWcMO4mvPvBDHIqliiqq0XOJeWYbQbWbNCjgGvXyqVdrlojSYJeteoaJcrX8rSNhUixmDC0raTvrkZZopphHAWmlD_HTHOfUDAXilm8bW)
Part of the impressive profit growth can be explained by attorneys working harder. Based on data from the 61 firms that submitted billing figures to the American Lawyer, hours billed [rose 5.7%](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/04/26/lawyers-burned-the-candle-at-both-ends-in-2021-faltering-demand-could-cost-jobs-anyway/) relative to 2020. Meanwhile, headcount in the Am Law 100 was up just 2.1%. As we at Lateral Link can attest, firms were eager to add talent in 2021, but growing the ranks was a challenge in the face of intense competition.

Let’s now take a closer look at the three key metrics — gross revenue, revenue per lawyer, and profits per equity partner — and the top 10 firms in each category.

Gross Revenue

Here are the top 10 firms in the 2022 Am Law 100 rankings, ranked by their gross revenue in 2021. You can access the full list [here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/04/26/the-2022-am-law-100-ranked-by-gross-revenue/).

[](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/x713VCzfTc6z7kMYqSkFvXZpNKKE5IfYwe-u47bIz9xmrICnGeErAmrNGZfYhPEALAb6nJ3N81Q1FPY-vIwnitkuZUVcWAW0ktuKjuLlz7Xmn8KEEYzW9qHY_3mkQQFjGDjkXUda)
Kirkland & Ellis and Latham & Watkins once again led the pack, not only maintaining their #1 and #2 slots but also increasing revenue at faster rates than the other top 10 firms. The composition of the top group was fairly stable, with Ropes & Gray riding a 22% growth rate into the top 10 and Jones Day falling out of it, despite increasing revenue by 10%.

Revenue growth was strong across the board, with every Am Law 100 firm enjoying an increase (as compared to 26 firms that suffered revenue declines in 2020). Remarkably, 63 firms increased revenue by at least 10% and 18 were up by at least 20%.

Revenue Per Lawyer

Here are the top 10 firms in the 2022 Am Law 100 rankings based on revenue per lawyer. You can access the full list [here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/04/26/the-2022-am-law-100-ranked-by-revenue-per-lawyer/).

[](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/mNR4G8xSS0Q-ttqBvvySpyRegw4R2kAj7oy8cj7yk9G5ioigwCtlIby-ozEB_a5CiCKjzPRuyb8RNjS3Tha8-s5ftI6yHACsy4zmSCWu5EhtJNfG-d90FXgrXiE2MmJP0cnMw0qt)
Seven of the top 10 firms increased revenue per lawyer by double digits (as compared to four in 2020). Once again, Wachtell and Sullivan & Cromwell took the top two spots. Davis Polk cooled somewhat after its market-leading 22% RPL growth in 2020. Cravath impressed with its rise from from #10 to #3 (mirroring the jump that Davis Polk achieved in 2020). Quinn Emanuel and Paul, Weiss ascended into the top 10, displacing Cahill Gordon and Debevoise.

Profits Per Equity Partner

And finally, everyone’s favorite ranking: the top 10 firms by profits per equity partner. You can access the full list [here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/04/26/the-2022-am-law-100-ranked-by-profits-per-equity-partner/).

[](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/OT5EcOKfxh9cOnzw1nkUSv6dm2HQoJhIep1Ou605ZdOgZQGHi7hRuPn9rEdWBwUU2Ap45oXvaBmgwlt1NcY1AXD4eVrQEg1uYHDNjOYetaoUa1ZrwfeAePRqvryIRFTIv1l58nbS)
As always, Wachtell tops the list, this year exceeding $8 million in PPEP for the first time. Kirkland and Davis Polk each cracked the $7 million mark. Sullivan & Cromwell leapfrogged Paul, Weiss and Simpson Thacher to claim the #4 slot. Broadly speaking, the top 10 was fairly stable: the only firm to drop out was Debevoise, which grew PPEP by 10% but was no match for Latham’s 26% growth.

Overall, 14 firms now have profits per equity partner above $5 million (compared to six in 2020). Consistent with the long-running “rich get richer” theme in Biglaw, PPEP growth was strongest at the top of the Am Law 100. Whereas the top quartile increased PPEP by 22.7%, the bottom quartile of the Am Law 100 managed only a 7.7% increase. Still, no matter where their firm stood in the rankings, most Am Law 100 partners would be hard pressed to complain about 2021.

# Teased Law Firm Merger Fizzles
## Law firms Brexit each other.

Back in October, Womble Bond Dickinson and BDB Pitmans informed the world that they were in the midst of merger talks. The merger of UK-based firms — which would’ve been the second in a decade for Womble, the product of the transatlantic tie-up between Bond Dickinson and Womble Carlyle — [would’ve created a new £440 million firm](https://www.legalcheek.com/2022/10/womble-bond-dickinson-in-merger-talks-with-bdb-pitmans/) that we desperately hoped would be named WBDBDB.

A joint statement from the firms:

Womble Bond Dickinson and BDB Pitmans announce today that they have decided not to proceed further with their proposed merger. After extensive discussions on the combined proposition, both firms have decided that the best path forward is to remain independent of each other. Excellent relationships have been established and the firms will continue to work closely together in the future.

Maybe the real mergers are the friends you make along the way.

We’d heard that UK firms were starting to realize that [they needed to do some serious merging if they wanted to remain competitive](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/magic-circle-firms-must-pull-rabbit-out-of-hat-to-stay-competitive-with-u-s-firms/). Mergers can fall apart for a lot of reasons, but given that backdrop, it’s interesting that the firms opted against this one.

A general sign of cooling interest, or a one-off speedbump in the industry merger race? We’ll see.

Biglaw firms across the country are implementing all manner of initiatives to bring attention to the importance of diversity and inclusion among their ranks. We’ve previously acknowledged [Dorsey & Whitney](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/biglaw-firm-introduces-diversity-hours-that-count-toward-associate-billable-requirements/), [Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/care-about-biglaw-diversity-well-now-you-can-bill-for-it/), [Reed Smith](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/the-first-biglaw-firm-to-offer-billable-diversity-hours-for-all-timekeepers/), [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/top-25-biglaw-firm-offers-bonus-eligible-diversity-inclusion-billable-hours/), and [Baker McKenzie](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/top-5-biglaw-firm-raises-the-bar-on-billable-diversity-inclusion-hours/) as firms where approved diversity and inclusion-related work will be billable for attorneys and will count toward bonus thresholds. We’ve just received word that yet another leading law firm has had a successful program like this that’s been quietly running since 2020 — and this firm is offering one of the highest number of billable diversity and inclusion hours we’ve heard of yet.

Ropes & Gray — a firm that brought in $1,903,616,000 gross revenue in 2019, placing it 13th in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — rolled out two new policies in 2020 to encourage increased efforts in the recruitment, retention, and advancement of those who are racially and ethnically diverse, LGBTQ+, and/or women, as well as those with disabilities.

Ropes not only has a 20-hour annual commitment for all lawyers related to advancing diversity, but the firm also offers up to 100 hours of billable credits to associates and counsel for diversity, equity, and inclusion activities. Those hours count towards the 20-hour commitment. Here’s what David Djaha, the firm’s managing partner, said about the initiative in a firmwide memo:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
At Ropes & Gray, our culture of excellence extends to everything we do as a firm. A core part of that culture of excellence—and of being an active Ropes & Gray citizen—is bringing to our efforts to create a more diverse, equitable and welcoming community the same enthusiasm and urgency we bring to our service to clients. To do the work of diversity, equity and inclusion effectively, each of us must be involved and each of us must be committed to its success.

Congratulations to Ropes & Gray on its commitment to diversity, and for offering its attorneys a way to create a more inclusive workplace. The firm’s diversity billables are just shy of Baker McKenzie’s 125-hour offering, but double the offerings of all other firms, placing it near the top of the heap when it comes to Biglaw firms’ dedication to equity in the profession. Which firms will be the next to step up and do what’s right?

What Am Law 100 firm had the attorney who billed the most hours in 2017, according to the most recent Am Law data?

Hint: The nameless attorney billed 3,597 last year.

# Guess Which Biglaw Firm Won The Former Congressman Lottery

Bill Shuster and Joe Crowley

Former House of Representative members Joseph Crowley (D-New York) and Bill Shuster (R-Pennsylvania) are Biglaw bound. The pair have decided to team up for their next career move, and this morning it was announced they’d be heading to Squire Patton Boggs, to the global public policy practice.

Crowley famously lost his primary race to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez after 20 years of representing New York’s 14th District. Shuster retired from his Pennsylvania seat in 2018. Their decision to move to the private sector together fueled [speculation](https://www.axios.com/bill-shuster-joe-crowley-congress-bipartisan-cb57bcdd-c752-47b4-b5ef-4e74191e0cee.html) about where they’d wind up. It looks like the bipartisan lobbying practice at Squire Patton Boggs — which boasts an impressive roster of former politicians including House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Mississippi), Senator John Breaux (D-Louisiana), and Democratic former Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater — did the trick for the pair.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As [reported by](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2019/02/19/squire-patton-boggs-snags-former-congressmen-crowley-and-shuster/) Law.com, Crowley and Shuster made appropriate statements about looking forward to the next stage of their careers at Squire Patton Boggs:

“We were honored to hear from many of the great firms in town since leaving Congress, and chose what we think is the very best place to continue our careers,” Crowley said in a statement. “Serving in Congress was an honor of a lifetime and I look forward to working on many of the same issues in this new role.”

…..

“Joining Squire Patton Boggs gives Joe and me an opportunity to work with the best in the business on tackling some of our nation’s most pressing needs, including prioritizing an infrastructure agenda,” Shuster said in a statement.

The firm’s public policy practice is led by Lott and Breaux, who issued a joint statement on the new hires, calling the pickup a “blockbuster addition” for Squire Patton Boggs.

# Am Law 100 Firm Completely Eliminates Its COVID-19 Austerity Measures
## This is great news for the firm.

Despite the fact that the second wave of the coronavirus crisis seems to be afoot, one by one, Biglaw firms are continuing to roll back their COVID-19 austerity measures. Cash seems to have been easy to come by for the most successful law firms during the pandemic, so why not?

Today, we have good news from Fox Rothschild, a firm that brought in $555,000,000 in gross revenue in 2019, placing it at No. 69 on the latest Am Law 100 ranking. Back in April, the firm announced that [salaries would be slashed](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-goes-with-good-news-bad-news-approach-to-covid-19-austerity-measures/) across the board, from partners to staff members. Specifically, a tiered salary reduction of between 10 percent and 15 percent for all attorneys and staff making more than $100,000 would take effect in May, while partners would reduce their monthly draws between 10 percent and 20 percent. At the same time, the firm announced that no layoffs would take place (but we have a feeling that the [“productivity and performance-related dismissals”](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/reports-of-associate-stealth-layoffs-at-am-law-100-firm/) that occurred were likely stealth layoffs). In September, half of the cuts made to partners’ monthly draws were restored and half of the reductions to attorney and staff salaries were also restored. Now, all of these cuts are finally coming to an end.

In an announcement made earlier this week, firmwide managing partner Mark Morris said that effective November 1, monthly equity partner draws will be fully restored prospectively, and effective November 5, compensation reductions for all attorneys and staff will be fully restored prospectively. Here is a statement we received from Morris regarding the firm’s most recent salary updates:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Like many other law firms throughout the country, Fox Rothschild has spent this year confronting and addressing the economic challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the past seven months, we have continually evaluated our situation to ensure we maintained financial flexibility and remained in the best position possible to serve our clients and provide the strategy and support they need to navigate these uncertain times.

Upon our most recent financial assessment, we are pleased to announce that we are able to rescind the austerity measures we implemented earlier this year.

We appreciate that many of our attorneys and staff have overcome significant obstacles during the past seven months and made sacrifices in many aspects of their lives, and they have done so while serving our clients and the firm with the highest degree of professionalism, poise and perseverance. While the uncertainty and economic impact of the pandemic will likely remain with us for the foreseeable future, I am confident that we will continue to forge ahead and provide our clients, and each other, with the services and support needed during these trying times.

Congratulations to everyone at Fox Rothschild on the positive salary news.

# NetDocuments Unveils PatternBuilder To Automate Expertise
## This would save a lot of time.

They say that insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. That definition probably wouldn’t satisfy a psychologist, but comes pretty close to describing the modern practice of law. Attorneys open the computer every morning and start trying to efficiently transform well-worn models into client-specific solutions and finding everything is just that little bit off the existing model and before they realize it, they’ve put in enough time that they might as well have started the document from scratch.

But automation can turn those static models into dynamic frameworks.

PatternBuilder, a new application natively integrated into the NetDocuments platform, offers a no-code solution for lawyers and legal teams to build automation out of their own expertise and processes. The product launches this morning and will be an add-on within the DELIVER solution — which also means the app works with all the existing NetDocuments features including all the platform’s security and compliance tools.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“Our customers are asking their technology providers different types of questions compared to just a few years ago. They are increasingly looking to scale their business and seek a competitive edge, which means automating and streamlining document processes and workflows,” stated Josh Baxter, NetDocuments CEO. “PatternBuilder is our answer. Built directly into the NetDocuments platform, organizations of all sizes will be able to leverage this new capability while inheriting all of the security, governance and accessibility benefits of being in the cloud.”

This should go without saying, but this isn’t a “fancy mail merge” that lets lawyers quickly swap in names and numbers. PatternBuilder can add entire clauses using conditional logic.

Take an executive employment agreement. The app will ask for the name and address, but will also ask other pertinent questions you set up. Could there be stock options? If so, build this into the app:

When you get to that area of the form it will ask about stock options and if that’s part of the deal it inserts this clause and asks for necessary additional information. If not, it skips right on by. And if you’re not keen on numbers, the system has a built-in logic engine that assists in turning user inputs to perform advanced calculations for issuing stock options — or applying tax regulations, calculating income eligibility, or computing risk scores.

Instead of looking for the model that addresses every specific scenario, just add everything into the decision tree and the system is ready to produce repeatable and error-free drafts for any situation.

As NetDocuments put it, “users can build online forms to capture data, execute calculations for on-the-fly number-crunching, and even automate completion of third-party PDFs for commonly used government and corporate forms.”

That last bit is particularly cool.

That’s scanning in the government’s I-9 form and turning it into a template so it can be populated automatically too. Because PatternBuilder allows for the creation of document sets so a single workflow can automate all the documents required. The system can connect approvals and reviews through automations too.

Breaking the cycle of constantly trying to square peg round hole static models is the lawyerly dream. NetDocuments seems to have a solution to this insanity with PatternBuilder.
