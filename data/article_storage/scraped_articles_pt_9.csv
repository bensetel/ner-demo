# Admitting That You've Done The Very Best You Can Do

Maybe you have this in common with me: In high school, you didn’t study very much.

On reflection, this was to manufacture an excuse. If you got an “A” on the test without having studied, that was great. If you didn’t get an “A,” you had an excuse: “If I’d bothered to study, I would have gotten an ‘A.'”

That same attitude carries over into the law.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
As an associate who had just moved laterally from a small firm to a big one, I was nervous: “These big firm guys might be really good. Suppose my very best work isn’t up to par?”

I knew I had to knock the ball out of the park to convince the new guys I was trustworthy. So I overworked stuff: To ensure that my work product was up to snuff, I put too much time into each of the first few projects that I was given. I figured that people would come to respect the quality of my work, and no one cared about the amount of time I put into a project. (When the time comes to make partner, people are thinking: “Do I want to have that guy with me or against me?” They are not thinking: “How quickly did he do the project?” Or, as one of my former partners put it, decades later: “No one ever failed to make partner at this firm by being too conscientious.”)

So I put too much time into drafting one brief. I fired off every last neuron ginning up arguments; I polished the prose until it glittered. And then, to hedge my bets, I left the draft on the partner’s chair with a note: “Here’s an early first draft of the brief, just to give you a sense of where we’re going. After I get your comments, I’ll put this into final.”

Perfect! If he doesn’t like the draft, I can just say, “Well, it was an early draft.” Then I can try to figure out what he’s after.

The next day, the partner called me into his office: “Can you tell me exactly what else you were planning to do to this brief? I’m a pretty harsh critic, and I normally mark things up pretty extensively. But I wouldn’t change a word of this. Just what were you planning to do to make it better?”

Sometimes, the world calls your bluff. For that question, I had no answer.

For years, I saw this at law firms: Sometimes people really did give me crappy drafts, with notes that said, “Here’s a crappy draft. I just want to get your thoughts.” I’ll tell you what I thought: “Why would you possibly ever give a partner a crappy draft? I don’t want to do your work for you. Do the very best you can do; then, give it to me. Why would anyone do anything else?”

On the other hand, sometimes people gave me finished, perfect drafts, accompanied by notes, “Here’s a crappy draft. I just want to get your thoughts.” I’d read the note and think: “Shoot. Here we go again.” But then I’d read the brief and understand what was going on: “The associate is just hedging because he doesn’t want to admit this is his best work. But this is pretty damn good.”

I never received a draft brief accompanied by a note that said: “Here’s the very best I can do. Does it make the grade?”

No one wants to know the answer to that question.

What do I see now that I’m in-house?

Law firms send me “early drafts” of briefs for my review: “Here’s an early draft. We just want to get your thoughts.”

What are they — in high school all over again?

I don’t want to review multiple drafts, each one slightly improved from the last version. I want to read one draft, perfect and ready to go, so that I can sign off on it.

Perhaps this is just hedging: “I hear Herrmann‘s a [curmudgeon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590316762/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dealbreaker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1590316762). Maybe he won’t like what I wrote. I’d better say it’s just an early draft.”

Fortunately, my students are educable these days. I explain that I want to see only their very best work. When it’s ready to go to court, it’s ready for my review; until then, keep polishing.

And get me the draft a couple of days early, too, so I have time to review the thing — because when you think something’s ready for court, you might be wrong.

An outside counsel recently told me that he has his partners “Herrmann-ize” briefs before they come to me. He’s wrong. That concept doesn’t exist: Either a brief is ready for prime time — to be filed in court — or it isn’t ready to be sent to an in-house litigator who has time only to review one draft. It’s final, or it’s not: Making something suitable for me is irrelevant.

You’re not in high school any more. It’s time to stop hedging your bets.

Best of luck with the new look.

# 500 Hours Of Pro Bono Work: Bumped Down at Biglaw, Bankrupted At Small Law, And Barely Making A Dent Towards Access To Justice

Last week, [Bloomberg](https://bol.bna.com/lawyer-who-helped-save-death-row-inmate-didnt-make-partner/) reported on [Brian Stolarz](https://www.leclairryan.com/brian-w-stolarz/), a former senior associate with [K&L Gates](http://www.klgates.com/) whose heroic pro-bono efforts helped a former death-row inmate win his freedom — but couldn’t win Stolarz partnership at his firm. Predictably, the firm’s partnership decision came down to hours: K&L Gates had an annual 2000-hour billable requirement, Stolarz admitted that he “was probably billing 1,400, and [around 500 pro bono]. As a result, Stolarz had to settle for an of-counsel position — though he’s since left K&L Gates and is now a partner at [LeClair Ryan](https://www.leclairryan.com).

The Bloomberg piece valiantly tries to make the counter-case that large global law firms should count all pro bono work towards associates’ billable requirements. Yet even if more firms adopted a parity-for-pro-bono-hours policy, it’s unlikely that this change would make a difference since most of the nameless attorneys interviewed for the article said that irrespective of their firm’s official pro bono policies, ultimately, their careers are judged by hours billed.

And that makes sense. After all, where else on the planet can employees who are hired and paid to perform a particular job devote a quarter of their work-time to charity and volunteer endeavors and still expect the same salary and advancement opportunities? That Uber driver who volunteers two mornings a week shuttling old folks to doctors’ appointments doesn’t even get paid for those hours. Ditto the grocery store worker who runs around town collecting canned goods for the local food bank.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Likewise, the universal rule that hours worked = income and benefits received applies in solo and small law land too. Solo lawyers who choose to spend 500 hours a week of their time on pro bono matters would soon find themselves not merely bumped down from the prospect of a high-six figure partnership salary to low six-figure of-counsel position, but flat out bankrupt. And large firms aren’t immune either: granted, a large firm that writes off 500-hours of billable time won’t go out of business, but multiply those 500 hours 500 times over, and you’re looking at a serious revenue loss.

Moreover, if the purpose of pro bono work is to expand access to justice rather than merely serve as a law firm recruitment tool, arguably, it’s efficient for large firms to fund legal aid organizations or pay solos to do pro bono work. Do the math: if Stolarz had spent 500 hours on billable work instead of pro bono, he would have conservatively generated $157,000 in revenues for the firm (assuming $450/hr rate x 500 hrs, applying a 70% realization rate). Stolarz’s foregone revenue funded one capital case, which is undoubtedly important. But those dollars would have gone much farther if donated to a non-profit focused on capital cases. Heck, $157,000 could pay for two solo lawyers to each take on a year’s worth of free and low-bono divorce, domestic violence, immigration and landlord-tenant cases — matters where representation is desperately needed.

Some large firms may be heading in that direction — effectively “outsourcing” their pro bono obligations by supporting other attorneys or organizations to provide legal services. For example, the Bloomberg mentions an initiative by [Jones Day](http://www.jonesday.com/) to set up a network to help military veterans obtain legal services. And for years, Skadden has operated [fellowship program](https://www.skaddenfellowships.org/) that pays the salary for 30 attorneys to work at legal aid organizations.

Decades ago, I published a [law review article](http://www.law.ua.edu/pubs/jlp_files/issues_files/vol16/vol16art06.pdf) questioning whether Biglaw pro bono programs are the most effective way to expand access to justice. Today, I’m more convinced than ever that these programs don’t work since despite the thousands of hours of pro bono time logged by Biglaw firms each year, the majority of low income people are consistently unable to afford legal services. Instead of forcing firms to forego revenue to benefit a handful of associates who take on pro bono work, why not ask them to spread the wealth to support solo and non-profit law firms who can do pro bono and low-bono work more efficiently and affordably?

# Biglaw Layoffs In A Pandemic: Opportunistic Or Necessary?
## We generally expect to see firms with entrenched corporate practices suffer the most.

Are law firms laying off associates and staff as a sword or a shield in this COVID-19 pandemic? This question predicates on whether we are headed for another protracted recession a la 2009, or if ultimately this is just a short-term blip. The answer is a moving target; ultimately, we do not know how the virus will play out. Optimistic models hope for a swift return to normalcy, while more pessimistic counterparts forecast many more months of lockdowns. Regardless of the ultimate answer, firms are preparing for the worst case scenario, as they hope to avoid the same pitfalls that toppled Howrey and Dewey & LeBoeuf during the last recession.

Although the financial crisis is more closely associated with 2009 for Biglaw, the crisis actually started in the spring of 2007. It took time for the full brunt of the downturn to propagate to Biglaw. As we can see, the ratio for lateral moves to lateral leakage (attorneys exiting Biglaw altogether) hit its nadir for partners in 2010, declining year for year starting in 2007.


Despite hitting its low point three years after the recession again, the market quickly resurged the following year as lateral movement increased relative to leakage. Associate movement is often a more sensitive barometer for market conditions as associate laterals take less time to execute and swarms of partners are insulated from recessions if they have strong portables or are in key practices. If we look at just associate leakage, and add further granularity to the best fit model, we see that market conditions actually started improving in 2010.


There is one caveat, this “growth” was driven not by an increase in appetite, but rather a decrease in associate layoffs.


Data supports the consensus that 2009 was the year of mass layoffs, as March of 2009 saw over 1,400 attorneys leave Biglaw altogether. Though associate movement increased a paltry 25 percent, compared to the 128 percent from 2010 to 2011, but the mass exodus of attorneys in 2009, seemed to assuage the concerns of most firms on their financial position.


The question on everyone’s minds is, what will firms do this time?

Generally the consensus is split; some firms are opting for austerity measures in the form of pay cuts and frozen partner distributions. These moves suggest that those firms believe this is a short-term crisis, and are deferring risk onto its members in a bid to avoid a repeat of 2009 style layoffs. The less optimistic firms are already resorting to layoffs and furloughs for associates and staff in hard-hit practice areas like M&A.

There will not be a one-size fits all approach, and the firms more diversified, especially in counter-cyclical practice areas like L&E, restructuring, litigation, and tax, are better equipped to weather the storm. Firms like Hueston Hennigan with strong litigation pipelines have actually announced bonuses instead of cuts, on top of their [market-busting bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/hueston-hennigan-bonus-2019/). Hueston Hennigan doesn’t need to address slowing corporate practices with highly paid M&A associates and partners waiting for deal flow.

We generally expect to see firms with entrenched corporate practices suffer the most. White-shoe firms like Simpson Thacher, Cadwalader, Davis Polk, Cravath, Goodwin, Wilkie, Ropes & Gray, Shearman & Sterling, will be hard hit by an extended recession as their large domestic corporate footprint exceeds 40 percent of their domestic practice share.


We expect many of these firms to begin retooling their associates – something Lateral Link’s very own Jon Kahn [experienced](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/01/jon-kahns-journey-from-biglaw-partner-to-recruiting/) when corporate work dried up at Fried Frank when he started in 1990. Firms will continue to bolster practices with stable demand, and we expect to see the lateral market resemble a mosaic as demand increases for certain specialties (especially among partners) and demand otherwise slows for other practices and level of experience niches.

For those that don’t have the capabilities or flexibility to retool their associates, we expect to see layoffs as associates represent a fixed cost for the firms. Because partners are the profit drivers in the Biglaw model, and associates are either profit sources or cost centers depending on their billable revenue generated, firms will protect their partners as much as they can while coveting other firm’s profitable partners. Additionally, layoffs represent a proven financial tool to weather declines in profitability that saw success in the 2009 crisis.


A precipitous drop was avoided in 2009 as firms boosted their PPP by laying off associates in dry practice areas. The reduction in partner profits was offset by the reduction in fixed costs in the form of associate pay. Nonetheless, the move has long-term consequences as it handicaps the profitability and strength of a firm’s practice once it ultimately re-engages its cyclical practices. Though some firms have a head start on layoffs, ultimately we expect firms to opt for a more conservative pruning relative to the deep Edward-Scissorhandesque cuts we saw in 2009 to minimize the opportunity costs associated with hemorrhaging attorneys right before the market reopens.

With such granular demand that differs by specialty and experience, your best bet for making a lateral move right now is to team up with an experienced recruiter who can help you navigate this mercurial market.

# Women Underrepresented In Leadership Positions, Overrepresented In Law School Debt
## It doesn’t take a genius to figure that it will still take decades for women lawyers to reach income parity while continuing to pay down law school debt.

Why am I not surprised? Even though women comprise the majority of law school students, they still don’t comprise (not even close) the majority of those in leadership positions in law firms and in corporations. And given the recent Supreme Court decision on affirmative action, that majority may never be reached, especially now that businesses with any kind of DEI policies are [in the litigation crosshairs](https://www.wsj.com/articles/diversity-equity-dei-companies-blum-2040b173).

And what will happen to [all the DEI initiatives](https://www.calbar.ca.gov/Portals/0/documents/reports/Diversity-Equity-Inclusion-Plan-Report-2023-2024.pdf) such as the elimination of bias and the implicit bias training required of all California lawyers? Will such initiatives be canned? To be determined. One lawsuit [against the Medical Board of California](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/california-doctors-sue-licensing-board-to-undo-dei-requirement?source=newsletter&item=read-text&region=digest) has already been filed.

The corollary to the majority of women in law schools is that women are also carrying [the major portion of the law school debt](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bloomberg-law-analysis/analysis-the-future-of-legal-is-female-but-it-comes-with-a-cost?source=newsletter&item=body-link&region=text-section).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
According to Bloomberg, 30% of the respondents to its most recent Law School Preparedness Survey reported having law school debt in the six-figure range, but a gender-based breakdown of the data shows that women make up a majority of those respondents. The same holds true for debt at or above $50,000. Not an easy amount to pay off, especially if women are not pulling down Biglaw salaries, and there’s still significant salary disparity.

All you need to do is to read [this abstract](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/law-and-social-inquiry/article/abs/gender-pay-gap-and-highachieving-women-in-the-legal-profession/96397A648EBA73213137F40F6CC67B2F) about how women attorneys still continue to lag behind in income. It doesn’t take a genius to figure that it will still take decades for women lawyers to reach income parity while continuing to pay down law school debt. Not a pretty picture.

The conclusion is cringeworthy and discouraging: “discrimination in the legal profession operates partly by devaluing female attorneys’ human capital, such that sterling academic credentials and other traits that are valued in men are far less valued in women.” Is there any woman lawyer who doesn’t know that already?

And how many times have women lawyers been criticized for being aggressive, for being “shrill “(what’s the male counterpart to that adjective?), and/or for speaking up? For being “pushy?” Whatever that means. Too many times to count. Adam Grant, an organizational psychologist at Wharton, thinks it’s [time to normalize language](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/31/opinion/women-language-work.html?campaign_id=39&emc=edit_ty_20230802&instance_id=99027&nl=opinion-today&regi_id=78061995&segment_id=140893&te=1&user_id=0d22f8d038b2fef3184a5c3bba481c1c) so that “weak language” (e.g., language such as disclaimers, hedges, and tag questions) can be a strategic advantage and an untapped source of strength.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
We all confront at some point whether we should have a “passion” for what we do. We like to think that we are passionate about what we do, otherwise, why do it, except for the lifestyle that it can afford some, but not all, of us. But what if passion is overrated? Given all that we have endured during the past three years of COVID-19 and now the post-COVID era, many lawyers have come to realize that passion for the work is not necessarily all that we think it is. WFH, hybrid work schedules, and being able to make time for the people and activities that make life worthwhile may well have put the brakes on the constant need to be indispensable, to be available 24/7, to make all the sacrifices that some peeps think are worth making, only to find that they aren’t worth it. That realization comes to everyone, eventually.

What may be an unintended consequence of associate deferral dates at some Biglaw firms may be the chance to think about whether the passion you have is worth the physical, emotional, and mental costs. Stress accompanies every single job, whether a lawyer, first responder, or tradesperson, especially HVAC peeps, the last of which would seem to be in the highest demand right now, given the weather. However, [using passion as the keystone](https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520303232/the-trouble-with-passion) to how you regard what you do and who you are can backfire.

What does “judgment” mean? The Orange County legal community here in SoCal is stunned at [the arrest of Orange County Superior Court Judge Jeffrey Ferguson](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/california-judge-arrested-on-suspicion-of-shooting-his-wife-to-death/) who is alleged to have killed his wife in their home in northern Orange County. He’s presently free on a $1 million bond.

In 2017, the California Commission on Judicial Performance [publicly admonished him for two matters](https://cjp.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2016/08/Ferguson-D-O-Public-Admon-5-31-17.pdf), including being Facebook friends with attorneys who appeared before him. He also had made false claims about a prosecutor running for a judicial office. The commission was not happy, especially given the “seriousness of his misconduct in accusing a judicial candidate of ethical impropriety with a reckless disregard for the truth. The judge’s post was not only potentially injurious to the candidate, but also undermined public respect for the judiciary and the integrity of the electoral process.”

Is judgment an oxymoron? In another matter, a judge in the Eastern District of Michigan commented that a defendant appearing in his courtroom “[looked like a criminal”](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/federal-judge-says-defendant-looks-like-a-criminal-to-me-which-is-obviously-a-problem/) to him. He refused to recuse himself, saying that he could be fair, and guess what? The defendant was convicted. No surprise there. The Sixth Circuit benchslapped that district court judge and reversed the conviction. Also, no surprise that the retrial would be before a different judge.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

Why can’t judges behave? What exactly is “judicial temperament”? That’s a question that every judicial evaluation questionnaire asks, at least here in California. Shouldn’t such temperament be like counting to 10 and then counting to 10 again? Maybe that 10 should be multiplied.

UPDATE: Prior version incorrectly identified that California Medical Association which is distinct from the California Medical Board.

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

# Elite Litigation Powerhouse Blasts Davis Polk Salary Scale Out Of The Water

What’s the best way to ensure that associates at your firm have a wonderful weekend? By announcing big-time — we’re talking huge — salary raises on Friday night. How exciting!

At litigation powerhouse Williams & Connolly, salaries are typically difficult to cover due to the firm’s black-box feel. While salaries are known to be slightly above market, associates at the firm usually remain relatively quiet as far as their compensation is concerned — that is, until now.

Please note the UPDATE below.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
According to memo sent on Friday, the firm is now paying lockstep salaries across all class years, and those salaries are way, way above market. Check it out:



For the Class of 2021, that’s $17,500 more than the DPW scale, and for the Classes of 2013 and earlier, that’s $35,000 more than the DPW scale. That’s quite the payday for associates at the firm.

UPDATE (1:30 p.m.): Sources note that while salaries alone at Williams & Connolly beat the new Davis Polk salary scale, their complete compensation is under market. Why’s that? There are no bonuses of any kind to had at W&C. Without year-end bonuses or special bonuses, the only remarkable thing here is the firm’s above-market raise structure.

# Picking Your System -- Part 2 of 2
## Should you find your home in Biglaw or SmallLaw?

This is the second installment in my two-part series about the different systems to consider as you think about your career and decide what you want to do with the rest of your life. I’ve been told this advice has been useful to people I’ve discussed it with in the past, so I hope it is helpful to some of you as well. [Last week](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/picking-your-system-part-1-of-2/), I talked about government and in-house work. This week, it’s BigLaw and SmallLaw.

BigLaw

I doubt I have to explain BigLaw to ATL readers. On average, BigLaw will be more lucrative than any of the other systems. If you spend your career in BigLaw, you probably won’t have to worry about whether you can afford to send your kids to private school or pay for college. It also allows you to do a variety of work for different clients, rather than specialize in one area for one client, as you will usually do in government or in-house. And in BigLaw, unlike in a corporation, the lawyer is king.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
To be successful in BigLaw, especially when you’re coming up, you need to let things roll off your back. You can’t, for example, take it personally when you’re a third-year associate and the partner calls you on Friday afternoon and tells you he’s sending you to China for a week — and the plane leaves in three hours. Prickly people tend not to be a great fit for BigLaw.

Your life in BigLaw will also be defined, in many ways, by whether or not you bring in business. And if you’re in BigLaw, that has to be a pretty big number for it to matter to the firm. (Your buddy’s $300,000 contract dispute won’t cut it.)

Origination is freedom — the more you bring in, the more freedom you have.

If you don’t bring in business — regardless of your title — you will, by definition, be doing other people’s work. If you work for the right people, that can be terrific. Finding the right rabbi is one of the single most important things you can do as you plan your career in BigLaw. You could also get lucky, have that rabbi retire, and get handed his clients. Being the relationship partner to a longstanding firm client is the functional equivalent of origination.

But if you don’t bring in business and never find the right rabbi, life can be hard and stressful. If you work for a rainmaker who is also a jerk, you can find your livelihood completely dependent on someone who treats you like crap and doesn’t care about your life.

You will also have to constantly think about billable pressure, which — as many ATL readers know — can be very stressful. And it gets worse as you get older and have more competing priorities than you do in your youth. Missing a night out with your friends is one thing; missing your kid’s soccer game is another.

Of course, the benefit is — again — that you will make more money. Money will allow you to outsource more things and afford more things. Life is all about tradeoffs.

SmallLaw

And finally, there’s SmallLaw. That’s my favorite system, of course, because it’s where I am. But it may not be the right system for you; I truly am trying to be descriptive and not normative here.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It’s hard to generalize about SmallLaw. Small firms vary widely in the quality and the amount of their work. Some small firms have lower billable requirements, and some are absolute sweatshops.

Some firms in SmallLaw pay pretty well, and some of them pay less than you’d make in a federal government job.

Public Service Announcement: In SmallLaw, the Cravath scale does not determine associate compensation. Many people who think big thoughts about law firm management suggest that associates should be paid anywhere from 25-33 percent of what is collected from the work they do. If you’re thinking you might like SmallLaw, play around with those numbers, adjusting the number of hours and the billable rate, and see what you get.

If you get the right firm in SmallLaw, it can be a really nice, collaborative place to work. (At the wrong firm, of course, there is nowhere to hide, and it can be hell on earth.) As in BigLaw, you will generally have more flexibility than you will in government or in-house. You don’t have to put in for leave, or get permission to leave early or work from home sometimes. Generally speaking, if you’re doing good work and meeting your hours requirements, you probably won’t be micromanaged.

You’re likely to have more client contact in SmallLaw than you are in BigLaw, because the cases are usually smaller. Think about what you would enjoy more: Would you rather be one of 20 lawyers on a massive case that’s in the news every day, feeling like you’re really doing work that matters on a national or international level? Or would you rather be lawyer number one or two on a case no one will ever know about, but that’s for an individual client you’ve really come to like?

SmallLaw can be riskier than the other systems, but you have to think about what risk means. To some extent, the only real security in the non-government legal world is origination. If you can bring in business, you can always find work somewhere. If you’re in-house, you could get laid off. If you’re a service partner at BigLaw, your rabbi could leave, or your firm could merge and render you redundant.

Plus, to be a successful rainmaker in SmallLaw, the numbers you have to put up are much smaller than they are in BigLaw. You don’t need to bring in Exxon; your buddy’s $300,000 contract case may be just fine. You can also develop a specialty, as I’ve been fortunate enough to do, in an area that’s better suited for SmallLaw than BigLaw.

In my experience at two small firms, SmallLaw can be a hell of a lot of fun. At the right firm, you can have a real sense that you’re building something together — a sense of ownership that can often be hard to find in the law.

***

I have often said that I have my dream job, and I am deeply grateful for that. But I know government lawyers, in-house lawyers, and BigLaw lawyers who say the same thing. There are, as the saying goes, different strokes for different folks. [“What might be right for you, may not be right for some….”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jJIVK-daGk)

# This Biglaw Firm Is Raising Associate Salaries For The Third Time In 2022

What’s better than two raises in less than two months’ time? Three raises!

Cadwalader was the very first firm to [match the Milbank scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/cwt-match-22/) back in January. Then the firm quickly [matched the Davis Polk scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cwt-reraises-22/). Now, the firm is matching the Cravath scale.

Here’s what the generous new salary scale looks like at CWT:



Just like the firm’s last two raises, its third will also be retroactive to January 1. Once again, congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Cadwalader.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post.

# Continuing Tom Girardi Saga Drags Itself Into Yet Another New Year
## A tale slightly older than time ...

Thomas Girardi

Phooey on resolutions, but this is the time of year when many of us take stock about where we are, where we’ve been, and where we may want to be in January 2025. Some of us may want to stand pat, but others may be thinking or have been thinking about moving forward, sideways, or even backtracking. It all depends upon what is important to you, a very personal decision. What may be perfect for one person may be horrendous for another. We know, through trial and error (pun intentional), there are many ways to have a career in the law. The perspective of having to have a particular job, to make tons of money, usually changes as we age, and what was worth chasing even a few years ago may no longer be appealing or even doable.

One of the biggest challenges for dinosaur lawyers is when and how to let go. Yes,  clients still need us, or at least we think they do, but what about personal and family needs? When, if ever, do they take priority or even parity with practice? For many dinosaurs, the perplexing question is now what to do and how to do it, to still have purpose and meaning while throttling back. It’s not an easy question to answer. I have friends who are close to 80 (and some beyond that), who are still incredibly sharp, and able to work, but should they? How do they reconnect with a personal and family life left behind years ago when chasing equity partnership and other benefits? Sometimes, you just know when it’s time. Other times, it can take a shove, gentle or otherwise.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Meanwhile, some stories don’t end. My first Tom Girardi story of 2024 (apologies to my editor): a federal judge has determined that [Girardi is competent to stand trial](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-01-02/tom-girardi-declared-incompetent-incompetent-to-stand-trial) for his various alleged misdeeds involving client settlement funds. This ruling is only the beginning of the next chapter.

It’s only January 4, and already I have my first “I am not making this up” for the new year. One law firm is suing another for alleged copyright infringement because Firm A allegedly copied language from Firm B’s brief. What? Is nothing sacred anymore? Nor should it be because, [as Joe Patrice points out](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/boutique-sues-winston-strawn-copyright-brief/), it can verge on malpractice not to copy language. As Joe says, copying is what we do in a common law system. We use the same words and phrases to avoid malpractice, especially in jury instructions where appellate courts have already ruled on  appropriate language to use. Perhaps there might be an issue if the brief was never public record, but in this case, it was and is. I have never seen the © on a brief, at least not so far. Have you?

When I was a junior lawyer, I looked for any help I could get to draft briefs, settlement agreements, and all the other forms of legal documents (this was way before AI). So, the standard answer when I asked for help, which was all the time, was to “go look at the form files.”

Dinosaur lawyers remember form files. They were copies of various and sundry documents/pleadings/agreements/etc. drafted by others and collected in a bunch of file cabinets. File cabinets, another anachronism? The pleadings and the like weren’t always on point, in fact, they rarely were, but they were roadmaps for drafting whatever had to be written, especially for junior lawyers who knew where the restrooms were, but not much more. You still had to research and Shepardize.

No one ever raised a copyright issue; we were all too busy copying from each other. It wasn’t plagiarism, it was using the best mousetrap available for a specific issue. Was it laziness? To the contrary, if you want to talk about laziness, then we can talk about generative AI, but let’s save that for another time.

The form files were usually bulging with past work, from our office and others, even pleadings and briefs from opposing counsel. The test was what would work best in a given situation, and if someone else had a better turn of phrase, a better way to position the argument, to lead the reader in the right direction, then so be it!

If we all had to reinvent the wheel linguistically, the profession would have sunk under the weight of wordiness — and we are wordy enough. There may be ethical issues in copying a brief and charging the client for it, but Joe points out, if copying a brief’s wording saves the client money and gets the necessary points across, what’s wrong with that?

And to end on a California note, heads up for any and all employers who have employees here in the Golden State, who will find that this year is not a happy one. Employees suing for retaliation must show [a nexus between their protected activity and employer retaliation](https://ogletree.com/insights-resources/blog-posts/new-california-law-makes-it-easier-for-employees-to-establish-retaliation-claims/). That’s still the law, but now in California if the employee can show that the adverse employment action occurred within 90 days of the protected activity, the presumption is now that the employer is the bad actor. Remember presumptions from evidence class?

I had always counseled HR that the more attenuated the connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action, the better. But sometimes it was too tempting not to go “ready, fire, aim.” And they did; itchy trigger fingers bought lawsuits. Now, it’s even easier to sue here in California. [SB 497 has the deets](https://legiscan.com/CA/text/SB497/2023). You’re welcome. You can thank me later, and Happy New Year!

# Unvaccinated Lawyers Will Not Be Allowed To Enter This Biglaw Firm
## Getting vaccinated is 'the least that we can do for ourselves, our families and each other as part of our community obligations,' says the firm's managing partner.'

[We will] require that all employees, other than those who cannot be vaccinated due to medical or religious reasons, be fully vaccinated before Sept. 13. …

Having all of our employees vaccinated not only helps protect the health and safety of the Mintz community, this requirement also safeguards the health of our clients and others who visit our offices. We will expect clients, vendors and others who enter our offices to provide proof of vaccination (and we will provide for protocols for visitors who cannot provide such proof).

— an excerpt from a memo written by [Bob Bodian](https://www.mintz.com/our-people/robert-i-bodian), managing partner of Mintz, detailing what the [firm’s return to the office](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/06/29/mintz-says-no-covid-vaccination-no-office/) will look like. Employees may return voluntarily starting on July 6, and at that time, those who are vaccinated will no longer need to wear masks or socially distance from colleagues. Those who are unvaccinated will [not be allowed in the building](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/06/29/mintz-says-no-covid-vaccination-no-office/) and will continue to work remotely until September, because “some employees … have compromised immune systems, and we have an obligation to do our best to protect them, and everyone else, particularly when protection is readily available.”

# First Biglaw Firm To Buy Serious Property In The Metaverse
## Biglaw goes digital.

Listen, full disclosure — I’m not sold on the metaverse yet. The commercials are a weird, uncanny valley and after two years and counting of pandemic-induced isolation, I am ready to be where the people are, not where their avatars are. But, man, the artist formerly known as Facebook is sure pushing the hell out of it.

And a Biglaw firm has bitten. Arent Fox has announced the firm has purchased digital land in the metaverse and is building a virtual office in Decentraland. The firm’s crypto chair, James Williams, [told Law.com](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/02/15/arent-fox-buys-property-in-the-metaverse-becoming-first-big-law-firm-with-serious-presence-in-the-virtual-world/) the virtual move is designed to demonstrate to clients that Arent Fox understands the new, digital world:

“The platforms you hear most about are the gaming platforms. But that’s not where the future is. In places like Sandbox and Decentraland you’re buying in locations just like you would buy a Rodeo Drive. You’re trying to get in early,” said Williams, adding that the idea, at a minimum, is to show clients that you’re smart and familiar with the metaverse. “We want to show our clients: We know this world; look, we bought in this world, and we can help them navigate this world.”

And even if the future in *not* in the metaverse, the purchase still makes sense for the firm: “[W]e still have a lot of clients moving to this place now, and we want to be where our clients are,” Williams said.

Firm chair Anthony Lupo said the digital investment has already increased its value by 25 percent and that Arent Fox wants to be part of deciding how the metaverse will be used:

“There is a lot of curiosity, but there’s also a lot of confusion about the metaverse, partly because nobody knows what the metaverse is,” said Lupo. “Arent Fox’s move to the metaverse is not only symbolic. We are attempting to find the solution and actually operating in the space. We don’t know what the metaverse will be in five years, but we’re not waiting five years to find out. We’re going to help iterate that future.”

Besides, the metaverse just might help with those work-from-home blues:

“We had our partnership meeting last week, and I announced our purchase of an office in the metaverse,” said Lupo. “I joked that when we return to the office, people that don’t want to come back to the work, we’ll put them in the metaverse office.”

But the jury is still out as to whether this becomes a full-blown Biglaw trend.

Last night, California-based litigation boutique Hueston Hennigan became [the first firm to officially match](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-firm-bumps-associate-salaries-to-match-180k-scale/) Cravath’s new $180K salary structure. Today, there’s more good news out West as the firm Hueston Hennigan largely grew out of, Irell & Manella, joins the new normal.

We routinely bank on Irell to [beat the market in associate compensation](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-same-as-it-ever-was/), so we had few doubts they’d be an early adopter of the new pay structure. When the firm bested market bonuses last year, some of our tipsters were still annoyed that the firm didn’t offer even more. So far we’ve not heard the same complaints about this bump.

Congrats folks!

# The Largest Law Firms With The Most Women Lawyers (2020)

Earlier this week, thanks to the recently released National Law Journal 500 ranking, we found out which U.S.-centric Biglaw firms were the [biggest of them all in terms of headcount](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/the-500-largest-law-firms-in-america-2020/). As a companion piece to the NLJ 500, today we’ve got the NLJ Women’s Scorecard, a ranking of the percentage of female attorneys and percentage of female partners at the largest 350 firms in the country.

For this ranking, both equity and nonequity partners were counted as partners, while nonpartner or “other” figures include special counsel, of counsel, and other staff attorneys. Temporary and contract attorneys aren’t included in the count. In the event of a tie, the higher rank is awarded to the firm with more female equity partners.

In all, 265 of the country’s 350 largest firms by head count reported data for the scorecard. Among the respondents, women accounted for 37.2% of the firms’ 143,454 lawyers in 2019, and 47.7% of 68,250 associates. …

Female representation at the partner level once again lagged in 2019: across the board, women comprised only 24.2% of all partnerships, out of 59,176 total partners, and only 20.5% of the equity partnership ranks.

Without further ado, here is the NLJ Women’s Scorecard Top 10 for 2020:

- Berry Appleman & Leiden
- Fragomen
- Hanson Bridgett
- Littler Mendelson
- Constangy Brooks Smith & Prophete
- FordHarrison
- Wood Smith Henning & Berman
- Manning Gross + Massenburg
- Ogletree Deakins
- Jackson Lewis
You may be wondering where the largest, namebrand Biglaw firms appear on this list. While the majority of the top 30 firms on the scorecard have a headcount of about 300 or less, there were some exceptions, with Fragomen, Littler, Ogletree, Jackson Lewis, Ropes & Gray, Wilson Elser, Shook Hardy, Gordon Rees, Lewis Brisbois, Baker McKenzie, and Quarles & Brady all making an appearance in the top 30. Firms like Ropes & Gray and Ogletree both made major strides, with Ropes cracking the Top 20 for the first time ever (the firm’s chair is a woman and four of its 10 board members are women) and Ogletree joining the Top 10 (the firm recently created a sponsorship program to support female nonequity partners advancing to the equity level).

# NY To $190K: An Addendum On Leverage
## In figuring out which Biglaw firm will bring us the next pay raise, it's important to consider the concept of leverage.

Last week, I offered some thoughts on which Biglaw firm might [lead the next round of pay raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-who-will-lead-the-charge/). I nominated Cravath, which in many ways is still the leader of the pack when it comes to New York’s elite, old-guard, white-shoe firms. (I didn’t focus on places like Wachtell Lipton and Quinn Emanuel, which are a bit different — younger and more narrowly focused in their practices compared to places like Cravath, Sullivan & Cromwell, Davis Polk, and Simpson Thacher).

A reader raised this important point in response to my article:

Have you considered writing about the role of leverage in the jump to $190K? On a profits-per-partner basis, Skadden (with a leverage of 3.5) would have an easier time raising salaries than Davis Polk (4.9), to the tune of about $45,000 per partner (assuming $30k raises across the board). In a world where firms game many of their accounting measures to boost PPP [profits per partner], I’m sure a margin of that size enters the calculus.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
As noted in the American Lawyer’s latest [ranking of firms by profitability](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202755651549/Firms-Ranked-by-Profitability-#ixzz49DWgd4r2), part of the recently released [Am Law 100](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/) rankings, leverage “is the ratio of all lawyers (minus equity partners) to equity partners.” The higher a firm’s leverage, the more an associate pay raise will cut into partner profits. For example, if a firm has leverage of 5 to 1 — i.e., five lawyers (excluding equity partners) for every one equity partner — giving every lawyer a $20,000 pay raise should increase overhead and reduce profits per equity partner by $100,000 (5 x $20,000). (Note: that example admittedly oversimplifies things a bit, but you get the point.)

As suggested by the reader comment posted above, it seems reasonable to assume that all else being equal, a firm with low leverage would be more willing and able to raise associate salaries than a firm with high leverage. It also seems reasonable to assume, based on the [history of Biglaw pay raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-who-will-lead-the-charge/), that the salary hike will come from a super-prestigious firm.

Every year, our friends at Vault rank the nation’s [100 most prestigious law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/2016-vault-law-firm-rankings-self-perpetuating-prestige/). If you take the [top 15 Vault firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/2016-vault-law-firm-rankings-self-perpetuating-prestige/) and rank them by [leverage according to Am Law](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202755651549/Firms-Ranked-by-Profitability-#ixzz49DWgd4r2), here’s what the list looks like (from lowest to highest leverage, and with Vault rank in parentheses after each firm’s name):

1. Covington & Burling (V13) – 2.09
2. Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz (V1) – 2.11
3. Gibson Dunn & Crutcher (V11) – 3.08

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In the reader poll accompanying the last [NY to 190 article](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-who-will-lead-the-charge/), which asked you to vote for which firm would lead the next round of pay raises, the most popular answer was “the field” (i.e., a firm other than the five named firms of Cravath, Davis, Simpson, S&C, and Skadden). So let’s review this list of prestigious firms ranked by leverage and see if we can identify a few more possibilities.

The top of the list is Covington & Burling. Covington is an amazing firm, but I doubt it will lead the “NY to 190” movement. First of all, it’s not an “NY” firm — although it has New York offices (very nice ones, in the New York Times building), it’s still a D.C. firm at heart. Second, Washington firms historically haven’t been compensation leaders — and Covington in particular has sometimes [disappointed its associates on the bonus front](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/03/associate-bonus-watch-associates-at-covington-covet-their-neighbors-bonuses/). This shouldn’t be shocking; by Biglaw standards, Covington’s [PPP of $1.275 million](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202755653273) puts it in the bottom half of the Am Law 100.

Next up: Wachtell Lipton. Wachtell does have the profits to sustain a pay raise — $6.6 million, an all-time high for the Am Law 100 — but it’s such an outlier already on comp that it doesn’t affect the rest of Biglaw much. In recent years, it has paid bonuses equal to 100 percent of its (already above-market) base salaries, but that hasn’t led to a Biglaw-wide pay hike. (By the way, if you can confirm WLRK’s bonuses from the past few years — our last story about them was from [January 2014](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/01/associate-bonus-watch-wachtell-lipton-2011-2012/) — please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Wachtell%20Lipton%20bonuses) or text us (646-820-8477).)

The third firm on the list is Gibson Dunn — interesting. I’m old enough to still think of Gibson as an L.A. firm, but today it’s really a global one — an extremely prestigious and profitable global law firm, with almost [$3.2 million in PPP](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202755653273). So I wouldn’t rule out GDC leading the market higher; it is, to its credit, a firm that cares about keeping its associates happy. (Recall how it [upgraded its West Coast bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/associate-bonus-watch-gibson-dunn-upgrades-its-bonuses/) in response to associate discontent.)

The fourth firm on the list, Quinn Emanuel, is an even more likely candidate. It’s obscenely profitable ([$4.4 million in PPP](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/) in 2015), its leverage isn’t too high, it likes getting good press, and it has played a role in the pay raise wars before (back in 2005, when it [raised starting salaries to $135,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-who-will-lead-the-charge/?rf=1), above the then-prevailing rate of $125,000).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And here’s another reason QE might be the first mover: last year it [dramatically scaled back its summer program](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/biglaw-firm-decimates-summer-associate-program/), shifting to a model that focuses more on hiring associates out of clerkships (wooed by [$75,000 signing bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/clerkship-bonus-watch-will-75k-become-the-new-standard/), above the $50,000 going rate). So raising starting salaries for first-year associates — to [$180,000](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/ny-to-180/), [$190,000](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/ny-to-190/), or whatever John Quinn fancies — would be a great way of inflicting compensation costs on competitors that QE won’t have to bear quite as much itself. Paying $180K or $190K to 50 or 100 first-year associates will hurt the Simpsons and Skaddens of the world, while Quinn can pay the new, higher rates to a significantly smaller number of associates: the people who come through its scaled-back summer program, 3L recruiting, and hiring out of clerkships. (These are, by the way, numbers that Quinn can adjust far more easily in response to its own needs compared to firms relying on the traditional recruiting model, which essentially requires firms to commit to hiring a year before they know how many associates they need.)

The next five firms on the list — Skadden, Kirkland, S&C, Latham, Simpson, and Cravath — all have leverage in the 3.5 to 4 range, ample prestige, and high profits per partner. So they’re all possible leaders in the move to a new pay scale.

The final five firms — Davis Polk, Cleary Gottlieb, Boies Schiller, Weil Gotshal, and Paul Weiss — are unlikely to lead the move to NY to 190. They all have leverage of 5 to 1 or higher — and if you have that kind of leverage, a pay raise will cost you dearly. You’ll do it if you have to, but you wouldn’t initiate it. The only possible contender here is Davis — which at least has leverage under 5 to 1, and which has [led a pay raise](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-who-will-lead-the-charge/) in the past 15 years.

Would an associate pay raise be a good idea? Some fear that increased compensation costs for large law firms could [lead to more layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/biglaw-firms-must-conduct-more-layoffs-before-its-too-late/). But let’s set that grim possibility outside for the time being, and vote in this revised poll on who will take the market higher (now with a whopping ten options):

Who will lead the next round of Biglaw base salary raises?

- Cravath Swaine and Moore
- Davis Polk and Wardwell
- Gibson Dunn and Crutcher
- Kirkland and Ellis
- Latham and Watkins
- Quinn Emanuel
- Simpson Thacher and Bartlett
- Skadden Arps
- Sullivan and Cromwell
- The field (any firm not listed above)

# These Special Bonuses And Raises Will Cost Biglaw Firms TONS Of Money
## Will all the firms that have matched be able to handle this new money suck?

It would be mismanagement if somebody at these firms is not thinking about it. If they don’t have an Excel spreadsheet, where they can plug in this raise and see what happens, then they need a new CFO.

— Bruce MacEwan, founder of Adam Smith, Esq., commenting on the [financial costs that go along](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/06/15/latest-salary-increases-will-cost-firms-but-not-as-much-as-special-bonuses/) with the latest [special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/special-bonus-tracker-2021/) and [raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/salary-wars-scorecard-tracker-2021/) that have spread across Biglaw this spring. For many firms, the new raises won’t be nearly as painful as the special bonuses. “I think they should have been discriminating in which associate years they gave raises too,” said Adam Smith, Esq.’s Janet Stanton, referring to the value some associates are delivering for the salaries they’re receiving.

# Sullivan & Cromwell's New Partners: Impressive, Yes; Diverse, Not So Much
## Five white males -- could this partner class be any less diverse?

In my mind, here’s the Holy Trinity of high-powered Biglaw firms: Cravath, Wachtell Lipton, and Sullivan & Cromwell. These firms aren’t the three most profitable, the three oldest (Wachtell is actually quite young), or even the three most prestigious (Skadden [edges out S&C](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/move-over-wachtell-theres-a-new-firm-at-the-top-vault-top-100-firms-2017/?rf=1) in the most recent Vault rankings). But for whatever reason — maybe prestige over a longer period of time, maybe their reputations for intensity and long hours (they’re not “lifestyle” firms), maybe a combination of prestige, profits, and overall excellence — I see these three firms as sitting at the pinnacle of Biglaw.

While renowned for their prestige, profits, and professionalism, these three firms aren’t generally known for the diversity of their partnership ranks. But as we’ve reported, both Cravath and Wachtell made progress on this front in their most recent partner classes. Cravath’s newest partner class consisted of [three women](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/cravath-names-new-partners-and-all-three-are-women/?rf=1), while Wachtell’s was made up of [two women and an openly gay man](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/wachtell-liptons-new-partners-100-percent-diverse/).

Alas, Sullivan & Cromwell didn’t keep up with this pair of peer firms, at least not this year. From upset sources at S&C:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
- “All white men elected partners at S&C.”
- “Five new partners at S&C. All white men. Management saying they can’t find qualified women. New York litigation particularly bad….”
Yes, it’s true. Flip to the next page for the announcement from chairman [Joseph Shenker](https://www.sullcrom.com/lawyers/JosephC-Shenker) and for short bios of the five, who will become partners as of January 1, 2017.

Congratulations to them; as you can see, they’re an impressive group. They might lack racial, ethnic, or gender diversity, but they do cover a wide range of practice areas — General Practice (S&C-speak for Corporate), Antitrust, and Litigation (one general commercial litigator, and one appellate and Supreme Court litigator). And they boast geographic diversity: two from D.C., one from New York, one from London, and one from Sydney.

The lack of diversity in this new partner class is disappointing. Even Cleary Gottlieb — whose managing partner [told us](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/cleary-gottliebs-new-partner-class-where-are-the-women/) makes “no excuses” regarding diversity, and “must do better” — had one woman in its [partner class of eight](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/cleary-gottliebs-new-partner-class-where-are-the-women/2/).

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
What can be said in Sullivan & Cromwell’s defense? A source at the firm pointed out to us that this class is a bit of an aberration. Looking at the broader time period of the past ten years, from 2008 through 2017, S&C has elected 61 lawyers to partner. Of those 61, 16 were women and 13 were diverse (African American, Asian American, Latino, and LGBT). In percentage terms, that’s 26 percent women and 21 percent diverse lawyers. Furthermore, of the 13 members of S&C’s senior-most executive committee, three are women and five are diverse. So women and minorities are represented both in the firm’s overall partnership and in the highest ranks of leadership.

(This source also disagreed with the claim that New York litigation is especially weak on gender diversity. Of the six women litigators made partner in the ten-year period, three are based in New York.)

While these numbers could be better, and S&C continually strives to strengthen diversity, focusing just on the most recent partnership class is misleading, said our source. “If you look at our peers, the top 10 Vault firms, we have a high degree of confidence that we are within range of all of them.”

So how do the top law firms fare when it comes to the diversity of their new partner classes? If you have information to share with us, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Diversity%20at%20%5BFirm%20Name%5D) (subject line: “Diversity at [Firm Name]”).

Congrats again to the five fine lawyers who just made partner at Sullivan & Cromwell. Any institutional issues that the firm might have with diversity should not overshadow their track records of accomplishment and the achievement of making partner at S&C.

# Lawyers, Especially When Talking To Nonlawyers, Should Shut Up And Listen Far More Often
## For lawyers in particular, the gift of gab is difficult to turn off.

Lawyering always involves a healthy dash of performance. Whether you’re tap-dancing in court purely for the client’s amusement (that sort of thing doesn’t work on the judges) or projecting confidence that a deal will close (when it’s not at all a certainty), there’s something of a performer in all of us. Developing the skill to draw people’s attention verbally can be a professional asset in many ways.

The trouble is, when you get good at something, you tend to keep on doing it. For lawyers in particular, the gift of gab is difficult to turn off.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
This can be a problem. A recent study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences confirms what anyone who’s ever been in a social situation could probably already tell you: [human beings are really bad at knowing how long a conversation should last](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/people-literally-dont-know-when-to-shut-up-or-keep-talking-science-confirms/).

In a series of experiments, researchers compared the points at which a participant in a conversation wished it would have ended with when it actually ended. Researchers also asked conversationalists to guess at which point their partners in the conversation would have wanted it to end — which, of course, almost everyone was horrible at.

Only 2% of conversations studied ended when both parties wanted the conversations to end. Two out of 100 left both parties fully satisfied; truly awful. If that was the mutual satisfaction rate of sex, we would have long since died out as a species.

Only about a third of conversations ended when even one out of a pair of conversationalists wanted them to end. The rest — the vast majority of conversations — ended when no one wanted.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)

To be fair, in some of the studied conversations people actually wanted them to last longer. For 10% of conversations, both parties wished they would have gone on longer. In 31% of interactions at least one of the two conversationalists wanted to keep going. However, on average, windiness was much more of a problem than brevity. Averaged out across the study, participants reported that they would have liked conversations to last about half as long as they actually did.

What does it all mean? “Whatever you think the other person wants, you may well be wrong,” said Adam Mastroianni, a doctoral candidate in psychology at Harvard [who was one of the coauthors of the study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2011809118). “So you might as well leave at the first time it seems appropriate, because it’s better to be left wanting more than less.”

Boy, I’ve got that one covered. I don’t find that many conversations need to last longer than the time it takes to drain a highball, and, as a bonus, you’ve got a built-in excuse to pull the ripcord on a conversation when it’s time to go refresh your drink.

All this research isn’t specific to lawyers. But come on, you’re reading this on Above the Law, you know as well as I that no one can get a word in edgewise around a group of lawyers.

Although a lot of us don’t seem to realize it, excessive wordiness is especially annoying to nonlawyers. We’re all somewhat inured to the effect of weaponized verbosity. Let’s leave the civilians out of this though: no one is even close to being as interested in your case as you are, and no one is all that impressed by how much you know about everything either.

So, give it a try. Ask some good questions, and then just listen and wait for the complete answers. Maybe don’t interject so much. See if the people around you are making eye contact, or are looking all around (the international nonverbal cue to STFU). In fact, don’t even look for cues, just go right ahead and stop talking each time you can think to do so. Your work relationships, and your personal relationships, are going to be better for it.

# Top 10 Biglaw Firm Plans To Fully Reopen Its U.S. Offices In November
## The firm 'strongly encourages' vaccination for all employees, but still hasn't mandated it.

The pandemic has taken the legal profession through some very unexpected twists and turns. From closing down in-person working environments and moving to remote spaces for more than a year’s time and now trying to return to the office and having to reschedule those plans and reschedule them again, many firms are trying to do their best to move on with life while keeping all of their employees healthy and well.

Earlier today, we mentioned one top law firm that will partially return to the office on November 1. Now we know of an even more prestigious firm that plans to make a full return on that date.

Sidley Austin — a firm that brought in $2,462,935,000 gross revenue in 2020, placing it at No. 6 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — sent out a memo to U.S. personnel on Friday to let them know that they’d be returning to the office on November 1. Here’s an excerpt from that memo:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
We are targeting Monday, November 1 to return to offices on a regular basis. … Our firm has embraced vaccination recommendations and health and well-being protocols, and our August survey of all U.S. personnel indicated that approximately 93% of all personnel (lawyers and staff) are fully vaccinated; this percentage has likely increased since then.

The progress our country, our communities, and the firm have made and continue to make in managing the pandemic lead us to believe that — as one firm — with your cooperation and support, November 1 is a reasonable date for us to transition to in-person office activities (albeit with an approach that will be more flexible in many respects than our pre-pandemic operations).

So, how often will lawyers and staff need to be in the office? According to the Management Committee, before COVID-19, Sidley’s lawyers were “not expected to adhere to set office hours and really enjoyed a fair amount of flexibility in where and when they performed their work.” Lawyers will still have that flexibility, but in the interest of professional development and face-to-face collaboration, the firm is requesting that lawyers “make a dedicated effort to spend a majority of their otherwise normal work days each month (i.e., non-vacation and personal days) working from their assigned Sidley office and participating in office-related meetings and activities.” Lawyers will still be able to work remotely “from time to time, at their discretion.”

As for staff, they must be working “regularly” in the office by November 1, with the understanding that the firm is working on ways to provide greater flexibility to promote an enhanced work/life balance.

Sidley continues to “strongly encourage” all personnel to be vaccinated (read: there is no vaccine mandate at the firm), and going forward will operate with an eye toward maintaining compliance with the directive issued by President Biden for large employers. That said, unvaccinated individuals at the firm will be required to submit a negative COVID-19 test before entering the office, weekly.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

(Flip the page to read the memos from Sidley.)

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# Two Biglaw Firms Get Benchslapped As Federal Judge Questions 'Integrity'
## Ouch, that's gotta hurt.

If you were to imagine the worst thing a federal judge could say to an attorney during a hearing, I’d have to imagine, “The court has serious concerns with the integrity of your brief. There are statements and representations that we view as inaccurate and misleading to an unusual degree,” would be very, very high on the list.

That’s exactly what Ninth Circuit Judge William A. Fletcher told lawyers from DLA Piper and Munger Tolles & Olson. The firms are representing BNSF Railway Co. in litigation against the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community over shipping crude oil through reservation land.

The lower court ruled in favor of the tribe, and BNSF appealed. In the hearing on the railway’s appeal, the Ninth Circuit had some… issues with the briefing. As [reported by](https://www.law360.com/articles/1163095/9th-circ-questions-dla-munger-attys-candor-in-bnsf-brief) Law360, some of the problems the 9th Circuit has with the brief are as follows:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Of the eight examples cited by the court in its written order Wednesday, four involve prior cases, with the court highlighting key context that the brief glossed over or seemingly tried to hide.

In one instance, the brief quoted text from a Ninth Circuit decision in a tribal railway dispute in 1991 and used ellipses to omit an order by the court that the U.S. Army “obtain a right-of-way across the reservation.” In another example, the brief characterized a decision as being about the use of land, as opposed to a dispute over the use of tracks, the panel said.

In two other examples, BNSF’s brief omitted passages from case law that specified the decision applied to states or to state law, framing the decisions as broader than they were, the Ninth Circuit said.

The court also highlighted the fact that the brief claimed that the easement agreement allowed “at minimum” one eastbound and one westbound train per day with up to 25 cars each, when in fact, the panel said, the text of the easement said that one 25-car train in each direction was the maximum allowed per day.

During the hearing, Benjamin Horwich of Munger Tolles said he was “disappointed to hear” the panel had issues with the brief. The Ninth Circuit gave BSNF four weeks to respond and explain how the brief “candidly represents” the referenced documents.

[Roberta Kaplan] was trying to think of people from Ohio that could maybe come and be surrogates and get the word out. And I said, ‘Oh, I know Allison Janney is from Ohio, but why stop at Allison? I could call the whole gang and see if we can put the band back together.’

McCormack plays Robbie Kaplan in an upcoming ABC miniseries about the LGBT rights movement, [When We Rise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_We_Rise).

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](https://www.mainspringlegal.com/laterallink/) team of expert contributors. [Cordell Parvin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cordellparvin/) is a Senior Director with [Lateral Link](https://www.mainspringlegal.com/laterallink/) based in the Dallas, Texas office. Prior to coaching and recruiting lawyers, Cordell built a national construction law practice at an Am Law 100 law firm. Cordell is a well-known speaker, writer and blogger on career development and client development. He has made presentations to law firms and bar associations throughout the US and Canada. Cordell has published four books on career and client development. You can subscribe to his blog at [http://www.cordellblog.com/](http://www.cordellblog.com/), connect with him on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/cordellparvin), join his [Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Cordell-Parvin-Lawyer-Coaching/222291473905?ref=ts), and follow him on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/cordellparvin).

Most of you are far too young to know where I got the line: You Gotta Believe. Tug McGraw coined the phrase about the 1973 underdog New York Mets, and it applies to you as well.

I remember when I finished my USAF active duty and first joined a law firm. Early in my career, I arrived at work every day at 6 a.m. so I could spend time listening to the lawyer for whom I did the most work.

I made the coffee, grabbed my first cup, went to his office, and sat across his desk with my coffee cup in hand. During our 10- to 15-minute sessions each day, he shared ideas, really gems — the kind you and I never learned in law school.

Several times he told me: “Cordell, clients want their lawyers to have confidence-inspiring personalities. They want to believe you are the lawyer who can handle their matter better than any other lawyer.”

I have coached well over 1,000 lawyers in the last 11 years.

What have I noticed? All lawyers have some self-confidence. They could not have made it through law school without it.

But, many lawyers don’t believe they can become a law firm leader or rainmaker. They might have bought into the misconception that they have to approach it the same way a senior lawyer did.

Once the lawyers I coach believe they can become rainmakers, they are able to accomplish great things. One lawyer I coached went from almost no clients to becoming a top rainmaker in her firm simply by figuring out she could make rain and she could do it her way.

So, what can you do to become more self-confident? Here is the advice I give to the lawyers I coach:

You will only be as successful as you believe you can be. When you believe you are successful and the right lawyer for your potential client, you have more energy, you exude confidence and your body language reflects that confidence.

- Dress for success and be aware of your body language. Whether you like it or not, part of the first impression you make will be based on how you are dressed and how you appear. I once met an M&A lawyer whose shoes looked as if he had been on a playground. It’s the only thing I remember about him.
- You don’t have to be an extrovert and life of the party to exude confidence. It is far better to be “interested” than it is to be “interesting.” Ask great questions, actively listen, and find a way to demonstrate you heard what was said.
- Decide what you really want and focus your time and energy on it. Time and energy are your two most important resources. Don’t waste either. To do that, plan your non-billable time for your own development and client development as if it was as important as your work for an important client.
- One size does not fit all. Do not compare yourself to others. You have your own unique talents, dreams, and challenges. Focus your time and energy on your highest priorities.
- Find someone who encourages you and whom you trust so that you can be brutally honest about who you are, how you are doing, and get feedback. The better I know the lawyers I am coaching, the better I can identify their skills and enable them to use those skills. I sought feedback from people I trusted throughout my entire career. I remember one time I had a great idea, which I shared with a colleague. My colleague told me that I needed to focus on finishing some of my other ideas before embarking on new ones.
- Pay attention to your self-talk. Instead of saying to yourself, “My problem is…” say, “My opportunity is…” Instead of saying, “I need to…” say, “I want to…” Instead of saying, “I’ll try to…” say, “I will…”
- Stay hungry, keep learning, and always seek to become a better lawyer.  In his Stanford graduation speech, Steve Jobs closed with “Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish.” I totally agree. When I see superstar lawyers, one thing they have in common is that they are never content. They are always striving to be better.
- Become the “go to” lawyer for your clients. If you feel you are the “go to” lawyer, your confidence will show.
- Focus on the journey (actions), and the destination (bringing in business) will take care of itself. This idea taken from the Ralph Waldo Emerson quote worked very well for me. Focus on becoming more valuable to your clients and they will seek you out when they need you.
- Work on small steps that get you outside your comfort zone. Each time you make a step outside your comfort zone, you gain confidence.
- Practice, Practice, Practice. Practice speaking in public and one-on-one. Have someone videotape you so you can observe your body language. Practice writing for clients. One way to do it is by blogging.
- Be patient and persistent. Making rain takes time. Don’t get discouraged when you are not seeing results. When I first decided to focus my practice on representing highway, heavy civil construction contractors, it took well over two years before I saw any results.
- Avoid distractions. Technology has made our work easier to get done, while at the same time it has made it far more difficult to stay focused. I watch people all the time now who are physically sitting with a person, only paying no real attention to that person because they are on their phone. I once saw a lawyer pull out his mobile device at a client meeting and type something under the table and send it.
One final thought: Self-doubt is natural, and it can actually be healthy. I have had it my entire career. I called it “healthy paranoia.” I’ve used it to motivate me to be a better lawyer. You can too.

# With COVID-19 Out Of Control, Working From Home Is Still All The Rage In Biglaw
## Do you really need to be in the office to get work done? Most firms don't think so.

The novel coronavirus continues its rapid spread across the country, with cases increasing exponentially by the day. Hospitals are once more on the brink of being overrun, and indoor gatherings of large groups of people have been discouraged by the CDC. So much for Biglaw’s plans to return to the office.

Some firms had already opened their doors and welcomed employees back to their desks in small numbers, but the Biglaw powers that be are now asking lawyers and staff to come to grips with the most difficult of questions: Do you really need to be in the office to get work done? Is it absolutely necessary?

Haynes & Boone, for example, was eager to get people back into the office, but they’re rethinking those plans. The firm’s executive committee is now telling employees to avoid the office at all costs, unless absolutely necessary, from November 25 through December 9, at the very earliest. “We’re still very focused on what return to office is going to be like,” managing partner Tim Powers said in an interview with the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2020/11/20/as-covid-cases-rise-law-firms-push-lawyers-and-staff-to-stay-home/). “But right now, we’re trying to be careful, do the right thing, and keep people physically and mentally well.”

At other firms like Dentons, where office work was made optional for the remainder of 2020, firm leaders are deciding whether they’ll extend their work-from-home plans into 2021 given how cases are surging and expected to get worse during the holiday season. Think twice before you head to the office at this firm.

“We’re still following, at the top level, the same approach that we had, which is incremental and deliberate,” U.S. chief operating officer Mark Flanagan said. “All of our offices are available for access.” …

With the Thanksgiving holiday approaching, Dentons is asking workers to consider if their presence in the office is really essential. ”It’s an additional protective measure with regard to the coming two weeks,” Flanagan said.

If any Dentons attorneys or staff do elect to hit the road or get on an airplane over the holiday, they will be asked to stay out of the office for 14 days upon their return, per the firm’s travel policy.

Firms with offices located in the heartland, like Ballard Spahr and Faegre Drinker, are still letting employees work remotely. “While our office remains open, we will largely continue to rely on our robust technology and remote-work capabilities in the coming weeks until the greatest risks from COVID-19 have subsided,” said Ballard Spahr’s Minneapolis managing partner Karla Vehrs. Although some of the firm’s locations in the Midwest reopened (with low in-person attendance), Faegre Drinker’s chief operating officer Jane Koehl echoed Vehrs’s thoughts, saying, “Earlier this year, we committed to all colleagues that no one is required to return to our offices in 2020. That commitment to our people has not changed.”

Help us help you. What are your firm’s plans for the second wave of COVID-19? Let us know what your firm is doing to take care of all of its employees during this unprecedented time. Please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20COVID%20WFH%20Response) if your firm expects you to go into the office or if you’ll be able to continue to work from home. Thanks.

# Another Round Of Raises To Start The Week

One holdout firm with a lot of offices around the country to consider has finally sorted out how it plans to compensate its associates.

Following the lead of his [brother](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2006/11/06/power-brothers-ascend-to-the-top-of-hotlantas-legal-scene/), Robert Hays of [King & Spalding](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/firm-with-big-profits-per-partner-shares-the-riches-in-new-york/), Richard Hays of [Alston & Bird](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/alston-bird-llp/) informed associates [this morning](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-round-of-raises-to-start-the-week/2/) that they would be seeing raises, and that the firm would not provide Cravath matches to every office.

Associates in New York, Washington, Los Angeles, Silicon Valley, and — bizarrely — Dallas will see entry-level compensation bumped to $180K. Salaries beyond that are distributed individually, so we don’t know for certain at this time if Alston & Bird will match Cravath all the way up the line. As we collect more intel, we’ll update.

UPDATE: We can now safely say that the offices matching Cravath are matched up through the Class of 2009.

Meanwhile, associates in Atlanta, Charlotte, and the NC Research Triangle (the non-patent bar qualified lawyers, that is) will see entry-level move to $155K.

UPDATE: It sounds like the slighted offices are also getting compressed increases. Per a tipster:

Alston ATL associates not only get less than the cravath bumped offices, but the relative increase per year is not on par. NY 3D years go from 175 to 210; ATL, CLT, RTA go from 145 to 170.

Summers are getting a commensurate raise.

Seriously, what is it about Dallas? The cost of living there is no more onerous than in Charlotte, and is actually cheaper than Atlanta. As these raises pile up around the country, it seems no one is making out better than Dallas attorneys, who keep getting Cravath matches even from firms willing to shave for other offices.

Congrats to all on your newfound riches.

# 4 Things Recruiters Don't Want You To Know
## List of things to ask yourself when a no name recruiting company calls you coldly.

The macabre word “headhunter” found its first usage in the 1940s. Although the term seems a bit predatory despite its common usage today, the images of taking someone’s head may remain true for some recruiting shops out there. With low barrier to entry, many new shops can come and go and drag the remains of a poor associate and partner’s career in their wake out the door. I’ve compiled a list of four things to ask yourself when a no name recruiting company calls you coldly.  

1) One Cravath Please. One of the hardest aspects of career management is being honest with yourself about the strength of your candidacy. Some recruiters will pitch you firms that sound appealing but in reality are aspirational. While you were fixated on your dream firm, the recruiter was busy loading the pellets to try to hit a bullseye with a sawed-off shotgun. This serves two purposes; once you inevitably are turned down for your dream position, they will present backup options, which you will choose to settle for or move onto your next recruiter. However, since they’ve now blasted your resume off to every firm in town, they’ve made the job of the next recruiter that much harder as they will try to claim origination credit. For a busy attorney, this is a frustrating waste of time; for a swamped recruiting department, this is a waste of resources and time; for a good recruiter, this would be a waste of their reputation with the firm and make it immeasurably harder to place another candidate in the future at that firm.

2) Every Rose Has It’s Thorns. You know that firm that you love that you’ve dreamed about working for your whole life? The one you can picture the golden elevators leading up to their marbel adorned floors on the 85th floor? Someone is walking out the door as soon as you walk in. The realities of any business are that there are pros and cons that create push and pull factors in an attempt to create a kind of workforce equilibrium. From a very superficial level, if you value free evenings, you’re not going to enjoy working for high powered litigation firms in Manhattan.  As we’ve [discussed in past articles,](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/3-reasons-not-to-trust-personal-reviews/) relying on the insight of current or former attorneys at a firm can be dangerous. An unbiased recruiter will be your best insight into the firm culture, fit, and your prospects there. If a recruiter tries to sell you two tickets to paradise, they’re probably going to leave you stranded and freezing in Paradise Newfoundland. An honest recruiter will be realistic about the firm, and not just because we’re altruistic. If we place you, and you leave, we would lose out on the placement fee and engender distrust from the firm about our ability to accurately represent the firm to the candidate and appraise their interest. 

3) Tip Of The Joberg. Recruiters often serve as gatekeepers to the legal market. Though firms post their needs on their corporate websites, the posted needs are almost always just a fraction of their actual needs. The issue with listing all of these postings is that it invites a frenzy of resumes that legal departments cannot keep up with. If a recruiter tries to tell you there are no oil and gas openings in Seattle, that’s probably accurate. However, if they are trying to push you to a specific firm by telling you it’s one of your only options, and you’re not in a niche practice, the truth is that they probably have a favorable agreement with that firm. We believe in transparency and honesty which is why we list the available jobs on the market on our website, which you can [register for here](https://app.laterallink.com/register). The reality of the market is that recruiters often serve as the impetus behind new firm expansion by bringing to the firm stellar associates and partners that allow them to expand their services into new industries or take on new clients that require a higher leveraged structure. 

4) We Got The Titanic Screeners. As firms eventually collapse (see Dewey, Bingham, et al.) the rumblings often reach legal recruiters first. Recruiting firms actually play a fairly significant role in firm mergers as they facilitate the mass exodus or influx of lateral talent to the firms, creating a quandary for recruiters. By assuming that the firm will collapse, and pulling out as many attorneys as possible, we participate in facilitating a self-fulfilling prophecy that can derail the careers of the attorneys caught on the sinking ship. However, by helping a firm try to navigate around the iceberg by stemming the outflow of lateral talent, we run the risk of derailing those careers as well if the firm collapses. Instead of running this ethical trolley problem down one of the paths, we generally try to stay off the trolley altogether. If there are clear signs that the firm will collapse, we will assist attorneys in escaping the wreckage. Above all, we are clear about our expectations for the firm with our clients so that there are no surprises. The recruiting shops that show up quickly to the scene with a thousand lifeboats are they ones preying on fear in hopes of making a quick buck, and you can often use this as a gauge for their trustworthiness. 

Though the preceding paragraphs were reflective of the darker side of the legal recruiting profession, the goal was not to dismay you, but to enlighten you that there exist many superb, honest, ethical and trustworthy recruiting shops on the market – us included. Making a sound lateral move is greatly eased by using a good recruiter.

# Wachtell Partner Calls Out Entire Firm In The Most Passive-Aggressive Memo Ever

Ed Herlihy

There are some employers out there who, when surrounded by the lazy and incompetent, would dig deep into their Dale Carnegie or Six Sigma voodoo and endeavor to inspire their charges. Others just throw a temper tantrum and hurl books at coworkers. But it is the unique specimen who drafts a short memo to the entire firm imploring them to read a moderately obscure essay about how f**king incompetent they are.

[Ed Herlihy](http://www.wlrk.com/EDHerlihy/) is, apparently, of this rare last sort. And to borrow from the text he recommends, “there is a man whose form should be cast in deathless bronze.”

The longtime Wachtell partner and Executive Committee co-chair sent out an all-hands memo last week, inviting his employees to a little impromptu book club. Eschewing [Oprah’s latest selection](https://www.eurweb.com/2016/08/oprah-picks-colson-whiteheads-underground-railroad-book-club/), Herlihy opted for a classic of late nineteenth century Americana:



That is some master class passive-aggression. The first tip we received conveyed the alarm:

Partners, associates, and support staff in a furious panic to see this left on their desks.

Well, that’s assuming people sat down and read the piece, which I’ve gotta say is billable time the firm’s never getting back.

Elbert Hubbard’s “[A Message To Garcia](http://www.foundationsmag.com/garcia.html)” was famous for much of the last century as a paean to self-starters who tackle a problem head-on without asking to have their hand held throughout the process. Which is a lovely message as far as it goes. More people need to approach life as problem solvers.

Especially lawyers, who have a tendency to waste bandwidth covering their flanks and pinpointing blame, instead of simply confronting obstacles — probably of their own making — directly.

And if that’s all the story conveyed, it would be a nice little motivational piece.

But the essay was also the cheap “Golly, Aren’t Millennials The Worst?” column of its era, with an added pinch of Atlas Shrugged. Framed around the Spanish-American conflict, the piece rips employees everywhere for trying to learn their craft (“[i]t is not book-learning young men need”), as opposed to falling ass-backward into success on the strength of their “initiative.” Which, of course, is what the war hero in the story (supposedly) did and what the, by extension, equally courageous managers of the world did. It’s less “Seven Habits Of Highly Effective People” and more “John Galt Joins The Green Lantern Corps.”

Whether that’s the message Herlihy intended to send or not we don’t know — he did not respond to our email seeking comment — but it seems as though that’s what some of the Wachtell recipients took from it when they spiraled into “furious panic.”

In the meantime, I’d give double points to the associate willing to take the initiative and respond with a memo to Herlihy with this excellent story they recommend reading:



I’ve got a feeling Herlihy might think that’s pretty funny.

# It Is Really Not About Where We Do The Work
## It is about how we do the work.

Before the global pandemic took hold, lawyers in law firms and legal departments across the globe worked mainly in-person in company offices. Working remotely was the exception and not the rule. Everything changed when the global pandemic presented companies with a unique challenge — how to work productively outside the office.

For the better part of two years, lawyers and legal professionals made it work. In fact, many lawyers and legal professionals did more than make it work. They thrived in that work environment. Now? They cannot imagine going back to the way things were.
I recently attended a legal conference where remote work was the topic of conversation. As I sat back and listened, it struck me that some of the more senior attorneys had romanticized work life in the office before the global pandemic. They talked about how working in the office was important because it was the only way to build the kind of camaraderie and closeness that improves job satisfaction and productivity in the office.
I thought back on my own days working as a junior attorney, but could not recall the working environment that these other senior attorneys were describing. I did not recall senior lawyers with open doors and unlimited time to sit back to discuss legal problems.
It was in that moment that I came to a realization. It is not about where we do the work. It is about how we do the work. It does not matter whether we are working in-person or in a remote environment. Building camaraderie is important, but it requires intentionality.
What Is Camaraderie?
Camaraderie is a feeling of friendship and trust that can take hold and grow when people spend time working together.
- It can help the team perform more efficiently.
- It can improve team work by maximizing collaboration.
- It can boost employee retention rates.
How Can You Build Office Camaraderie?
- You can encourage the use of video chat for meetings. After all, it is easier to bond with people when you communicate with voices with faces. It is also helps when you can hear words and see body language.
-  You can create a group chat. You can do it using your phone or through software platforms like Slack. Giving your team a place to have conversations not centered on work where they can get to know each other and bond over shared experiences is important.
- You can encourage casual conversation. Just because you provide a way for conversation to occur does not mean it will. You can encourage it by just asking people how they are doing and sharing something personal.
- You can make time for recurring social gatherings. They can be in-person lunches or “virtual drinks.” Regular check-ins with the group or individual team members can reduce feelings of isolation.
- You can lead by example. You have to exhibit the behavior you want to see from others. You have to be willing to attend social meetings and share things about your personal life if you want your team to feel comfortable doing the same thing.
- Finally, you can resist the urge to micromanage. Allow your team to exercise autonomy. Show them you have faith in them and their ability to get the work done and don’t constantly check in.
Because of the global pandemic, lawyers and legal professionals stepped up and showed what is possible.
We cannot turn back time. We can only move forward. As we do, let us not forget the lessons we have learned along the way.

# Remaining Confident In The Face Of Change: Practical Law

[](https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/400015798;152149592;h)The changes in regulatory and enforcement priorities usually brought with each new incoming presidential administration can signal a time of confusion and delays as new federal authorities — from cabinet members down to front-line regulators — step in, assess the landscape, and start about their work.

But what does that mean to certain industries and the legal counsel and law firms that advise those industries?

Further, given the focus on deregulation and rule easement already voiced by the new administration of President Donald Trump, the regulatory shift this time around may be greater than any time in recent history.

“I think the transition from the Obama administration to a Trump administration is probably more significant and is likely to have a greater impact than potentially ever before,” says Scott Mason, a senior policy advisor with the Public Policy & Regulation Group in Holland & Knight’s Washington, D.C., office, who focuses primarily on the intersection between Capitol Hill and the White House on major policy initiatives and other key priorities. (Mason was also a member of Trump’s transition team.)

Mason spoke to Practical Law about how this shifting landscape for regulations and federal rules may impact law firms and leave them scrambling for ways they can benefit in the current environment. And one area that is really going to feel that change is regulation, Mason adds.

“I think some of the things Trump has proposed has changed the tone already,” he notes. “For example, you’ve seen that, under Trump’s order, that for every new regulation imposed, you’ve got to take out two. Then also, he assigned to each of the Cabinet secretaries a 90-day window for them to, quite frankly, summarize the lists of regulations in their agencies that they are working on or would like to eventually do away with, and then report back to him on it. That’s a significant change.”

Indeed, Practical Law’s attributes take on more importance in today’s turbulent and fast-moving legal environment, where change may be the only constant. As the pressures grow greater on lawyers to address the needs of their clients in a timely, less expensive, and more encompassing way, certain practice areas — such as Capital Markets and Corporate Governance, Finance, or Intellectual Property and Technology — are themselves changing dramatically as well.

Mason further suggests the changing regulatory environment could be a boom for some law firms, but only if they are ready for it and have access to the tools that let them take advantage of such opportunities. “Larger law firms that have significantly built-up policy shops are in an extraordinary position to benefit because they allow firms to broaden their ability to service their customers, all of whom are going to be impacted by government in some way, shape, or form,” he explains. “And these public policy shops work hand-in-hand with a law firm’s lawyers, looking for opportunities to better serve clients.”

That means being able to leverage the legal acumen needed through products like Practical Law is even more important during uncertain times such as these. And given these opportunities for the fleet-footed, law firms must ask themselves, what do we need to access so we are in the best position to ensure success for our clients?

Being able to answer that question is key to operating in the legal market with confidence, says Josias “Joe” Dewey, a financial services and real estate attorney who is the practice group leader of Holland & Knight’s Miami Real Estate Practice Group. (He is also considered one of the foremost thought leaders on blockchain technology.)

“It’s a differentiator — it really is,” Dewey says of Practical Law. “It’s targeted specifically to be a practical resource that allows a lawyer to leverage Practical Law’s legal know-how to improve the work product and give the client a better result in the end.”

Of course, the best way to serve your clients is to make sure you know what is happening in impacted industries, such as healthcare, banking, or taxation that will be undergoing a lot of regulatory upheaval in the coming months and years. “It gets back to the old adage,” Mason says. “If you’re not at the table, then you’re on the menu.”

Dewey agrees and discusses how, in these uncertain times, it’s even more important to have resources and research that you can trust to be up-to-date, timely, and pertinent to your task at hand. Being a financial services and real estate lawyer, Dewey says his practice is naturally “heavily document-oriented” and his use of Practical Law really helps him stay on top of things.

Dewey says he primarily uses Practical Law in his document creation work; for example, to help him articulate a provision in a contract he wants to explain further. Practical Law annotated Standard Documents and Clauses are especially valuable to him in his work and even are a source of continual surprise. “Even after 19 years, it seems that every time I use [Practical Law], I learn something new from the materials.”

Further, the Practical Law search mechanics are so easy that Dewey has little trouble finding a pertinent example of the provision he is looking for in another contract to see how it is adapted there, he says, adding that the Practical Law drafting notes and negotiation tips are so good that “my end product is always much better.”

Practical Law gives Dewey something he says is very valuable in daily practice management: Confidence. “Because of the quality materials and the ease of which I can use them, it makes me more confident in the work product I am producing for the client,” he explains. “If you don’t have this kind of confidence in your research and materials, it can really bog you down in your work, because you’re second-guessing every little thing and hours are wasted.”

For Holland & Knight’s associates, Practical Law offers another benefit: Education. “Given our business constraints and the efficiencies we want to implement, to be able to use this product to help our associates reach a baseline of needed knowledge is incredibly important,” Dewey notes. And the associates themselves have really taken to Practical Law Checklists that allow them to tick off necessary items, tasks, or approvals in the contracting process, he adds. “Yes, they get very used to those checklists!”

With a team of over 230 attorney editors, Practical Law creates of standard documents, checklists, legal updates, how-to guides, and more. Holland & Knight attorneys — like many of the 85% of Am Law 200 firms that subscribe to Practical Law — use this maintained and trusted legal know-how offering to practice more efficiently and add more value for clients in an ever-changing legal landscape.

# Firm That Raised Pay In New York Spreads The Love Nationwide
## Is the trend of nationwide pay raises gaining momentum?

There’s a strong case to be made that the [$180K pay scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) established by Cravath [should not go nationwide](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/no-your-office-doesnt-deserve-the-ny-to-180-raise/). There are major differences between NYC and other legal markets, including [cost of living](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/is-ny-to-180k-hurting-the-new-york-market/), hours worked, and revenue generated.

Some firms are raising pay to the same scale in all U.S. offices, while other firms are paying different salaries in different cities. Looking at today’s pay raise news, for example, we see [WilmerHale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-top-tier-firm-raises-salaries/) taking the former approach and [King & Spalding](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/firm-with-big-profits-per-partner-shares-the-riches-in-new-york/) taking the latter.

Here’s a firm that started out in one camp and just moved into the other: Brown Rudnick. Last week, we reported on the firm raising salaries, but [only in New York](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/firm-announces-raises-kinda-screws-over-the-older-folks/). Just in time for the weekend, the firm announced it’s raising salaries nationwide (emphasis in original memo):

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
We are pleased to announce that, effective as of July 1, 2016, our annual base pay structure for associates in all of our U.S. offices will be as follows:

It then pastes in the familiar salary scale (although topping out at $300K for seventh-years rather than $315K for eighth-years). The effective date is the standard July 1, and summer and incoming associates get the bump too. Associate compensation in European offices is being “actively evaluat[ed].”

Here’s the reaction of one delighted source:

BR has matched in [ALL U.S. offices](http://www.brownrudnick.com/locations) [i.e., Boston, Hartford, New York, Orange County, Providence, and Washington, D.C.]. Associates were getting frustrated with the wait and are thrilled that the news came before the weekend. Associates outside of New York go ‘off market’ as fourth years, so for mid-level and senior associates, this is a huge bump!

Nobody was expecting it. Some people thought they would bump up but not match. Certainly nobody thought they would match all offices. I think it was taking them a while to figure out what was going on in Hartford.

I’m sure the summers are also happy with the unexpected increase as well!

# Law Firms Need To Be Better To Job Candidates
## Even though partners have a number of responsibilities, they should try to conduct the hiring process quickly and notify candidates of their decisions as soon as possible.

As many readers of this column know from firsthand experience, getting hired by a law firm is a brutal process. Job applicants often need to interview with many attorneys, and sometimes must appear at a law office three or more times to be interviewed for a job. In addition, job applicants often need to fill out long conflicts forms, background check forms, and other documents in order to be hired by a firm. Perhaps the worst part of the hiring process is how long it often takes to get hired. As someone who has been on both sides of the process, I understand firsthand how law firms need to respond faster and be more respectful to job applicants out of courtesy and to reduce the stress of applying for a job.

[Throughout my career](https://www.rothmanlawyer.com/jordan-rothman/), I have been both a job seeker and an individual tasked with reviewing applicants for jobs at the firms at which I worked. It has always been very frustrating to observe how long it usually takes for the hiring process for a law firm to take place. Although some job hunts can take less than a month, I have seen job searches take as long as six months. During the hiring process, numerous job candidates are left in limbo as they nervously await a decision from the firm that they hope to join.

I remember earlier in my career when I was a job candidate and had interviewed at a variety of firms. For months, I waited in trepidation. I checked my emails religiously and made sure my voicemail box was empty so I could receive messages from firms. Not a day passed that I didn’t think about my job search, and most days, I constantly thought about my experiences at interviews and my chances of getting hired at a firm.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Given that the hiring process is such a trying time for many attorneys, you would think that firms would prioritize interviewing candidates as soon as possible and notifying everyone within a few days about whether they have been selected for a job. However, that is often not the case.

At many of the firms at which I worked, partners did not prioritize the hiring process and delayed responding to the candidates they had interviewed. I understand some of the reasons why partners take such a long time to respond to job candidates. For one, partners have a number of competing obligations, the most critical of which is billing hours and making money. Although adding personnel can lead to increases in revenue, taking the time to interview candidates in the short term can take time away from billing hours. In addition, law firms operate on cycles, and some periods, such as the holidays and the time leading up to Labor Day, may be slower at a shop, and many key partners may be away. As such, it is sometimes unavoidable for partners to take weeks and months to respond to job candidates.

However, partners need to understand that job candidates are often extremely stressed out about the hiring process and would like a decision as soon as possible. This is even more true for attorneys who have been laid off and simply want the nightmare of being axed to end. As a result, partners need to have compassion and factor in the stress of job candidates when deciding on the timing of a hiring process.

In addition, partners should try to minimize the amount of trips a job candidate needs to make to a firm while interviewing for a position. Every time applicants show up for interviews, they need to take time off from their current jobs (which could arouse suspicions with their current bosses) and make other arrangements. I once had to travel to a firm three times to meet with attorneys during a job search, and the last time was for a ten-minute interview with one person! Firms should try to do screening interviews by phone whenever possible.

In addition, firms should not grant interviews out of kindness or because of office politics when there is no chance the candidate will be hired. Sometimes, I have seen firms offer interviews to a client’s relative just to show the client they care about them, and this is usually fine. However, one time, I was tasked with interviewing a job candidate after our firm had experienced rounds of layoffs and financial uncertainty. There was no way we would hire new people in this situation, but our firm still “interviewed” a candidate since this person had connections to one of the partners. All things being considered, the kinder option might have been to not waste the candidate’s time with an interview when there was no way that candidate was going to be hired by our firm at that time.

All told, the hiring process at many firms is brutal, and one of the worst parts about this process is how long it typically takes to hear back from firms. The job search often takes months, and job candidates often need to attend multiple interviews and won’t hear updates throughout the process. Even though partners have a number of responsibilities, they should try to conduct the hiring process quickly and notify candidates of their decisions as soon as possible.

# Hybrid Work Model Raises Interesting Challenges When It Comes To Billing
## Keeping track of what who does what.

It seems as though most lawyers are eager to move to a hybrid work model that allows out-of-office working for one or two days a week. [And they’re willing to sacrifice raises for it](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/return-to-the-office-how-much-money-would-it-take-for-lawyers-to-give-up-remote-flexibility/).

But while attorneys may be eyeing a bold new world that combines the benefits of a communal office structure with the technological gains of a robust COVID-inspired remote office infrastructure, firms are worried about how this new model will impact billing.

It’s not that firms think attorneys will bill less from home — we already learned during the pandemic that the billing doesn’t stop and may actually increase. But there are serious concerns about what working from home does to workflow and whether or not it leads associates to take on more work that would customarily be performed much cheaper by support staff.

Workflow, productivity, and profitability software company [BigHand](https://www.bighand.com/en-us/) just released [a report](https://www2.bighand.com/atl-workflow-report) compiling the results of almost 1000 respondents from firms in North America, the UK, and APAC. And what firms are worried about is a confluence of retiring staff and associates billing for administrative tasks they’re taking on themselves.

Well, it’s not all about retirement:



Yes, firms cut back on staff during the pandemic. It’s a perverse firm tradition to wait until an economic downturn to cut back on staff as opposed to doing it in a boom when those folks can more easily find another job. From the firm’s perspective they feel they can afford underutilized staff in the good times, but that doesn’t make it sting any less when the firm downsizes in a recession.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Still, 56 percent of North America respondents and 49 percent of UK respondents expect between 20 and 40 percent of their support staff to retire in the next five years. And 61 percent of North America and 64 percent of UK firms expect to lose the same range of staff through natural attrition over the next five years.

So with staff leaving and attorneys working from home…

Hybrid working raises challenges for 30% of NA firms, 35% of UK firms and 53% of APAC firms, there are concerns regarding the need for lawyers to undertake more administrative work instead of delegating to support staff. In NA, 36% cite the difficulty of ensuring an even distribution of work between support staff, as well as 31% of UK firms and 38% of APAC firms.

It’s difficult enough to rewire a young lawyer to delegate copy jobs when the staff is sitting right outside the office. It must be near impossible to get lawyers to hand off admin tasks to someone existing in the cloud. Yet that’s going to become an issue as clients demand efficiency.

The report talks about this problem in terms of a decline in billable hours — noting that 52 percent responded that hours had either declined or stayed the same. The more dramatic figure to me is that this means 48 percent saw an increase, which makes me wonder if demand was really up or if associates just lumped more administrative tasks into their overall figures. Because as bad as associates losing billable time to preventable work might be, associates passing work over to clients that could be more efficiently handled by others would be worse.

Staying on top of that’s going to require firms to manage workflow and deliver the sort of transparency needed to please clients. But right now it looks like a lot of that is being handled on the fly.



And that’s going to be a bigger deal when everyone’s not under the same roof. Some sort of “automated reporting on the volume and types of tasks, support staff capacity and utilization and the speed of turnaround” is going to be essential at that point. If it isn’t already.

There’s a lot more in this report — that’s just what jumped out at me. You can check out [the whole thing here](https://www2.bighand.com/atl-workflow-report).

# Change In Vacation Policy Causes Consternation At Biglaw Firm
## 'Unlimited' isn't always a good thing.

On paper, there isn’t anything *wrong* with what’s going on at Shearman & Sterling. The firm recently announced they were moving away from a specific number of vacation days for associates (4 weeks) and transitioning to an unlimited number of vacation days. Well, to be precise, “as much paid vacation time as you deem consistent with your seniority while considering the firm’s needs and client demands.” That just hits slightly different, don’t it?

In the email announcing the policy change, Shearman leadership points to the “greater flexibility” the new vacation rules allow and touts that the “health and wellbeing of our people is our top priority.” They also encourage taking “at least one of your vacations each year for a meaningful period of time in duration as short vacations do not always provide enough time to fully recharge.” But despite this language, not everyone is feeling it.

Just take a look at some of the salty tipsters reacting to the new policy:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
They claim it is for the well-being of the lawyers, but it is obviously intended to get us to work more and take fewer vacations.  Please note that the email says we are encourages to take at least one week-long vacation.  But every associate I know was already taking multiple week-long vacations each year—this is clearly the firm hinting to us that more than one long vacation is no longer encouraged.  This shit is ridiculous and law students should know about this sort of thing when choosing a firm.  Hopefully they won’t pick this one.

This [isn’t the first time](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/another-firm-offers-unlimited-vacation-for-associates/?rf=1) (or [second](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/03/latham-lathams-accrued-vacation/) or even [third](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/unlimited-vacation-policies-can-be-bad-for-associates/)) Above the Law has written about the move to unlimited vacation days in Biglaw — and the backlash to the move. The industry is based on billable hours, so there will always be a push and pull when there’s a change to that. And there’s historically been a good deal of skepticism across the entire industry about “unlimited” vacation when most aren’t in a position to take the previously offered four weeks — now they just won’t get an extra payout for unused days off.

If Shearman & Sterling is serious that the change is meant for “flexibility” and for associates’ “well-being” they have to up the messaging. Because right now, there’s a lot of side eye amongst the rank and file associates.

# Are Billing Rates Too Darn High?

A Supreme Court expansion proposal is officially out there. It’s not going to pass, it’s not a particularly good idea, but might proposing it be a smart tactic? Meanwhile, as we get new insights into Biglaw finances from the Am Law 100 release, we got a hefty clue into Covington & Burling’s business plan when we learned Eric Holder’s hourly rate. Is this too much to bill a client or are people overreacting? Finally, the bonus wars continue, but are counsel and income partners getting left out?

# Yes, Prosecutors Are Still Trying To Hold Someone Accountable For Dewey & LeBoeuf's Failure
## The Biglaw retrial rolls on.

I do recall at least one occasion discussing some of the specific [accounting] entries and asking if Joel [Sanders] was on board with this, meaning, has he approved this or initiated this action. [Frank Canellas] said ‘Yes.’ In fact, I think he said ‘Oh yeah.’

—Thomas Mullikin, former controller of the failed Biglaw firm Dewey & LeBoeuf, in testimony this week in the retrial of former Dewey execs, Joel Sanders and Stephen DiCarmine, on fraud and conspiracy charges. Mullikin worked directly under former finance director Frank Canellas, and both Mullikin and Canellas are among the government cooperators who’ve pled guilty to charges related to the case. [Accounting irregularities](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/did-disgruntled-partners-lead-to-the-dewey-prosecution/) that allegedly inflated the firm’s bottom line and encouraged investors and banks to sink money into the firm before its 2012 collapse are at the heart of the case. Sanders’s and DiCarmine’s [2015 trial](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/dewey-know-why-theres-a-retrial/) on charges related to the firm’s downfall (which included as a defendant former Dewey Chairman Steven Davis as a defendant, who has since negotiated a deferred prosecution agreement) resulted in a [mistrial](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/10/dewey-mistrial/) on the majority of charges.

# Centering On Mentoring
## When done effectively, mentoring can benefit all in-house lawyers regardless of experience level.

As leaders of in-house legal departments, we should all care about creating an environment where effective mentoring is possible. Successful leaders of in-house legal teams focus on the personal growth of individual team members, but successful leaders also focus on the personal growth of the legal team as a whole. When done effectively, mentoring can benefit all in-house lawyers regardless of experience level and can play an important part in developing a strong legal team which, in turn, can contribute to the overall success of the organization.

Over the course of my professional career, I have participated — as a mentee and as a mentor — in many mentorship programs. While I have valued those formal mentoring programs and the relationships that resulted from them, I have valued most those mentoring relationships that formed outside of any formal organized program. These informal mentoring relationships have developed and grown over time without conscious effort. Because of that natural human tendency to seek guidance, I have learned from others, and I have supported the growth and development of those who have surrounded me.

What Allows This To Happen?

When individuals work in a supportive environment, it is possible to connect with other individuals with whom you can share interests and with whom you can have mutual respect. It is in these environments where mentoring relationships flourish and grow.

When Does This Happen?

Shared goals and interests. When individuals within a group share common goals and interests, mentoring relationships can form organically. Within any group, there are often individuals who naturally assume leadership roles. Those individuals who assume those roles often offer guidance, support, and advice. When these individuals are willing to provide that support and guidance, others in the group naturally begin gravitating toward those leaders for help and advice.

Mutual respect. When individuals within a group respect each other’s skills and knowledge, they are more likely to seek guidance and mentoring. Mutual respect fosters an environment where people are open to sharing and receiving knowledge, leading to mentoring relationships.

Supportive group environment. When individuals find themselves in a positive and supportive group environment, individuals within that group may feel encouraged to help each other. In such an environment, mentoring relationships can naturally develop, with experienced members offering guidance to those who are less experienced or knowledgeable.

Who Serves In The Role Of Mentor In This Supportive Environment?

It is not always who you may think. Mentors are not always older, more experienced professionals at the highest levels of the organization. As Ashley Herd, founder of Manager Method, recently shared on her YouTube channel, you “don’t have to look ‘up’ to find people who will give you the best advice, support, and leadership.”

[In her insightful video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibTFY9vr2D4), Ashley explored the unconventional, yet powerful, realm of mentorship and shared a personal experience that sheds light on why the best mentor might just have an “assistant” title rather than a “chief” title.

How Can This Happen?

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
People have diverse perspectives. Different people bring diverse perspectives to the table. Sometimes, people at the same level or even below can offer unique viewpoints that those in higher positions might miss.

Personal connection exists at all levels. Support and understanding can come from people regardless of title or rank who are personally connected to you, to your situation, or have faced similar challenges.

Leadership exists regardless of title or rank. Leadership is not confined to specific levels within an organization. Leadership skills can be demonstrated by anyone who shows initiative, guides others, and inspires positive change.

Emotional intelligence exists at all levels. People with high emotional intelligence can provide excellent support and advice. Empathy, understanding, and the ability to relate to others’ emotions are qualities that can exist at any level.

# Nationwide Layoff Watch: Mass Lateral Hire, Mass Support-Staff Fire
## This deal saved many jobs, but not all of them.

Last summer, when Andrews Kurth engaged in a [mass lateral hire](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/is-a-merger-in-the-cards-for-this-troubled-law-firm/) of 55 lawyers from former IP powerhouse Kenyon & Kenyon, it brought a long-running saga to a happy conclusion. Kenyon & Kenyon had been swirling the drain for quite some time, so it was nice to see a stronger and more successful firm come to its rescue — and to the rescue of lawyers who otherwise would have found themselves unemployed.

But we noted some open questions at the time. In her [story](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/is-a-merger-in-the-cards-for-this-troubled-law-firm/) on the deal, my colleague Kathryn Rubino had this as her final line: “As of yet there’s no word on the fate of Kenyon staff members.”

As it turns out, some of those staffers got hired by [Andrews Kurth Kenyon](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/andrews-kurth-llp/). And now, some of those staffers are getting fired. Tipsters recently shared with us the following information about staff layoffs at the firm:

1. At least 18 staffers have been laid off at Andrews Kurth Kenyon.

2. The layoffs were concentrated in the New York office and focused on legacy Kenyon staff.

3. Affected departments included business development, paralegals, IT, finance, and office management.

4. The affected individuals are being provided with severance (although specific arrangements are not known).

5. Some of the affected individuals feel that the firm made misrepresentations to them regarding job security (specifically, that there would be no layoffs in the wake of the Kenyon deal).

6. Some of the affected individuals are considering legal action against the firm.

We reached out to the firm for comment. Andrews Kurth Kenyon declined to address the specific points raised above, but managing partner [Bob Jewell](http://www.andrewskurth.com/people-RobertVJewell.html) had this to say: “We place the highest value on the commitment and hard work that our people have dedicated to building this law firm. In order to remain competitive and financially healthy, we are constantly reviewing head count and staffing as they relate to the demand for legal services. Out of respect for our workforce, we do not comment on human resources matters.”

I’m not an employment lawyer — unlike the contributors to [On The Job](https://abovethelaw.com/on-the-job/), Above the Law’s [new employment law center](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/on-the-job-above-the-laws-new-employment-law-center/) — so take my opinion with a grain of salt. But based on what we currently know, I think suing the firm would be an uphill climb. Support staffers generally do not have employment contracts, making them “at will” employees; assuming no violation of a specific federal or state law (e.g., Title VII), it would be tough for them to sue based on some informal promise of continued employment. (And the staffers in question did receive continued employment, at least for a time; the mass lateral hire took place more than six months ago.)

Legalities aside, it’s unfortunate news for the laid-off staffers. But at least they enter what seems to be a decent job market, with an impressive past employer on their résumés. We wish them the best of luck as they seek new opportunities, whether in the legal profession or otherwise.

# ...And Now The Inevitable Ethics Complaint Against Trump's Lawyer

When the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/11/us/politics/trump-lawyer-marc-kasowitz.html) that Trump’s personal attorney Marc Kasowitz was telling White House aides [not to retain their own counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/is-marc-kasowitz-drunk-on-his-own-power/), it seemed like the sort of detail that we’d hear more about down the road. While most Americans think “legal ethics” is an oxymoron, the profession does take it pretty seriously, and “giving legal advice to people who aren’t your client” is one of those maxims that matter a lot. Especially in potential criminal matters. After all, there’s that whole Upjohn thing that structured finance attorneys may only remember vaguely from law school, but white-collar litigators have tattooed on their backs.

Maybe that’s why people hire experienced criminal defense lawyers and not real estate litigators when they’re embroiled — target or not — in a criminal probe? Just a thought.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
So it comes as little surprise that it took less than a week after this broke for someone to lodge the formal ethical complaint against Kasowitz. Now comes the non-partisan [Campaign for Accountability](https://campaignforaccountability.org) with [a bar complaint](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/and-now-the-inevitable-ethics-complaint-against-trumps-lawyer/2/) alleging breaches of both Rule 4.3 and Rule 5.5(a) regarding the unauthorized practice of law. [UPDATE: There’s also a complaint lodged with the First Department in New York over this conduct. You can [read it here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/emqy128l13j2do0/Legal%20ethics%20complaint%20against%20Marc%20Kasowitz%20-%20Redacted.pdf?dl=0).]

From the organization’s press release:

District of Columbia Professional Rule of Conduct 5.5(a) provides “a lawyer shall not practice law in a jurisdiction where doing so violates the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction.” Rule 4.3 prohibits lawyers from offering any unrepresented party who has a potential conflict of interest with the lawyer’s own client with any advice other than that they retain counsel.

Well, that’s certainly what the Times report suggested, and while Kasowitz has — through a spokesperson — denied the accuracy of that article, he wasn’t able to offer a counter-narrative of what he really said.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Let’s all cool our jets here. While this was undeniably poor judgment on his part if true, it doesn’t necessarily rise to something unethical. It all depends on who these anonymous staffers were. If Kasowitz is telling a national security staffer who sat in on multiple meetings between Trump and Michael Flynn or that meeting with Kislyak where Trump handed over classified material for the laughs, then telling them not to hire an attorney is obviously a breach of Rule 4.3. But if he told a gathering of admins charged with robosigning physical fitness certificates for elementary schoolers that they don’t need lawyers, it’s hard to imagine that would meet the “knows or reasonably should know” of a potential conflict standard. There are a lot of moving parts in the White House, and not everyone has even a tangential relationship to the subject of the investigation.

That said, this is what a disciplinary committee should try to get to the bottom of, if only to impress upon attorneys that Rule 4.3 is serious and should be approached with an abundance of caution. But for those hoping for an edict tagging someone close to the president as “unethical,” this complaint probably isn’t going very far. These anonymous staffers cited in the Times piece presumably enjoy remaining employed, making it hard to believe that if they’ll come forward and testify — whether or not they’re the sort of employees likely to have a conflict. Without that testimony, this isn’t much to go on.

Leaving us, fairly or not, with a complaint that provides more theatrical weight than legal significance. A fitting result for this whole administration so far.

(The full complaint is available on the next page…)

# Power Niche Marketing: Failure Should Not Be Able To Stop You – More Statistical Thinking
## Start to embrace your failures -- because without them you will not succeed.

My last article made the point that marketing is essentially a game of pure statistics. I want to discuss in this article, something else that grows out of the statistical nature of marketing.

If you accept that marketing is all about statistics, then you can start thinking of it like a sport in a way. A batter who bats 333 is incredibly good — actually a great hitter. Yet, two out of three times, he strikes out!!!

Is he sitting there bumming out about his failures? Maybe yes, but it is a dumb emotion when he is doing better than almost every batter in history.

You will have the same thing going on. Most of your marketing attempts — especially at first — will end in failure. Indeed, the odds are that 99%, or even 100%, of your attempts will fail for quite a while.

This is inherently, and intensively, depressing. You get your hopes up, time and again, and your hopes get dashed. What a bummer.

Indeed, when I was starting out to try to do marketing, and it was failure after failure, day after day, and week after week, and even month after month, there were days I just wanted to give up and crawl into the fetal position and lie under my desk. Thankfully, my Marketing Director was tough as nails and she wouldn’t let me lay down to die.

In any case, if you accept what I am telling you about statistics, then you recognize that this is just what happens. You can bum out for a few minutes — like that great batter probably does when he strikes out — but then you dust yourself off, and step up to the plate again.

Being honest with myself, and you with yourself, there is no way that my intellectual crap about statistics is going to cheer you up when you do everything right and just don’t get the client. It is depressing — there is no doubt about that. Indeed, if you failed in clinching a major deal, and you come home all miserable and your wife/husband says to you: “Well, honey, you know it is all a game of statistics like that annoying guy said in his column, so you know that this kind of thing is going to happen”, you will probably have a huge fight with your wife/husband that night.

So what do you do to protect against failure getting you down? I guess I don’t have a great magic bullet here, but maybe consider:

Think of Churchill, and “never ever ever give up…..”

Or Tim Allen in Galaxy Quest and “never give up – never surrender.”

Or think of Roosevelt and be “the man in the arena” who just got clubbed in the head, and is bleeding, but getting up anyway! And also be proud that you are not “one of those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.” [Here](http://www.theodore-roosevelt.com/trsorbonnespeech.html) is a the full quote, which is one of my favorites.

Or do what I do, and drink some single malt scotch and watch an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie that I have seen a dozen times before.

Then, once you have gotten past the sharpness of negative emotion, carefully analyze why you failed, without bullshitting yourself, and perhaps adjust your style and/or your message. Just like that great batter presumably does after he strikes out.

When this happens to me, and even today it still happens a fair amount, I beat myself up for my errors (with a pretty rough drubbing), and then I just keep moving along and I am immediately excited about the next prospect.

If you understand my message, then you will not think of this as a somewhat dreary article — and instead, you will start to embrace your failures — because without them you will not succeed. I will end with (another) favorite quote — this one from John Wooden — who says that “the team that makes the most mistakes usually wins, because doers make mistakes.” That is the team that is pushing the envelope and taking the necessary chances, some of which will fail but some of which will succeed.

# Kamala Harris Gets Dragged Into DLA Piper Sexual Assault Controversy

Senator Kamala Harris (Photo by NOAH BERGER/AFP/Getty Images)

Kamala Harris is in a bit of a sticky situation.

The presidential hopeful has [publicly come out in opposition](https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-blumenthal-to-jpmorgan-chase-ceo-jamie-dimon-forced-arbitration-is-unfair-and-unjust) to mandatory arbitration agreements. Indeed, she joined Senator Richard Blumenthal urging JPMorgan Chase to eliminate forced arbitration, saying at the time:

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
“One of the fundamental principles of our democracy is that everyone should get their day in court. Forced arbitration deprives Americans of that basic right.”

And that’s a great, liberal stance to take! Unfortunately for the senator, DLA Piper feels very, very differently. See DLA is where Harris’s husband, [Douglas Emhoff](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/people/e/emhoff-douglas-c/), is a partner. And the firm’s stance on mandatory arbitration has been in the news lately — a partner at DLA, Vanina Guerrero, [alleges the co-managing partner of the firm’s Silicon Valley office, Louis Lehot, repeatedly sexually assaulted her,](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/dla-piper-partner-accused-of-sexual-assault-by-fellow-partner/) beginning shortly after she began working for the firm in 2018. Last week Guerrero penned an open letter asking the firm to release her from their forced arbitration agreement so she’d be free to pursue her claims in open court. The firm has yet to respond to Guerrero’s request to be let out of the mandatory arbitration agreement, saying only that they are aware of the allegations against Lehot and are investigating.

Indeed, DLA Piper has defended their use of mandatory arbitration before. When law school student activists[ organized a #DumpDLA](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/one-biglaw-firm-refuses-to-do-away-with-forced-arbitration-agreements/) campaign over their arbitration stance, the firm put out a fluffy statement defending arbitration conflating the benefits some people get from arbitration as an option and ignoring the harms of forcing all their employees to use that as their exclusive mechanism for dispute resolution. Their stance didn’t waiver amidst[ protests](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/law-school-students-are-taking-to-the-street-over-biglaw-firms-with-mandatory-arbitration-agreements/) against mandatory arbitration outside of their office.

All of which sets the stage for the latest move. Guerrero’s attorney, [Jeanne Christensen](https://www.wigdorlaw.com/portfolio/jeanne-m-christensen/) partner at Wigdor, [wrote an open letter](https://medium.com/@Jeannechristensen/letter-to-sen-kamala-harris-forced-arbitration-at-dla-piper-9117fd3f5ed2) to Harris asking her to condemn the use of mandatory arbitration agreements at DLA Piper:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
I am sure you would agree that silencing women through forced arbitration must end. No female employee, including a new partner, would knowingly agree to waive her right to our court system for claims involving sexual assault, battery or rape. Given your profile as a candidate for the Democratic nominee for President of the United States, you are in a unique position to condemn the actions of DLA Piper and make clear that mandatory arbitration must stop. We, therefore, urge you to publicly support the notion that all women who work at DLA Piper deserve to hear allegations about unlawful sexual conduct by male employees.

And, you have to give it to Christensen, this is a smart play. Legally, they don’t have a way into court unless DLA waives the arbitration agreement. So turning up the pressure on the firm is really their best bet, and using a high profile partner and his higher profile spouse to do so keeps the conversation about sexual assault and mandatory arbitration going and gives it the widest possible audience.

Now [some have argued](https://twitter.com/ElieNYC/status/1181580876502712325?s=20) it isn’t fair to hold Harris responsible for the actions of her husband and his firm. But Harris willingly waded into the mandatory arbitration waters when JP Morgan Chase was doing it. Why wouldn’t it be okay to now ask Harris if her stance on mandatory arbitration is universal or if it stops when her family gets some tangential benefit from the agreement? And here’s the thing, she can condemn DLA — no one has to agree with their spouse 100 percent of the time and with their spouse’s law firm even less of the time. But asking Harris this question to better get a sense of the contours of her position on mandatory arbitration agreements is more than a fair question for someone who wants to be president.

And Harris has issued a statement, via her communications director, Lily Adams:

“Senator Harris has been and continues to be a staunch advocate for survivors and believes all people must be guaranteed their day in court. She has long opposed forced arbitration agreements and that position has not changed and she does not believe this is any exception.”

# Firms Laying Off Associates Have Misread The Market

The steady drumbeat of [stealth](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/biglaw-firm-makes-2-rounds-stealth-layoffs-billable-work-disappears-gunderson/) and [not-so-stealth](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/shearman-sterling-associate-layoffs/) layoffs over the last six months [struck terror](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/are-you-a-biglaw-associate-with-low-hours-sorry-but-theres-a-target-on-your-back/) into the hearts of associates everywhere. [Doom and gloom predictions](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/more-associate-cuts-ahead-thanks-to-biglaws-negative-financial-outlook/) dominated industry coverage. When would the next shoe drop?

And then it… didn’t.

Because — [as some of us kept saying](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/for-all-the-layoff-talk-most-law-firms-are-holding-steady-and-banking-on-swift-recovery/) — the economic hard times appeared to be localized to firms heavily servicing the tech sector. Despite the best efforts of the Federal Reserve, the “Little Recession That Couldn’t” [never progressed beyond the hypothetical](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2023/2/3/23584939/jobs-report-economy-federal-reserve-inflation-recession-jay-powell). Now — finally — the Fed seems to realize that the inflationary bump produced by Putin invading Ukraine and the Bird Flu killing off egg-laying hens has [little to do with fiscal policy](https://twitter.com/JosephPatrice/status/1633134013249384448?s=20). If this marks an end to their interest rate death drive, things should soon get back on track.

Which tracks the findings of the [Leopard State of the Industry Report](https://www.leopardsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/StateofLegalIndustryReport2022.pdf) released this week. As the [American Lawyer wrote](https://www.law.com/2023/03/08/can-law-firms-hold-the-line-on-layoffs-and-billing-rates-in-2023/):

“Across many industries, hiring is firm, which complicates the fix to inflation by the Federal Reserve. The higher interest rates caused a pullback on M&A work, but today’s mortgage rate of 6.6% is significantly lower than the 8% rate that was available in 2000,” the report states. “Once the initial shock of higher rates is absorbed, M&A will return, and firms will seek those associates again. It might be wise for firms to hold on to these specialists now, because the need will return, and luring them back after layoffs can be brutal.”

Especially in light of that forecast, law firms should “hit pause” on fee increases, the authors also wrote.

There’s no evidence-based reason for M&A to be slumping other than the fear that the rate hikes weren’t stopping. If they reach a soft landing soon, it’s game on!

But let’s push back on the second half of this conclusion.

Inflation may not be a byproduct of an overheated economy right now, but it did happen. Law firms are entitled to catch up after [holding the line last year](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/2023/02/15/40-percent-law-firms-not-raised-rates/). Firms took it on the chin so clients didn’t have to and now it’s time to pay that back.

Moreover, rates have to go up because clients are not just paying for hours billed in Q3, they’re reimbursing the firm a share of what it’s costing to keep that expertise on staff and not generating revenue in Q1. Everyone wants the firm to be fully primed and ready to go on July 1, and part of that is guaranteeing there isn’t a staffing shortfall on June 30.

Don’t get greedy about it. Partners may have to take a haircut on their profits to make this work too. But clients who want a turn-key law firm should expect to pay a bit more for it.

# Biglaw Firm Still Fighting Allegations Of Impropriety On Part Of Former Partner
## The real question is how much will it cost the firm?

We’ve written… a lot about former Dechert partner [Neil Gerrard](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/neil-gerrard/) — and that’s because the firm’s former head of white collar has been accused of some pretty questionable practices.

The biggest controversy surrounds Gerrard’s representation of Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (“ENRC”). He was hired to investigate a whistleblower complaint about its Kazakhstan operations (the engagement began in December 2010 when Gerrard was at DLA Piper, but the matter moved to Dechert when Gerrard did in April 2011). However, the initial matter they were hired for quickly grew in scope, something Gerrard was largely responsible for, as he treated the billing code as a “cash cow.”

[The Biglaw firm and Gerrard](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/biglaw-partner-treated-client-as-cash-cow-gets-benchslapped-in-court-judgment/) lost their case in London’s High Court when the judge found they breached their duty to ENRC. Indeed, though he denied it at trial, [Gerrard allegedly referred to billing in the case as “rape mode.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/the-most-offensive-way-to-refer-to-biglaw-bills/)

And the High Court judge in this case, Mr. Justice David Waksman, found Gerrard leaked confidential client information to regulators (and newspapers) in the hopes of expanding the engagement. As one might imagine, the judge did not take kindly to that move, calling it “at least in reckless breach of duty.” Gerrard was “so obsessed with making money from his work that he lost any real sense of objectivity, proportion or indeed loyalty to his client.”

For that breach of their professional duties, Dechert made [an interim payment of £20 million](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/biglaw-firm-about-to-write-a-20-million-check-to-their-former-client/) for costs to ENRC. And this week, a trial begins to determine just how much more the Biglaw firm may owe their former client.

Plus, as [reported by](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/dechert-ex-partner-leak-hack-allegations-threaten-firm-damage) Bloomberg, there’s even more litigation stemming from Gerrard’s work at the firm for a separate client:

Dechert separately faces two more UK trials next year, and two US lawsuits, stemming from Gerrard-led representation for one of the United Arab Emirates. The firm is accused of aiding a hacking operation that targeted perceived enemies of the emirate, Ras Al Khaimah.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

The allegations in that case also involve hacking into private emails and releasing the content:

The emirate, Ras Al Khaimah, hired Gerrard in 2013 to aid an investigation into Khater Massaad, the former CEO of its sovereign investment fund who would later be convicted of fraud in the UAE.

A US aviation executive, Farhad Azima, who said he had been working with Massaad to publicize human rights abuses in the UAE, claimed that as part of Gerrard’s work his emails were stolen and posted online.

The emails allegedly showed Azima had made fraudulent misrepresentations in a prior commercial agreement with the emirate’s investment fund. The fund successfully sued him in the UK for $4.2 million.

Azima is fighting that judgment, saying it should be thrown out because it was the result of a hack and conspiracy to mislead the court.

Separately, he filed suit in the US, saying a hacking enterprise involving several parties, as well as a cover up that he claims Gerrard led and Dechert aided, violated the RICO Act.

A former Wall Street Journal reporter, Jay Solomon, is also suing, alleging it was because of the leak of his emails with Azima that he was fired.

Dechert and Gerrard have said they were unaware of the hacking operation. However, it’s not surprising the plaintiffs are utilizing RICO claims to try and go after the firm’s deep pockets:

It’s not surprising that plaintiffs are using RICO to target the firm, said Jeffrey Grell, a lawyer at Grell Feist PLC and RICO expert. “One of the reasons to use RICO is because it extends the scope of liability and you can get into deep pockets like banks and law firms,” he said.

But “it’s still a big hurdle to get over in proving intent by the law firm,” Grell said. “It is one thing to have a rogue partner. It would all depend on what the law firm knew, when they knew it, so establishing the law firm’s liability even if all the allegations are true is still a pretty big step.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Though Dechert and Gerrard are fighting the lawsuits and allegations of improper behavior, it does have folks wondering what costs — both monetarily and in terms of reputation — the firm will pay:

“Law firms have brands just like anybody else,” said James Jones, a senior fellow at Georgetown University Law Center and former Arnold & Porter managing partner. “It can certainly take a toll.”

And professional liability insurance may only cover some of the exposure:

“Some firms have huge deductibles, that would be a direct cost,” said Tom Sharbaugh, a professor at Penn State Law and former managing partner of operations at Morgan Lewis & Bockius. “The indirect costs are hard to estimate, but you may have an adverse impact with clients and on recruiting.”

It’s still an awful lot to deal with. No wonder the firm has distanced itself from Gerrard.

# Be Generous Around The Holidays, Even If You're Burdened With Student Loans
## Making administrative professionals happy and setting yourself up for success at your firm will be well worth the expense.

The holidays can be a very stressful time for young lawyers.  Attorneys usually need to work hard toward the end of the year to fulfill annual billing requirements, and most must also attend a variety of awkward work-related holiday events.  In addition, attorneys burdened with student loans must usually shell out a tidy sum on holiday gifts to individuals who work at their firms, even though these lawyers are typically cash-strapped as it is.  However, it is important to not spare any expense when giving holiday presents to individuals at your workplace, since skimping out on this annual obligation can have a negative impact on your standing at your firm.

Many new attorneys must face the holidays only a few months after joining their firms.  It is oftentimes overwhelming to learn the customs surrounding the end of the year, especially since many new attorneys never worked a corporate job before becoming lawyers.  One of the biggest surprises I learned shortly after joining my first firm was that I would be expected to give a holiday present to my secretary.  This was something I had never previously considered, and since I never worked a “real” job before heading to law school, I knew nothing about office expectations around the holidays

The unofficial rule at my firm was that associates would pay their secretaries around $100 for each year that attorney was out of law school.  Since I was new to the firm, I was expected to provide my secretary around $100 as a holiday gift my first year as a lawyer.  I have been out of Biglaw for several years now, and I am not sure if this is still the standard!  As such, it is best to ask around before settling on a gift amount.  In any case, $100 was a large amount of money for me, especially since [I was struggling with six figures of student loan debt.](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/saving-mindsets/)

However, I made sure to pay this amount, and I encourage everyone to follow whatever tradition your workplace has about providing gifts to support staff.  Administrative professionals are great people, and they are extremely important to your success at a firm.  Making sure your secretary likes you is well worth whatever amount of money you need to spend on a holiday gift.  Also, if you do not provide your secretary with an adequate present, they will justifiably talk badly about you with other administrative professionals, and this will make your job much more difficult.  It is of course hard to part with this money when these funds could be used to pay down student loans.  However, making administrative professionals happy and setting yourself up for success at your firm will be well worth the expense.

At my first firm after leaving Biglaw, the gifting tradition was that every attorney gave a holiday present to both their secretary and their paralegal.  The gift amount was pretty much set at $50 for both your paralegal and secretary no matter how long the attorney had been at the firm.  Since I witnessed in Biglaw how much administrative staff appreciated holiday gifts, I made sure to provide even more than this amount to my secretary and paralegal.  I could tell that they were really thrilled to receive more money from me than others had gifted, and I think that this gesture made these administrative professionals appreciate me more than my colleagues.  Even though providing larger presents was a bigger expense, the increased commitment I received from these individuals because of my gifts was well worth the cost.

Even though I had student loans to deal with, I also gave presents to other professionals at my firm who had helped me throughout the year.  When I was working my first gig after leaving Biglaw, I relied on the office manager and the billing coordinator to provide me with information about the clients I originated and whether our firm had been paid by these clients.  As I mentioned in a prior article, I made money through originating business during my first job after leaving Biglaw, and I used this extra money to pay off my student loans.  I could not access much information about the bills sent out to these clients, but support staff at my firm would always tell me when a bill had been paid and when I could expect my commission.  I really appreciated this information, and I made sure to provide these individuals with holiday gifts too, since they were helping me out and would hopefully continue to do so in the future.

In sum, it is important to be generous around the holidays even if you are struggling with student loans.  Not living up to expectations about holiday gifting could negatively impact your standing in the workplace, and making administrative professionals happy will be well worth the expense.  In addition, I encourage everyone to also provide presents to other administrators around the office who have helped you throughout the year.  Although these gifts might set you back when tackling student debt, the benefits you will receive will be well worth the cost.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Could Biglaw See Another Associate Pay Raise -- Followed By A Recession?

Another associate pay hike, less than a year after the Cravath-led [move to $180K?](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) You’ve got to be s**tting me kidding.

But actually, if you look at the history of pay increases for Biglaw associates, you’ll see that there’s precedent for it. In a very interesting piece for the American Lawyer from earlier this month, entitled [The Aftershocks of Big Law’s Associate Salary Hike Are Still Hitting](http://www.texaslawyer.com/id=1202779428825/The-Aftershocks-of-Big-Laws-Associate-Salary-Hike-Are-Still-Hitting?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL), law firm strategist and former Ropes & Gray COO Hugh Simons points out:

While past performance is not an indicator of future outcomes, history often rhymes. Figure 2 shows associate starting salary levels for the past 20 years. It’s notable that on both occasions in the past two decades when nominal salaries rose, they did so in multiple steps. Over the course of these multiple steps salaries went up 47 and 28 percent, considerably more than last year’s 12.5 percent. Thus, we shouldn’t be surprised if associate salaries go up again in 2017.

By Hugh Simons (via Texas Lawyer / American Lawyer)

As you can see, associate pay raises tend to “clump” — i.e., one raise is followed by another raise or raises in fairly short succession — followed by multiyear periods of no raises at all. The most recent example of this came around a decade ago. We all tend to focus on the Simpson Thacher-led [move to $160K](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/01/breaking-simpson-thacher-raises-associate-base-salaries/) in January 2007 — and understandably so, since it’s the first Biglaw pay hike that Above the Law was around to cover — but we often forget that less than a year earlier, in February 2006, Sullivan & Cromwell had taken starting salaries [from $125K to $145K](https://concurringopinions.com/archives/2007/02/the_big_law_fir.html).

Now, let’s not get too excited. I think the likelihood of another pay raise anytime soon is fairly low. First, Biglaw isn’t booming like it was in the early 2000s; the gains are not evenly distributed, with some firms flourishing and others floundering. Second, Biglaw isn’t facing intense competition for talent from other sectors, as it did in the late 1990s (from tech companies in the dot-com boom) and the early 2000s (from finance). Third, clients were [none too pleased](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/some-clients-are-super-pissed-about-associate-raises/) about the last pay raise. Fourth, if firms have good years, they can just pay robust bonuses, a safer move than increasing the fixed costs of salaries.

But still, I think Simons’s historically grounded observation is interesting. The chance of another Biglaw pay raise for associates might be low, but it’s not zero.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
A second point made by Simons is, sadly, much more likely to come to pass:

The historical data sound a second cautionary note: the timing of associate salary increases may contain information as to the current stage of the broader business cycle. As [Figure 3 shows](http://www.texaslawyer.com/id=1202779428825/The-Aftershocks-of-Big-Laws-Associate-Salary-Hike-Are-Still-Hitting?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL), the last two salary increases have been followed by Big Law recessions, i.e., declines in PPP. This could well happen again; Big Law is a highly cyclical business and we’ve been in boom times (i.e., profits growing) for eight consecutive years.

I made the same point [last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/dear-biglaw-firms-please-dont-raise-salaries/?rf=1):

In February 2000, Davis Polk took starting salaries in New York from $105,000 to $125,000. In [March 2001](http://www.nber.org/cycles.html), the post-dot-com recession started.

In February 2006, Sullivan & Cromwell took starting salaries from $125,000 to $145,000. The economy kept on chugging for a bit. In January 2007, less than a year later, Simpson Thacher took starting salaries from $145,000 to $160,000. By [December 2007](http://www.nber.org/cycles.html), the Great Recession began.

On the bright side, I think — or hope — that the next downturn won’t be as cataclysmic as the Great Recession. To their credit, firms are actively managing expenses, even though times are still good for many. This is why, despite high partner profits and strong associate bonuses, we’ve seen firms engaging in [staff layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/staff-layoffs/), closing [underperforming](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/nationwide-layoff-watch-biglaw-firm-tells-underperforming-office-to-go-frack-itself/) [offices](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/biglaw-firm-to-close-two-offices-lay-off-25-lawyers/), and [parting ways](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/project-rightsize-strikes-again-another-office-bites-the-dust/) with [less profitable practices](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/ropes-gray-splitting-with-around-100-lawyers-and-staffers/?rf=1). These moves are painful for the affected individuals, but the hope is that a little pain today might help firms avoid a lot of pain tomorrow.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The increase in expenses driven by the associate pay raises has important strategic implications for firms, and those implications vary depending on a firm’s place in the Biglaw ecosystem, its model of partner compensation, and other factors. As Simons explains:

To most managers, costs going up is unambiguously a bad thing. To a strategist, though, it depends. If a cost increase hurts your competitors more than it hurts you, and you can turn this into an advantage in the market, then cost increases can be a good thing.

In his [article](http://www.texaslawyer.com/id=1202779428825/The-Aftershocks-of-Big-Laws-Associate-Salary-Hike-Are-Still-Hitting?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL), Simons offers smart advice to “super-high profit firms,” on how they can press their advantage, and to “medium-high profit firms,” on how they weather the storm. If you haven’t checked out his piece already, it’s very much worth a read.

As we chronicled in these pages, a [surprising number of firms and offices](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises/) followed the Cravath pay hike, even some that had [no business doing so](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/no-your-office-doesnt-deserve-the-ny-to-180-raise/). If these firms see their expenses climb, partner profits drop, and leading rainmakers defect, they may rue the day that they listened to the siren call of Cravath.

# Which Biglaw Firm Is Best For Pro Bono? (2017)

On-campus recruiting season is upon us, and rising 2Ls across the country are trying to create some meaningful distinction between the firms they are hoping to score interviews with. May we suggest looking at the firm’s pro bono numbers?

Pro bono experience is great for young lawyer. Those matters are usually leanly staffed — since they’re a drain on the firm’s profits — so junior attorneys get actual experience (that’s how yours truly was able to argue before the Second Circuit). The matters also tend to to be a bit more exciting. For those of you thinking, “What? Litigation that revolves around the interpretation of an obscure finite reinsurance agreement doesn’t leave your knickers wet?” Well, you’ll be right at home at Biglaw.

Our friends over at Law.com have [compiled a list](http://www.americanlawyer.com/home/id=1202791117587/Big-Laws-Pro-Bono-Hours-Tick-Upward) of the top 10 Biglaw firms when it comes to pro bono hours. They’ve ranked them by total number of hours billed, so note that firms with a larger headcount may have a slight advantage:

5- Kirkland & Ellis

7- DLA Piper
8- Sidley Austin

10- Morgan Lewis

It should also be noted that this ranking is based off of 2016 numbers, so any 2017 pro bono emergencies (ahem, travel ban, ahem) were not factored in.

Law.com also revealed that 50 percent of lawyers participated in at least 20 hours of pro bono work in 2016. The average per lawyer number of hours billed to pro bono matters was 56.7.

# Cooley Got The Bonus Party Started But Doesn't Sound Like They'll Be Following The Leader
## Well, at least some money is better than none.

As one Cooley insider told Above the Law, “It was nice being the market leader for a day.”

So, what’s going on at the firm? If you remember way back to last week, Cooley started the [COVID appreciation bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cooley-bonuses/) game, offering associates between $2,500 and $7,500 as a special thank you from the firm for their hard work during the pandemic. But then [Davis Polk ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/)got involved with a new standard, and it just blew away the Cooley scale. Their bonuses started at $7,500 and went all the way up to $40,000. And firms [quickly](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/milbank-bonuses/) started [piling](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/irell-bonuses/) on this [new bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/sullivan-cromwell-makes-a-move-in-covid-19-bonus-war/) [scale.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/debevoise-bonuses/)

Though there was a notable outlier. Kirkland — the [world’s richest law firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/the-global-100-the-richest-law-firms-in-the-world-2020/) — [begged off](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/kirklands-not-giving-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-salty-about-it/) fall special bonuses, and seemed to be asking the market not to follow the trend.

All of which sets the backdrop for speculation at Cooley. Will the firm pony up the difference between their bonuses and the newly emerging market standard?

It doesn’t look like associates seeking extra cash are in luck. Tipsters report the message from the partnership is, “We’re not matching DPW, but we’re also not matching Kirkland.”

Here’s some perspective from inside the firm:

It’s a bummer, especially after hearing the update on the firm’s numbers. We’re apparently up 8% productivity YoY for August, and down only 1% from this point in the year in 2019 (but rapidly gaining ground after a brief lurch during the early COVID era). There was some reassurance that marketplace total compensation will be taken into account for year end bonuses, but that rings hollow considering Cooley pays individualized bonuses.

We reached out to Cooley for comment, and will update the story if we hear back.

At least Cooley associates got some money — there’s a lot of Biglaw that’s still wondering if their firm will say thank you in the form of some cold, hard cash.

# Beyond The AI Glitz And Glamour, Practical Implications

Last week, [Legalweek](https://www.event.law.com/legalweek) was held New York City. It’s the annual legal tech Conference put on by [ALM](https://www.linkedin.com/company/alm) and directed at Biglaw and, sometimes, not so big. Lots of exhibitors, lots of parties, and fancy dinners. Glitz and glamour.

And this year, as you might expect, there are lots of educational sessions, discussions, and hard-core sales pitches around generative AI. There are predictions ad nauseam about how it will transform the legal profession. How it will let lawyers reduce the time they spend on mundane matters so they can spend more time contemplating life’s big problems for their clients. How Gen AI will take over the routine aspects of the practice and make everything great again. 

Oh, there are a few references in the sales pitches to those pesky hallucinations and inaccuracies. But hey, you can deal with that by just being extra cautious. For sure, don’t worry about privacy and security, we got that covered. Just trust us. The pitches all include a solemn warning that the real dangers lie with the public-facing, inexpensive AI products like ChatGPT, not the vendors’ closed systems.

And yes, lawyers face other problems and pain points, but why try to solve those when we can sell our shiny new Gen AI programs?

What’s Not Being Talked About

But despite all the talk, there is one thing that the Gen AI titans never mention. Cost. Ask any Gen AI provider offering programs to assist with the substantive end of the practice like eDiscovery or legal research (as opposed to the back office or practice management end), and you get a lot of shrugs, hems and haws. Or some vague answer that depends on the user and whether they want to do it. I have been to plenty of pitches and about all I get is that the Gen AI tool will be an add on to an already somewhat expensive program.

But what information is available indicates that the costs can be substantial. According to confidential sources, the costs for the substantive tools can range from over $150 per user per month to $1,000 per user per year. Some providers also require every lawyer in a firm to be a user, dramatically escalating the costs. Others tie other subscriptions to the AI products, further increasing the cost.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
One unnamed source told me that the millions of dollars spent in well-known acquisitions and mergers of Gen AI providers and products has fueled aggressive pricing in an attempt to make up for the cash poured into the field. 

The Concerns of Smaller Firms

But there are real concerns being raised among practitioners and law firms, particularly at midsize firm levels. These firms fear a double hit to profitability due to Gen AI tools. These firms face a plethora of products with precious little information to go on to ensure the right fit with their needs. At the same time, they fear that the costs for purchase and implementation will create a substantial financial burden. They are also concerned that the work that the programs are reportedly able to do is often billable. So, the firms are worried not only about increased costs but also decreased revenue. Of course, the cost of the Gen AI program is probably less than hiring a cadre of associates. But that cadre of associates produces revenue to offset some of the cost.

These smaller firms already face competition from the big players who can better afford the swanky products that can be dangled in front of clients. While [some industry reports](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/legal/state-of-the-us-legal-market-2024/) suggest clients have been referring more matters to smaller firms since they are less costly, the costs to the firms of Gen AI may decrease their competitive advantage on the cost side. Any increased revenue due to the increased work may be lost by the loss of billable hours of associates and paralegals replaced by Gen AI products. The midsize firms generally handle smaller, less complex matters that are also ripe for more effective cost control.

Beyond that, as clients insert more and more control over matters, as industry surveys suggest, they may move work to firms that are using Gen AI products. A shift like this could impact traditional law firm models, particularly at the midsize level.

AI Back Office Practice Management Tools Offer Help

But there are ways that midsize firms can push back and control costs. While there is a lot of hype over Gen AI that does substantive legal tasks, a number of companies are quietly offering Gen AI tools for back office work and practice management. Work like preparing billing, tracking collections, automating client intake, routine client collections, and accounting functions can all be done more efficiently with AI products whether they are Gen AI or just regular AI. Value billing functions in particular can be aided by these tools especially in monitoring time and costs being incurred. And the tools solve the problem of legal staff writing off time spent in doing functions they feel they are over qualified to do.

Most of this work is all non-billable for law firms and shows up as a pure cost. Reducing these costs does not reduce revenue but instead improves profitability. Reducing these costs may help firms deal with the changes that the more substantive AI tools will make to the legal practice. These tools can help smaller firms weather the financial storms. Many of these tools are viable even now, allowing firms to take a more wait-and-see approach to the substantive tools and perhaps allow the costs to come down. 

Midsize and smaller firms might benefit from focusing on these kinds of tools and exercising caution regarding other Gen AI products.

# Yet Another Am Law 200 Firm Is Cutting Salaries Because This Madness Will Never End
## Another day, more salary cuts come to Biglaw.

You ever feel like you’re trapped in a dystopian version of Groundhog’s Day? Every day — hell, even the weekends — has blurred together in a kind of awful sameness. Only the smallest details change which is how you know time is, in fact, passing, no matter how slow it seems.

Your friendly Above the Law editor feels that as well. Every day we report on more Biglaw firms that find it necessary to cut something — [layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-announces-associate-layoffs-and-other-cost-cutting-measures/), [furloughs, ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firm-furloughs-associates-firm-hopeful-they-can-return-to-work-soon/)and [associate salary cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/another-am-law-100-firm-turns-to-furloughs-and-salary-cuts-amid-covid-19-crisis/) — and it’s what passes for Biglaw normal these days. Only the names of the firms seem to change, which is how you know just how massive COVID-19 austerity measures have been in the industry.

Anyway, the latest firm to announce salary cuts is Hinshaw & Culbertson. The firm notched $208,549,000 in 2018 gross revenue which makes them 140 on the Am Law 200. Hinshaw has decided to cut salaries by 15 percent across the firm, for all employees making more than $55,000. This measure is to begin on April 30, 2020, and is to continue through August, subject to “constant review.”  They’ve also halted retirement savings plan matching. Plus mid-year reviews and salary adjustments, which include promotions of senior associates to partner, have been delayed, likely until January 2021.

# Surprising Exactly No One, Women And Minorities Are Less Satisfied In Biglaw Than White Guys
## Hey! Guess what? Water’s wet!

There’s lots of interesting data in Am Law’s [latest edition of the Midlevel Satisfaction Survey](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/the-best-biglaw-firms-if-you-want-to-be-happy-at-your-job/), but one detail, while illuminating isn’t actually surprising (indeed, [it’s a familiar story](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/08/the-am-law-midlevel-survey-is-out-and-people-are-thrilled-to-work-in-biglaw-except-the-women/)). It turns out women and minority associates are less satisfied in their Biglaw careers than their peers.

As Am Law [reports](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/08/26/women-and-minority-associates-are-less-satisfied-than-their-peers/), minority attorneys scored their satisfaction levels lower in every category the survey asked about:

The most dramatic difference was in [minority associate’s] expectation to stay two years or more at their current firm—the average score was 4.181 for white associates and 4.072 for minority associates.

Other discrepancies of note between minority and white attorneys were in partner relations (4.478 for whites and 4.381 for minorities), billables policy (4.227 for whites and 4.131 for minorities) and overall workplace rating (4.428 for whites and 4.340 for minorities).

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Women who are still in Biglaw as midlevels also report less job satisfaction:

For female attorneys, the discrepancies were even greater in certain categories. Women on average gave a satisfaction score of 4.115 for their firms’ billable hours policy, while men rated them 4.267 on average. The average overall workplace rating was 4.339 for women and 4.453 for men. And communication about partnership was rated 3.689 by women and 3.789 by men.

Though the difference may seem small, there is a significant impact on the morale of associates and firms’ ability to retain talented, diverse associates. Keeping women and minority associates is essential for Biglaw firms that want to do better when it comes to diversity. Figuring out how to bridge that gap may seem challenging, but it is something that can be done, [if firms prioritize it](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/these-biglaw-firms-are-officially-diversity-certified/). Or, as one anonymous respondent said on the survey, they can just “not be racist and sexist.”

# Fifth Circuit Gets Way More Originalist Than You Thought Possible
## Plus a dramatic reading of the MyPillow deposition.

Sam Alito might be citing [witchhunters from the 1600s](https://www.propublica.org/article/abortion-roe-wade-alito-scotus-hale) as authority on the meaning of the Constitution, but the Fifth Circuit is taking it a step further and [fighting over how the Bible might interpret a statute governing class action lawsuits](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/fifth-circuits-battling-over-meaning-of-bible-verses-because-thats-how-they-make-law/). The MyPillow guy [lost his composure in a video deposition](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/mike-lindell-deposition-lumpy-pillows/) for all the world to see. Probably had a bad night’s sleep on some lumpy pillows. And it was quite the worrying summer for law students. Summer associates [don’t trust that they’re going to get full-time employment](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/being-a-summer-associate-doesnt-guarantee-you-a-job-anymore/) and [exploding offers have proliferated throughout the industry](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/biglaws-exploding-offers-are-adding-unnecessary-stress-to-law-students-lives/). At least one firm with a low retention rate this year still found the time to [take everyone to the club](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/strip-club-summer-outing-worse/).

One year ago this week, the venerable firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore [raised associate salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/?rf=1). This set off a chain reaction, leading other Biglaw firms and elite boutiques around the country to adopt the new $180K pay scale (or some variant thereof).

The last major pay raise took place almost a decade earlier, when Simpson Thacher raised salaries [to the $160K scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/01/breaking-simpson-thacher-raises-associate-base-salaries/?rf=1). So it’s unlikely (but [not impossible](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/could-biglaw-see-another-associate-pay-raise-followed-by-a-recession/)) that we’ll see major movement on the compensation front anytime soon.

In the meantime, expect certain thriving, hyper-elite firms to raise their pay scales in order to stay ahead of the market — which brings us to today’s news, from the renowned litigation firm of [Susman Godfrey](http://www.susmangodfrey.com/) (full press release posted [on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/associate-bonus-watch-which-firm-now-offers-up-to-125000-in-associate-starting-bonuses/2/)):

Once again showing its willingness to lead the market on associate bonuses, national litigation firm Susman Godfrey LLP has announced that it will be paying a $25,000 sign-on bonus to lawyers accepting offers for future employment at the firm. Effective immediately, in addition to the firm’s current structure of paying incoming lawyers an $80,000 clerkship bonus if they clerked for one federal judge, and a total of $100,000 in clerkship bonuses if they clerked for two federal judges, the firm will also pay incoming lawyers a $25,000 sign-on bonus. The firm also leads the market on bonuses paid to Supreme Court law clerks.

When Susman Godfrey [raised associate salaries last June](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/prestigious-litigation-boutique-announces-nationwide-salary-raises-to-190k/), it touted a “first-year” salary of $190,000. But because all Susman associates come to the firm with at least one year of coveted clerkship experience, a “first-year” at Susman is actually a second-year at Cravath et al. So one could have argued that Susman was matching rather than beating the Cravath scale — until now.

Susman Godfrey is now a clear member in the [$180K Plus Club](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/nationwide-pay-raise-watch-which-firm-pays-a-starting-salary-of-200000/), the small group of pathbreaking, hyper-prestigious firms that pay starting salaries in excess of the already generous Cravath scale. And don’t forget that Susman pays [generous year-end bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/associate-bonus-and-new-partner-watch-susman-godfrey/) — unlike another litigation powerhouse in the $180K Plus Club, Williams & Connolly (when will they raise?) — and boasts a short, seven-year partnership track. (And that counts clerkship experience, meaning that someone who clerked for two years could make partner after just five years at SG.)

UPDATE (2:27 p.m.): A clarification: one year of clerking gets counted against the track, but the second year of credit goes just to Supreme Court clerks.

If you’re a young lawyer looking for great experience working on cutting-edge cases with brilliant colleagues, along with compensation that puts other firms to shame, then consider Susman Godfrey. It’s not easy to get a job there — the firm requires all new associates to have clerked, a sign of how selective it is in hiring, and many SG associates have done multiple clerkships (including SCOTUS clerkships) — but if you can get your foot in the door, the rewards are rich indeed.

SUSMAN GODFREY — PRESS RELEASE — ASSOCIATE STARTING BONUSES

Susman Godfrey Breaks the Market for Associate Starting Bonuses, Offers up to $125,000

HOUSTON, LOS ANGELES, NEW YORK and SEATTLE (June 8th, 2017): Once again showing its willingness to lead the market on associate bonuses, national litigation firm Susman Godfrey LLP has announced that it will be paying a $25,000 sign-on bonus to lawyers accepting offers for future employment at the firm. Effective immediately, in addition to the firm’s current structure of paying incoming lawyers an $80,000 clerkship bonus if they clerked for one federal judge, and a total of $100,000 in clerkship bonuses if they clerked for two federal judges, the firm will also pay incoming lawyers a $25,000 sign-on bonus. The firm also leads the market on bonuses paid to Supreme Court law clerks.

The firm, which currently boasts nine former Supreme Court clerks amongst its 102 Partners and Associates, only hires lawyers who have clerked for federal judges. Firm founder Steve Susman states, “Requiring our new lawyers to have completed a federal clerkship assures that they have unique insight into how judges work and are able to make smart decisions in deciding what cases to take on.”

Co-Managing Partner Neal Manne adds, “The new sign-on bonus reflects our continuing commitment to recruiting, hiring and retaining the best, brightest and most capable young lawyers.”

‘We got offers!’

We’ve had an incredibly slow season in terms of summer associate gossip. We suspect that one of the main reasons for that — on top of their fears of indebtedness and unemployment — is that summer associates worked through [Summer of $190K](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/), and they’ve been on their very best behavior in the hopes of earning a grandiose paycheck as a first-year associate after graduating from law school.

Money makes the Biglaw world go ’round, and it also makes summer associates act like a bunch of little goody two-shoes. That being the case, you’d think that this summer’s offer rates would be absolutely awesome. But are they? Let’s find out which firms have handed out offers to 100 percent of their summers — information that rising 2Ls will want to know as on-campus interviewing season starts up very soon.

Many firms haven’t issued offers yet — some wait until the summer program is done, and some even wait until summer associates are back in school. In fact, so far we’ve only heard about 100 percent offer rates at one law firm:

100% percent offer rate from Pillsbury San Francisco office for summer associates (five offers for five summer associates).

Congratulations to everyone at Pillsbury San Francisco. It was probably easy to make offers to summers there because the firm [isn’t offering raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/biglaw-firm-makes-a-lackluster-entry-into-the-associate-compensation-game/) to any of its associates, only supplemental bonuses. But what about other firms? What could they be waiting for? Is that pie-in-the-sky $190K starting salary a bit too high for firms to willingly make offers to entire summer classes? That’s a scary thought for those awaiting offers.

If you have offer rate information to share, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Summer%20Associate%20Offer%20Rates) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Summer Associate Offer Rates”), or text us (646-820-8477). We’ll keep you anonymous. If and when we receive enough information, we’ll do a follow-up story.

The Biglaw firm of [Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/quinn-emanuel-urquhart-sullivan-llp/) has been served with a racial discrimination lawsuit that levels some shocking allegations against the litigation powerhouse. From the opening paragraph of the complaint, it is clear that this former Quinn Emanuel secretary, Spencer Marin, isn’t pulling any punches (use of racial epithets have been modified from the original):

The website of Quinn, Emanuel, Urquhart & Sullivan, LLP boasts that “there is no firm like ours.” That certainly appears to be the case with respect to its total apathy to the plight of its African-American support staff. While assisting Quinn’s attorneys during the notorious Apple v. Samsung trials, these staff members endured horrific racial discrimination, including blatant use of the word “n***er,” at the hands of Quinn’s Trial Logistics Director, Yllen Cruz. When one such individual (Plaintiff) had the good sense to stand up for himself and his co-workers and bring this to Quinn’s attention, Quinn retaliated against him harshly and swiftly, ultimately forcing Plaintiff to leave the firm. Ms. Cruz, on the other hand, continues to enjoy the supervisory position she has held for some thirteen years without facing any consequences.

Marin alleges his supervisor Cruz frequently questioned his sexual orientation and ridiculed his race. But the most brazen alleged racial incident occurred while he was assigned as a floater and traveled in support of the Apple v. Samsung case. During a staff dinner, Cruz allegedly used the term “re-n***er” as a racist pun to describe a staff member that had changed their mind about sharing food.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
When Marin complained about Cruz’s behavior, he alleges he was immediately sent home from the assignment — and the lucrative overtime that went with it — and put on less desirable cases. Marin alleges that a pattern of retaliation began and he was passed over for a promotion from a floater secretary to a permanent, stationary position.

When reached for comment, [Peter Calamari](http://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/calamari-peter-e/), managing partner of Quinn Emanuel’s New York office, said:

This complaint is utterly without merit. It relates to a private conversation over three years ago among a small group of staff members. At no time did the firm take any adverse action against the plaintiff, and he left the firm on his own accord nearly a year later.

We’ll be following the case as it develops.

Someone whose online handle is “hlsperson1111” is almost certainly insufferable unless in some freak coincidence they’re a Hofstra grad. But since we all know this is really the kind of person who went to Harvard Law and now — years into practice — still feels this fact is central enough to his or her properly gender-neutral identity to employ it online we’ll take judicial notice of their insufferabilitude.

But the first step to overcoming any obstacle is admitting you have a problem, and our friend hlsperson1111 seems to be grasping toward self-awareness over at [the Top Law Schools board](http://www.top-law-schools.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=304066):

I’m a senior associate at a big firm. Over the years, I have developed an abiding hatred of people using “Thanks” without a period in emails. I think it’s sloppy and sends a message that the sender doesn’t care enough about your time to include a period. I see it often from partners and other associates around my seniority, and I suffer in silence because it’s not really appropriate for me to pick a fight with them about it. But I now am at the point where I am supervising associates who use “Thanks” without a period, and it drives me up the fucking wall. Is it too petty for me to tell them to cut it out and that it’s a bad look?

Thankfully moderator QContinuum (a handle that marks a very different kind of insufferable) offered the final word on the matter:

Yes, it would be petty. Thanks

And while that was a perfect way to end, if there are any of you out there who sympathize with hlsperson1111, you should know that your frustration should be with your own inability to understand the vagaries of human language. In a recent episode of the podcast Lexicon Valley (which is a fantastic program), Columbia University linguist John McWhorter discussed [a phenomenon of human language known as “softeners.”](https://slate.com/podcasts/lexicon-valley/2019/11/politeness-in-the-english-language) These are the little wrinkles in communication that people often subconsciously throw in to indicate to the listener that they shouldn’t misread a potentially harsh sentence. It’s the “could you open the door?” when you mean to communicate the directive “open the door.” These aren’t set in stone, but evolve as human communication evolves.

Written electronic communication has brought a whole new set of softeners from emoji to aggressive overuse of the exclamation point! And one other recent marker he mentions in passing is the technique of omitting a period to avoid giving the message a sense of brusque finality. And by recent, it’s worth mentioning that we’ve been talking about this softener [for at least nine years now](https://www.wired.com/2011/06/secret-meanings-text-message-punctuation/).

Ending a message with “Thanks.” today would be understood by many if not most online literate readers as a “don’t even try to respond to this until it’s handled you plebeian.” It’s just how communication is evolving… leave the period off if you don’t want people to think you’re a dick.

# Gordon Sondland Is A Case Study In Trump's Obstruction Of Congress

We talk a lot about how “weak” the Congressional subpoena power is, but we have to remember why the power is so weak. The abuse of executive power required to make a Congressional subpoena “weak” is so massive, and we’ve gotten so used to President Donald Trump’s abuse of his office, that we really need to take a step back to see how violative Trump is behaving towards American norms and practices. Today’s non-testimony of Gordon Sondland is as good a case study as any.

Gordon Sondland was asked, not subpoenaed, to appear before Congress as part of its ongoing investigation into Trump’s apparent and admitted to extortion of the Ukraine in exchange for help with the 2020 election. Sondland, as the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union, reports to the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, who reports to the President of the United States, Donald Trump. But Sondland, Pompeo, and Trump all work for the people of the United States (technically) of which the House of Representatives are their most direct representatives.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Put another way, the people asked one of their employees to appear before their representatives to answer for how the people’s business is being conducted abroad, and that employee told the people to go f**k themselves. More than that, he claims that he was ordered to tell the people to go f**k themselves by the President of the United States.

That’s simply insane. You shouldn’t need a subpoena to compel an employee to explain themselves. That we even get into the realm of subpoenas represents a direct obstruction of a Congressional inquiry by the president. In a normally functioning democracy, that would be a fireable offense on the part of the president.

[The House responded by issuing a subpoena for Sondland’s testimony](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/gordon-sondland-key-us-official-in-political-storm-over-ukraine-to-be-deposed-in-impeachment-inquiry/2019/10/07/c3c1703e-e942-11e9-9306-47cb0324fd44_story.html). Most likely, Trump will order Sondland to ignore the subpoena as well.

Which brings another actor into our game: Attorney General William Barr. Barr, again, reports to President Trump, but is technically employed by the American people. His job, as the chief law enforcement officer in the country, is supposed to be to enforce the laws of the United States government. A Congressional subpoena is one such law, and the attorney general is supposed to take all steps to ensure compliance, including jailing people who refuse to testify under a duly executed subpoena, if need be.

Does anyone think Barr will do that? Of course not. Because Barr has shown himself to be a craven accessory to President Trump’s apparent crimes, not an independent actor with his own responsibility to the Constitution. It is likely that Barr will aide Sondland’s attempts to avoid congressional testimony, all at the behest of Donald Trump.

Barr, of course, should not even be in a position where he is making any decisions regarding any enforcement of this investigation, because he himself is implicated as one of the major accomplices or witnesses to Trump’s abuse of power. Asking him to help force Sondland to testify might be like asking a drug kingpin to force his connect to testify against him.

Again, in a normally functioning democracy, this would be unacceptable. Barr would be forced to recuse, a deputy would urge Sondland to comply, over the will of the president if necessary, and men would be dangling handcuffs in front of Sondland while he made his decision. The fact that none of that is going to happen should enrage people, regardless of party. But there is no more “regardless of party” in this country. Republican party apparatchiks have successfully convinced Republican voters that there is no more important identity than being white and Republican. Nothing can be allowed to threaten that, not even crimes committed by the president in plain sight.

It is in this context: where the employee of the American people fails to voluntarily comply with the law, where the secretary of state and the attorney general fail to uphold the Constitution, all in service of a criminal president who is supported by the spineless prevarications of his wholly owned political party, is where the Congressional subpoena power appears “weak.” If you put it on a solid booster rocket, the Space Shuttle can aid humanity’s exploration and understanding of the cosmos. On its own, it’s just a shell of fragile plastic. It can’t even fly.

Every president and executive branch officer going forward now gets to know that Congress can simply be ignored if the people they represent are too docile and distracted to take action. This will not end well for the American system of government.

# Did A Biglaw Firm Really Build Its Own Video Game?
## All the best swag from #ACCAM17.

A prior post about the Association of Corporate Counsel annual meeting bore the title “[No One Knows What It Is, But In-House Counsel Desperately Need It](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/no-one-knows-what-it-is-but-in-house-counsel-desperately-need-it/).” That article was about artificial intelligence solutions, but — as one person pointed out on Twitter — it could have just as easily been about the swag available in the exhibit hall.

How do scores of technologists, service vendors, and law firms attract the eyes of the thousands of potential clients strolling through the hall? With candy, fun giveaways, and branded swag of course. It truly is an art form, staying atop the trends to provide something new and different and, most importantly, memorable. There’s a lot of information at a conference like this, so making sure everyone leaves the hall with your company’s name top of mind is the whole goal. Like a few years ago when [Catalyst gave out rolling papers](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/02/the-13-best-swag-items-from-legaltech-vote-for-the-champion/) — people still talk about that three years later.

There wasn’t any drug paraphernalia going around at ACC, but the show still brought its share of memorable items.

Louisiana-based attorneys [Kean Miller](https://www.keanmiller.com) made sure no one would forget their firm and its Louisiana expertise by handing out gift boxes of branded hot sauce, gumbo starter, and Mardi Gras beads.

Plus there’s a gator head you could win in case you wanted to make your office terrifying.

Meanwhile, [Seyfarth Shaw](http://www.seyfarth.com) pulled out all the nostalgia stops and delivered 8-bit gaming glory with Level Up! The game mechanics are reminiscent of Space Invaders for those [Gen Xers](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/understanding-the-lawyer-generation-gap-or-millennials-are-way-too-obsequious/) who remember such things.

I did a pretty good job of killing the invaders — in the conceit of the game Poor Communication, Time Management, Risks and Errors, and Frustration — but I kept botching it whenever I’d try to grab the power-ups (Project Management, Process Improvement, Tech, Data Analytics, and Change Management).

Even if I didn’t set the high score, Seyfarth Shaw’s booth wowed me with their commitment to thinking outside the (NES) box.

Here are some saucy luggage tags brought to you by [Meritas](https://www.meritas.org). Hands off or I’ll call my lawyer shouldn’t be limited to a luggage tag — that’s a mantra for life.



[Bloomberg Law](https://essential.bna.com/login/signin?msg=deny&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwsauth.bna.com%2Fwsauth%2Fblawauth%3Ftarget%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberglaw.com%2Fstart&authenDec=-203) brought a whole vending machine to distribute shrink packaged T-shirts, which was appropriately over-the-top for an ACC booth.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  


On the subject of T-shirts, [SimpleLegal](https://www.simplelegal.com) brought the best design to the house with its ACC/DC shirts.

Speaking of the Highway to Hell, the conference hotel — attached to the convention center — was simultaneously playing host to a Heritage Foundation conference and gummed up the whole area on Tuesday night when Trump rolled in to give the faithful some spiel about how there were good people on both sides of every Klan rally or whatever.

This is why we shouldn’t do conferences in downtown D.C. — there’s just no guarantee the cops and Secret Service aren’t going to create a traffic nightmare for the sport of it.

[Gowling WLG](https://gowlingwlg.com/en/global/global-reach) brought the sort of coy wordplay you’d expect of an entity with British roots. “Together we make a great pair” — on socks. Get it?

Yes it’s corny, but even the most cold-hearted conference-goer had to crack a smile over that one. It’s tough work to come up with something this clever and the marketing professionals who help firms come up with this stuff deserve some credit.

The Pro Bono Institute’s [Corporate Pro Bono](http://www.cpbo.org) project offered some treats for the four-legged lawyers out there with some branded dog treats.



It’s unclear what the pro bono world expects you to do if you’re a cat person, but maybe they figure that if you’re a cat person you’ve already declared to the world that you don’t care about anyone or anything.

[Drinker Biddle](http://www.drinkerbiddle.com) brought Zoltar to the party in case anyone wanted to wish they were Big(law).

See, Zoltar was from the movie [Big](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_(film)) where a child wishes to be an adult and then spends the whole movie committing adult faux pas after adult faux pas that literally no 12-year-old is naive enough to really do. It’s actually incredibly frustrating for the audience because you can’t stop thinking, “how is this kid so stupid?” Anyway, then he becomes a kid again, completing the Joseph Campbell’s monomyth in a crisp 104 minutes. I kind of think he hooked up with Elizabeth Perkins at some point in the movie, which is super creepy when you think about it.

Anyway so there’s your “Big” and “Biglaw” reference. Look not every joke is going to be gold here.

Akerman went all in on the sports car theme, offering a toy Maserati for the toddler who just can’t wait to have a mid-life crisis.



Hey, Zoltar’s right over there buddy.



[LexisNexis CounselLink](https://www.counsellink.com) had a mini-drone they flew around the exhibit hall. It’s kind of fun to see one of these things in action. Other vendors give away full-sized drones, but these pocket drones strike me as the real gem because you can harass your co-workers with them so easily.

At my old office, one lawyer hid a remote device in another guy’s office and had it intermittently make soft cat meows every 10 minutes or so late at night just to drive the other guy crazy. It was awesome. I’m terrified of what he could have done with a drone.

Did you know they made Bourbon-flavored Gummi Bears? Because [Perkins Coie](https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/index.html) did. They had other flavors as well, but nothing topped the sweet taste of whisky Gummi.



[Lex Mundi](http://www.lexmundi.com/lexmundi/default.asp) offered glowing glasses full of Magic Hat. If the goal of any booth is to get attention, handing out actual flashing lights is a pretty good way to do it.



And so closes the Above the Law 2017 tour of conference swag. Time to pack it in until 2018 when there will be all new trends to jump on.

At least by then [the fidget spinner should be dead](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/biglaw-is-handing-out-fidget-spinners-and-were-all-doomed/).

All signs are pointing to trying times ahead in the legal profession. Anyone paying even the least attention to macroeconomic news knows that 2022 has been a difficult year. [The S&P is down over 20% year-to-date](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/04/sp-500-down-20percent-for-year-retirement-investors-reconsider-stock-bond-strategy-.html), [inflation remains rampant](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/why-is-inflation-rising-right-now/), [gas prices continue to remain high](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/05/business/gasoline-prices.html), and [overall consumer moods continue to remain sour](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/inflation-consumer-confidence-destroyed-strategist-193229082.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJX5uIGIjFLnthufZhZQ8PkelIJ3drcsqmdYjc_-ftdT9naTNwZFwvmjaJQXz0Ccr0q37z_76DqOfEr5z61X7lvRgFJyvHiBXScBObCW9f4gN4tvKyylxbV0wj0ZxeFNw2mgMxa03Sw7Szz1pMnhqs8zmXqpk7OWMx4ut7Es1SkJ). The Federal Reserve’s historically aggressive interest rate increases are as much a sign of the difficulties ahead as they are hopefully a contribution to their eventual end.

The headwinds on the larger economy appear to be felt in the legal industry as well. [Global M&A activity has dipped by around 34% year-over-year](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/10/03/deal-watch-cravath-latham-lead-6-8-billion-clean-energy-deal-q3-deal-activity-down/), including a major drop in activity in Q3 as compared to Q1 and Q2. This overall decline in activity could easily be seen as a leading indicator of an economy battening down the hatches overall, but it also signals a significant drop in work to be done by the firms who service those deals.

And those firms appear to have taken notice. The hiring frenzy of 2021, where associates and laterals were in such demand that they could attract massive salary, bonus, and perk offers, [appears to be at an end](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/the-party-is-ending-big-law-associates-brace-for-fiscal-change). [Demand and supply have evened out](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/09/08/hiring-pauses-stealth-layoffs-at-top-50-law-firms-signal-industry-austerity/?slreturn=20220905125922), or in some cases potentially inverted, meaning firms that were previously desperately struggling to keep their matters staffed are now faced with potentially idle timekeepers.

Hopefully, your firm has been planning for a potential downturn for some time, if it hasn’t, it needs to start today. And there’s no better way to start planning for the future than going back to the basics: how does a law firm actually make its money?

The RULES Of The Game

Luckily, we’ve had a good answer to that question for about three and a half decades. Robert Arndt created the [RULES model ](https://www.amazon.com/Identifying-profits-losses-law-firm/dp/0897074009)of law firm economics back in 1988, and it has remained a valid, useful model for analyzing your own law firm’s performance ever since. In fact, with the software analytics and measurables available to firms of all sizes today, [it’s easier to analyze the RULES than it’s ever been before](http://www.lawbill.com/2014-know-r-u-l-e-s/).

RULES stands for Rates/Realization, Utilization, Leverage, Expenses, and Speed of Collections. By taking a hard look at each of these metrics in turn, law firms can understand where their revenue is coming from, where their expense items are flowing to, and how the firm’s structure helps (or hinders) its success.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Rates/Realization. Rates may be one of the trickiest challenges firms face in the coming year. Firms have been aggressively increasing their rates the past few years on the backs of intense client demand for services. Demand is flagging, but inflation is putting the pressure on to keep rates going up, leading to a complicated balancing act. Firms that don’t raise their rates enough risk pinching profit as costs increase, while those that increase too much risk alienating their client base at a time when clients have significant leverage to take their business elsewhere.

So, what do you do if your firm doesn’t have a pricing specialist to dive into price elasticity in your markets? The solution for many, I expect, will be to keep rack rates increasing, but negotiating discounts as appropriate. But firms engaging in that strategy need to carefully monitor the other half of the R, realization. Your sticker price might be $2,000 an hour if you’re a coastal attorney at a top tier firm. But that rack rate doesn’t mean anything to the bottom line if it’s not what your clients are actually paying. Firm leaders need to focus on realization, how much an attorney’s work is actually translating into dollars and cents. To really understand if you’re capturing value, you need to examine what you get after baking in unrecorded time, discounts, pre- and post-billing write-offs and write-downs, and collections issues.

Utilization. You can’t understand whether your firm is appropriately staffed if you don’t understand how your people are using their time. In an economically ideal world, timekeepers are utilizing every hour of their workday to bill clients who will happily pay a full, undiscounted rate, and they’re being supported in that effort by the absolute minimum number of nontimekeeping staff as possible. If there’s a firm that has achieved this goal, even for a week, I’ve yet to hear of it.

The real world is messy, full of necessary-but-unprofitable things like meetings, nonchargeable legal work, sick days and leave, onboarding new members, marketing and client development, and myriad other items that take up people’s time without directly putting dollars back in the firm’s coffers. Even billable time isn’t all equal, as some clients pay different rates, and others struggle with timely payment. Firms need to measure and understand where their people’s time is going, what it’s contributing to overall firm goals, and how it might be better spent.

Headcount is also an unfortunate component of the utilization analysis, and one that many firms are going to have to take a hard look at in the coming months. New hiring requests should be strictly scrutinized even in the best of times. If the work that needs to be done could be performed by someone already within the firm, figure that out before committing to bringing a new body aboard.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Leverage. The basic economic model of most law firms is leverage: partners bill out the work of nonpartner timekeepers (generally associates and paralegals), and the partners make a margin on that work after paying their nonpartners. The more nonpartners generating profit for the partnership, the more highly leveraged the firm is said to be.

Understanding your firm’s leverage strategy is essential to making high-level strategy decisions. Most firms would agree that increasing leverage is generally a good thing for the partnership, because it puts more cash in the partnership’s pockets. But as in all things there’s a balance to be struck. Bringing in legions of associates who aren’t utilized helps nobody. Similarly, having a culture where associates routinely bill 3,000 hours per year may be great for driving up short-term margins but terrible for retention, culture, and longer-term profitability. Understand how you’re leveraged, then make a plan to increase it in smart ways.

Expenses. I’ve spoken about the importance of corralling expenses [at length](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/the-biglaw-recession-playbook/) in this column [before](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/the-tragedy-of-the-law-firm-commons/), so I’ll try not to repeat myself here. Suffice to say, it’s a lot harder to cut expenses than it is to simply not take on bad expense items in the first place. As we’re heading into turbulent economic times, firms should be aggressive about finding ways to lower their spending, and appropriately skeptical about requests to take on new spending. You can’t make money without spending money, but you absolutely can spend money without making it.

Speed of Collections. Imagine you’re a client, and you have two law firms’ bills sitting on your desk. One is for work performed in the past 45 days, and it’s from a firm that sends your bill promptly the same time every month and diligently checks up on the status of unpaid invoices. The other is for work performed several months ago that the firm only now got around to billing you for, and if it goes unpaid you probably won’t hear anything for another few months. If you could only afford to pay one of these bills off, dear reader, which are you more likely to pay?

Diligent billing practices beget stronger collections, and stronger collections mean more revenue and profit for your firm. Firms need to pay attention to getting time recorded, bills out the door, and invoices followed up on, especially as we head into uncertain economic times that may force our clients into tougher payment decisions. Projecting diligence is good for business generation, and it’s good for getting payments in the door. If you’ve got a weak link in your collections process, it needs to be identified and corrected ASAP.

Law Firm, Know Thyself

The better we understand how our firms function, the better we’re able to shore up weaknesses, emphasize strengths, and plan strategically. Of course, knowledge is nothing without action. Once a firm’s management team has identified what needs to be done to survive and thrive, proactive communication of those findings and strategies to the partnership is essential.

If you want to rally the troops, align your teams’ vision, and start honing your firm into the profit-generating machine you know it can be, it’s not all that hard. It’s simply a matter of following the RULES.

# The IRS Will Use Artificial Intelligence To Help Pick Which Large Law Firms To Audit
## The IRS has not elaborated, but the vague language could be intentional in order to put many others on notice.

Last week, the IRS [announced](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-announces-sweeping-effort-to-restore-fairness-to-tax-system-with-inflation-reduction-act-funding-new-compliance-efforts) that it will use its increased funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to shift more attention to high-income individuals, partnerships, and corporations. While this announcement covered may topics, including digital assets such as cryptocurrencies, foreign bank account reporting (FBAR) compliance, and scams to name a few, it has specifically named certain large law firms for close scrutiny.

By the end of the month, the IRS will open examinations of 75 of the largest partnerships in the U.S. that represent a cross section of industries including hedge funds, real estate investment partnerships, publicly traded partnerships, large law firms and other industries. On average, these partnerships each have more than $10 billion in assets.

The IRS also plans to contact 500 partnerships via mail in early October. These partnerships have a discrepancy on their balance sheets with over $10 million in assets. The IRS believes that this discrepancy without an explanation could be an indicator of potential noncompliance.

To determine which partnerships to audit, the IRS will use artificial intelligence (AI) to help with the selection process.

With the help of AI, the selection of these returns is the result of groundbreaking collaboration among experts in data science and tax enforcement, who have been working side-by-side to apply cutting-edge machine learning technology to identify potential compliance risk in the areas of partnership tax, general income tax and accounting, and international tax in a taxpayer segment that historically has been subject to limited examination coverage.

The IRS has not elaborated on the “groundbreaking collaboration” or what the “cutting-edge machine learning technology” is, but the vague language could be intentional in order to put many others on notice. Also, the IRS keeps its selection methodology a secret. For example, the IRS uses a “discriminant function” score, commonly referred to as a “DIF score” to determine whether to audit a tax return. Taxpayers are not allowed to see their DIF scores.

Why is the IRS targeting large partnerships? Because general and limited partnerships are popular business forms for certain high-income industries, such as real estate and law firms. The tax law allows partnerships to be flexible when it comes to the allocation of profits, losses, deductions, and credits. This flexibility addresses partners that contribute differently to the partnership. Compare this to the S-corporation where shareholders are taxed solely in proportion to their stock ownership, regardless of what each shareholder brings to the joint venture. It also avoids the double taxation of C-corporations.

With this flexibility comes the potential for abuse. For example, a partner in a high-income tax bracket would want all of the deductions and credits allocated to her while the partner in a lower income tax bracket would absorb the partnership income. To mitigate this, the tax law has anti-abuse rules which generally prohibit taxpayers from using the partnership entity if its primary purpose is to shelter taxable income with no legitimate business purpose. It also requires allocations to partners to have “substantial economic effect” which generally means the partner receiving the allocation feels the economic effect of the allocation.

Partnership tax law is considered to be one of the most complicated and can confuse experienced professionals. It is also some of the most convoluted. For example, one of the Treasury regulations addressing “substantial economic effect” — commonly known as 704(b) regulations — is [144 pages long](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.704-1). So it is possible that noncompliance could be unintentional.

Despite this complexity, audits of partnership returns are not as successful as you might think. According to a [2022 report](https://www.oversight.gov/report/TIGTA/Centralized-Partnership-Audit-Regime-Rules-Have-Been-Implemented-However-Initial-No) from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, audits of 480 partnership returns between 2016 and 2019  show a 78% no-change rate. Compare this to a 50% no change rate for all partnership returns for the same period.

For the large law firms that could in the Internal Revenue Service’s sights, it would be helpful to have a second look at their past partnership returns. Generally, the IRS has three years from the date the returns were filed to audit. But if there is a “substantial understatement of income,” meaning that the return omitted more than 25% of gross income, they have six years to audit. And if the return is fraudulent, the IRS has no time limit to audit.

# 'No, You Can't Motivate Paralegals By Pointing Prop Guns At Them' Is A Sentence I Unfortunately Have To Write

The case of Judy Thomas v. Jones Day is still very much in its infancy. The matter was removed to federal court only last week and we’ve not gotten a chance to hear from the defendants at all. A former Jones Day paralegal alleges a pattern of harassment and retaliation at the firm that saw her held to unreasonable standards and berated for requesting overtime. The Haitian-born Thomas alleges that the firm didn’t subject any of the young, white women working as paralegals to these conditions.

The latter allegation, suggesting that paralegals are kept around as props, carries disturbing echoes for a firm [previously sued for promoting a “fraternity culture.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/jones-day-facing-second-class-action-lawsuit-over-fraternity-culture-of-the-firm/)

Discrimination cases can sometimes turn on communication failures and a direct quote that demeans the plaintiff may have had a totally innocent intent. That doesn’t make it OK, and co-workers need to confront even harm that they’ve caused unintentionally, but it may well prevent the behavior from being actionable. There are a lot of allegations in this specific complaint that one could imagine having a less ominous explanation. “Don’t bill for overtime” could have meant “we’re going to mark down your hours on the bill” or something. Perhaps it was a deliberate attempt to steal from an employee, but there’s at least a conceivable counter-narrative. That’s what this matter will hash out.

I’m sure the firm will dispute this account in some way, but any response that doesn’t truthfully center on “there’s no such toy gun” is not going to sufficiently answer any of the problems here.

I know Jones Day has represented the NRA, but why does someone keep a gun of any sort in their desk? Maybe a Nerf dartgun on display because it was a deal toy when you closed on Nerf’s new headquarters or something. But even then, what scenario would make any gun an acceptable prop for communicating with an employee? It’s difficult to conceive of any interpretation of brandishing a toy gun other than to be menacing in a conversation with an employee who — at that point — had already raised concerns about harassment. “Oh, it was a toy” may fly as an excuse on the first day (it shouldn’t) but after the paralegal has already spoken with human resources about harassment, it should radically curtail the latitude a boss might expect to have.

Despite this, I’m sure there will be people lining up to downplay this as “just a joke” or something, and this is why I depressingly have to string together the words, “no, you can’t motivate paralegals by pointing prop guns at them.”

That’s just rot in the institutional culture. Attorneys shouldn’t need Dale Carnegie training to stop before waving gun props around to motivate the staff. Whatever happens with this specific case, there needs to have a serious internal reckoning over there. Because it’s not enough to just offer excuses, the firm needs to get ahead of this and be constantly and proactively saying, “this isn’t the sort of thing we condone and here’s everything we’re doing to ensure this doesn’t happen here.”

But given the firm involved, the response will probably be a shrug and a press release announcing another Trump administration hire.

Joe and Kathryn talk to Marty Festenstein and Kristin Cerutti of NELSON Worldwide about the design of traditional law firms and how that model will be changed in the aftermath of COVID-19. We also discuss what trends are coming as a result of the pandemic, and some changes that most businesses are embracing that just won’t work for law firms, as well as
how is the pandemic going to accelerate firms making changes.

# Biglaw Firm Announces Special Bonuses, But Takes A Different Approach Than The Rest Of The Market
## Even high billers will wind up below market.

Spring has sprung and special bonuses are all the rage in Biglaw. The latest firm to drop a bonus announcement is Dorsey & Whitney, ranked 96th on the Am Law 100 with $414,096,000 in gross revenue in 2020. And, they’ve taken a very different approach to the extra cash.

[Unlike most Biglaw firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/special-bonus-tracker-2021/), which have given out special bonuses ranging from $12,000 to $64,000 based on class year, payable across two separate paydays (which may or may not have a billable hours requirement attached to it), Dorsey has eschewed divvying up payments based on seniority. Instead, the firm is going on a strict billable hours basis, based on annualized client billable hours through April.

The special bonus schedule (which is in addition to any year end bonuses) is as follows:

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
·         Those annualizing at 1800-1899 will receive $2,500.

·         Those annualizing at 1900-1999 will receive $5,000.

·         Those annualizing at 2000-2199 will receive $10,000.

·         Those annualizing at 2200-2399 will receive $15,000.

·         Those annualizing at 2400 or above will receive $20,000.

The special bonuses will be paid in June 2021.

As you can see, the bonus range is… much smaller than the market bonuses going around, and the top bonus requires an awful lot of billable hours. But perhaps the billable hours requirement isn’t too much of a barrier. Managing Partner Bill Stoeri said in the announcement that the firm is looking to hire more associates to keep up with demand.

So, Dorsey associates: what do you think about the special bonuses? Feel free to sound off [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Biglaw Attorney Is One Of The Lawmakers Behind Letter Targeting Sidley Over Abortion Travel Costs
## UPDATE: Guess who is no longer on the firm's website?

Sidley Austin (photo by David Lat).

Okay, so at this point all Biglaw watchers know that, of all the employers stepping up to provide travel costs for employees who live in jurisdictions where abortion care — and potentially other reproductive health procedures — are banned, Sidley Austin has been targeted by the Texas Freedom Caucus (I know…  that name, ugh). [Sus, right](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/wait-a-second-why-is-sidley-the-employer-targeted-over-abortion-travel-costs-policy/)? The Biglaw giant[ received a letter from the Caucus last week ](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/texas-legislators-threaten-sidley-over-abortion-care-travel-costs/)threatening all manner of repercussions because of the firm’s [policy](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/which-biglaw-firms-will-cover-travel-expenses-for-employees-who-can-no-longer-access-abortion-care/).

But a new wrinkle has recently been revealed.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As [reported by](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/attorney-rival-firm-among-lawmakers-accusing-sidley-austin-aiding-illegal-2022-07-13/) Reuters, [Cody Vasut](https://www.bakerlaw.com/CodyTVasut) is both of counsel at the Biglaw firm of BakerHostetler and also a Texas state representative… as well as a member of the Freedom Caucus. Now my curiosity as to why Sidley is the only employer targeted by the Freedom Caucus is REALLY piqued.

UPDATE: As noted by an eagle-eyed tipster, Vasut no longer appears on BakerHostetler’s website.



BakerHostetler Chair Paul Schmidt had this to say about Vasut’s caucus targeting a rival firm, “His affiliation with the Texas Freedom Caucus is in a personal capacity and solely related to his legislative role.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
BakerHostetler has not responded to requests to find out if the firm will, like [many of its peers,](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/which-biglaw-firms-will-cover-travel-expenses-for-employees-who-can-no-longer-access-abortion-care/) offer similar coverage of travel costs. Law students, only a few weeks away from early interview week (and potential laterals), take note.

All this hubbub also reminds me of that last time that BakerHostetler waded into controversial political waters. Jimmy Fallon was not impressed.

# Partner Shows All The Compassion You'd Expect From Biglaw (Read: None At All)

Listen, above all else, Biglaw is a business. I know that, you should know that, and folks that operate under a different assumption do so at their own risk. That is always true, even when there is a global pandemic raging. So, perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised that some Biglaw partners are sending around emails that could, at the most generous, be termed as tone deaf.

The email in question was sent to associates in the Houston office of Kirkland & Ellis by Andy Calder, a partner and member of the firm’s global management committee. The email scolds folks that they need to keep churning out billable hours and that the firm “isn’t a gravy train where you can just chill and be along for the ride” and that “the math is not going to work out well for you at the end of the year.”

Notice, if you will, the complete lack of empathy in the letter — no mention that people who work at the firm might be suffering from COVID-19 or have a loved one hospitalized with the virus, or that in-person school has been canceled and all the parents working for him are likely trying to balance the demands of their children with the demands of this job, or that the isolation caused by the pandemic can exacerbate existing mental health issues. Nope, none of these very real concerns are mentioned, let alone validated in the email. The message — from a member of the management committee — is clear: you are only useful to the firm if you keep on billing. And if you can’t bill because there is a goddamned pandemic going on? Tough shit, figure it out yourself.

You can read the full email below:



Folks,

Just hung up with some of the restructuring SPs. There are some huge cases coming in and they have no staffing. Thanks to everyone for stepping up so far on cases.

For those that aren’t fully occupied right now, and are not on a single restructuring matter because they have been hiding, let me spell out reality for you real quick. I am seeing a ton of money being left on the table on the matters coming in and I have seen all of your hours today (from most junior associate through SP). Am pretty shocked and the math is not going to work out well for you at the end of the year.

Bacon and Larson will continue to staff folks below SP over the coming days/weeks, I will be calling SPs personally. Given the market you should feel extremely lucky to be in an institution with too much work. That doesn’t mean you have an annuity here. If you get a call or don’t have enough to do, I suggest you grab a restructuring assignment ASAP and roll up your sleeves. If it was me in 2008 I would be pre-emptively calling Doug or Adam after you read through the end of this note. This isn’t a gravy train where you can just chill and be along for the ride.

Andy

And if there was ever a question, this email makes it clear: associates are nothing more than billable hours.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
When confronted with the substance of the email, Calder [told Vivia Chen at Law.com](https://www.law.com/2020/05/07/this-isnt-a-gravy-train-the-curious-case-of-the-kirkland-email/):

“We’ve done above and beyond what firms have done during coronavirus. Our people are well taken care of. We’ve taken care of our people and will continue to do so.”

(Calder also told Chen, without disputing the substance of the email, “Some of that sounds genuine; some not. It seems embellished.” That screenshot though ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.)

Regardless of what official COVID-19 policy the firm may have, the real life experience of associates at Kirkland couldn’t be clearer: associates should be busy making money for the firm so Kirkland can stay on top of the rankings and keep bringing in billions in gross revenue year after year. And the firm doesn’t seem to care what you are going through as the pandemic sweeps across the globe.

# Older Lawyers Can Be Bolder Than Others In How They Practice Law

Lawyers, like most other professionals, tend to act differently as they progress throughout their careers. From my own experience, younger lawyers tend to be deferential to judges, adversaries, and of course, people at their own law firms since they are new to the profession and are still building their reputation. In addition, younger lawyers may not know too much about the practice of law, so they are more likely to keep their heads down and not make waves or draw attention to themselves or their work. However, sometimes older attorneys bring a great deal of swagger to their legal practice, and this can be a valuable resource for them.

From my own personal experience, older lawyers may not care about the consequences of action as much as younger lawyers, and they may be more empowered to take bold action during a representation. There are a variety of reasons why this is the case, but perhaps the main factor is that older lawyers (depending on their finances and career goals) may be a lot closer to retirement than younger lawyers. If things really hit the fan for older lawyers, they could presumably peace out of the profession with few consequences.

For instance, earlier in my career, I was taking a deposition in a mass torts matter in which defense attorneys usually did not make waves. Plaintiffs’ counsel and defense lawyers needed to work with each other constantly, so it was hard to be aggressive during some phases of litigation because counsel did not want to harm their relationships with other lawyers. However, an older attorney at the deposition was letting a plaintiff have it and was calling BS in ways that many of the younger lawyers could not for fear that they could harm longstanding relationships with counsel. During a break at the deposition, this attorney related that he was so close to retirement that he really did not care about long-term connections, and just wanted to do his best job in the moment. This was an interesting perspective, and this lawyer’s proximity to retirement gave him the ability to advocate better for his client.

Another time when an older lawyer displayed swagger and bravado that you do not usually see from many attorneys was when I was only a few years out of law school. My adversary was giving me a hard time with the case, and he kept making threats to me about seeking sanctions and escalating matters related to the lawsuit. He kept cc:ing his client on these over-the-top messages, which just added to the intensity of the emails. In any event, when my boss, who was in his 60s, found out about this abuse, he sprang into action. He went even more over the top in his responses to this lawyer, and eventually, the other attorney stopped sending nastygrams. My boss said that as a 40-plus-year member of the bar, he’d earned the right not to care about decorum once in a while, especially if it was for a good cause like shutting down an annoying adversary.

A further reason why older lawyers can act boldly sometimes is because society naturally provides a great deal of respect and leeway to senior citizens (and for good reason). Whenever I interact with an older lawyer in my practice, I always extend all of the respect I can and try to learn as much information as possible from counsel who have been in the profession for decades. Judges often also seemingly extend respect and recognition to older lawyers in consideration for decades they spent as members of the bar, and this may allow older lawyers to get away with things that younger lawyers cannot.

For instance, one time I was at a court conference at which the court was very upset that the matter was taking a long time to resolve. The real reason why the case was delayed was due to the fact that the court had taken many months to decide a motion even though it was a straightforward one that could presumably be decided without much effort. None of the lawyers wanted to call the court out on the fact that it was the court and not really the attorneys that primarily caused the delay.

However, an older lawyer somewhat sarcastically called out the court for its delay in deciding the motion. All of the other lawyers held our breath since we usually do not hear lawyers call out courts for their shortcomings. However, the court acknowledged its responsibility in delaying the case, and it was positive that this older lawyer might have felt emboldened by his status to speak truth to power when other lawyers involved in the matter did not feel comfortable doing so.

In sum, the status of being a senior lawyer and the ability to just quit the profession can be very empowering (for them). Sometimes, these circumstances allow older attorneys to make bold moves that could have a positive impact on a representation.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

It’s not that firms are running out of options. It’s that firms need to make their way into the world of the possible, weigh their options and pick the ones that will produce the most value.

— Kent Zimmermann, a consultant at the Zeughauser Group who regularly advises large law firms on mergers, in comments given to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/us-law-firm-mergers-ticked-up-last-year-more-deals-loom-2024-2024-01-02/) on the need for law firms to be more realistic when searching for potential merger partners. Zimmerman is currently advising several firms on their merger options.

# Games People Play: CLE Levels Up With Learning Science
## People learn better when they can interact meaningfully with the material – this is as true for CLE as it is in law school.

Look back on your learning experiences as a lawyer-in-training. Did you retain more information by listening in a large lecture hall, or by practicing your skills in a smaller seminar or clinic?

Researchers who specialize in learning science have found that people learn better when they can interact meaningfully with the material. This is as true for CLE as it is in law school.

That’s where the Practising Law Institute’s [Interactive Learning Center (ILC)](https://bit.ly/37Pv66n) comes in. In 2012, we began consulting with learning development firms around the world and building an in-house team of specialists focused on instructional methodologies and how people learn. Drawing from the fields of cognitive psychology, neuroscience, instructional design and education, our ILC team is dedicated to producing cutting-edge CLE programs built on a learning science foundation.

Today, the ILC offers 18 e-learning titles, most of which are available on-demand, and our programs have been recognized with eight industry awards from both inside and beyond the legal education profession.

But we don’t rest on our laurels. Our Research & Development team keeps up with the latest technologies to improve and innovate our content delivery. We develop games, simulations and scenario-based programs in order to provide a healthy dose of “learning by doing” interactivity along with compelling narratives. Beyond upping the engagement, these programs are shown to transfer more effectively to the real world – that is, they serve as rehearsals for actual legal conversations and decision-making.

For example, two “serious games” and two “simulations” offer immersive, first-person, role-playing experiences – a big leap from traditional CLE.

Consider our [Financial Statement Basics game](https://bit.ly/2K3yIcO), which teaches the ins and outs of a financial statement. While essential, this type of information can be dry and difficult to process. Our interactive program uses a fictional premise that has the learner evaluate several businesses for an M&A deal. Over the course of 90 minutes, participants work to peel back the secrets behind the numbers in a financial statement. Your challenge is to help the client, and this involves dissecting numbers, interviewing some off-the-wall CFOs, and identifying red flags The aim is to entertain as well as inform.

On an equally serious but different topic, [an Internal Investigation game](https://bit.ly/2K3yKkW) has the learner investigate allegations of sexual harassment against a company executive.

Participants, playing the role of outside counsel, conduct interviews with company employees and make a report to the general counsel.

Two of our simulations immerse learners into preparing and then conducting a negotiation on an intellectual property matter.

Other programs are more of a hybrid, combining instructional segments led by a lawyer-faculty member with scenario-based experiences that require responses and deep thinking about what was just observed. These scenarios include professionally produced video story lines that have a “soap opera” feel.

Legal expertise for PLI’s interactive programming is usually drawn from our deep bench of renowned and experienced faculty, but for a program on ethics in the legal profession, we tapped two leading law school faculty.

[Our Motivated Reasoning and Legal Ethics program](https://bit.ly/3oD7kRX) offers a deeper dive into the concepts that underpin why lawyers might be tempted to take less-than-ethical positions, such as inflating client billing in response to pressure from a senior partner. The faculty worked with the development team to illustrate concepts via animations and helped script fictional lawyers faced with ethical quandaries. We know that ethics credits can be hard to come by, and our team enjoys pulling together useful programs that spark discussion and insights.

For busy lawyers, no amount of fun, effective learning will be worth it if CLE credit can’t be earned. In fact, in an industry that has for years accredited lecture-based programs almost exclusively, PLI has led the charge on urging regulators nationwide to approve non-traditional CLE experiences.

Eight years in, our Interactive Learning Center’s product pipeline is full, including an upcoming program on informal legal writing that will offer guidance and practice on using digital communication tools wisely. Also in development is an unusual program built around the learner acting as a consultant on a new legal drama ‒ while making sure that diversity and inclusion issues are addressed in the fictional law firm. The program, slated for a 2021 release, will offer specialty credit in the diversity category now required by many state regulators.

# Time Now, Pay Later: How LegalTech Can Tighten Payment Funnels
## There’s a better way to ensure you get paid for more of what you do.

A wise man once said (probably), that it’s a long road from doing the work to actually getting paid.

That’s especially true for law firms, where most attorneys are still billing by the hour, and taking payment in arrears. 

But there’s a better way to ensure you get paid for more of what you do, and it starts and ends with time, billing, and payment software for law firms.

So, for this episode of the Non-Eventcast, we brought on a quartet of popular guests to the show, to talk all about how modern law firms are managing these three essential components for running a law practice: Matt Spiegel of Lawmatics, Scott Clasen of TimeSolv, Tomas Suros of AbacusNext, and Sam Mallen of MyCase. 

I kicked things off by asking each of our guests how important it is for law firms to build and lean on systems in their practices, especially when it comes to time capture, billing, and collection (15:26). 

Next, we talked about how to simplify time tracking (23:28). After that, everybody tossed off some suggestions for creating invoices that are ultra-compelling to legal consumers (31:05). And, finally, each guest offered up some tips for making more money in the final business quarter of 2022 (36:14).

There’s nothing more important than revenue to the average law firm owner, so maybe this is the most important LegalTech podcast you’ll ever listen to.  (Too strong? Yeah, maybe – we’ll workshop that one.)


And while you’re here, feel free to visit the [Legal Billing Software section](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/the-legal-tech-non-event/legal-billing-software/) of the Above the Law Non-Event, where we show you just how easy an upgrade can be.

[Jared Correia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaredcorreia), a consultant and legal technology expert, is the host of the Non-Eventcast, the featured podcast of the Above the Law Non-Event for Tech-Perplexed Lawyers.

# The Perfect Card To Say, 'I Had Intercourse With Your Wife Last Night'
## CEO hurls vulgarities in outrageous deposition.

“I’m sorry, you want to do what?”

Hallmark, purveyors of superficial sentiment and contrived holidays since 1910, is locked in [a trademark dispute](https://www.law360.com/articles/933734/fox-rothschild-attys-say-exec-called-them-dogs-in-depo) with Dickens Inc. over a number of Hallmark cards the latter sold, which Hallmark claims Dickens illegally acquired from an abandoned facility. That sounds like a lot of trouble to go to over some cartoons and warmed-over wit and wisdom, but an infinite profit margin is worth it even at a couple bucks a pop.

Anyway, Hallmark’s attorneys from [Fox Rothschild](http://www.foxrothschild.com) — specifically [George Krueger](http://www.foxrothschild.com/george-j-krueger/) and [Alexandra Sobol](http://www.foxrothschild.com/alexandra-l-sobol/) — recently conducted a deposition of Dickens CEO James Chou, and it’s safe to say he’s not in the business of writing the tender thoughts in your next anniversary card:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
[Hallmark’s chairman] is “an asshole,’ a-s-s-h-o-l-e.” See Deposition Transcript of James Chou, annexed hereto as Exhibit (“Ex.”) A, at 240:8-9.1
 To Mr. Krueger: “I have a license to fuck your wife.” Ex. A at 241:23-24.
 To Mr. Krueger: “I had intercourse with your wife last night.” Id. at 247:19-20.

If this sounds like a deposition off the rails, well, don’t worry, there’s more! By the way, if you want to see these gems in context, we’ve [attached Exhibit A](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/the-perfect-card-to-say-i-had-intercourse-with-your-wife-last-night/2/).

To Mr. Krueger: “When I think – I think of your words, I want to pee. . . I want to even shit. I will take a shit in your face.” Id. at 248:24-25; 249:2-7.

Excuse me, what? This deserves some further analysis. The last sentence, devoid of context, is the sort of hyperaggressive threat you might expect from a David Mamet outtake. Referring to defiling someone’s body is a well-worn quip, and that’s certainly what Chou’s trying to do here. But considered in the context of the rest of the answer, it sounds less threatening and more like Chou has chronic incontinence issues.

I guess they should have taken more breaks that day.

 To Mr. Krueger and referring to Ms. Sobol: “This beautiful lady, do you have regular relationship with her?” Id. at 247:23-24.
***
 To Mr. Krueger: “For you, yes, you are a dog. You are a bulldog. You are a vicious dog. You’re a nasty dog. But as for Allie [Ms. Sobol], okay, I do not mind if she bite me.” Id. at 310:5-16.

Because what’s vulgarity without a little gross sexual harassment stirred into the mix? What a dirtbag.

One might wonder where Chou’s lawyer was in all of this. Well, as Law360 describes it, quoting from the motion:

The lawyers said that rather than rein in his client, Chou’s attorney, Mitchell A. Stein of Stein Law PC, enabled the behavior and has allowed him to essentially run his own case. “Mr. Chou skirts dangerously close to practicing law without a license, conduct which Mr. Stein facilitates and defends over Hallmark’s repeated objection,” the motion said.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
In fairness to Stein, he’d probably love to control his client’s worst impulses and just can’t do it, and even though that doesn’t excuse him of his obligation (and he should be [cognizant of his obligations](http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/id=1202431030778/Attorney-Sanctioned-for-Bringing-TimeBarred-Securities-Fraud-Suit)) to keep trying — both for the judicial process and his client’s own good — that’s an awful position to be in.

Maybe we should send him a sympathy card?

# Kirkand Scores Another Record Financial Year, Conducts 'Not Layoffs' Anyway
## Talk about awful timing...

During a year when other firms struggled, in 2022, Kirkland & Ellis increased its gross revenue by 7.8% to just over $6.5 billion. It certainly looks like the firm will continue its reign as the most successful firm in not just America, but the world in the forthcoming Am Law 100 and Global 200 rankings.

At the same time Kirkland’s revenue was climbing, so was its head count. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/04/04/kirkland-building-on-6b-in-revenue-grew-almost-8-in-down-market/) has the details:

Kirkland is growing fast in head count, even after 11% growth in 2021. Kirkland’s lawyer count rose about 12.9% in 2022 to 3,415 full-time equivalent lawyers. Its associate head count rose even faster, about 14.5% to 2,029 last year.

On top of all of this, the firm is set to welcome about 425 first-year associates in the fall.

Kirkland definitely has a lot of lawyers to congratulate on yet another financial year for the record books. But maybe associates shouldn’t have started celebrating so soon. As we recently reported, some of them just [lost their jobs](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/stealth-layoffs-strike-once-again-at-worlds-wealthiest-biglaw-firm/) thanks to “performance-based” cuts, otherwise known as stealth layoffs. This was the firm’s [second round](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/stealth-layoffs-arrive-at-worlds-richest-biglaw-firm/) of — in the words of a K&E spokesperson — “not layoffs” in the last six months.

“It’s been frustrating to see what looks like reckless overhiring,” a Kirkland associate who’d just been let go told [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/kirkland-ellis-lays-off-associates-across-us-offices). Is Kirkland guilty of the same overhiring that’s plagued other firms that have conducted layoffs to right-size their firms this year?

Whatever the case may be, announcing personnel cuts across numerous offices at the same time as the firm’s record financials are being trumpeted across legal media is just not a good look.

# Yet Another Reason To Work From Home: In-House Counsel Don't Care Where The Work Is Done
## You don't even have to be working on this planet, as long as the work is good.

[M]ost clients don’t care if their outside lawyers are working from the Moon.

— Legal consultant Jordan Furlong of Law21, in response to a question of [whether in-house clients care if their outside counsel work in an office](https://www.law.com/2022/01/12/most-clients-dont-care-if-their-outside-lawyers-are-working-on-the-moon-law-com-twitter-chat-tackles-law-firm-culture-and-remote-work/) during Law.com’s recent [#IsTheCommuteWorthIt](https://twitter.com/i/events/1480967898990579712) Twitter chat. Furlong elaborated, stating where the work is done really doesn’t matter, because “in-house counsel care about results, costs, reliability, business/industry awareness, ease of communication, and DEI, in approximately that order.”

# Money Matters: Top 20 Biglaw Firm Officially Announces A Milbank Match
## Associates are quite happy with the firm's generosity.

Almost one month has passed since Milbank first announced its new salary scale. While boutique firms have been matching (and sometimes exceeding) that compensation scheme, Biglaw firms have been a bit slow to adopt it.

Last week, we discovered that some firms — like Cooley — were quietly showing associates the money [under cover of their annual review process](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/top-20-biglaw-firm-hasnt-announced-a-match-but-associates-say-theyve-received-milbank-raises-after-reviews/). Lo and behold, the firm has now officially announced a Milbank match, along with the announcement of its bonuses.

Here are the firm’s 2021 year-end bonus and special bonus scales, which are both Cravath/Davis Polk market matches:





Associates who made contributions at a level above and beyond that expected of their class year (including performance, productivity, and contributions to firm culture) received amounts in excess of the bonuses listed here. One happy associate notes, “I billed 2200 hours and got 30% above market for the discretionary year-end bonus component. I assume it may have been similar for other associates. That was pretty generous and unexpected above market.”

And here’s the firm’s official new salary scale, which, as we [previously reported](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/top-20-biglaw-firm-hasnt-announced-a-match-but-associates-say-theyve-received-milbank-raises-after-reviews/), is a Milbank match. Check it out:



Congratulations to everyone at Cooley!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Cooley.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post.

They’re our best ambassadors. Many times when you do use vendors you have to teach them about your culture.

— Geline Midouin, Shearman & Sterling’s chief people officer, speaking highly of the firm’s former lawyers, who are now being rewarded with cash for referring potential new hires. According to a report from [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/wall-street-law-firm-turns-ex-lawyers-into-bounty-hunters-ease-talent-crunch-2022-01-20/), Shearman will pay $25,000 for a successful placement of associates or counsel with at least one year of experience, $2,500 for salaried business services professionals, and $1,000 for hourly staff.

# A Celebrity Senator Comes To The Defense Of Biglaw

Senator Cory Booker (by Bbsrock via Wikimedia)

I reject the idea that the guy who comes out of Yale and goes to work in the projects in Newark is good, and the guy who goes to work for a white-shoe law firm is bad. We’re all mountain rangers. We all have peaks and valleys. I know a lot of people who work at nonprofits with men and women coming out of prison. But I also know lawyers at major law firms who help tremendously through pro bono work. Let’s not judge.

— Senator [Cory Booker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Booker), the Yale Law School graduate who went to work in the projects in Newark (before entering politics), at a [lunch interview](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/fashion/when-washington-met-hollywood-at-lunch-with-cory-booker-and-susan-sarandon.html) with actress Susan Sarandon and Philip Galanes of the New York Times.

The layoffs aren’t over yet.

The leaders of Dechert — a firm that brought in $1,288,692,000 gross revenue in 2022 (down 3.94% from 2021), putting it at No. 36 in the most recent Am Law 100 — just announced a global reduction in force. It seems that about 5% of the firm’s workforce, including attorneys and business professionals, will be let go.

Andrew Levander and Henry Nassau note in the memo (available in full on the next page) that those who are affected by the layoffs will receive the firm’s support:

Our affected colleagues have made valuable contributions to the firm, and we are committed to helping them through this process by providing severance benefits and career counseling services. …

We encourage you to take advantage of our mental and emotional well-being resources if you need support.

The reduction in force is includes a “redundancy process” that is taking place in the firm’s London office.

UPDATE: In total, this reduction impacts 55 lawyers and 43 business professionals.

A reduction in force of attorneys and business professionals took place today. Additionally, a redundancy process has begun in London. We anticipate that, subject to the ongoing consultation process in London, 5% of our total global workforce will be impacted.

While this was a difficult decision, we continue to execute on the firm’s strategic plan by providing world-class legal service, focusing on areas of growth, bringing high-profile clients and matters to the firm, and advancing innovation in the legal industry.

Best of luck to those who are being let go from Dechert.

Which members of the Vault Law Top 25, the nation’s 25 most prestigious law firms, have not matched (or beaten) the new [Cravath salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) yet?

Hint: If you were an avid reader of Above the Law, you’d [already know the answer](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2016-salary-increase/) to this question. Many of the firms that haven’t announced market salary matches yet have no excuse for their failure to do so.

# The Firm That Brought The $190K Salary Scale To Biglaw Has Announced Bonuses
## Even more money for Milbank associates!

On the second day of 2018’s year-end bonus season, the firm that brought (most of) the nation’s Biglaw associates a [shiny and new $190K salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) has issued its bonus announcement. Milbank is officially [matching Cravath’s bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/breaking-cravath-announces-annual-bonuses/). In case you’ve somehow forgotten, this is what the 2018 bonus scale looks like:

Class of 2018 — $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2017 — $15,000
Class of 2016 — $25,000
Class of 2015 — $50,000
Class of 2014 — $65,000
Class of 2013 — $80,000
Class of 2012 — $90,000
Class of 2011 — $100,000
Class of 2010 — $100,000

As we noted previously, for the past three years, Milbank was the first firm to match Cravath’s year-end bonuses, but this year, the firm is the third firm to match. Bonuses at the firm will be paid “on or before” December 31 to those who are in good standing. Talk about a nice way for Milbank associates to celebrate the New Year.

Congratulations to Milbank and its associates on their bonuses and for inspiring Biglaw to finally move to the long dreamed of $190K salary scale!

# Solving The Biggest Weakness In Biglaw: Intapp Outlines Its Vision

Gathering in the crowded Grand Central Hyatt ballroom, over 575 registrants representing over 250 firms and legal departments, hushed to take in the opening speakers at Intapp’s Connect19 show. What we didn’t really expect was Coldplay to blast over the speakers to introduce COO Dan Coleman — or that all the other speakers would also have their own walk-up music befitting an at bat appearance or a WWE intro. I kept hoping that a speaker would be called up a second time so I could hear “Viva La Vida” and yell out “BY GOD, THAT’S COLEMAN’S MUSIC!!!”

But of all the pop walk-up music employed by the staff running the Intapp Connect19 show, they never played the one theme that would best define the spirit of this conference. I’m talking, of course, about Vanilla Ice’s seminal 1990 work, “Ice Ice Baby.” It’s hard to imagine there are any lyrics in the popular musical canon that could better explain Intapp’s core business mission to the legal world than:

“Stop, collaborate, and listen.”

Collaboration is at the heart of Intapp’s mission to bring efficiency to the law with an industry cloud for professional and financial services. Collaboration across practices and collaboration across functions to ensure that client demands are being served, especially in a world where clients are trying to cut back on firms and pushing back on unpredictable billable hour fee arrangements. That’s a taller order than the soundbyte may seem, but Intapp sees an opportunity with its platform to span the entire client life cycle to identify opportunities for beneficial collaboration.

Intapp CEO John Hall explained that “one of the big points we want to make is that it’s about what you might be able to do today.” In other words, Hall pushes back against the law firm futurist model that gets tripped up imagining the firm of the future without recognizing that there are best practices that can be implemented today to wildly improve the law firm model.

And it’s a model in need of attention. Some 49 percent of survey respondents thought that a lack of collaboration was their firm’s biggest weakness. With around 53 percent of clients reporting that they have cut at least one of their firms over the past year and 76 percent claiming to be in cost-cutting mode and 82 percent utilizing alternative fee arrangements in some part of the legal spend, the pressure is on firms to constantly re-earn client business.

How does a firm effectively price out an alternative fee arrangement? Eyeballing it is the current preferred method and like a lot of Biglaw practices, not a particularly savvy strategy. But a system that monitored the life cycle of every matter across every part of the firm that it touches? That’s where efficiencies can arise. In a session later in the day, HBR Consulting Senior Director Andrew Baker and American Lawyer’s Roy Strom ran through the potential of a platform like Intapp’s that can use zero-entry capture of data throughout the law firm work process and run it through a model for serving a particular matter not unlike Uber, where it can guess at fee and even potentially figure out the best lawyer. Complain about surge pricing all you want, but it’s economically efficient.

From Intapp’s perspective, this is what’s been lacking in the service industry writ large, and the legal industry in particular. For large firms, the choice for years has been between “square peg round hole-ing” a comprehensive solution designed for manufacturing companies that fail to grasp service industry quirks or to purchase more and more solutions for support silos (IT, Knowledge, Risk & Compliance, etc.) that drive those functions further apart and put up more roadblocks to collaboration.

In the final session of the day, former Orrick chair and current Intapp board member Ralph Baxter kicked off the festivities by explaining that it’s not just that clients are restless in the delivery of legal services, but that they understand how it can be done better. Unlike law firms, the global corporate world has embraced — with the help of software providers serving their needs more consistently over the years — a collaborative model. They don’t see what the holdup is with all these crazy lawyers.

As legal technology guru Richard Susskind explained in the final presentation of the day, the Big 4 are the competition of the future in this space and they have spent years embracing technology. As lawyers struggle to catch up, the warning is to resist the Steampunk mentality — the bankruptcy of imagination that envisions horseless carriages as stagecoaches with robot horses. The future isn’t about “robot lawyers” it’s about technological solutions that eliminate the need for lawyer work in the first place.

Susskind is fond of an old Black & Decker management game. Upon showing a newly minted executive a picture of a drill they’d ask if this is what the company sells. The noob would inevitably agree and then get shown a hole. Black & Decker sells holes to clients who need to have holes in specific locations — the drill is just the best current solution they offer. The lesson is to begin from the solution and work backward rather than waste valuable time wondering if a computer can ever do the specific task a third-year associate is performing right now.

But to circle back to John Hall’s comments, the first step to that future is to recognize that there are key improvements to be made today. At Connect19, Intapp laid out its case for providing firms a path to do just that.

# World's Wealthiest Law Firm Announces Reopening Plan, Says 'Office-Centric Work Environment Is Necessary'
## Associates don't seem to be too thrilled about this.

Less then a business week has passed since we celebrated Independence Day, and it looks like the most financially successful law firm in the world was inspired to declare its independence from the remote working environment that was brought about by the COVID crisis. Kirkland & Ellis — the #1 firm in the country, having brought in $4,830,000,000 gross revenue during the pandemic in 2020 — announced yesterday that an “office-centric work environment is necessary” for the firm’s continued successes.

Citing difficulties with training, building collegial relationships, and coming up with creative legal strategies (not to mention lawyers’ “heightened personal stress, strain and isolation” while working remotely), Kirkland will be throwing open its office doors at the end of the summer. Here’s an excerpt from a memo that was sent yesterday by Jon Ballis, the firm’s chair:

For all these reasons, we believe an office-centric work environment is necessary to deliver the world-class legal services that our clients expect, and the world-class culture, training and camaraderie that we all deserve. Therefore, our base-line perspective will be to return to an in-office presence. That said, Kirkland was never a face-time kind of place, and we have always provided great flexibility for our attorneys to work remotely when they believed it was appropriate to do so. That will not change. And as we transition back to the office, we understand that many may require more flexibility at the start.

While our offices are already open in all locations, and it’s terrific to see more and more attorneys coming to the office every day, we will continue our office-optional mode until U.S. Labor Day. However, beginning on Tuesday, September 7, please plan on being in the office as your routine baseline, then use your judgment as to when it is appropriate to work remotely.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Insiders at the firm have referred to the memo as “disheartening,” saying they thought the remote work environment they’ve endured for more than a year would have been given a little more appreciation considering how successful the firm was while everyone was working from home. Here’s what one associate had to say:

When recruiting, Kirkland made it sound as if it’s this avant-garde workplace where associates are empowered to work from home as often as they’d like (assuming it doesn’t negatively affect their work). In reality though, it wasn’t that way, at least not before COVID.

To be fair, many partners never seemed to mind, but it only takes one partner (and there were/are many more than one) with a bad attitude to make your life miserable if you don’t show up to the office as much as they’d like. We all thought this issue would be fixed with COVID—didn’t we just show we could be the most profitable and highest grossing firm in the world or something like that? And, all while working from home? Now they want to come at us talking about “in-between moments” where “so much of our culture is forged?” What does that even mean? What about the incredible opportunity to cultivate and forge a family the entire firm just experimented with for over a year? It was an opportunity to show the world that a new work paradigm is available and productive, and we rose to the occasion. I’ll worry about my own “personal stress, strain and isolation” issues, since I don’t recall Kirkland being very good about taking care of that for me.

A truly avant-garde law firm would have the foresight and courage to shepherd a new paradigm even without the necessity COVID brought. So, what does it say about a firm that lacks the courage and fails even with the benefit of hindsight? That’s the opposite of avant-garde—that’s “old school” and not in a good way.

Hopefully Kirkland & Ellis will stay true to its word and allow those who wish to work remotely to do so, without interference from partners.

You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# Nationwide Layoff Watch: 60 Positions Across 22 U.S. Offices
## Have the associate pay raises led to staff layoffs throughout Biglaw?

Has the [Great Associate Pay Raise of 2016](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/?rf=1) ushered in the Not-So-Great Staff Layoffs of 2017? It’s a tough question to answer, especially without inside information about the financials of different firms. But it is fair to say that there have been a significant number of [staff layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/staff-layoffs/) since associate pay hikes spread throughout Biglaw last year, and it is also fair to say that some staffers think, accurately or not, that reductions in their numbers are tied to bump-ups in associate pay.

On Monday, approximately 60 staffers at [Dentons](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/snr-denton/) were informed that today would be the last day at the firm. We heard from a number of the affected individuals, and some of them speculated that the layoffs were caused in part by the need to trim expenses in the wake of [increased costs for associate compensation](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/firm-details-the-special-bonus-it-will-offer-to-close-the-cravath-gap/).

We reached out to Dentons about the layoffs, which provided this statement through a spokesperson:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As part of regular business operations, Dentons has undertaken a review of its U.S. internal operations. The legal sector is rapidly evolving, and just like our clients it is important that we constantly explore ways to ensure our business is aligned to the needs of our Partners and clients to demonstrate continued value. Having completed one full year post-merger in the U.S., we now have a complete set of data on our combined operations, as well as continued integration of our US and global support teams. In many U.S. locations, we have concluded moving from two offices to one, and consolidated many systems, among other integration. As a result, earlier this week we implemented a realignment of our business services teams. Regrettably, this resulted in notifications of an overall reduction of approximately 60 positions in business services across our 22 U.S. offices. This process is complete.

While very unfortunate for the affected individuals, these cuts do not come as a total surprise. Back in November, after a similar analysis, Dentons made cuts to its [international support staff](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/worlds-largest-law-firm-conducts-layoffs/). And it is certainly far from the only firm undertaking an efficiency-focused review of its operations.

A few additional points from our reporting (which the firm declined to comment on, resting on its prior statement):

1. The cuts appear to be centered on support staff. We have not heard of any lawyers being laid off as part of this reduction (but [let us know](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Dentons%20layoffs) if we’re wrong).

2. Affected offices included Los Angeles and Atlanta (and the latter saw significant cuts as a former McKenna Long hub; McKenna Long was itself formed by a merger between two firms, the D.C.-based McKenna & Cuneo and the Atlanta-based Long Aldridge & Norman).

3. Employees are getting severance (one week for every year of service, at least according to the sources we’ve heard from).

4. Bonuses and raises were supposed happen on April 1 for staff, but those who were not let go have been told there will now be a delay with reviews and comp.

If you’re one of the surviving staffers, don’t be shocked if you hear the popular [recessionary refrain](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/11/where-are-the-bonuses/): “Your bonus is your job.”

We fear that more cuts are coming in Biglaw. If your firm or organization is reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# Overpriced, Overgrown, And Overlapped: Biglaw’s Fragile Fundamentals And How They’ll Play Out When Recession Hits
## Profitability should be tanking. That it hasn’t yet is curious; that it will is certain.

Biglaw is defying the laws of economics. Over the last 20 years, the Am Law 100 has raised price at over twice the rate of inflation despite adding lawyer capacity at twice the growth rate of the economy and almost doubling the number of cities in which each firm competes. Profitability should be tanking. That it hasn’t yet is curious; that it will is certain. The next downturn will set the tinderbox ablaze.

Let’s start with price. We don’t have a perfect measure of effective billing rates; however, in revenue per lawyer we have a proxy for price that’s valid over longer time periods. Figure 1 shows the history of average revenue per lawyer for the Am Law 100 from 1994 to 2017; for context, the level of inflation (the consumer price index) is also shown. While pricing in law has been somewhat volatile, the cumulative Biglaw price increase over the period is 2.3 times that of inflation. Given that law firm costs rise roughly with inflation, it would seem law firms have built up a hefty margin. The flip side of this is that when the downturn hits, there’s a long way for prices to fall before firms’ operating costs set a backstop. Further, it’s hard to imagine that this relentless price aggression hasn’t fomented a degree of ill-will with some clients who will experience little compunction in extracting their pound of flesh.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
One would expect demand for lawyers to grow in line with expansion of the overall economy. Accordingly, Figure 2 presents the history of lawyer numbers at Am Law 100 firms in the context of US GDP growth. The total number of lawyers has grown at 1.7 times the growth of the economy but with significant variability by cohort within this total. While equity partner growth is less than half that of the economy, associate growth is double economic growth and the growth in non-equity partners is literally off the charts — 520 percent over the time period shown. There are a couple of implications here for when the downturn hits: firms will cut people and firms will cut prices. On the former, the lawyer growth profile foreshadows how the downsizing will occur: equity partners will be unaffected, associates will be cut significantly, and non-equity partners will be decimated. On prices, the human desire to retain lawyers and thus to find them work will lead firms who have thus far resisted using major price reductions to garner work to break ranks; realized rates will drop dramatically.



In 1994, the average Am Law 100 firm had offices in 8.2 cities; by 2017 this had grown to 14.7 — a 1.8 times increase. As the legal market is concentrated in major cities, it’s not surprising that this increase has led to significant growth in the number of competitor firms in such cities. Figure 3 focuses on the 20 cities where the largest number of firms have offices and shows the number of firms present in 1994 and 2017. Not surprisingly, almost all firms have offices in NY and Washington DC; interestingly, the number of firms in New York has grown over the period while that of DC shrank slightly — a manifestation of the appeal of higher profit New York practices. We see strong growth in the number of firms with offices across Asia, even though we know all firms struggle to operate profitably there. Perhaps surprisingly, we also see doubling and tripling in the number of firms in US regional centers (San Francisco, Chicago, Houston, etc.) and significant growth across Europe, with London now having the third-highest Am Law 100 firm presence of any city globally. We know that more competitors in a market produces greater competition leading to lower price realization with clients and higher compensation for lateral recruits; thus, new offices are rarely profitable right away. Between this effect playing out in US regional centers and Europe, and the strong growth in Asia, we can infer many firms have significant cross-subsidies in partner compensation, e.g. partners in established cities are covering the compensation of partners in new cities. Such subsidies cause modest friction when profits are rising; when profits start to fall, they precipitate internecine war. It will get ugly at some firms when the business cycle turns.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
There’s a scene in 1960’s The Magnificent Seven where Steve McQueen’s character, Vin, is asked if he’s worried. Vin replies that he’s reminded of a fella back home who fell off a ten-story building and, as he was falling, people on each floor kept hearing him say, “So far, so good.” Analogously, when an industry is undergoing structural change, the absence of pain in the early stages doesn’t obviate the inevitable; the fundamentals of economics don’t stay in abeyance indefinitely. The implication? Adopt a laser-focused strategy, implement it with discipline, and don’t be like the fella Vin knew back home.

# Were Those Really Raises?
## From the outside, the pay for attorneys can often seem exorbitant. Here are a few reasons why it's really not.

Michael Allen

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://bit.ly/2KxFPa6) team of expert contributors. [Michael Allen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelallen/) is the CEO of Lateral Link. He is based in the Los Angeles office and focuses exclusively on Partner and General Counsel placements for top firms and companies. Prior to founding Lateral Link in 2006, he worked as an attorney at both Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and Irell & Manella LLP. Michael graduated summa cum laude from the University of California, San Diego before earning his JD, cum laude, from Harvard Law School.

While Biglaw associates continue to celebrate the increase of salaries for the third time in 10 years, the reality is these base salaries are actually lower than the standard Simpson Thacher set in early 2007, when adjusted for inflation. $160,000 in 2007 is actually equivalent to $199,000 today.

New York associates in particular are feeling the pinch as the cost of living continues to balloon. Ranked the 13th most expensive city to live, the 136 tons of copper and steel, public park larger than the principality of Monaco, and 68 combined miles of towering steel skyscrapers that make up New York are working hard to justify the exorbitant cost of living to Manhattan associates.

If the raises below inflationary rates weren’t bad enough for New York attorneys, firms matching the salaries in most of their major U.S. offices are impelling New York associates to search for greener pastures. While in the past, New York associates were typically compensated at the top of the market due to living in one of the most prohibitively expensive metro areas in the world, associates across the country have reaped the benefits of these raises both now and when the market was set in 2014.

The question many New York attorneys ask themselves is, “If not New York, then where?”


Many of these major legal markets clock in at half the cost of living as New York. Associates in Houston, Dallas, and Seattle are especially enjoying the new salary hikes that have spread there as Texas and Washington have no income tax.

Unsurprisingly, real estate is the real culprit for these cost of living differences. With the average rent for a one bedroom hovering above $4,000 in Manhattan, associates are spending a large chunk of their take home just on rent — around 40 percent for first years. Even in the notoriously grueling real estate market in Los Angeles, $4,000 may just get you a starter house or a luxurious and spacious apartment.

The continuous influx of tech and the continued growth of native blue chip firms parallels the development of L.A.’s downtown development as it chases after New York’s title of premier legal market. It won’t surpass it anytime soon, given the amount of wealth being generated by banks and funds on Wall Street, but the gap continues to close. The greatest barrier to entry is the California Bar exam, notoriously the most difficult in the country. However, passing it gains you entry to not just one, but four major legal markets — L.A., San Francisco, San Diego, and Silicon Valley. Lateraling from one of these cities to another is much easier than lateraling across state lines, especially given that firms that have footholds in Los Angeles almost always have offices in San Francisco and often San Diego and Silicon Valley as well. L.A. has a reputation as a laid-back city, and while expectations are still high and partners are competitive for clients, the atmosphere is less intense than its New York peers.

San Francisco has a legal market which has many similarities to NYC, both in terms of practice areas and sophistication of work. San Francisco services high-level deals, but increasingly its clients are mostly tech companies and startups. Bonuses among several prominent California firms have historically run a bit lower compared to New York. As the tech boom brings more entrepreneurs into San Francisco, the city is rivaling New York real estate prices. Overall, San Francisco is the closest of these cities in terms of cost of living. Aspiring partners will appreciate the sophistication of the work which yields massive dividends once your pay switches to the origination and profit sharing model partners enjoy.

For attorneys looking to stay on the east coast, D.C. can be another viable opportunity. Relocating attorneys appreciate the D.C. bar waiver rules. Unlike many jurisdictions, you can apply to waive in even as a junior associate, if you meet MBE and MPRE requirements and pass the character and fitness investigation. The federal government shapes the types of practices based in D.C. Most of the highest-rated regulatory practices are based there because of proximity to the agencies, and appellate teams are expected to have a strong presence there. The government also offers excellent exit opportunities for attorneys who decide to leave private practice.

Additionally, for associates across the U.S., tuition increases continue to erode their take home pay. Even when accounting for inflation, tuition rose by nearly 43 percent for private law schools from 2007 to 2017 and 70 percent for public schools. Compounded by this double-digit inflation, the challenge to new grads to both pay their loans and flourish in all markets can be onerous.



From the outside, the pay for attorneys can often seem exorbitant. However, when accounting for the continually rising costs of law school, and the uncertainty of partnership prospects, the pay looks much more reasonable in comparison. Many attorneys will earn the most they ever will as a Biglaw associate, especially if they reach the end of their associate runway without a plan. Many attorneys end up in the wrong city for their practice and personality. Not everyone is meant to thrive in the pressure cooker of New York; not everyone appreciates the frigid summers in San Francisco. Law firms have offices in all major cities, and with the newest round of raises spreading to most major cities — and proportionality lifting ancillary legal market salaries — now is the opportune time to move your practice to the place that is going to help your career and life, long-term. Feel free to reach out to our team at Lateral Link if you have any questions or would like help relocating your practice.

Sheri Dillon

Hello, yes, hi. My name is Sheri Dillon, I’m his lawyer. And this right here is all the papers that prove that Mr. Trump is really divesting. I mean, look at all these papers. If he wasn’t divesting, how could there be so many dang papers? There’s papers here, there’s papers here. I mean it’s like, ‘Help! Help! Lifeguard! I’m practically drowning in papers.’ If you still don’t believe me I’ll read every paper out loud right now starting with this one. Oh, that’s right they’re fake.

—[Cecily Strong’s](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5198446/) satirical portrayal of Morgan Lewis partner [Sheri Dillon](https://www.morganlewis.com/bios/sdillon), who made headlines after appearing at President-elect Trump’s latest news conference. Dillon tried to [explain away](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/morgan-lewis-joins-trumps-reich-shills-for-toothless-interpretation-of-emoluments-clause/) Trump’s conflicts of interest, but really, the prop [file folders got all the attention](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/revealed-whats-really-in-trumps-stack-of-folders/).

# Stats Of The Week: Biglaw Hiring Looking Up
## Law firm hiring is at its most robust since the recession.

[NALP data](http://www.nalp.org/feb16_perspectives_pressrel) on the most recent law firm recruiting cycle finds that entry-level hiring is at its most robust since the Time of Shedding and Cold Rocks. Nearly all of the 2015 recruiting metrics measured showed an increase, including:

- Summer associate offer rate for full-time positions (95.3%, up from 69% in 2009)
- Number of summer associate position offers made
- Percentage of callbacks resulting in offers
- Number of firms visiting school for OCI
In the words of [James Leipold](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/james-leipold/), NALP’s executive director: “After a period of considerable and prolonged slowdown in law student recruiting volumes, for the last two years we have seen strong markers of recovery. There is a scramble for top talent that we have not seen since before the recession.” Check out the [full report](http://www.nalp.org/feb16_perspectives_pressrel) here.

# Ex-Attorney At Top 10 Biglaw Firm Pleads Guilty To Insider Trading
## The former visiting attorney at the elite firm faces up to 20 years in prison for insider trading.

Trading on insider information never, ever ends well for anyone — especially if you’re an attorney at a Biglaw firm.

Romero Cabral Da Costa Neto, 33, of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, started working as a visiting attorney at Gibson Dunn in September 2022. Back in August, Costa was [arrested and charged with insider trading](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/ex-attorney-at-top-10-biglaw-firm-charged-with-insider-trading/), accused of accessing confidential client information from within Gibson Dunn’s internal filing system to make trades ahead of a major pharmaceutical M&A deal. Earlier this week, he pleaded guilty to the charges. The [National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2023/11/01/ex-visiting-attorney-at-gibson-dunn-pleads-guilty-to-insider-trading/) has the details:

Costa pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Carl J. Nichols of the District of Columbia, who scheduled sentencing for Dec. 20. Costa faces a statutory maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for insider trading, as well as potential financial penalties.

Costa is also facing additional charges of securities violations in a parallel civil complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Philadelphia regional office.

U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves offered the following statement: “This attorney stole material non-public information, betrayed his law firm, victimized its client companies, and monetized those insider secrets to gain an illegal advantage on other investors.”

As noted by the NLJ, Gibson Dunn is continuing to assist with the investigation. “We are cooperating with authorities and have terminated our relationship with the individual, who was an international visiting attorney from another law firm,” a firm spokesperson said.

Costa is represented by attorneys from Boies Schiller & Flexner.

# Why Innovation Dies In Law Firms
## Even the most established firms need to think like startups.

The only constant in this world is change, and thanks to the onward march of technology, the changes we face are getting bigger, faster, and more irrevocable all the time.

Have you ever heard of a startup called ByteDance? It owns TikTok, a goofy little app that kids use to make videos lip-syncing to popular songs. TikTok debuted in September 2016, a grand total of 29 months prior to the writing of this column. Most adults wouldn’t have any reason to be aware of it save for one thing: that young, fresh company ByteDance is currently worth an estimated $75 billion. Billion, with a B. An app that’s barely old enough to be potty trained is worth that much, and all because it perfectly married a popular product to the right cutting-edge technology.

Tech startups are the poster children of companies seeking to employ cutting-edge technology for financial gain, yet there’s no reason why the startup mentality can’t be applied to traditional businesses. The essentials of the startup culture are universally useful. At their best, startups are hungry, creative, willing to take chances, and dedicated to changing the status quo.

Just like Biglaw, right? Not quite.

Law Firms: Innovation’s Kryptonite

The Biglaw mentality and the startup mentality are anathema to one another. Biglaw is founded on a model of precedent and continuity. Too often Biglaw stifles its most creative voices, remains complacent instead of hungry, and focuses on staying the course rather than acknowledging that the very foundations of our industry are in flux.

The path from innovative new company to major power is shorter than ever. Think about how many of the dominant companies in the business world were young, hungry startups just a short time ago. If they were people, Google and Alibaba wouldn’t be old enough to drink. Facebook and YouTube wouldn’t be old enough to drive. Companies like Slack, Snapchat, and Blue Apron were all topping billion-dollar valuations before they made it into kindergarten.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
That compression in the time it takes a company to rise has a “dark side,” though, in that it’s now easier than ever to find your market scooped out from under you. The consequences of failing to shift with the times can be devastating. Small, hungry law firms are increasingly niching in deep, commoditizing their practices, and leveraging small overhead into stiff competition for Biglaw. When a boutique can offer premium service at a wholesale price, it’s hard for even the biggest, grandest, most mahogany-lined names to compete. And when they fail, they fail harder and faster than ever.

Add to that the fact that alternative legal service providers are increasingly [biting into our market share](https://blogs.thomsonreuters.com/answerson/alternative-legal-service-providers-buyer-perception/), and that the [Big Four accounting firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/king-kong-is-coming-to-crush-your-practice-with-a-calculator/) are angling to take over our traditional lines of business. Then consider that our largest clients are dragging more work back in-house, and overall decreasing their outside counsel spend whenever they can.

The pie is shrinking, and more players are angling for a piece. Biglaw needs to get hungry, or face going hungry.

The Innovator’s DNA: A Roadmap for Biglaw

For any Biglaw leaders looking for an excellent primer on getting into that startup headspace, allow me to enthusiastically recommend [The Innovator’s DNA: Mastering the Five Skills of Disruptive Innovators](https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-DNA-Mastering-Skills-Disruptive-ebook/dp/B0054KBLRC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1550680940&sr=8-1&keywords=the+innovator%27s+DNA), by Jeff Dyer, Hal Gregersen, and Clayton Christensen. It’s a well-researched, thoughtful, yet easy-to-read treatise on the basic traits associated with innovative minds and organizations.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In brief, the five traits Dyer, Gregersen, and Christensen focus on are:

- Associating – finding the links and harmonies behind disparate ideas
- Questioning – reexamining even the most basic assumptions
- Observing – seeking, finding, and analyzing the correct data
- Networking – if you need this one explained, I can’t help you
- Experimenting – prototyping, iterating, and just plain trying something new
This is as good a rubric for evaluating a firm’s innovation level as I’ve seen. Firm leaders looking to develop some of that tech startup mojo for their own companies could benefit from regularly bringing their practice heads together to assess how well they are integrating these traits into their own strategic plans. Some topics of discussion could be:

Associating – How are we doing at cross-selling within the firm? What are we doing to mingle our attorneys together into combinations that might not be intuitive, but might open up new areas of practice or new target markets we hadn’t previously identified? Outside of the purely legal practice, can the firm marry its skills with other, non-legal concepts to offer their clients a better service? For example, some firms, such as [Wilson Sonsini](https://www.wsgr.com/WSGR/Display.aspx?SectionName=practice/entrepreneurialservices.htm) and the firm I’m lucky enough to practice at, have married their corporate formation practices with venture capital consulting models to form [accelerators](https://www.fclaw.com/ventures) for their startup clients.

Questioning – What is our firm’s basic model? What is its mission statement, and what is its plan to fulfill that mission? Do those models and plans still make sense? Can they be improved? If we decided to throw everything out and radically remake the firm tomorrow, where would we start, and how? For example, a Chicago-based boutique called [Actuate Law](https://www.law.com/legaltechnews/2019/01/24/young-chicago-firm-latest-to-launch-legal-tech-subsidiary/) questioned whether part of its practice even needed to be housed within the law firm, and ended up spinning off a non-legal subsidiary called Quointec to develop legal AI tools.

Observing – What data are we tracking, both within the firm and in the larger market as a whole? How accurate are our tracking methods? How valuable is the data we’ve chosen to track? Do we need to put more resources into tracking firm metrics? Less? Are we actually using the data we’re putting together? It’s all well and good to know what your accounts receivable stands at, but can you break down the ages on those accounts? The legal sectors and practice groups with the biggest AR? Have you measured AR as a percentage of actual realized income?

Networking – Are our attorneys making links with the larger business community? Is our firm supporting those efforts? Is our firm making efforts to establish a larger general presence in the community? Are there strategic partnerships, at the firm-wide level, that would help us drive business to our partners and bring business back into our waiting arms? You don’t have to reinvent the wheel. There are plenty of off-the-shelf networking opportunities for lawyers. Consider [Vistage](https://www.vistage.com/), for example, which puts business in small groups to serve as a personal board of directors. Vistage tries to limit membership to one person per industry. So if you’re the only lawyer in the group, you might find yourself with some good ideas — and new clients.

Experimenting – What are we actively trying to do right now that we haven’t tried before? If we’re not trying new things, we’re failing. Where are we underperforming and in need of renovation? Where are we excelling, and can we afford to play around to try to pad our lead? Where do we have hungry young associates and partners willing to take a risk for the sake of building their practice? Workers at Google famously [spend 20 percent of their time on experimenting](https://www.inc.com/adam-robinson/google-employees-dedicate-20-percent-of-their-time-to-side-projects-heres-how-it-works.html) with new ideas (although Marissa Mayer says the [20 percent is more like 120 percent](https://www.businessinsider.com/mayer-google-20-time-does-not-exist-2015-1)). Whatever the percentage, the concept is right. It takes time and initiative, grit, and time to come up with new ideas and to experiment.

The Clock is Ticking

The change of pace in the business world is only accelerating. Failure to innovate now may mean failure to continue doing business in the future. TikTok isn’t just a billion-dollar app; it’s the sound of time running out on law firms that are content to phone it in.
