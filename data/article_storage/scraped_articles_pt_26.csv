# Atlanta Market Update: Higher Salaries, Robust Lateral Demand
## Atlanta is poised for outsized success in the competition for top legal talent.

You may have heard that Atlanta is a fantastic place to live. There’s no shortage of people deciding to move here to enjoy our reasonable cost of living, cultural diversity, and world-class entertainment, not to mention the [second highest rate of job growth](https://atlantaregional.org/whats-next-atl/articles/metro-atlantas-population-keeps-growing/) among large American metros. With Georgia [regularly placing first in rankings](https://www.metroatlantachamber.com/assets/executive_profile_-_october_2021_final_ZOy6bJK.pdf) of the best states for doing business, and Atlanta recognized as [one of the five best metros](https://www.metroatlantachamber.com/assets/executive_profile_-_october_2021_final_ZOy6bJK.pdf) nationally for business climate, many employers are actively expanding here, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Rivian. That adds to what has long been a strong local employer base: major companies headquartered in Atlanta include Home Depot, UPS, Coca-Cola, and Delta Air Lines.

But for Big Law attorneys considering a move to Atlanta, there was always one significant drawback. Despite the A-list corporate client base, Atlanta associate salaries lagged compensation in New York and other leading legal markets. Before Spring 2021, the top Atlanta salary scale started at $165k for first-year associates. Firms tended to follow a loose compensation scale for lateral associate hires, but annual salary increases for existing associates were not lockstep at most firms, causing many associates to fall increasingly behind their top-market peers as their careers progressed.

Closing the salary gap

Happily, over the past 18 months, the situation has improved greatly. First-year starting salaries have increased in Atlanta by as much as 30%. At least 14 firms now pay first-year associates $215k and another five start first-year associates at over $200k. Perhaps more significantly, of the 56 Big Law firms with an Atlanta office, at least 11 have matched the lockstep New York/Cravath compensation scale for all associates through their eighth year. Firms now paying Atlanta associates top dollar include both Atlanta-based firms, such as King & Spalding, Alston & Bird, and Troutman Pepper, and national firms with a substantial Atlanta presence, such as Holland & Knight and DLA Piper. Another 12 firms have adopted a modified version of the Cravath scale. Atlanta-based firms Morris, Manning & Martin and Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton are in this group, along with the Atlanta offices of national firms such as Nelson Mullins, Baker Hostetler, Greenberg Traurig, and Seyfarth Shaw.

The compensation increases have removed the main reason to hesitate in accepting an Atlanta Big Law offer. Even two years ago, the opportunity to relocate to a slightly smaller market that offers both sophisticated work and substantially more favorable cost of living was well worth considering. Now that a Big Law attorney from a top market can move here without taking a significant pay cut, it’s virtually a no-brainer.

Broad demand across practice areas

For lawyers intrigued about the opportunities here, we have good news: Atlanta lateral hiring is booming. In the first half of 2022, there were 285 lateral hires in Atlanta: 174 associates, 58 partners, and 53 counsel. That was a substantial increase over the 199 lateral hires in the first half of 2021 (117 associates, 50 partners, 32 counsel). Incidentally, it’s also more than the 229 total lateral moves in full-year 2020.

Opportunities are plentiful in both litigation and corporate. Litigation leads the pack, comprising 37% of Atlanta lateral moves year-to-date in 2022. Corporate lateral moves have accounted for 18% of the year-to-date total. Real Estate (15%), L&E (9%), and IP (7%) are also seeing relatively strong demand. These proportions were virtually identical in full-year 2021 for Corporate, Real Estate, and IP. Litigation was a bit less dominant in 2021 (32% of lateral moves), whereas L&E accounted for a somewhat greater proportion in 2021 (13%).

Atlanta is poised to compete for top talent

For those who haven’t spent much time here, it may be difficult to appreciate just how far a New York/Cravath salary and bonus will take you in Atlanta. The Atlanta Chamber of Commerce and Nerdwallet calculate our cost of living to be 140% less than New York City, 94% less than San Francisco, 58% less than DC, 45% less than Boston, and 17% less than Chicago. In other words, $215k in Atlanta is equivalent to $527k in New York City, $414k in San Francisco, $340k in DC, $311k in Boston, and $253k in Chicago. We at Lateral Link recently helped a 4th-year associate move from New York to Atlanta: she traded a 1-bedroom apartment for a five-bedroom house in one of Atlanta’s premiere neighborhoods.

But the upsides of living in Atlanta extend well beyond cost of living. This region is home to a remarkable diversity of people, with [no majority racial group](https://www.metroatlantachamber.com/assets/executive_profile_-_october_2021_final_ZOy6bJK.pdf) and one of the [largest LGBT populations](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/MSA-LGBT-Ranking-Mar-2021.pdf) nationally. Atlanta blends a cosmopolitan sensibility with traditional southern hospitality. And the mild winters will be appreciated by those migrating from northern climates.

Whatever your preferred form of entertainment, you’ll find it here. Atlanta has a legendary music scene, and film production has grown so rapidly in recent years that the city is now widely regarded as the Hollywood of the South. We have a pro sports team in every league and regularly host major college sports championships and tournaments. And when you’re ready to get out of town for a quick weekend trip, there’s a great chance you’ll find a direct routing from Atlanta: more than 80% of the U.S. population is within a two-hour flight.

Now that our major firms have closed the salary gap, Atlanta is poised for outsized success in the competition for top legal talent. If you think you might be tempted to move here, please [contact us to learn more](https://laterallink.com/).

There’ll be no[ jelly of the month club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K8-kNuDgoA) debacle at Mayer Brown this year! The Biglaw firm that took 17th place in the latest Am Law 100 rankings, with $1,484,000,000 in gross revenue is delighting its associates with full market rate special bonuses — with no hours requirement.

So-called COVID appreciation bonuses became all the rage [among Biglaw firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-fall-special-bonus-tracker-which-biglaw-firms-are-handing-out-cash-for-associates-hard-work-during-the-pandemic/?rf=1) starting in the fall, as a thank you for associates‘ hard work during the pandemic. The market special bonuses range from $7,500 to $40,000, depending on class year.

The special bonuses at Mayer Brown are in addition to their typical year-end bonuses. Those bonuses, which can differ based on the office, will remain at the same levels as last year. You can read the firm’s full announcement [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/mayer-brown-bonuses/2/)

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
It’s been a bumpy year for Mayer Brown. [Back in May,](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/top-20-am-law-firm-cuts-pay-for-all-due-to-covid-crisis/) the firm announced a series of graduated salary cuts. Even though at the time it was anticipated the cuts would last through the end of the year, in September they changed course and [restored salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/top-20-biglaw-firm-reverses-pay-cuts-but-not-everyone-is-happy/) to their pre-pandemic levels.

And tipsters report that the firm made retroactive salary payments restoring the cut salaries:

The firm already paid make-whole payments for the cuts to all associates back in October. After originally indicating that such payments might be made only to “high performers,” the firm actually paid them to everyone. Thus, with the payment of normal annual bonuses and market-matching special bonuses (with no hours requirement), associates are now in a position where they are making just as much as the average person at any top firm.

All of which means there are some pretty happy associates at the firm. Here’s a sampling of the comments:

This is a big deal because it shows that the firm was honest and made good on its word. The pandemic pay cuts were truly a prophylactic measure driven by the firm’s trademark conservatism during an uncertain time. I was skeptical of that and was considering jumping ship if bonuses didn’t pan out. But when it became clear to firm leadership that things were ok, notwithstanding the pandemic, they ensured that we would be compensated commensurate with the market. This is and will remain a market-matching firm. Morale is high. The firm is in fact having a great year and was just treading lightly back in the spring.
Importantly, even during its time of prophylactic austerity, the firm also did not conduct any layoffs, including staff.

Firm saw Sidley got burned on the hours requirements for special bonuses and stepped up. Associates are happy. Insanely busy year. Many associates I know will be getting end of year bonuses well in excess of market. I don’t know anyone that won’t hit their hours for a full bonus or more.

Congrats to those at the firm!

Michael Callier

Meet multi-lingual, multi-disciplinary Biglaw attorney, Michael Callier.

The practice of law is changing, yet few lawyers have studied the cutting-edge information technology and business protocols which will usher in that change. Even fewer have returned back to Biglaw to apply that knowledge.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Inside [Davis Wright & Tremaine’s](http://www.dwt.com/) dedicated innovation arm, [DWT De Novo](http://denovo.dwt.com/), Michael is utilizing business intelligence, root-cause analysis, and process engineering to help the firm’s clients get amazing results (while automating routine tasks).

Sound familiar?  It’s because DWT is working to blaze an alt.legal path and modernize the practice of law from the inside.

And let’s be clear, DWT is leading the way in innovation for Biglaw.  In both 2015 and 2016, DWT was named “Innovative Law Firm of the Year” by members of the ILTA (the International Legal Technology Association).  Michael was their first outside hire!

Besides having one of the most fascinating backstories around (a Division 1 football player and globe-trotting, multilingual in-house attorney), Michael has advice for those trying to change the legal system for the better:  call him!

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Joe Borstein: Tell me about your background?  You have been a D1 football player, a lawyer all over the world, and now you work for De Novo at DWT. Tell us quickly about your [alt.legal](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__alt.legal&d=DwMF-g&c=4ZIZThykDLcoWk-GVjSLmy8-1Cr1I4FWIvbLFebwKgY&r=VZeX4Yhw8aQkbke7I8w3r4UqdR8x29QMSdskhe7OgE4&m=XTO4rVFglr5hwh8g7ZO9ZqKVr2neZ_4Kut1DWAcHysU&s=rXCOzN4trNyAuVO-dkaxyIajv7x45N49wQVba1kM70I&e=) journey. 

MC: I started out on a traditional track — judicial and legislative internships in undergrad, law firm clerkships during law school, and a business associate role at a reputable law firm. A short while after becoming an associate, however, I developed an appetite for understanding the big picture of clients’ business problems. Years later, I went in-house with NIKE to get closer to those problems.

At NIKE, I discovered two things that changed my trajectory: (1) the rise of China, and (2) problem-solving methods like Lean Six Sigma, Knowledge Management, and Information Management — tools that are rare in the legal industry but that businesses rely on to solve everyday problems.

JB:  So tell me a bit about your adventure in China.

MC: My time in China was life-changing.  I first became interested in China when NIKE was preparing for the 2008 Olympics.  The energy around the event was palpable. Soon after, I discovered why NIKE was so excited: China, the “Sleeping Dragon,” had woken up and a major intersection with the Western world was inevitable. I felt absolutely compelled to both understand and operate effectively in that intersection.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
After working at NIKE for a few years, I found an institute that offers scholarships to foreigners for immersive language study in China and bought a one-way ticket to Shanghai. After completing the program, I became competent in Chinese language and culture and began working as legal counsel and director of China operations for a European business consultancy that focused on process improvement. My job was to direct operations and provide legal counsel as our European engineers advised our Chinese clients and strategic partners on aluminum manufacturing. That experience taught me three important lessons: 1) good (and bad) project management; 2) process improvement — taught by expert engineers; and 3) change and innovation are about people and culture. As we tried to integrate European manufacturing know-how into the Chinese manufacturing environment, the Chinese resisted the change because they had their own know-how and had not completely bought into the need for change.

Sound familiar? Changing the behavior of smart, successful people who take pride in the status quo, despite the fact that they know they need to change, is no small feat.

JB: And information management?

MC: Clients expect their attorneys to deliver the right law, at the right time, and in the right format to support their objectives.

The law is a form of information. Information Management is the science of facilitating effective information transfer. The law is just a piece of the puzzle that businesses need to solve to be successful — albeit an important piece. I saw Information Management as a path to design and build efficient information systems to help clients accumulate and assemble the additional pieces. I followed that path to the University of Washington’s Information School and completed a Master’s of Science in Information Management. My focus was strategic information initiatives which covered systems design, information structuring (like taxonomy and database design), entrepreneurship, project management, risk management, and data science.

Today, that training helps me to design legal solutions that work for business and bring more value to DWT and its clients.

JB: So then you returned to the US in 2014, how had the legal scene changed?

MC: Legal Tech was in full swing.

Legal departments were insourcing higher volumes of complex legal work as they hired more in-house counsel and outsourcing more low-risk work to LPOs. Contract automation was trying to gain a foothold outside of DTC solutions like Legal Zoom. And a few forward-thinking firms, like DWT, were looking for cross-disciplinary attorneys. In 2014, I was the first outside hire for De Novo. Now, De Novo has three Legal Solutions Architects with JDs from law school innovation programs. Those programs didn’t exist when I was in law school.

So I went pretty full circle but had I not left traditional practice, I never would have accumulated the skills and awareness that I have now. But I’m a perpetual student and continuing to learn how to mobilize people to tackle tough problems and thrive in a changing and challenging environment.

JB: Walk us through De Novo. What is its mission and how do you fit in?

MC: Our clients want greater efficiency, predictability, and flexibility. They want legal work product that’s easier to access and service providers who identify, understand, and creatively address business problems. De Novo’s goal is to meet these challenges and ensure Davis Wright Tremaine stays out front in the industry. We help our clients develop systems that address new and unique legal problems while automating repetitive tasks, and streamlining processes to accelerate decision-making and results.

DWT attorneys already deliver best-in-class traditional service for substantive legal matters. De Novo’s mission is to help DWT partners build the future practice of the firm. We approach our mission from a few different angles, including designing and scaling managed services and helping partners deliver practice-facing or client-facing business solutions.

My role on the team is to provide process and system strategy for large-scale deployments, like our managed services, and to design innovative legal solutions.

JB: We interview a lot of legal startup and legal tech companies. One common complaint is that they simply can’t get the attention of law firms. What advice would you give legal entrepreneurs? How can they get law firms to try new things?

MC:  They should call me to discuss — I’m happy to share! Law firms are adopting innovation (see the [Legal Services Innovation Index](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.legaltechinnovation.com_overview_&d=DwMF-g&c=4ZIZThykDLcoWk-GVjSLmy8-1Cr1I4FWIvbLFebwKgY&r=VZeX4Yhw8aQkbke7I8w3r4UqdR8x29QMSdskhe7OgE4&m=ei9c_mNoC_ELXNyfbeTHoVn1CiAcele5jSHBDQHIAnc&s=WUXjeW5sk2-X6v3lXPkiZ7H5Y9SnT6Y1ePgk4tz7_T4&e=)) but are traditionally risk-averse and structured in a way that can encourage stagnation. Legal entrepreneurs should know the signs of innovation readiness before spending time trying to sell to any particular firm.

JB: What areas of legal innovation excite you most? Any companies or CEOs we should keep our eyes on?

MC: AI, along with document and workflow automation, is going to change the practice of law.

Law firms are sitting on gold mines of unexploited, unstructured, and semi-structured data that could be converted into insights that provide great business value. I don’t think AI is going to replace lawyers, but that lawyers AND AI is a lot better than lawyers OR AI. With advances in automated ETL and data ingestion, along with self-service tools for articulating data analysis, lawyers should embrace AI for legal because it’s going to make their lives easier.

As for companies, I keep my eye on our two biggest clients: Amazon and Microsoft. I’m impressed with Microsoft’s digital transformation efforts, including [SQL Server Machine Learning Services](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__docs.microsoft.com_en-2Dus_sql_advanced-2Danalytics_r_sql-2Dserver-2Dr-2Dservices&d=DwMF-g&c=4ZIZThykDLcoWk-GVjSLmy8-1Cr1I4FWIvbLFebwKgY&r=VZeX4Yhw8aQkbke7I8w3r4UqdR8x29QMSdskhe7OgE4&m=ei9c_mNoC_ELXNyfbeTHoVn1CiAcele5jSHBDQHIAnc&s=it_v2ZMt0xAQCR2aNRf_6zRw9aoZqFah6BwslZ4B6pc&e=) which incorporates R and its open source libraries into MS SQL.  Also, check out LexPredict, which just open-sourced its data analytics and machine-learning tool, [ContraxSuite](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__github.com_LexPredict_lexpredict-2Dcontraxsuite&d=DwMF-g&c=4ZIZThykDLcoWk-GVjSLmy8-1Cr1I4FWIvbLFebwKgY&r=VZeX4Yhw8aQkbke7I8w3r4UqdR8x29QMSdskhe7OgE4&m=ei9c_mNoC_ELXNyfbeTHoVn1CiAcele5jSHBDQHIAnc&s=vtsJw17Wil9B-bA__mKcfjHx9TejgNApAHNeftYt0EE&e=).

# Top 4 Ways To Prepare For A Job Interview
## Interview preparation is a crucial step oftentimes overlooked in the process for those who think they can just wing it.

Getting the interview is the first step.  Getting the job offer is what you really want.   We always tell our candidates to secure the job offer so that you are the one making the decision.   Otherwise, you don’t really have an option from which choose.  That said, interview preparation is a crucial step oftentimes overlooked in the process for those who think they can just wing it.

Know Your Résumé. Preparation is key. If your plan is to go to the interview and just “fake it until you make it,” you will never make it. Your résumé is not sufficient enough to get you the job anymore. Back in the day, the interview process was merely a formality and a way for firms to screen out people who were completely socially inept. Today, you have to factor in many components and make certain you follow these steps:

- Know your résumé inside and out, and prepare yourself to speak in detail about your cases or transactions. The interview is your chance to shine and further expand on everything you have accomplished up until this point.  Take a video of yourself answering common interview questions and ask for constructive feedback.
- Act with confidence, not arrogance. It is not everyday that you have to spend hours discussing your accomplishments. You need to develop a simple sales pitch highlighting your strengths, accomplishments, and experiences, all without sounding like an arrogant summer associate who is inquiring about early partnership prospects. There is a balance.
[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4iFzweRf3E]

Know the Interviewers. One of the most important items is to research your interviewers. Before you set foot in the interviewer’s office, make sure you know your audience. Look for interesting common connections, past wins, anything that ties you and the interviewer together. There are numerous sources that provide specific background.   Most obviously, a firm’s website. Next up, LinkedIn. Lastly, the great mass of social media posts from Instagram to Facebook.  Most importantly, talk to your recruiter who, if worth their grain of salt, should know the personalities from prior interviewees who have gone through the process.  The goal is to demonstrate both your genuine interest in and deep knowledge of the firm.

Show Your Knowledge. You want the interviewer to know you are taking the process seriously and want the job. Every interviewer will ask you if you have any questions, and it is important to have thoughtful and relevant questions prepared as it shows a great deal of interest.   Also, adjust your questions based on the flow of the interview.  Don’t sound like a robot.   You shouldn’t ask an equity partner the same question as a senior associate. Know your audience.  Use segues when appropriate, especially if the conversation begins to dwindle, but never completely hijack the interview.

Dress the Part. Look professional, respectful, and hungry. Don’t pull up in a Ferrari, wearing a Rolex watch, and popping a Gucci pocket square. Dress to the standards of the environment. That means, likely no denim, unless your interview is with Quinn Emanuel, but even there, we’d recommend a more professional look. When in doubt, think simple and appropriate, not flashy. Take, for example, Andrea SoRelle, Principal at Lateral Link.



You may be surprised to know that there are four other candidates just as strong as you are who are interviewing for the same ONE spot. The candidate attending an interview without sufficient preparation demonstrates to the decision-maker a lack of interest, which will ultimately result in a lukewarm reception to your candidacy. Let Lateral Link help guide you through a successful interview to a job offer. Contact us today and allow one of our seasoned legal recruiters prepare you for the big day.

# Biglaw Firms Are Coming For Associate Jobs, Bonuses Based On Office Attendance
## Yikes! Associates may no longer be in control of the market.

Earlier this week, we highlighted a [rather ominous quote](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/want-your-full-biglaw-bonus-better-get-back-to-the-office/) from a Biglaw managing partner concerning associate bonuses. “Firms are being much stricter about attendance and tying it to bonuses and retention, because they can now,” said Andrew Detherage of Barnes & Thornburg. “A year ago, they couldn’t.” But now — amid a negative financial outlook for the largest of law firms that’s come at the same time as a tech industry implosion that’s led to layoffs en masse — it looks like they’re ready, willing, and able to do so.

The allure of free food wore off quickly for associates, and ever since, Biglaw firms have been having trouble getting employees to abide by their new in-office attendance policies. Today, firms are looking to leverage associates’ bonuses and even their job security against time spent at their desks.

“Now it’s, ‘If you’re not coming in, there’s going to be consequences,'” Michelle Fivel, a partner at recruiting firm Major, Lindsey & Africa, who specializes in placing associates, told the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/11/18/law-firms-start-tying-office-attendance-to-job-security-and-bonuses/). “Whether that’s losing your job or maybe not getting bonuses, or maybe that carrot of just, ‘Hey, if you’re not around, you’re not developing.’ That skill development. So, there is this concern about how this is going to affect the rest of your career.”

Fivel said she heard this week about a partner who said that lawyers who didn’t consistently show up to the office about three days a week “probably won’t be here too much longer.”

“That’s as strong as it gets, I think,” she said. “Firms don’t do that kind of stuff when they are not holding the most power in the job market. And the thing is, that pendulum is always swinging back and forth. But it’s swung pretty quickly back to the employers’ domain.”

The new normal for associates is starting to look a whole lot like the old normal for associates, with their firms in complete control. If they want their full bonuses — and if they want to avoid being seen as a candidate for stealth layoffs — it may be time to head on back to the office.

# Everything You Need To Know About Biglaw Parental Leave
## What does a good parental leave policy even mean?

In the latest episode of The Jabot podcast, I chat with [Kate Reder Sheikh](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/kate-reder-sheikh?byconsultantorauthor=kate-reder-sheikh), managing director in the Associate Practice Group at Major, Lindsey & Africa, who specializes in helping her clients negotiate parental leave. We discuss what a robust parental leave policy consists of, how to have uncomfortable conversations about parental leave, what to really expect when you take parental leave in Biglaw, and how gender-neutral parental leave can help close the gender pay gap.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wears when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

# What Is It Like To Practice Biglaw In The Summer?
## Being a summer associate is awesomeness wrapped in terror.

For summer associates staring at their newly-heftier paychecks — and yes, we realize no one really gets paychecks in the age of direct deposit, but then again phones don’t actually ring either unless you’re the hipster doofus who sets your iPhone to sound like a 40s receiver — the summer experience is a party fraught with danger. You have to live it up to show your superiors that you’re one of the gang… but not so much you end up embarrassing yourself. As we discuss in this week’s podcast, we have some legendary tales of summer associates embarrassing themselves.

How should a summer associate attack this opportunity with a major firm? We talk about that too, from getting the most out of lunch to maximizing your professional opportunities.

And for full-time associates, watching all the fun those law students have while you toil may be [a slap in the face](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/did-a-biglaw-lawyer-just-get-slapped-by-a-summer-associate/), but try to have some fun anyway.

## Only when you know what matters to you will you be able to look out and see if your values are reflected in the individual lawyers and law firms you are considering working with.

Last week, Sean [wrote about](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/97-of-general-counsels-agree-winning-isnt-everything/) the importance of values and ethics of the law firms providing services for corporate counsel, noting that, “97% percent of corporate counsel leaders told us they would take action if they discovered a law firm they were working with did not meet their ethical or values criteria.”

This brings up interesting questions about what it means to meet ethical or values criteria. While there will be certain extreme scenarios, such as attorney malpractice, lying about experiences, or other generally accepted criteria where it is clear that ethics or values have been violated, in most scenarios knowing whether a firm meets a company’s values is going to be much trickier.

Does it mean alignment with your company’s environmental, social, and governance goals? Does it mean public statements supporting causes that your company cares about? Is it based on their areas of expertise or the industries they are experienced in? None of these? All of these?

While there is no easy answer to this question, we try to provide a fairly comprehensive framework to this and other value-related questions in an [article we published](https://globelawonline.com/article/529/the-rise-of-the-ethically-empowered-corporate-legal-team), “The rise of the ethically empowered corporate legal team,” in the most recent edition of Modern Lawyer. Spoiler alert: If you don’t first know what you value, you are going to have a hell of a time trying to find lawyers and firms that match your values. Data and technology are critical in helping you to achieve your goals, but you first need to have a sense of where you are and where you want to go.

Only when you know what matters to you will you be able to look out and see if your values are reflected in the individual lawyers and law firms you are considering working with. Even then, it can be tricky.

One of the biggest challenges we see with our customers at Hence is when values seem aligned at one level, but misaligned at another. For example, companies may look at a law firm in aggregate and feel like the firm is well-aligned with their ethics and values, only to find that the individuals and teams supporting their internal matters do not. The same can happen in reverse. Particular lawyers may be well aligned, while the firm itself is not. And of course, neither companies nor values are static. They change over time.

The recent situation with Kirkland & Ellis and Paul Clement and Erin Murphy, for example, is a prominent and high-profile instance of differing values within the same law firm, and potentially also of changing values over time.

Kirkland & Ellis brought in Paul Clement, Erin Murphy, and more than 15 other attorneys when they absorbed Bancrofft PPLC in 2016. According to their press release, Kirkland brought in Bancrofft, and Clement in particular, to give “the Firm an unrivaled appellate capacity.” Clement was specifically described as a “Renowned Supreme Court Advocate.” Beyond this, Bancrofft and Clement also brought a track record of supporting controversial cases. [According to reports](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/04/paul-clement-quits-king-spalding-after-ks-moves-to-drop-doma-defense/), one of the reasons Clement left King & Spalding to join Bancroft was allegedly because they were going to drop [their work](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/04/paul-clement-and-king-spalding-defend-doma-at-a-discount/) with members of the U.S. House of Representatives to defend the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).

Simply put, it would seem that Kirkland brought in Paul Clement and Bancroft to argue and win cases in the U.S. Supreme Court. It is unclear how they felt about the types of cases Bancroft argued, but the types of cases were there for all to see.

From then on, Clement did what he was meant to. As recently as September 2021, Clement was highlighted in a Kirkland press release for being one of Law360’s 2021 Appellate MVPs, stating, “Paul Clement of Kirkland & Ellis LLP successfully argued four cases before the U.S. Supreme Court in the past year.” Then, at the end of June this year, Kirkland & Ellis won the landmark [U.S. Supreme Court case of New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf) and lost the partners who led them to victory.

Kirkland did not provide much context on why they left, but Clement and fellow partner Erin Murphy published an [op-ed in the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/2nd-amendment-bruen-new-york-gun-case-supreme-court-decision-kirkland-and-ellis-rule-of-law-constitution-11656017031) stating that, “we were told to ditch our clients or leave… There was only one choice: We couldn’t abandon our clients simply because their positions are unpopular in some circles.”

[According to Clement and Murphy](https://www.wsj.com/articles/2nd-amendment-bruen-new-york-gun-case-supreme-court-decision-kirkland-and-ellis-rule-of-law-constitution-11656017031), Kirkland was trying to get them to violate one of their most cherished values, namely that, “Lawyers owe a duty of loyalty to their clients.” Kirkland likely would not entirely agree with the implication that they are not loyal to their clients, however, it would seem that Kirkland was also considering other values.

What all this means for a company trying to find lawyers and firms that meet their values depends on the values of the company evaluating. For one, loyalty may be valued above all else. For another, avoiding controversy may be primary. A third company may be driven more by a mission to eradicate gun violence in the United States. A fourth to protect the Second Amendment.

Regardless of what your values are, if as a company you can articulate those values then two things should be clear from this example. First, there is a lot of data available about values that companies can use to evaluate. From press releases to court cases there is an immense amount of information available if you know how to find it and use it. Second, the challenge is a complex one that is only getting harder.

# Law Firms Believe In Themselves... Don't Have Much Faith In The Rest Of Y'All
## 2019 isn't going to be much different than 2018 according to law firm leadership.

It’s that time of the year where we check in on the confidence level of the leaders of America’s law firms. How are law firm leaders feeling? Not too good, as it turns out.

The Citi Private Bank Law Firm Group just released its confidence index for the first half of 2019 and — [as usual](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/law-firm-leaders-are-completely-confident-that-they-dont-have-much-confidence/) — managing partners are quick to place faith in themselves to see modest demand growth over the next several months but they really don’t have much faith in the economy as a whole.

Fully 69 percent of respondents believe the U.S. economy will be the same or worse over the first half of the year and 84 percent feel that was about the global economy. Very few see it getting “considerably worse,” so that’s a silver lining. And yet 73 percent feel that demand for their services will grow over the same span and 64 percent see revenue on the upswing. Unless Citi only talked to bankruptcy-heavy firms, those numbers probably can’t jive. Okay, okay, bad economic times can bring on consolidation mergers and a whole host of litigation, so it’s not totally fair to give all the good news to bankruptcy, but you get the drift.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The good news for lawyers is that law firms are sufficiently confident in their own prospects that they’re still ready, willing, and able to expand with 73 percent expecting to increase associate headcount — 61 percent saying they plan to expand by more than 1 percent. The non-equity partner ranks are expected to grow at 51 percent of the firms surveyed and 56 percent of respondents expect to add to their equity partnership numbers (44 percent by more than 1 percent).

What’s the takeaway from all this? Mostly that law firm leaders see the next few months as an extension of the last several years. These numbers more or less track exactly how firms felt last year at this time. Were they true to their predictions back then? Yeah, more or less. The economy limped along — though the market proper showed show volatile highs and lows — demand crept up slowly — though elite firms enjoyed more success on this front than the rest of the legal community — and headcount has gone up.

So generally speaking, meet the new year, same as the old year.

By now we all know the story of how the Am Law 100 fared in 2020. Contrary to what many of us [predicted](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/the-covid-19-crisis-and-the-perils-it-poses/), the Am Law 100, the nation’s 100 largest law firms by revenue, hit new highs in terms of [gross revenue, revenue per lawyer, and profits per equity partner](https://davidlat.substack.com/p/the-top-10-most-profitable-biglaw). For Biglaw, last year was a very, very good year.

But how about the firms that the American Lawyer refers to as the “Second Hundred,” the firms ranked #101 to #200 in terms of total revenue? Taken as a whole, these firms are not just smaller in revenue than the Am Law 100, but they also tend to be smaller in headcount, less profitable, and less prestigious.[[1]](#f1) Was 2020 as kind to them as it was to their higher-ranked peers?

The American Lawyer just published its [Am Law 200 rankings](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/05/18/the-2021-am-law-200-ranked-by-gross-revenue/) and accompanying [report](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/05/18/faced-with-a-fractured-economy-the-am-law-200-not-only-survived-they-grew/), and the big-picture answer is that the Second Hundred firms did … fine. They didn’t kill it like the Am Law 100 firms, but they also fared reasonably well, considering the global pandemic and economic downturn that loomed over last year. They did better than many of their clients, and they did better than many of us (and them) expected when the pandemic hit, when numerous firms started [instituting austerity measures](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-covid-crisis-law-firm-layoff-tracker-whats-your-firm-doing-to-survive/) left and right. Here’s how the Second Hundred performed as a group:

- Total revenue: $20.8 billion, up 1.1 percent.
- Average revenue per lawyer (RPL): $707,506, up 3 percent.
- Profits per equity partner (PPEP): $863,449, up 8.8 percent.
These numbers, standing alone, seem entirely respectable — but they’re positively mediocre compared to the numbers [for the Am Law 100](https://davidlat.substack.com/p/the-top-10-most-profitable-biglaw):

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
- Total revenue: $111 billion, up by 6.6 percent.
- Average revenue per lawyer (RPL): $1.05 million, up by 5 percent.
- Profits per equity partner (PPEP): $2.23 million, up by 13.4 percent.
I was surprised at the magnitude of the difference between the Am Law 100 and Second Hundred firms. The total revenue of the Am Law 100 is more than five times the total revenue of the Second Hundred. Average revenue per lawyer at an Am Law 100 firm is almost 50 percent higher than RPL at a Second Hundred firm. And profits per equity partner at an Am Law 100 firm are 2.5 times the PPEP at a Second Hundred firm.

The already large gap between Am Law 100 and Second Hundred firms only increased last year, since Am Law 100 firms grew these three key metrics at a much faster rate than their peers in the Second Hundred. These differences are why Brad Hildebrandt, founder of the legal management consultancy Hildebrandt Inc., said that comparing the Am Law 100 to the Second Hundred is the proverbial [apples-to-oranges](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/05/18/faced-with-a-fractured-economy-the-am-law-200-not-only-survived-they-grew/) comparison.

Why did the Am Law 100 outperform the Second Hundred by such a large margin during the pandemic? The always insightful Dan Packel identifies [several factors](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/05/18/faced-with-a-fractured-economy-the-am-law-200-not-only-survived-they-grew/), including more resources and better technology, which allowed the Am Law 100 to transition to remote working more quickly and efficiently; greater diversity in terms of practice areas, industries, and geographies, which insulated the Am Law 100 from the serious blows dealt to specific sectors during the downturn; and a stronger client base in general.

But one interesting thing that can make it tougher to generalize about the Second Hundred is that they’re a [much more diverse group than the Am Law 100](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/05/18/faced-with-a-fractured-economy-the-am-law-200-not-only-survived-they-grew/):

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
A Midwest powerhouse in its first year after a blockbuster merger [Taft Stettinius]. A single-office elite litigation boutique [Williams & Connolly]. A sprawling insurance defense legacy firm that’s expanded into transactional work and beyond [Wilson Elser]. An IP specialty shop [Finnegan]. And a firm that’s placed a bet on multidisciplinary practice, with a growing number of consultants working alongside lawyers [Manatt]. This sampling of five entirely different business models found within just the first ten spots in the Second Hundred is a microcosm of the diversity of the group.

Here are the first 10 firms in the Second Hundred, i.e., the firms ranked #101 to #110 in gross revenue. For the full list, check out the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/05/18/the-2021-am-law-200-from-a-to-z/).

[](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce757a20-b0d2-44b7-8853-ed327b05ef32_600x241.png)
The #1 firm in this group, Taft,[[2]](#f2) is very different from, say, the #4 firm, Williams & Connolly. Taft is a full-service firm with almost 600 lawyers across a dozen offices, mostly in the Midwest; W&C is an elite litigation shop with around 300 lawyers in a single D.C. office. The equity partnership of Taft, at 349 lawyers, is larger than all of Williams & Connolly, at 336 lawyers. And W&C is far more profitable than Taft, with PPEP of $1.448 million, compared to Taft’s $745,000. These two firms, both in the top 10 of the Second Hundred, have far less in common than pretty much any two members of the top 10 firms in the Am Law 100.

Aside from Taft shooting to the top, thanks to its merger with Minneapolis-based Briggs and Morgan, there wasn’t much movement in the top 10. Elsewhere in the rankings, four other firms joined the Am Law 200, in addition to Taft: Waller Lansden, Offit Kurman, FisherBroyles, and Herrick Feinstein. The most notable is FisherBroyles, the first “virtual” or “distributed” law firm to join the Am Law 200 — and surely not the last, given the [continued growth of these firms](https://www.law360.com/pulse/articles/1361435/virtual-law-firms-grow-amid-biglaw-hiring-slump), which should only accelerate now that the pandemic has taught us that working remotely can work quite well.

One firm fell from the Am Law 100 into the Am Law 200: Boies Schiller, which dropped from #93 to #130. This wasn’t a shock, since the Am Law 200 rankings are based on revenue, and BSF lost a lot of revenue when it [lost a lot of equity partners](https://davidlat.substack.com/p/whats-going-on-at-boies-schiller) last year. But it’s interesting to note that Boies actually grew its revenue per lawyer during 2020 by a respectable 4.6 percent, to $1.412 million, and PPEP, while down significantly, was still $2.3 million. As for 2021 performance, BSF came into this year with something to look forward to: fees from its work on the [$2.7 billion settlement](https://davidlat.substack.com/p/whats-going-on-at-boies-schiller) in the Blue Cross Blue Shield antitrust litigation.

Speaking of revenue per lawyer, widely regarded as the most reliable indicator of a firm’s financial performance, let’s look at the top 10 firms among the Second Hundred for RPL. Again, for the full list, see [Am Law](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/05/18/the-2021-am-law-200-from-a-to-z/).

[](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4def770f-9aea-47fc-87ef-5199649460ba_508x218.png)
Lots of prestigious litigation powerhouses here, including Irell, Kobre & Kim, Munger Tolles, Boies Schiller, and Patterson Belknap. But the litigation focus might also explain why the Second Hundred didn’t do as well as the Am Law 100 overall. Transactional practice enjoyed a much better year in 2020 than litigation, which suffered from extended courthouse closures and the cancellation or postponement of lucrative trials — so to the extent that the Am Law 100 firms are more focused on transactional work than the Second Hundred, they had a better year last year. Cf. [Mammas, Don’t Let Your Babies Grow Up To Be Litigators](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/02/mammas-dont-let-your-babies-grow-up-to-be-litigators/).

Interestingly enough, as the American Lawyer points out, some of the revenue per lawyer figures for Second Hundred firms are higher than the RPL figures at many Am Law 100 firms. The RPL figures of Irell, Kobre & Kim, and Choate would put them in the top 10 in a combined ranking of the Am Law 100 and Second Hundred firms by revenue per lawyer:

[](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5750732-abdf-405b-b589-e9e397d477c0_511x220.png)
In fact, Irell’s RPL of almost $2.1 million puts it ahead of Sullivan & Cromwell, Davis Polk, Kirkland & Ellis — every firm in the Am Law 200 except for Wachtell.

Finally, let’s take a look at the 10 firms in the Second Hundred with the highest profits per equity partner:

[](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F063d70e9-baf7-4836-930e-edd8aa418c29_495x234.png)
If you’re not familiar with Cole Scott, it’s a 541-lawyer firm with 13 offices across the state of Florida. The firm is best known for insurance defense litigation.

Wait, hold on — insurance defense litigation? How on God’s green earth does a firm focused on insurance defense work, a practice area with notoriously low billing rates and profit margins, boast PPEP of almost $3.7 million? Here’s how: Cole Scott has 541 lawyers, and just three equity partners.[[3]](#f3)

The other firms on the list are familiar names. Irell is a perennially profitable firm, and despite some notable partner departures in the past few years, it looks like its strategy of focusing on [high-end IP and commercial litigation](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/firm-will-focus-on-high-end-ip-and-commercial-litigation-after-departures-cut-revenue) is paying off. It grew its PPEP by almost 25 percent in 2020 — and 2021 might be even better, considering that in March the firm won a [$2.2 billion patent award](https://www.irell.com/ourwork-recent-matters-299#:~:text=Irell%20%26%20Manella%20LLP%20obtained%20a,technology%20used%20in%20Intel's%20microprocessors.) on behalf of its client, VLSI Technology LLC, against Intel.

Choate did well, which wasn’t unexpected, considering the firm’s strength in transactional work as well as litigation. More surprising is the strong performance of Kasowitz Benson. Industry observers have wondered for a while about the fate of the litigation-focused firm after Marc Kasowitz is no longer around, and the [departure of seven partners](https://today.westlaw.com/Document/I6dc949a0659611ebb18fff998c1627db/View/FullText.html?contextData=(sc.Default)&transitionType=Default&firstPage=true) in February to launch a new boutique, Glenn Agre Bergman & Fuentes, surely didn’t help in terms of succession planning (or lack thereof).

But based on that nice 20-percent increase in PPEP, things at Kasowitz are just fine — for now. Kasowitz isn’t the most transparent of firms — partners other than Marc Kasowitz have shockingly little information about the firm financials — but when the firm is doing well, Marc can pay his people enough to keep them happy.

The PPEP numbers for the top 10 firms in the Second Hundred look nice, standing alone — but again, they pale in comparison to the PPEP figures for Am Law 100 firms. Cole Scott’s $3.7 million would land it in 17th place in PPEP if it were an Am Law 100 firm, one spot behind Paul Hastings and one spot ahead of Cleary Gottlieb.

So that’s PPEP. Let’s now talk about PPP — no, not the old moniker for PPEP (formerly known as “Profits Per Partner”), but the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program. Per the American Lawyer, 44 of the Second Hundred firms took out forgivable Paycheck Protection Program loans from the federal government, compared with zero firms in the Am Law 100 (many of which were ineligible as businesses with more than 500 employees). As Dan Packel [explains](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/05/18/faced-with-a-fractured-economy-the-am-law-200-not-only-survived-they-grew/), cash from these loans wasn’t included in firm revenue under Am Law’s methodology, but it could get reflected in net income figures if money was ultimately directed to partner comp.

In closing, what can be said about the Am Law 100 and Second Hundred firms, now that all of last year’s financial figures are in? In 2020, the super-rich got richer — and the sorta-rich did just fine too.

[ [1]](#reff1) The key language here is “taken as a whole”: the Second Hundred firms, collectively, are less profitable and prestigious than the Am Law 100 firms, collectively. But certain individual firms in the Second Hundred, such as Williams & Connolly, Munger Tolles, and Irell & Manella, are more profitable and prestigious than many Am Law 100 firms.

[ [2]](#reff2) Taft, which you can think of as the Cravath of Cincinnati, has an [interesting history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taft_Stettinius_%26_Hollister). It’s quite old, tracing its roots back to 1885, and yes, there is a connection to former president and chief justice William Howard Taft. Two of President Taft’s sons, Robert A. Taft and Charles P. Taft II, co-founded one of the predecessor firms to today’s Taft.[](#reff2)

[ [3]](#reff3) It’s actually amazing that Cole Scott doesn’t have PPEP higher than $3.7 million, considering that its leverage — the ratio of all lawyers who aren’t equity partners to equity partners — is a staggering 179.33. But the average revenue per lawyer at Cole Scott is a mere $315,000, and the average profit per lawyer is around $20,000. Compare that to the revenue per lawyer at Wachtell Lipton, $3.645 million — meaning that a single Wachtell lawyer generates more revenue than 11 lawyers at Cole Scott.

As one of the very few women leading a firm in Big Law, I am keenly aware that while there has been progress in hiring, investing in, and elevating women lawyers – there is still much more to be done. A personal commitment of mine is to mentor and sponsor diverse legal talent within our firm, including women and people of color. I am proud to be part of a firm that has demonstrated a deep commitment to women lawyers for many years, and I am excited about the amazingly talented women leaders who represent the next generation at Jenner & Block. I look forward to the day when there are as many women as men leading Big Law firms.

— [Katya Jestin](https://jenner.com/people/KatyaJestin), co-managing partner of Jenner & Block, issuing a powerful statement on women’s progress in Biglaw, and at her firm in particular, on [International Women’s Day](https://www.internationalwomensday.com/).

I’ve heard ’em all.

Over coffee; over beers; by email; from folks looking for new jobs.

I’ve heard all of the gripes that big firm lawyers have about developing business.

Here are a few I like:

“I’m trying to sell my firm’s capacity to do internal investigations here in London. But we don’t have any heavy-hitters at our offices back in the United States. We don’t have any guys who had important positions at the Department of Justice, for example. How the heck can I sell our capacity to do internal investigations when we’re competing against firms that have those sorts of credentials?”

Good question.

I’ll let you know if I hear of any open in-house jobs.

(Alternatively: “What are you thinking? If you want to be important, then make yourself important. Write articles! Give talks! Write a book! If you want to attract business, [start doing something to attract business](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/12/inside-straight-building-a-practice-a-case-study/). Don’t wait for your firm to hire someone who’s going to turn you into a star. It doesn’t work that way.”)

There’s a corollary to the branch office in London that can’t sell the big offices back in the States:

“We can’t sell the mother ship because there aren’t any hotshot lawyers there. But the mother ship doesn’t sell us, either. We’re just a small branch office, and no one thinks to say that we could do a great investigation here in London. So we’re starved for business.”

Like I said: I’ll let you know if I hear of any in-house jobs.

“How can I sell myself? All I’ve ever done in my life is work here at Bigg & Mediocre. We’ve got other guys who have done real stuff: We have former judges, former assistant U.S. attorneys, guys who worked at the SEC, folks from the Department of Justice. I understand why people would want to hire those guys; why would anyone want to hire me?”

This one’s a little easier, although it depends on how your firm feels about origination credit.

For firms (which I think are relatively few) that give origination credit to only one lawyer, this is a tricky situation. You simply can’t invite the guy with credentials to attend the beauty contest with you.

But at firms that are more flexible with origination credit — credit can be shared between lawyers, or the firm doesn’t directly track origination credit — it’s a little easier. You get the first nibble with the client, and then you invite the credentialed guy to seal the deal.

You might have to share origination credit, but then you weren’t going to land the matter without the other person’s help anyway, so there’s a certain logic to being forced to share.

(And, of course, you could always make yourself important by speaking and writing and developing a reputation. I admit that’s hard, but wallowing in self-pity ain’t a barrel of laughs, either.)

How about this one:

“My firm’s so damn big that everyone’s already a client. Any time I get a call from a potential client, either my firm already represents them (so I don’t get client origination credit) or my firm is adverse to them (so the client can’t retain me because of conflicts). There’s no room to build a practice.”

This person solved his (or her) dilemma the obvious way: The person moved from the huge firm to a smaller one and then started to bring in the business that he (or she) had previously been losing.

And, of course, the increasingly common complaint:

“I’ve never brought in very much business, but the firm didn’t used to care. I stayed busy doing great client work to support my other partners, and the firm treated me with respect.

“That’s changed now. Only people who attract business stay in the ranks of equity partner. Those of us who simply do great work are demoted to income partner, or counsel, or thrown out of the firm entirely. What’s the justice in that?”

Who said the world was just? (Actually, for the more cold-hearted among my readers: That is justice. Why should people who can’t attract business be kept in the equity ranks?)

The truth is that firms need both lawyers who attract business and lawyers who do great work. Those aren’t necessarily the same people, but they’re equally responsible for the firm’s well-being. It’s only when the folks who control a lot of business end up running your firm (which happens pretty frequently) that the firm loses perspective.

But I’m afraid I can’t help with that. It’s a cold, hard world.

Global firm Herbert Smith Freehills just took a groundbreaking leap forward when it comes to benefits for transgender employees in the Biglaw world. The firm is now the first in the U.K. to cover gender affirmation surgery for attorneys and staff.

The firm’s new medical benefit is available to 1,651 U.K. employees, and will cover “all or part of the cost” of the surgery, and will provide psychological support “at any time during their transition process.” The firm’s new medical benefit was announced in tandem with its new Global Transitioning Guidelines, a set of policies which aim to support transitioning employees and create a culture of inclusion for all transgender employees. [Employee Benefits](https://www.employeebenefits.co.uk/issues/february-2018/herbert-smith-freehills-transgender-surgery/) has more information on the firm’s plans for its transgender employees worldwide:

Herbert Smith Freehills is also offering other medical benefits for global transgender employees. This includes time off for medical appointments and procedures, as well as time off for employees who want to support family members who are transitioning. The law firm is also looking to expand its gender affirmation surgery and psychological support medical benefit to a global scale in due course.

Stressing that HSF is a trans-inclusive workplace, [Justin D’Agostino](https://www.herbertsmithfreehills.com/our-people/justin-dagostino), the firm’s global head of disputes and the regional managing partner of its Asia offices, said, “[t]he transgender community faces ongoing discrimination and in launching these guidelines we are acknowledging the ongoing impact of transphobia on the everyday lives of our transgender colleagues and clients and the importance of creating a global workplace that is safe and supportive.”

Congratulations to Herbert Smith Freehills for being the first Biglaw firm in the U.K. to cover this important medical benefit for its transgender employees.

# Biglaw Firm Finally Announces Below-Market Raises For First-Years, May 'Completely Screw' Everyone Else
## Uh-oh. Are associates in trouble at this firm?

When it comes to firms that have made their associates irate this raise season, McGuireWoods is one that tops the list. First, partners buried their heads in the sand with their asses in the air, hoping that the media (read: we here at Above the Law) wouldn’t notice the fact that they’d [yet to make a decision on raising salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/these-partners-desperately-dont-want-us-to-know-they-arent-raising-salaries/) for their hard-working associates. Then, partners decided to announce an associate conference call where they wouldn’t discuss associate salaries, but instead reveal the winners of the [“McGuireWoods Excellence Award.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/no-raises-but-heres-a-made-up-award-for-your-trouble/) It looks like the firm decided to change course on partners’ reluctance to discuss raises, because today during that fateful associate awards call, the topic of salaries finally came up.

Unfortunately, only first-year associates at the firm received good news, and after all of that painful waiting, that good news didn’t even come in the form of a full Cravath match. [Thomas Cabaniss](https://www.mcguirewoods.com/People/C/Thomas-E-Cabaniss.aspx), the firm’s managing partner, announced that first-year associates in large markets would see their salaries rise from $155K to $175K. First-year associates in the firm’s middle-market offices would see their salaries increased from $140K to $155K. As for first-year associates in the firm’s small markets… well, there’s no specific raise information available — either because those associates won’t receive raises at all, or because their raises will be highly individualized, just like they will be for all of McGuireWoods’ more senior associates. Everyone will find out what their new salaries will be later this week, retroactive to July 1. “We’re all tentatively excited pending getting completely screwed over in individual memos,” said one frustrated associate.

Here’s what we heard from some other McGuireWoods associates about the comp news:

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
• I think one of the reasons they’ve been hesitant to react is there are some groups that are just really slow (all associates have access to firmwide numbers for billables — so it’s easy to see what groups are slow), and they were probably struggling with how to deal with that. My guess would be the associates in slow groups get small (or no) bumps. We’ll find out soon enough.

• The raises were actually announced during the Excellence Award conference call by the firm’s managing partner. He also explicitly said the firm would not be making a public announcement about the raises and kind of implied such practices were a little gauche, so I wouldn’t expect any official response from the firm. He said we’ll tell our incoming first years (and interview candidates) directly about the raise in comp.

Congratulations on your raises, McGuireWoods first-years, and to everyone else, we’d congratulate you on your prospective raises, but who knows what they’ll look like. We hope that not too many of you get “completely screwed.”

Remember, we are covering this trend extensively, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Silly Monkeys
## NFTs can embed legal relationships and legal terms into code and automate the entire life cycle of the associated transactions.

“Here we come, walkin’ down the street. We get the funniest looks from everyone we meet. Hey, hey, we’re the Monkees, and people say we monkey around. But we’re too busy singing to put anybody down.”

In 1966, while the established crowd thought rock music was a passing fad — mere dance music for teenagers — the Monkees went on to sell more than 75 million records worldwide. And here we are almost 60 years later with the “smart money” laughing at a new set of monkeys, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) known as the Bored Apes and their Yacht Club (#BAYC). To most lawyers, bankers, and accountants, and other smart folks, NFTs are just another passing fad. Silly monkeys!

Columnists here on ATL are a case in point. [Joe Patrice](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/2022/09/26/biglaw-firm-offers-nfts-to-lawyers-completing-its-metaverse-course-in-experiment-to-shove-as-many-buzzwords-in-a-title/), recently wrote: “It’s not that NFTs are dumb, they are incredibly dumb.” [Olga V. Mack](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/what-do-you-need-to-know-when-it-comes-to-nfts-and-the-law/), while not engaging in such ridicule, tends to focus on NFTs merely as digital art. The reality is that NFTs are the new digital contract (#legaltech). Routine Process Automation (RPA) and its ability to automate the drafting of paper contracts is of course still interesting because most lawyers still haven’t learned to apply it to their practice, but that doesn’t mean RPA tools like ContractExpress are still cutting edge. Cutting edge is a technology that completely eliminates the need for the paper contract. NFTs do just that. They embed legal relationships and legal terms into code and automate the entire life cycle of the associated transactions. Let’s consider some use cases.

First of all, the silly monkey pictures that appear on the tokens associated with the Bored Ape Yacht Club are actually no different than the cover of a book. Open up the book, look at the underlying token, and you will find that the holder of the NFT has purchased membership rights to a club that includes access to physical venues and events as well as future distributions automatically received in digital wallets in which the NFT is held. The rules and processes for the transfer of the asset and the benefits (the club membership, distributions, etc.) are immutable, transparent, and free of transaction costs (#frictionless).

Since we are talking about music here as well, let’s talk about concert tickets.  Neonox.io offers proprietors of events a blockchain-based platform on which to issue event tickets as NFTs. The NFTs offer a transparent and guaranteed method of transferability, enable the event owner to participate in resale proceeds, eliminate transaction fees, ensure authenticity, remain connected with the event attendee, and leave the event attendee with digital memorabilia following the event.  The event ticket NFTs eliminate the question of authenticity and the middle layers controlled today by Ticketmaster, Stubhub, and others. Sure the NFTs, like paper concert tickets, will display some relevant artistic design.  Imagine if someone thought a paper ticket to a Rolling Stones concert was just a silly picture of a funny looking man with a big fat tongue. Worthless before the concert? Worthless after the concert?

Balaji Srinivasan, a Stanford University technology professor, and author the book, “Network State,” talks about the concept of “soul-based NFTs” a token that is permanently associated with an individual with a specific purpose of non-transferability, say for example, your passport. Consider the legal rights controlled through today’s passport system of paper books and inkpad-based stamps. Say you need a record of what date you entered a country and what date you left, for tax residency purposes or visa authorization purposes among other reasons, and you are still flipping pages trying to decipher faded date stamps. An NFT-based passport paired with a biometric marker (fingerprint or iris scan) provides a mechanism that ensures authenticity, traceability, immutable records, and eliminates the friction associated with today’s paper book and inkpad stamp records. It is this antiquated paper-based system that is incredibly dumb.

Certainly, a large number of pointless NFT projects abound — many such projects are literally nothing more than computer-generated variations of the same image and absolutely no functionality. The inception of the dot com era in the 90’s similarly saw a multitude of sham websites. Anyone who relied on that fact to conclude that the internet was dumb or the need for a business to have a website was dumb probably ended up feeling like they made a silly mistake, much like the experts who wrote off the Monkees in 1966.

Two partners at [Balch & Bingham](https://www.balch.com/about/about), Steven McKinney and Joel Gilbert, have been indicted on charges of conspiracy, bribery, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy in connection with a plot to oppose an environmental cleanup plan in Alabama. Also implicated in the scheme is former Alabama state Rep. Oliver Robinson Jr., who played basketball briefly in the NBA before beginning his political career. Robinson has taken a plea deal on bribery, fraud and tax evasion charges.

The government’s case against McKinney and Gilbert revolves around their representation of Drummond Co. Inc., a coal company, in their efforts to avoid remediation costs in the cleanup of an EPA superfund site. (A Drummond executive, David Roberson has also been indicted in connection with the alleged conspiracy. Roberson is represented by Jones Day.) The pair allegedly directed Balch & Bingham, Drummond and another entity (the Alliance for Jobs and the Economy (AJE) that law enforcement contends was created by MicKinney, Gilbert and Roberson in furtherance of the scheme) to make payments to Robinson, through his charitable organization, for his support as a public official to oppose efforts to have residents’ homes tested for elevated levels of arsenic, benzo(a)pyrene and lead. As [reported by](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/09/29/law-firm-partners-indicted-in-environmental-cleanup-scandal/) Law.com, the bribes were allegedly made through a series of payments:

The government’s indictment claims that on June 22, 2015, Gilbert instructed Balch & Bingham’s accounting department not to make reference to the Oliver Robinson Foundation on invoices sent to Drummond and to remove references to the nonprofit on two other invoices the firm had already sent its client. McKinney had previously approved a payment request by Gilbert to the firm’s accounting department for a $14,000 check to Robinson’s foundation, according to the indictment.

[According to](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndal/pr/federal-grand-jury-indicts-two-lawyers-and-coal-company-vp-conspiracy-bribe-legislator) the Department of Justice the payments were laundered through the law firm:

As part of the conspiracy, payments from Drummond and AJE to the Oliver Robinson Foundation were routed through Balch & Bingham. According to the charges, the Oliver Robinson Foundation invoiced Balch & Bingham; Balch & Bingham paid the invoices; Balch & Bingham invoiced Drummond or AJE in an identical amount; and Drummond or AJE promptly paid those amounts to Balch & Bingham.

The U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama, Jay Town, is going after the lawyers as the mastermind of the corruption:

“McKinney and Gilbert were the brains behind any public or official action taken by Robinson—and why wouldn’t they? They helped Drummond buy him and they were getting what they paid for,” said Jay Town, the newly-appointed Republican U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama. “This is the worst type of public corruption. It was all done for the greed of a few and at the expense of so many families and children living in potentially toxic areas.”

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Balch & Bingham, a 230 attorney firm with offices in Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Georgia and Washington D.C., has hired [ W. Warren Hamel](https://www.venable.com/w-warren-hamel/) of Venable to represent them in the corruption probe. Both of the partners have been placed on indefinite leave — and their profiles are off of the firm’s website. The firm offered this statement on the charges:

“While we note that Mr. Gilbert has denied the charges and vowed to vigorously defend himself, and expect Mr. McKinney to do the same, the charges allege actions that, if proven to be true, are contrary to the ethical values that guide our firm’s attorneys and staff,” Balch & Bingham said. “We take these issues very seriously. We are continuing to cooperate fully with government authorities, because, in part, we believe strongly that our firm is not implicated more broadly in the alleged conduct … We will continue to ensure that all of the firm attorneys and staff, across our footprint, fully understand and are adhering to the highest standards of legal and ethical compliance.”

The charges against the attorneys are serious. McKinney and Gilbert could face up to 20 years in prison for the wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy charges, 10 years for the bribery charges and 5 for the conspiracy charges.

UPDATE: Attorneys for Gilbert have provided, in part, the following statement (you can read the full press release[ here](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lightfoot-franklin--white-llc-us-attorney-expected-to-indict-joel-gilbert-tomorrow-for-routine-work-within-the-practice-of-law-gilberts-counsel-will-prove-his-innocence-at-trial-300527244.html)):

Joel Gilbert is innocent of these charges. He did not bribe anyone. This is a case that never should have been brought. Joel represented a client in a legal dispute with the EPA, a powerful and, in this case, over-reaching federal agency. Everything he did while representing that client was lawful and ethical. He is a longtime partner at a leading law firm. A lawyer with a reputation for honesty and integrity, he did what is routine for good counselors to do for corporate and individual clients every day – he engaged a consultant through a written contract to perform real and lawful services.

“I’m going to compel him to include women in the sequel!” — [Angelica](https://genius.com/7857740), Hamilton (Lin-Manuel Miranda)

This week, McKinsey & Co. published a new study titled, [Women in Law Firms](https://www.mckinsey.com/Global-Themes/Gender-Equality/Women-in-law-firms). This study is part of McKinsey’s and LeanIn.Org’s broader [Women in the Workplace 2017](https://womenintheworkplace.com/) research.

In their broader initiative, which gathered data from 222 companies and surveyed over 70,000 employees, McKinsey and LeanIn.Org make several observations, which include:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
- Women fall behind early and continue to lose ground with every step –inequality starts at the very first promotion. This is even more dramatic for women of color.
- Women are not leaving their companies at higher rates than men, and very few plan to leave the workforce to focus on family.
- Women experience a workplace skewed in favor of men.
- Women of color, particularly black women, face even greater challenges.
- Women and men see the state of women — and the success of gender-diversity efforts — differently. In other words, men think women are doing better than they really are.
McKinsey partners Alexis Krivkovich and Irina Starikova and their colleagues introduce [their write-up on the study](https://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/gender-equality/women-in-the-workplace-2017), by stating:

More companies are committing to gender equality. But progress will remain slow unless we confront blind spots on diversity—particularly regarding women of color, and employee perceptions of the status quo.

They end their report by presenting a roadmap for [supporting and advancing women](https://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/leadership/time-for-a-new-gender-equality-playbook), which includes the following:

- Make a compelling case for gender diversity;
- Invest in more employee training;
- Ensure that hiring, promotions, and reviews are fair;
- Give employees the flexibility to fit work into their lives; and
- Focus on accountability and results.
As for the [Women in Law Firms 2017](https://www.mckinsey.com/Global-Themes/Gender-Equality/Women-in-law-firms) study, which gathered data from 23 law firms and surveyed 2,500 attorneys, McKinsey makes several key findings, which include:

- Attrition among women is lower than that among men, until the equity partner level.
- External hires for more senior positions are less likely to be women than men.
- Women are not convinced by law firms’ statements of commitment to gender diversity.
- Women see the playing field as uneven.
- Law firms lack the gender-equality targets and senior-leadership accountability that would enable the tracking needed to ensure real progress.
McKinsey partner Marc Brodherson and his colleagues introduce their [write-up on the study](https://www.mckinsey.com/Global-Themes/Gender-Equality/Women-in-law-firms) by stating:

 [Law firm diversity] efforts have had limited success. Only 19 percent of equity partners are women, and women are 29 percent less likely to reach the first level of partnership than are men. We found that law firms face higher attrition among women than men at the equity partner level and that the gender gap is much is much wider in law firms than in other industries.

Women of color face an even steeper climb, with their representation dropping significantly at all levels in the pipeline. Female attorneys perceive less commitment to gender equality and a more uneven playing field at law firms than their male colleagues.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
They end their report by recommending  three specific questions for law firms to ask themselves:

- How do we make flexible-work programs a real option?
- Where should we invest to strengthen coaching and formal sponsorship?
- How do we drive accountability for gender diversity?
And they conclude their report by stating:

Law firms clearly take gender diversity seriously and have made efforts to increase their diversity. But challenges remain, and the law firms committed to superior performance and employee satisfaction will act to address them.

If you have a few moments this weekend and are interested in improving gender equality at your law firm, I highly recommend you check out both of these studies — [Women in the Workplace 2017](https://womenintheworkplace.com/) and [Women in Law Firms 2017](https://www.mckinsey.com/Global-Themes/Gender-Equality/Women-in-law-firms).

# The On-Boarding Process
## There's no reason to be caught flat-footed at the last minute when it comes to bringing new team members into the fold.

Law firms are bad at many things, but they’re good at one: On-boarding new lawyers.
Time is money. Law firms know that. When law firms bring on new lawyers or laterals or have lawyers moving between offices, law firms permit those lawyers to start working on client matters as quickly as possible.

Corporations are less good at this.

In corporations, time is not (so directly) money. Corporate employees spend a fair amount of time dealing with internal bureaucracies. Corporations are less stressed about permitting employees to do productive work.

This is obvious in the on-boarding process.

A new employee joins the corporation.

Oh, shoot! We needed a computer for this person! Can someone order a computer, and it’ll be here in a few days?

Oh, shoot! We needed a telephone for this person! Can someone order a telephone, and it’ll be here in a few days?

Oh, shoot! We needed a pad of paper and a pencil for this person! Can someone see if there’s a pad and pencil lying around somewhere?

This is two things: (1) An abomination and (2) absolutely routine.

It’s an abomination because the employee is nonproductive. But it’s also an abomination because it tells the new employee that the corporation really doesn’t care whether the new employee does any work. The new employee thinks, “If the company doesn’t care if I accomplish anything — if I can wait days before I have a computer — then why should I care if I accomplish anything? I guess the main requirement of this job is to sit in the office from 9 to 5. I guess that’s not a bad gig, and I could learn to be pretty good at it.”

How about avoiding this problem — by giving about two minutes thought, in advance, to what new employees will need when they arrive at the workplace?

For example, you know before the employee arrives that the employee will need information technology supplies. Why not arrange for that stuff before the employee’s first day at work?

You know full well that someone should send a “welcome aboard” email to the team and the new hire, so everyone knows who the new person is. You could draft that email in advance.

The new hire should have an on-boarding package, explaining how the joint works. There’s no reason to be caught flat-footed at the last minute for that one.

The new hire should similarly receive a welcome packet, and again, that can be prepared in advance.

On the first day of work, someone should be assigned to greet the employee. That person should help with obtaining a security badge. That person (or someone) should have lunch with the new hire. Someone should introduce the new hire to everyone on the team.

This isn’t hard. It’s obvious. But someone in the joint should think about it before the employee’s first day.

Over the course of the first few weeks or months, the new hire should be invited to relevant corporate events. The new hire should be introduced to all of the relevant stakeholders in the business. The new hire should be exposed to materials that raise the new hire’s corporate IQ: What are all the businesses that the corporation is involved in? What are the basics of each? Who’s in charge of each? The new employee should know enough to understand the businesses and to be able to describe the businesses on the chance that an outsider asks.

Perhaps the new employee should shadow you (or someone else) for a day to get a sense of the joint.

After a couple of weeks have passed, the new hire should be asked about the on-boarding process, to see how it felt from the receiving end and to learn what you missed, so the process can be improved for the next person.

My sense is that corporations devote painfully little time to thinking about the on-boarding process.

Sadly, it shows.

# Partners Should Focus Less On Assigning Blame, More On Fixing Problems
## Needlessly assigning blame can hurt morale and divert resources away from fixing problems.

As mentioned in prior articles, [many attorneys focus far too much on insulating themselves from liability](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/lawyers-should-focus-less-on-cya-and-more-on-serving-clients/). Indeed, lawyers are often afraid to look bad in front of their bosses or face malpractice claims, and this sometimes forces many attorneys to cover themselves at the expense of their clients. One reason why attorneys may focus on shielding themselves from blowback is because partners at a variety of law firms often concern themselves more with assigning blame when something goes wrong than simply solving issues. Nevertheless, partners should focus less on assigning blame and should strive to spend the most energy possible finding solutions for clients.

Lawyers, like every other type of professional, mess up from time to time. Sometimes, attorneys screw up because they are inexperienced and do not know the correct procedure or substantive law to solve an issue. Pretty much every “baby lawyer” has a hard time figuring out when notices to admit need to be responded to, when paperwork needs to be filed, and all of the other practical legal strategies that professors don’t teach you in law school. In addition, lawyers sometimes mess up because they are too busy. I once worked at a firm where attorneys were responsible for handling hundreds of cases, and it was naturally easy for something to slip through the cracks with such a workload.

At some of the firms at which I worked, partners were not particularly focused on assigning blame, and used mess-ups as teaching moments. If something was not filed properly or was filed after a deadline, this was typically a good learning experience for how to properly litigate matters. Most screw-ups can be fixed, and few will kill a litigation matter or deal. As a result, there was usually ample opportunity to focus on solving problems and learning for future situations.

However, I also worked at firms where partners spent far too much time trying to figure out who exactly screwed up when something went wrong. These partners were like [Captain Hindsight](https://southpark.cc.com/clips/360430/captain-hindsight) (there is a long history of Above the Law writers citing to South Park!), trying to piece together email chains and other evidence needed to figure out precisely who was to blame for a misstep. While it may be important to find out who is the weakest link on a team to guide future employment decisions, it was often absurd how much time and energy partners spent on figuring out who had messed up.

When I worked in Biglaw, I was once tasked by a partner to assist her in an investigation of who had screwed up on a particular project. Our team had written a motion that had been denied by the judge. In a footnote of the judge’s opinion, the judge said that one of our citations did not stand for the proposition that we said it stood for in the brief. Since it is uncommon for a court to point out such a misstep in a footnote, we were somewhat embarrassed in front of the client for this issue.

Since I hadn’t worked at the firm when the motion was briefed (and could therefore not be assigned any blame) the partner tasked me with figuring out who was liable for this situation. While I can understand why a firm would want to do a retrospective on how the faulty citation ended up in the brief, this more introspective type of assessment was above my pay grade. I was simply tasked with determining if there was actually a mess-up and who was responsible for dropping the ball.

Somehow, word got out to other associates that I was conducting this project, and one of the associates who had worked on the brief called my office phone. He told me that the brief was written under enormous time pressure months ago, and the associates were not able to cite check and proofread the brief as much as they ordinarily would. The associate subtly requested that I spin the situation in the light most favorable to the associates that had worked on the brief.

I ended up telling the partner that the proposition that was cited in the brief was in the case cited, but simply in a different place in the opinion than the location referenced in the citation. It was a stretch to make this assertion, but I wanted to protect the associates and just complete the task investigating the mess-up with as little blowback as possible. However, there was really no reason to focus so much on assigning blame, and we could have simply changed our procedures moving forward without worrying associates that they might face serious consequences from a relatively minor mess-up.

Again, I’m not saying that it is bad for law firms to be reflective and assess on how they messed up and how they can improve in the future. However, partners should not perpetuate a culture where blame is delegated over focusing on how to solve an issue. Needlessly assigning blame can hurt morale and divert resources away from fixing problems.

# WHOA!!! Willkie Farr Is Handing Out Special Spring Bonuses
## This is sure to put some pressure on the market.

Spring officially starts tomorrow, but it’s already sprung in Biglaw because one elite firm is already tossing out piles of cash to its associates.

Willkie Farr decided to surprise its U.S. associates this morning by announcing another round of special bonuses thanks to the firm’s “very strong finish to 2020.” The firm [already included special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/willkie-bonuses/) with its year-end bonuses, so associates are going to be coming in WAY ahead of their peers at other firms.

Please note the UPDATE below.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Here’s the scale — which should look familiar to those who received special bonuses in 2020 — from the firm’s memo (available on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/willkie-spring-bonuses-2021/2)):

Class of 2020: $7,500
Class of 2019: $10,000
Class of 2018: $20,000
Class of 2017: $27,500
Class of 2016: $32,500
Class of 2015: $37,000
Class of 2014 and senior: $40,000

UPDATE (3/26): Willkie has now [matched Davis Polk’s bonus payments](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/willkie-special-bonus-match-2021/), which have become the prevailing market rate. The firm will pay associates between $12,000 and $64,000, depending on class year.

There’s just one catch. Willkie’s second special bonus will be paid in two parts: one payment will be made on June 30, and the second payment will be made on September 30. Associates will need to stick around at the firm to receive the entire special bonus, but after a year of absolute upheaval thanks to the pandemic, these fat stacks of cash will surely make up for it. But the good news doesn’t end there. The memo says that Willkie expects to pay its regular year-end bonuses in December, which we take to mean these are NOT replacements. Woohoo!

My colleague is excited about taking the International Association of Privacy Professionals exam. “I can’t wait to practice in today’s exciting, fast-developing privacy world!” she said. 

“Uh … wasn’t privacy new and exciting like 20 years ago?” I asked.

Then my husband pointed out that privacy will matter for hundreds if not thousands of years. “In the grand scheme of things, we are still at the beginning, especially with technology,” he said.

Beginnings are long — very long, my friends.

Legal professionals are still beginning the long process of understanding and using technologies that change our relationships with each other, businesses, and the rule of law in various ways. We’re all still learning to make sense of new tech-enhanced legal spaces. But there’s so much to love because all you need to join a beginning is a willingness to adapt. 

There’s So Much To Love About Long Beginnings

Some lawyers worry they are late to the blockchain party after missing out on a few initial waves. But that’s the beauty of long beginnings: it’s never too late to jump in and swim with the flow. (And you are definitely not late to blockchain adventures.)

Enjoy the beginning because there are no lines to stand in or clubs to join here. Perfection is a distant ideal. Enter the conversation, the market, a community, or a company in any way your skill sets enable you to contribute. Embrace your peers and mentors. Ask and answer questions. Share ideas and resources.

You’ll get plenty of opportunities to pivot. Mistakes are often preferred in the early days, as they can lead to discoveries. They can drive us to pivot here or there or to continue on our current path bolstered by our newfound knowledge and confidence. 

Beginnings bring the novelty of new interests and thoughts amid the unfamiliarity of a fresh experience. You’ll likely need to guess as you go — the opposite of what law school teaches us to do. 

Raising your tech competence can help alleviate that fish-out-of-water feeling. Lawyers don’t have to code or become technologists with a capital T. But we should understand how technology impacts our work and the legal aspects of our client businesses. 

At the same time, we must get comfortable with long periods of uncertainty. Regulations on technological advancements will arrive eventually. Then, the unfamiliar will be ours to navigate and make sense of again. This is what it means to practice law today.

Partner with technologists to make sense of new areas. Left alone, lawyers discussing technology and the law can drift into abstract philosophy in three seconds. Technologists keep our discussions practical and rooted in how things actually work.

There are many ways to contribute initially, even if you don`t have the title or skills yet. I know a few lawyers who enjoy not having fancy titles or certifications because they get to enjoy the beginning stage longer. 

Stay as long as you like and pivot whenever you want to wherever you want. That’s another benefit of practicing law today. 

Are you at the beginning of a new area of law? 

Do you collaborate with technologists on new projects?

Where are you in your career journey?

# Biglaw Firms Better Get Ready To Push Back Their Unrealistic Reopening Dates
## Yes, again. COVID-19 is still raging across America.

The dates don’t seem very realistic. People in the firms expect it to be pushed back.

Firms really want to have time back in the office. There are competing pressures here. On the one side, people have gotten attached to remote work. But for many firms their culture and long history is tied to being in the office.

Some firms will say, ‘Well we’re supporting hybrid work but expect you to be in the office four days a week.’ I think there’s a bit of a cognitive dissonance.

— Bill Bice, CEO of legal technology company nQ Zebraworks, commenting on the [Biglaw reopening announcements](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/08/31/big-law-converges-around-a-late-september-return-but-that-may-not-be-realistic/) that have been made public thus far. About half of the 72 law firms with publicly available return-to-office plans are targeting September 21 as their reopening date. The second-most popular date is October 21. According to [data analyzed](https://nqzw.com/firms-great-return/) by Bice, most firms are offering a hybrid return policy, with the most popular choice being three days a week in the office. The second-most popular option is four to five days a week in the office, which is not really a hybrid policy at all, and more of a full-time in-office policy.

# Welcome To The 'Kirklandization' Of Biglaw, Partners!
## Nonequity partnership tiers are getting bigger and bigger in Biglaw.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

This is the continuation of a trend, which is not ending in the near future — the sort of the Kirklandization of the industry. A lot of the traditional firms that looked down on [the nonequity tier] have since come around. The whole industry is going in that direction.

— Matthew Bersani, a legal recruiter with the Cliff Group, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/03/26/nonequity-partner-growth-kicks-into-high-gear-405-138528/) on the expansion of nonequity partnership tiers across Biglaw firms. As Bersani notes, Kirkland & Ellis, one of the most successful Biglaw firms in the world, has effectively used its vast troop of nonequity partners to boost the firm’s profits into the stratosphere. More than half of the firm’s partners are in the nonequity tier.

# Layoffs Come To Kirkland & Ellis, The World's Wealthiest Law Firm
## The firm is serious about keeping its COVID staff cuts on the down low.

Kirkland & Ellis is not only the [richest firm in the world](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/the-global-100-the-richest-law-firms-in-the-world-2020/), it’s also one of the nation’s greatest law firms. But outside of the firm’s compelling combination of prestige, profitability, and pay, something seems to be going on at K&E. Even for a firm with more than 1,000 partners, Kirkland has [lost an unusually high number](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/the-upswing-in-biglaw-partner-departures/) of them in 2020. On top of that, the firm was the first to [refuse to offer special fall bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/kirklands-not-giving-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-salty-about-it/) to associates, leading some to question why K&E was unwilling to share the wealth during a reportedly banner year.

Now, we’ve received word that the firm has been conducting layoffs.

During the coronavirus crisis, several firms have opted to let staff go to through a series of outright layoffs — be it to rightsize their ranks or account for the new realities of working remotely — during these tough times. This seems to be what’s happening at Kirkland, but under the auspices of secrecy.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Numerous sources have reached out to Above the Law to let us know that support staff at Kirkland & Ellis are being quietly pushed out. Here is what is happening at the firm. First came the general alerts about layoffs at the firm. (Potentially identifying information of those laid off has been redacted from their accounts.)

Kirkland had a round of layoffs this week for staff. Several people from several offices.

Kirkland Houston is laying off staff. They’re being very cagey about the reasons, but it seems like COVID cuts. I don’t have a reliable number yet — I’m asking around internally, but management is trying to keep things quiet.

Wanted to let you know anonymously that despite Kirkland having an amazing year, they have started letting staff go, even after the weekly emails from John Ballis assuring us of how amazing the firm is doing and how all of our hard work is so appreciated.

Stealth staff layoffs at Kirkland & Ellis. Not sure if attorneys are on the chopping block. Makes sense now why they didn’t want to pay the fall bonuses, as they have presumably had this planned for a while.  Pretty disgusting though, considering the year K&E is having.

Then, more and more tips continued to pour in, each one more and more detailed:

I was told today that my position was eliminated due to COVID-19 at Kirkland & Ellis LLP. I’m sure I will not be the only person to receive a phone call and I’m sure they’ll be making cuts throughout the week.

A list has gone around to some senior employees that were let go and the numbers have been updated to between 54-58 staff members from various departments. Some to be let go tomorrow and others before December 31st.

Last week (Wed./Thurs.) Kirkland & Ellis fired ~50 employees from its Chicago office staff (legal assistants/paralegals, IT personnel, legal secretaries, photocopy dept., and other admin./staff positions. Evidence suggests firings occurred in its other offices, as well, but how many or from which of the 14 other offices is unclear at this time. There are rumors floating around that another wave of firings is slated before year-end. No one feels safe and tension is high.

This account was even posted on [TheLayoff.com](https://www.thelayoff.com/post/@39zbd+14p5iQpY) three days ago, around the same time the staff layoffs were happening at the firm:

I myself am a support staff person who was “let go” because of performance issues. It’s simply not the case. I had a lot of admiration for Kirkland during my time there but I am now glad that I am free from that toxic greed.

Sources have told us that they will receive assistance with COBRA payments from the firm as well as generous severance packages, but have cautioned that their separation agreements reportedly state that said severance will be withheld if they discuss the reason for their departure with anyone.

When Sullivan & Cromwell [made staff cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/layoffs-come-to-top-20-am-law-firm/) this summer, the firm’s executive director refused to comment on personnel matters. Kirkland seems to be refusing to comment, at all. We’ve reached out to the firm several times via phone and email for a statement but we’ve yet to hear back. If and when we do, we will publish an update here.

Best of luck to all those affected by the staff layoffs at Kirkland & Ellis.

# SCOTUS Slams Lawyers For Petty Bigotry... Which Is What They Wanted Anyway

While places like Texas are working overtime on a so-called “bathroom bill” to serve the twin goals of salving the insecurities of morons and ensuring the state government continues to ignore its [embarrassing](http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/education/article/Texas-ranks-43rd-among-states-in-national-6750691.php) [deficiencies](http://www.expressnews.com/business/health-care/article/Texas-ranked-last-nationally-for-health-care-6684949.php), the Supreme Court is gearing up to hear the G.G. case about transgender restrooms and the requirements of Title IX. And as you might imagine the gaggle of organizations that make their nut fishing for donations from those with pockets as deep as their seeded prejudices are super excited about this one.

So much so that three of them violated the rules of the Supreme Court over it.

Gavin Grimm, captioned by his initials because he’s still a minor, wants to use the men’s room at his high school. Is the school’s decision to keep him out because he was born female unlawful gender discrimination under Title IX? That’s the question on the table. Not on the table is litigating Gavin Grimm’s gender, which is legally and medically male.

But [as reported by Slate](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2017/02/24/supreme_court_reprimands_groups_for_misgendering_gavin_grimm.html), Liberty Counsel, the National Organization for Marriage, and the Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence (who filed two briefs in conjunction with NOM), filed amici briefs with the caption: “Gloucester County School Board v. G.G., by her Next Friend and Mother, Deirdre Grimm.” Now that there is most definitely not the caption of the case and that didn’t escape the notice of Scott Harris, the Clerk of the Supreme Court, who promptly sent counsel letters:

It has come to the attention of this office that the cover of your amicus brief in this case identifies the respondent as “G.G., by her next friend and mother, Deirdre Grimm.” In fact, the caption for the case in this Court, as in the lower courts, identifies the respondent as “G.G., by his Next Friend and Mother, Deirdre Grimm.” (Emphasis added.) Under Rule 34, your cover is to reflect the caption of the case. Please ensure careful compliance with this requirement in this and other cases in the future.

You got cold clerked, son.

Mark Joseph Stern thinks this was a dumb move because it likely disqualifies these briefs, even for justices who might’ve been inclined to rule against the Grimm:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The briefs reject the very validity of Grimm’s identity in a manner that is both offensive and petty. Indeed, these organizations are so eager to deny Grimm this basic dignity that they intentionally flouted the rules of the Supreme Court of the United States. It is difficult to imagine a justice citing anything these groups’ briefs say—even those who vote against Grimm. Liberty Counsel, NOM, and the CCJ have given the game away, revealing that while they claim to care about bathroom predators, they are really attempting to repudiate trans people’s identity.

That’s definitely true, but how often do justices really give a damn about an amicus brief? Certainly some entities — say, for example, filings by non-party state attorneys general — are important enough to get some love as amici. But usually an amicus brief is just a pretty document that non-profits can wave around at fundraisers. If anything, these shenanigans probably helped their odds of getting cited… by the other side. While the school district tries to play off how this is about stopping predators and not a matter of gender, some enterprising justice can say, “you say that, but weren’t these briefs submitted trying to litigate the kid’s gender?”

If that’s the case, then you might think sabotaging their side is the sort of thing Liberty Counsel, NOM, and the CCJ would feel bad about, but consider what’s really at stake for them. No votes on the Court are changing over this. The justices have known how they’ll vote on this case since before they saw the cert petition. All that’s happened is a few groups got to pull this petty, bigoted captioning move and then suffered no real punishment whatsoever. Now they can take this admonishment letter on the cocktail circuit to crow about how the activist, politically correct Supreme Court is a threat to our cherished medieval values and how they “bravely” stood up to those liberal bullies by refusing to extend common f**king courtesy to a minor.

No, these folks knew what they were doing and they got exactly what they wanted.

# What To Do If You Get Laid Off -- Or If You Think You Might Get Laid Off
## Don’t reach out to anyone until you take steps to make yourself hot property when you start speaking to people.

Okay, the law business has gone from boom to — maybe — bust, depending on your area of practice. You just got laid off, or maybe you think there is a good chance that will be happening soon. What should you do? Here are some thoughts.

At the outset, do not go out and tell other people you need a job. This is a poor plan, as you will essentially be branding yourself as a sad sack who needs help.  Even your closest friends will find it difficult to help someone in that situation. So whatever you do, don’t do that. In fact, don’t reach out to anyone until you take the following steps, all designed to make you hot property when you start speaking to people:

First, read these three articles I wrote about four years ago. They outline exactly how to get a job. They have all of my thoughts from four years ago. I tried to give very specific steps, and if you follow them, they will dramatically increase your chances of success:

- [Marketing Yourself: How To Create A Powerful Résumé (Part III)](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/marketing-yourself-how-to-create-a-powerful-resume-part-iii/)
Second, think of this as an opportunity rather than a problem. You possibly always wanted the chance to redefine your career, but who would quit a steady job for something risky? Well, that concern has been taken away — since your employer effectively made or is making the decision for you — and now the world is open to you. When I got fired from a big firm — close to 30 years ago — I recall initial horror, depression, panic, and misery. But then it was followed by open-mindedness, then introspection, and finally by (yes, truly) exhilaration.

Third, take a look at the industry you are servicing and think what needs there are in that industry and how you could create value. I am sorry to sound like a humbug, and I don’t mean it that way, but I suggest that you read my book, “If You Want To Get Rich, Build A Power Niche,” as that is what you should be doing (i.e., creating a Power Niche for yourself).

Note that until this time, you haven’t reached out to anyone. You are setting up your game plan so that you are in a good and strong position when you start talking to people — unlike the sad sack mentioned in my second paragraph above.

Fourth, once you have created a Power Niche, now it is time to start reaching out to people. Instead of “needing a job,” you have something to offer; namely, power in your Power Niche. This will only be of interest to a small subset of potential employers, but if you do it right it will be of dramatic interest to those few employers and, after all, you only need one job.

As an aside, be mindful that you don’t FIND a Power Niche, you CREATE one.

Fifth, network and network and network, but as you do it, keep mentioning your Power Niche to everyone. If your Power Niche is a good one, the message will resonate, and you will start to see all sorts of things happen. Of course, if your Power Niche is a dud, it may still work but not nearly as well.

Lastly, you can — and should — start creating a Power Niche for your career even if you are gainfully employed and think a layoff is very unlikely. A Power Niche can juice your career dramatically.

Oh, yes, if you are a real estate lawyer, maybe give me a shout. We are hiring!!!!

# Biglaw Firm Pledges To Keep Fighting To Protect Abortion Rights In America
## Defending abortion access will be absolutely essential in our post-Dobbs world.

Access to abortion care is essential for women’s equality. I and my Boies Schiller colleagues will continue to fight alongside organizations like the Center for Reproductive Rights, state by state, law by law, to protect access where we can. We are not going anywhere.

— Joanna Wright, a member of the executive committee and diversity council at Boies Schiller Flexner, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2022/06/24/as-scotus-overturns-roe-steptoe-gives-lawyers-and-business-professionals-day-off-to-reflect/) after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade. Wright went on to note that this is the first time the high court has ever taken away a constitutional right, one that is “vital” to women’s healthcare. The firm has already notched a win in this battle after receiving a [temporary restraining order against Louisiana’s “trigger laws,”](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/06/27/boies-schiller-lawyers-file-emergency-relief-petition-in-louisiana-following-roe-reversal/) which criminalized abortion in the state immediately after Roe’s reversal.

After a 15-year run as the head of the firm, [Eric Friedman](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/f/friedman-eric-j) is stepping down from his role as Skadden’s executive partner. Friedman was just the third person to serve in this role in the firm’s venerable 75-year history.

During his time serving as Skadden’s leader, Friedman responsibly guided the approximately 1,700-lawyer firm through a recession, a pandemic, and a great deal of financial growth. As noted by the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/06/15/skadden-names-new-executive-partner-as-eric-friedman-steps-aside-after-15-years-at-the-helm/), when Friedman first assumed his leadership role in 2008, the firm’s revenue was just over $2 billion. Last year, the firm’s revenue was just over $3 billion.

Friedman will be passing the reins to corporate partner [Jeremy London](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/l/london-jeremy-d), a 25-year Skadden veteran who currently serves as chair of the firm’s client engagement committee, and previously served as a member of the firm’s partner compensation committee. “Jeremy is an outstanding lawyer, highly capable leader and trusted colleague who embodies our firm’s core values, including our commitment to superior client service,” Friedman shared of his successor in a statement. “The partnership has made an excellent choice in selecting Jeremy as our next executive partner, and I am certain that under his stewardship Skadden will continue to thrive as one of the world’s leading law firms.”

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
London, who will assume the executive partner role next spring, had this to say of his future with the firm:

“Through his steadfast leadership, Eric Friedman has personified our values, enriched our culture and positioned us for ongoing success. I am honored to step into this role next April, and I look forward to working with Eric during the transition period, and with all of my partners to best serve our clients, support our colleagues and position them for success, and continue to attract the top talent in the legal industry.”

Congratulations to Eric Friedman on a job well done, and congratulations to Jeremy London on his ascent to the top of the firm.

Young business woman working from home wearing protective mask

I’m on the board of my apartment building. We voted to require masks when you’re in the building. I run jog (without a mask, out in the streets, more than six feet away from everyone) in the morning. But I carry a mask in my pocket: When I return to the apartment building and walk the thirty steps from the back door to the service elevator, I’m in public. I’m on the board, so I put on a mask for those thirty steps. It may be silly, but it’s only right.

For several years, I served as the chief compliance officer of my company.  During those years (and some would say permanently), I was humorless. You look at the ethics complaints coming up through the system, and you realize that people take offense at damn near everything. As the chief compliance officer, you shouldn’t give offense. So I didn’t. I might have been boring but not giving offense was part of the job. (It’s slightly easier now that I oversee litigation. You’re still in a leadership role, but you can lighten up a little bit.)

So here’s what I don’t understand: The United States is facing one serious policy issue, about which reasonable minds should certainly differ, and one scientific issue, about which reasonable minds could not possibly differ. Why have those two issues become intertwined?

The policy issue is this: For how long should we shut down the economy to reduce the spread of COVID-19?

This is a very hard question. How quickly should we have shut down the economy at the outset? At what speed should we reopen? These are hard trade-offs to consider: If we leave the economy closed people will be out of work, people will be driven into poverty, domestic violence and alcoholism will increase, and so on. If we open the economy, we avoid those social ills — but people will die. How many deaths should we tolerate for how much economic and social cost? (Don’t tell me that’s an immoral question.  Governments make those decisions all the time: Should the speed limit be 20 mph or 70 mph? It depends on how much inefficiency we’ll tolerate for how many deaths. How many safety precautions should we take when digging mines? How tall should we allow a building to be? Governmental decisions will inevitably result in deaths, but we make those decisions.)

Politicians will disagree about the speed with which we should reopen the economy, and both sides can hold reasonable positions. We should encourage that debate, make a reasoned choice, and then move on (informed by new data as that data become available).

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The scientific issue, unrelated to the tough policy choice, is this: Should people wear masks in public?

This is not a policy issue about which reasonable minds could differ. There’s plenty of scientific evidence showing that wearing masks reduces the spread of COVID-19. Wearing a mask may be a pain in the neck, but everyone should tolerate a minor nuisance for the greater good of saving lives. This is not an issue as to which politicians, or anyone, should differ.

But somehow they do.

[Democrats now generally favor wearing masks; Republicans do not](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-do-so-many-americans-refuse-to-wear-face-masks-it-may-have-nothing-to-do-with-politics-2020-06-16). President Donald Trump says that some people wear masks “[to signal disapproval of him](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/18/trump-says-some-wear-coronavirus-masks-to-signal-disapproval-of-him.html).” That may now be true — but, if it’s true, it’s only because the government has already blundered so badly. It is Trump himself who refuses to wear a mask and who suggests that there’s a legitimate argument against wearing masks (by tweeting that there are “[[s]o many different viewpoints](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1265980172739719170?lang=en)” on the issue).

I understand that we live in a partisan time. But can’t we occasionally let an issue of universal public health remain nonpartisan?

We spend a lot of time here at Above the Law detailing the exploits of people that have used their Biglaw background to do… anything but the law.

These Biglaw refugees can go on to any manner of distinguished careers: president of the [National Basketball Retired Players Association](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/len-elmore-has-the-ultimate-sports-law-resume/), [political commentator](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/10/quote-of-the-day-shes-no-miss-congeniality/), [sports reporter](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/lawyer-turned-sports-reporter-clay-travis-dishes-on-what-its-like-to-leave-the-law-cle-credits-and-college-football/), [bestselling author](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/05/because-biglaw-could-use-more-gorgeous-yale-law-grads-who-are-also-bestselling-authors/), [reality TV](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/07/celebrity-summer-associate-an-apprentice-in-law/) [star](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/former-biglaw-associate-looks-for-love-on-tv-again/), [novelist](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/biglaw-partner-turns-author-in-historical-debut-novel/), or [professional wrestler](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/11/musical-chairs-david-otunga-to-wwe/), and they serve as a reminder to all those still mired in the billable hour rat race that escape is possible.

Celebrating those that have come before, [Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/famous-people-who-were-big-law-lawyers-video/) has put together a list of former Biglaw associates, and the Am Law 200 firms they once slaved away at, who are now famous. Enjoy the list and start daydreaming about the future of celebrity where you worry about Snapchat wars, not exchanging interrogatories.

# California Market Update: Plentiful Office Openings, Strong Associate Demand
## In the midst of the pandemic-fueled narrative about an exodus from California, a funny thing happened: several Biglaw firms took the opportunity to enter the California market for the first time.

In the midst of the pandemic-fueled narrative about an exodus from California, a funny thing happened: several Biglaw firms took the opportunity to enter the California market for the first time. Demand for associate and counsel hires was red hot in 2021 and remains strong now, with both the new entrants and hometown California firms hunting for lateral talent.

A wave of new entrants

Some California lawyers have of course taken the opportunity to relocate in the pandemic-induced reshuffling. Markets like [Austin](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/texas-market-update-lateral-opportunities-abound/) and Salt Lake City have grown impressively, attracting both major firms and California-trained attorneys. But in the same period, some big-name lawyers have moved into the Golden State as prominent firms aggressively expand their California offerings.

Debevoise & Plimpton offers an instructive case study. Before 2021, the firm had never had a west coast office, despite its many years of serving major California clients. So Debevoise attracted attention when it announced last year that it was relocating 14 attorneys to San Francisco, including M&A co-chair Michael Diz and IP litigation chair David Bernstein. The firm has since bolstered its Northern California ranks with locally-hired partners such as former Skadden IP litigation co-chair Jay Neukom and longtime SEC lawyer Kristin Snyder.

Debevoise has plenty of company sensing opportunities in California. Fellow New York firm Paul, Weiss joined Debevoise in San Francisco, while Cleary Gottlieb set up shop in both San Francisco and Silicon Valley. Two Magic Circle firms arrived in the Bay Area, with Freshfields opening a Silicon Valley office and Allen & Overy setting up three California locations in the space of a year: Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Silicon Valley. Firms with some existing California presence also decided to expand in 2021. After just over a decade of operating in Los Angeles, Jenner & Block opened in San Francisco. Willkie expanded to Los Angeles, building on its existing San Francisco and Silicon Valley offices.

It remains to be seen how these new outposts will fare over the longer term. But one advantage of moving into the Bay Area in 2021 was relatively attractive pricing on commercial real estate, in the midst of uncertainty over the future office space needs of the region’s tech companies. That may give the new entrants some cushion as they continue to build their California client bases.

Continued lateral hiring opportunities

So what does all this mean for associate and counsel lateral hiring? On the whole, the California market remains healthy across the board. Granted, the market has calmed a bit from the unprecedented frenzy of 2021, but there are still numerous opportunities across multiple practice areas.

Geographically, demand is fairly balanced between the Bay Area and Southern California.  Specifically, there are currently around 900 associate and counsel openings in each of those regions. (For comparison, there are around 1,100 in New York.)

Demand for corporate associates is no longer at the frenzied pace it was last year, but it remains steady. We have seen a steady increase in litigation and real estate openings in recent months. Across all practice areas, the greatest need is for midlevel as well as senior associates, with the sweet spot in the range of 2-5 years of experience.

Firms have this year taken the opportunity to rebuild their summer associate programs after two summers of scaled-down (and largely remote) programs. Many firms are hosting their largest summer classes ever, and almost all are having in-person summer associate programs.

The return to in-person summer programs is consistent with a broader move towards imposing some limits on remote work options. By national standards, California firms generally have relatively flexible remote work policies. For example, Cooley recently announced that it would not require attorneys to return to the office even though the firm’s offices have fully reopened as of the beginning of June. However, firms have generally declined to follow Quinn Emanuel’s lead in allowing associates full remote flexibility — working anywhere in the country for as long as they would like. Nonetheless, firms recognize that five days in the office is not a viable demand in the current healthy lateral market.

A good time to consider a move to California

Nobody can predict the economy’s future direction with certainty, but by historical standards, it’s still an excellent time to pursue a lateral move to California. As the recent entry of so many firms illustrates, the growth of other markets has not materially damaged California’s appeal as a place to build a cutting-edge legal practice.  If you are interested in learning more about the California legal market, please do not hesitate to contact me or one of my California colleagues.

# Associate Bonus Watch: Sullivan & Cromwell Finally Speaks!
## The firm sure took its sweet time to announce bonuses this year.

Associates at Sullivan & Cromwell have been restless for days, beseeching us to write about the fact that the firm had yet to announce bonuses. “All associates here are shocked,” said one associate. “The cafeteria is basically a war room.” Another obviously upset associate remarked, “Partners are acting as if nothing happened during the year-end reviews. If they think the firm is unable/unwilling to pay bonuses they should just announce it!” These associates had every right to worry, because SullCrom was one of the only Vault 10 firms that hadn’t announced bonuses yet — until this afternoon.

If you thought the firm was taking its sweet time because it was deciding whether or not to award bonuses that were better than the Cravath scale, then you were wrong. Sullivan & Crowell appears to have matched the [Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2016-associate-bonuses/), yet again.

As you may recall from prior years, S&C doesn’t issue a universal bonus memo listing different class years and their respective bonuses; instead, the firm sends each associate an individual memo with a link to an intranet page listing that lawyer’s year-end bonus and compensation for the year ahead. We have heard from S&C associates in a wide range of class years, and so far they all report amounts on the Cravath scale.

The Sullivan & Cromwell bonuses will be paid on December 21. Unfortunately, there is no mention in the memo of spring bonuses, which S&C has sometimes paid in the past.

Barring any major surprises, the Biglaw bonus scale is now set. We’ll continue to track the announcements, even if there won’t be as much suspense going forward.

That’s our take on associate bonuses from Sullivan & Cromwell. If you’re a lawyer at the firm, what do you think? Feel free to let us know how you feel [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Staff%20Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks for your help.

# We Can't Let 'Pawternity Leave' Become A Thing

I get it. I spend enough time around childless people with fabulous disposable income. I know what they bitch about when “breeders” aren’t around. I know that some of them feel unfairly treated when parents “get to” miss work or leave early because of their children. From their perspective, what with their lives solely focused on what’s good for them, parents who have hard outs from work because they have to go home and take care of their kids irks them.

“They chose to have that kid. If only I had some excuse to leave work at the close of business hours.”

Normally, I am content to leave these genetic dead ends to their own devices. Most of them will enjoy the horrors of parenting soon enough. And the ones who don’t will live long enough to experience the abject loneliness of an old age comforted only by their professional successes and sound retirement planning.

Unfortunately, Texas Lawyer [has a “trend” piece up](https://www.law.com/texaslawyer/2018/10/15/pawternity-leave-are-employers-barking-up-the-wrong-tree-with-pet-based-leave/) that desperately needs to get off my lawn.

Pawternity Leave: Are Employers Barking Up the Wrong Tree With Pet-Based Leave?

No. Nooooo. The line must be drawn HERE. This far, AND NO FURTHER.

Look, I’m a pet owner. I’ve been coming into work late every few Wednesdays for months now to take her to doggy chemo, and I’m thankful my company and colleagues can accommodate me. When she inevitably passes, I’m gonna need a day.

But my company already has something to deal with that, something that does not require promulgating an entire pet-leave policy. It’s called: A PERSONAL DAY. When my dog dies, I will take a freaking personal day, RUB SOME DIRT ON IT, and come back to work the next day.

I would not insult my colleagues — colleagues who have dealt with the HUMAN DEATH in their families — by asking for freaking BEREAVEMENT LEAVE for my pet. Christ on a bone.

Part of my objection to pet leave is that it actually infantilizes employees, under the guise of being “worker friendly.” If you are a grown-ass adult, you shouldn’t have to memorialize every freaking moment you are not at the office. If you need a day, take a day. As an adult, you can be trusted that you have some plan for making sure all of your essential functions are either covered or will be completed in a timely fashion.

If you are a good employee, it’ll all even out. If you are a sh***y employee, no amount of “I took two weeks of pawternity leave” is going to hide the fact that you bailed on your company right when something important was due.

You know who took my dog to chemo the Wednesday during the Kavanaugh hearings? Nobody! I rescheduled it. Because I kind of needed to work that day.

If you are going to allow for pet leave, you had better do it like Susman Godfrey.

Susman allows for [unlimited vacation](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/10/firm-offering-unlimited-parental-leave-for-all-parents/). Unlimited. Because Susman treats people like adults. Texas Lawyer reached out to Susman to see if associates could use the unlimited leave for pets, and Susman was like “sure.”

Neal Manne, a managing partner of the Houston-based firm, said that as soon as he read a commentary about the pawternity leave trend in Texas Lawyer on Monday, it was clear to him that the firm already provides that benefit under the firm’s unlimited vacation policy for associates.
“We have an unlimited paid vacation leave—as much as anybody wants. It’s a vacation policy; It’s a pawternity policy; it’s an I-want-to-go-to-the-beach policy,” Manne said.

That just makes sense. It’s not about giving people a cheap excuse to get out of work, it’s about empowering people to handle their lives.

You don’t need a pet leave policy. You need to employ adults and treat them as such.

Your crisis management legal team?

People say to me, ‘What is your practice?’ I say, ‘Well, if I could put ‘big messes’ on my business card, I would.’

— [Jamie Gorelick](https://www.wilmerhale.com/en/people/jamie-gorelick), co-chair of the crisis management and strategic response group at WilmerHale, commenting on her [unique practice area](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/03/28/meet-the-lawyers-who-clean-up-clients-worst-messes/). Gorelick likens herself to the pilot on a client’s plane that’s about to crash, saying, “You’re in flight, you have a decision to make. You generally do not have time to look up the manual, consult broadly, turn the plane around, do a bunch of loops. You have to land the plane. For many lawyers, that’s a very uncomfortable place.”

# Am Law 200 Firm Conducts Associate Layoffs Due To COVID-19
## Associates were 'blindsided' by the news.

It was just last week that we said the layoffs were coming, and we hate to say we told you so, but it looks like we were right. The coronavirus crisis is far from over, and after one financial quarter has passed, it may just be getting started with Biglaw.

Sources have reached out to us regarding associate layoffs occurring at Hughes Hubbard & Reed — a firm that was recently ranked #116 on the Am Law 200 with gross revenue of $288,100,000 — in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. We’ve been told the firm is offering affected associates three months’ severance pay as well as five free sessions with a recruiter to help them find another job (and that the recruiter was hired to help “everyone” impacted, leading associates to believe these were large-scale layoffs). It is unclear at this time how many associates were let go. We’ve heard that the reason for the layoffs was there not being enough work to go around at the firm. Those who have contacted us said they were “blindsided” by the news, as the firm has been touting its financial success via email every Friday.

It was recently revealed that the firm received between [$5 and $10 million in loans](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/the-biglaw-firms-that-cashed-in-on-government-ppp-loans/) from the paycheck protection program, likely to avoid conducting layoffs. And yet, here we are.

We reached out to Hughes Hubbard for comment. Here’s a statement from the firm:

More than three months into the pandemic, the deep impact of court closures and a slowdown in deal activity have given us a better-informed sense of the manner in which the pandemic has changed the way we do business. To prepare for that future we must take action that we have long sought to avoid and layoff certain attorneys and staff. We regret the hardship these steps cause as we, and the industry, continue to evolve to meet this changing environment. We have confidence that the action we take today will enable us to continue to serve our clients, to compete at the highest level and to deploy our people effectively.

Best of luck to all those who are affected by the layoffs at Hughes Hubbard.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs/Salary%20Cuts) or text us (646-820-8477).

# Oh, Look At The Biglaw Firm Representing OAN...
## This is not a great look for a Biglaw firm.

Earlier this month, Herring Networks — the parent company of One America News Network (OAN) — [filed suit](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21410177/oann-lawsuit.pdf) against AT&T, its chairman William Kennard, and DirecTV over the decision not to renew its carriage contract with the controversial network, as well as another Herring-owned network, AWE, on DirecTV’s lineup. The suit, filed in California Superior Court, alleges the nonrenewal “will result in damage to Herring exceeding $1 billion” and says, “As a result of the conduct of AT&T, AT&T Services, DirecTV, and Kennard, OAN and AWE might be forced off the air because Herring will no longer be able to broadcast OAN and AWE via DirecTV and Herring presently has limited alternative carriage options.”

What? That’s not me giving dreamy looks over the possibility of a world without OAN.

But, before we dig further into the allegations in the case — and we will, as this is a legal industry website — the question of which lawyers threw in their lot with the far right of the broadcasting world lords over the whole matter. Well, it’s Eric R. McDonough, Marie E. Christiansen, Blaine C. Kimrey, Jeanah Park and Bryan K. Clark of Vedder Price. That’s… certainly *a* look for a Biglaw firm.

Listen, decisions on what kind of clients and cases to take have repercussions for a Biglaw firm. Jones Day faced [boycotts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/protests-and-boycotts-come-to-jones-days-doorstep/), [attack ads](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/you-have-to-watch-the-opening-salvo-in-the-anti-jones-day-ad-campaign), and [more](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/jones-day-to-prepare-for-a-bad-pr-campaign-the-likes-of-which-theyve-never-seen-before/) for their election representations. King & Spalding saw protests [on their front door](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/protests-and-boycotts-come-to-jones-days-doorstep/) over election work. While firms [like Snell & Wilmer](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/biglaw-firm-withdraws-from-election-litigation-before-they-get-jones-day-ed/) and [Porter Wright](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/another-biglaw-firm-withdraws-from-election-litigation-no-not-jones-day/) withdrew from controversial cases rather than deal with the blowback. And [Foley & Lardner](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/cleta-mitchell-out-at-foley-lardner-after-troubling-donald-trump-call/), [Fox Rothschild](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/and-now-both-biglaw-lawyers-have-resigned-over-the-trump-call/), and [Barnes & Thornburg](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/barnes-thornburg-partner-from-loony-mypillow-suit-no-longer-with-the-firm/) quickly parted ways with partners who took on problematic representations.

Plus, there’s the whole [recruitment aspect](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/the-biglaw-firms-doing-trumps-election-bidding/) — law firms flourish or wither based on their ability to recruit and retain the best and brightest minds. Remember, lawyers tend to [skew more liberal](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/the-mostly-liberal-political-ideologies-of-american-lawyers-law-schools-and-firms/) than the average population. And OAN has veered well off the mainstream for, pretty much its entire existence. So, laterals and law students — unless you actually want to be involved in a case like this (in which case you probably have [your heart set on working for Jones Day](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/new-report-explains-that-no-matter-how-objectionable-you-thought-jones-day-was-its-worse/)) — keep these cases in mind when you’re interviewing with Vedder Price.

But, let’s get back to the instant case, because that’s not all that’s in there. The complaint further alleges claims for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing because, though AT&T is merely not renewing their carriage contract with OAN, a separate advertising deal with AT&T subsidiary Xandr runs until July 2024. And the complaint alleges that was proof that the carriage contract would be renewed:

Herring reasonably believed that the Advertising Agreement was proof of a commitment to a long-term carriage relationship by AT&T, AT&T Services, and DirecTV. This belief was solidified by the fact that the Advertising Agreement was set to expire more than two years after the Affiliation Agreement was set to expire. Herring did not take issue with the term of the Advertising Agreement because Herring had a reasonable belief that the Affiliation Agreement would be renewed.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
There’s also an allegation that the confidentiality provision of the contract was violated when the coming nonrenewal was disclosed to the press.

The lawsuit further alleges that AT&T disparaged OAN because of things said by on-air talent, as [reported by](https://www.law360.com/articles/1474276/oan-sues-at-t-over-directv-pull-disparagement-by-cnn) Law360:

According to Herring, the on-air talent of any AT&T-owned outlet is bound by the non-disparagement agreement, meaning AT&T was improperly disparaging OAN through HBO’s John Oliver when the “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver” host called OAN “Fox News with even less shame and even fewer scruples” and a “ragtag band of fascists,” and when he said OAN is “happy to give a platform to batshit election fraud theories from America’s most out-of-breath pillow fetishist” Mike Lindell, the CEO of My Pillow Inc. known for pushing pro-Trump election conspiracies.

The suit further alleges that AT&T disparaged Herring in violation of their affiliation agreement when CNN host Jake Tapper said OAN is “a major source of lies masquerading as facts,” CNN host Don Lemon stated that OAN is “corrosive to our democracy” and CNN media reporter Oliver Darcy called OAN a “far right-wing conspiracy channel” that “promotes all sorts of nonsense.”

CNN chief media correspondent Brian Stelter on Jan. 17, 2021, continued “promoting disparagement of OAN” by inviting former Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos on-air to criticize OAN, Herring argued.

If you want to know why the decision to part ways with OAN was made by AT&T, well, the lawsuit has a theory. And it supposedly has everything to do with that [$1.6 billion defamation](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/dominion-voting-sues-newsmax-oan-the-overstock-weirdo-for-1-6-billion/?rf=1) lawsuit Dominion filed against OAN (plus a hefty dose of leftist pressure, natch).

Herring argues that AT&T Board Chairman William Kennard also serves as a member of the executive board of directors of Staple Street, which is the majority owner of Dominion. Kennard is a Democrat who previously served as chairman of the FCC under former President Bill Clinton and U.S. Ambassador to the European Union under President Barack Obama, Herring said.

Kennard’s role at Staple Street “includes ensuring Dominion defeats its opponents such as Herring in Dominion’s defamation litigation,” Herring said. “And one way to hasten Herring’s defeat is by cutting off Herring’s ability to earn revenue to help fund its defense.”

I’m not sure [that case needs](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/oan-execs-try-to-yeet-out-of-dominion-defamation-suit-in-dc-leaving-reporters-holding-the-bag/) an assist, but that’s *a* theory. And oh look, it’s Vedder Price [that’s doing the heavy lifting](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/60120427/47/us-dominion-inc-v-herring-networks-inc/) on behalf of OAN in its defense of that defamation suit filed by Dominion. No surprise there.

Reince is a good man and a very reasonable person. He doesn’t fit the mold of a lot of the other people Trump is picking. I really pray that this brings a voice of reason to the White House and the cabinet.

— [Andrew Moss](http://www.krmlegal.com/attorneys.html), a plaintiffs’ lawyer at [Kutner Rubinoff & Moss](http://www.krmlegal.com/), offering [remarks on his classmate](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/11/15/law-school-classmates-call-priebus-a-voice-of-reason-for-trump-white-house/) from Miami Law, [Reince Priebus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reince_Priebus), the Chairman of the Republican National Committee who was recently chosen as President-elect Donald Trump’s chief of staff. Priebus has been [on leave](https://www.michaelbest.com/People/Reince-Priebus-On-Leave-) from [Michael Best & Friedrich](https://www.michaelbest.com/), an Am Law 200 firm, since he first took up his duties with the RNC in 2011.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Solo practitioner [Al Isani](http://www.manta.com/c/mb54l4w/the-law-offices-of-al-isani-p-a), another of Priebus’s classmates, had this to say: “For all those people out there who have fears about a Trump presidency—of whom there are many—if they knew Reince Priebus as I do, I think they would be somewhat comforted. He’s a voice of reason and he will try and keep things on an even keel. The way you see him on TV is how he was—always smiling and even-tempered. I don’t have anything bad to say about him. How often can you say that about a fellow lawyer?”

# Curate Your Tech Stack As You Do Your Closet To Propel Your Legal Career Forward
## The right tech tools can make you look like a superstar.

I like to wear boldly colored, knee-length dresses at my in-person presentations. Yellows and reds are favorites! I add cheerfully colored heels, accessories, and bright lipstick. The finished appearance enhances my confidence.

[Research has shown](https://www.lifehack.org/355487/science-says-what-you-wear-largely-affects-how-you-think-and-behave) that our clothes broadly impact how we feel about ourselves and interact with those around us. Sharp attire can give you a positive energy that others notice. It illuminates you, whereas wearing shoddy clothing makes you disappear and miss out on opportunities.

In short, we can strategically choose clothing to craft our desired experiences. And we can use technology in the same way. Our tech stack can propel our careers forward — or hold us back from our goals. That’s why it’s important to curate your tech stack as you might curate your closet. 

Curate Tech With Purpose And Style 

Just as we craft a visual presentation of ourselves to the world through our clothing choices, we can also make a conscious decision about the technologies we use to present ourselves online, in the workplace, and in everyday life.

Question loudly, “Who do I want to be? How do I want to present myself?”

[INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE.] 

Then, take the necessary actions to become that person. It’s similar to the old adage to dress for the job you want. The idea here is to outfit your career with the tools that empower you to adapt and perform at higher levels. 

For example, cell phones and laptops are as commonplace as T-shirts and jeans. Without them, many of us would be lost. You may also:

- Iron out any client relationship wrinkles with a matter management system that coordinates all your client and matter details the way you might color-code your pants, shirts, jackets, ties, and shoes.
- Adopt a contract management platform that updates your contract templates like a personal stylist does with your wardrobe.
- Pair a project management tool with e-signature software as if you’re pairing a suit with a shirt and tie to create a complete solution.
The right tech tools can make you look like a superstar. Don your advanced tech knowledge like a superhero cape! Or sport your tech skills with the comfort and ease of yoga pants and baseball caps. It all depends on how you define yourself.

And remember, shopping is far from a one-time event. Many of today’s professional career goals require continuous learning to keep up with constant change. Questions to ask when filling your technology closet include:

- Does the technology fit me well in all the areas it needs to? 
- Will it help me feel confident and stay relevant? 
- Will it give me the edge to stand out from the crowd?
You can always add a trendy item or two for variety. But don’t waste too much time on fads. Make smart choices that support short, midrange, and long-term goals. This timeless approach to the digital age will serve us on all occasions, like a little black dress or a navy blazer. 

What does your tech style say about you? What does it say about your career?

# Legal Career Growth: Why Continuous Engagement With Legal Recruiters Is Key
## Discover how engaging with a legal recruiter, even when you're not actively job hunting, can offer unparalleled insights, guidance, and opportunities to advance your legal career.

It is a common misconception that recruiters are only useful during an active job search. While it may be surprising, engaging with a legal recruiter while you’re still content in your current role can bring tremendous value. The help of a skilled legal recruiter can positively impact your career development and set you on the path to a successful and lucrative legal career. Here’s where an informed legal recruiter can help you maintain a competitive edge even if you are not actively job searching:

Unearth Exclusive Market Insights

Lawyers often wonder about the market and how they fit into it. Legal recruiters know the legal market and can provide you with detailed market insight. This can help you conduct periodic career evaluations, irrespective of any immediate intention to lateral. Questions that your legal recruiter can help you answer may include:

- Is my compensation competitive?
- How does the future of my practice or niche look?
- Which legal market resonates best with my expertise?
- Should I lateral now or later?
Recruiters’ guidance on the market, practice areas, and timing of a career move can ensure that you make transitions at the opportune time and at the peak of your marketability.

Receive a Customized Career Consultation

Lawyers want to do what’s best for their careers, but often find themselves without a knowledgeable professional to guide them. Recruiters recognize that your career is an evolving narrative and understand that your circumstances are unique. Your pressing questions may include:

- Are you on par with the milestones typical for someone with your experience?
- Are you strategizing appropriately to increase your odds of becoming a partner?
- Is your current specialization what you want for the remainder of your legal career?
- Are you well-positioned to transition to an in-house role?
Every individual’s situation is different and distinct. Recruiters offer targeted guidance and connect you with the best resources tailored to your needs.

Cultivate Connections and Prepare for the Unexpected

Gone are the days when employees stayed at the same company for the duration of their careers. While many attorneys might stay with a firm for a considerable time, a transition is often inevitable. A need for a lateral move may arise from layoffs, economic downturns, non-competitive compensation, a change in firm leadership, or some other occurrence. By nurturing relationships with seasoned legal recruiters, when the unexpected happens, you’re primed with a trusted ally to navigate the shift seamlessly.

Help Your Network

Being content with your firm doesn’t mean your network is. Engaging with recruiters and knowing what is going on in your market positions you to refer someone in your network who may be looking for their next opportunity. Recruiters welcome referrals and you may be able to connect your colleagues, friends, and peers to new and exciting legal opportunities.

Position Yourself for the Golden Opportunity

Perhaps the most enticing reason is the unforeseen “golden opportunity.” Without active searching, irresistible and exclusive opportunities may be brought to your attention — whether it’s an unparalleled work-life balance, an attractive compensation package, or the chance to work at a prestigious law firm. Legal recruiters can connect you to these serendipitous opportunities and it may be exactly what you didn’t know you are looking for.

While your instinct might be to approach recruiters only during active job searches, astute attorneys foster this relationship throughout their careers. Doing so not only provides a competitive edge but also primes them for future legal opportunities. Consider recruiters not just as gateways to new roles but as lifelong partners at every step of your career.

# A Jones Day Partner Unintentionally Sums Up The Vapidity Of The Political Moment
## Biglaw partner beclowns himself.

The gold-plated airhead: a fitting metaphor of these days.

There are some people who think the whole Donald Trump phenomenon is just an exercise in throwing around third-grade insults to cover for a complete inability to comprehend or counter complex thoughts. A childish celebration of ignorance and selfishness — a weaponized “safe space” — foisted upon the Republic by a cynical, race-baiting GOP and an insultingly aloof Democratic establishment.

And those people would be right.

As an example of this pox on the landscape of reason, take this response of a partner at Jones Day — Biglaw’s basket of deplorables — to [a straightforward account of the history of the Electoral College](http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2016/11/11/the_electoral_college_is_an_instrument_of_white_supremacy_and_sexism.html) written by Mark Joseph Stern. Does partner [John Vogt](http://www.jonesday.com/javogt/) quarrel with Stern’s analysis of Madison’s notes linking the College to the same white supremacist logic of the three-fifths clause? Or does he raise real workability concerns over the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact? Perhaps he thinks the real problem with the Electoral College rests in the [wholly unintended cap on House apportionment](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/why-is-the-electoral-college-constitutional/)?

Hard-hitting analysis in my inbox from [@JonesDay](https://twitter.com/JonesDay) partner John A. Vogt [https://t.co/tdxjr0Nf60](https://t.co/tdxjr0Nf60) [pic.twitter.com/QWrWtiNSTA](https://t.co/QWrWtiNSTA)

— Mark Joseph Stern (@mjs_DC) [December 20, 2016](https://twitter.com/mjs_DC/status/811255390159699968)

Top-notch argumentation!

Perhaps it’s for the best that federal judges [use cartoons to benchslap Jones Day](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/judge-uses-cartoons-to-benchslap-jones-day/) — they may not be able to deal with the big words.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But that’s the whole worrying crux of the political moment. Dodging direct argumentation like a cur is not only acceptable, it’s almost considered a sign of weakness to engage in the dirty business of point-by-point refutation.

After all, trying to refute Stern would expose Vogt’s complaints — whatever they may be — as wholly bereft of merit. That’s the troll’s guiding maxim: best to hurl an unwarranted, empty barb and be thought a fool than pen a response and remove all doubt.

And now that’s the guiding maxim of American deliberative democracy.

As the moment’s most accomplished logician might say: SAD!

# Revenge Of The Nerds
## Tomorrow’s leaders need to bring analytic skills to the table.

What is going to be the single most important characteristic of business leadership over the next 20 years? Steve Jobs-like vision? Jack Welch-like process discipline? George Clooney-like charisma? I’m wagering it’s none of these. While any of those traits can be helpful, I firmly believe the future belongs to leaders who are willing to go deeply nerdy about their jobs.

When I say nerdy, I’m not talking about hosting a Dungeons & Dragons session in a firm conference room. I’m talking about the boring, unsexy, but increasingly critical work of gathering, analyzing, and understanding data. Data analytics can’t just be farmed out to the geek squad and relegated to a quarterly report. Good leaders need to be able to engage their analytical teams on their own terms, and leverage those findings into actionable agendas.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The image of the bookish, wonky CEO remains deeply at odds with the charismatic ideal of leadership that TV and movies have conditioned us to look for, and there remains a palpable hunger in the marketplace for dynamic, confidence-inspiring leadership. Academics have long been [sounding the warning bells](https://hbr.org/2002/09/the-curse-of-the-superstar-ceo) about the counterproductive myth of the superstar leader who inspires growth through just being awesome, but the warnings remain largely unheeded.

Consider for a moment the case of the young, magnetic CEO Elizabeth Holmes. By tapping her connections, charisma, and unbridled chutzpah, Holmes raised over a billion dollars for a company that promised to change the way medicine was performed. That company, Theranos, [turned out to have forged most of its results](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-history-of-silicon-valley-unicorn-theranos-and-ceo-elizabeth-holmes-2018-5), never developed a viable product, and in fact appeared to have promised its investors a concept that could not, as a matter of physics, work.

I raise the case of Holmes not to say that all magnetic CEOs are frauds, because they aren’t. There are leaders who know how to work a room like it’s nobody’s business and also run mind-blowing regression analyses using [R](https://www.r-project.org/). I raise Holmes, however, to highlight how easily charisma can mask a total lack of substance. By several accounts, Holmes consciously modeled her management style on Steve Jobs, who was notorious for projecting a “[reality distortion field](https://medium.com/@jhargrave/how-steve-jobs-created-the-reality-distortion-field-and-you-can-too-4ba87781adba)” that caused people to buy into impossible timelines and concepts, at least as long as Jobs was talking to them.

Charismatics are defined by their ability to cut through our mental defenses and get us to accept ideas and goals that we might otherwise reject. That skill set can be invaluable to companies that are resisting necessary disruption. But that can be a little like wanting to increase your browsing speed and disabling your antivirus firewall instead. Today’s economy demands the goods. A winning smile without intellectual firepower and technical knowledge won’t cut it today. Leaders can’t just live in the world of the “big picture” — they have to understand the less-exciting, nitty-gritty technical side of the business, as well.

The Other Guys

The better model for the leadership of tomorrow is the founders of Google. Pop quiz: who were they? If you answered Sergey Brin and Larry Page without resorting to the search engine they built, you’re probably in the minority. Most of us have heard those names dozens of times over the years, but these aren’t guys that stick in your brain. Their oratory is workmanlike at best. They didn’t inspire a cult of personality. They were coders who struck gold and grew their product without generating a lot of press for themselves. Google was notoriously spartan in its design, but wicked fast and more useful than any of its competitors (remember Ask Jeeves?).

Today, Brin and Page are the President and CEO of Alphabet, Inc. Google’s parent company, and worth about $100 billion combined. They’ve built one of the largest companies in the world, and they did it by getting deeply embedded in the technical side of their work. They realized before anyone else the power of the data they were collecting, and they’ve developed strategies to profit off that data that are head-spinning (and occasionally terrifying). Brin and Page lead an army of coders and IT professionals that they’re capable of having detailed conversations with, and they know how to translate those skills into successful implementation of their corporate strategies. Google is literally in the business of data analytics, and it’s one of the most powerful companies in history.

Learning The Lingo

The legal industry typically lags behind the rest of the business world by a few years, but even today we’re seeing firms that know how to mine and analyze data and turn that ability into profits. Smart firms are developing their data intake methods and combing through everything they can to find an edge on their competitors. Data analysis can help firms price themselves better, can help demonstrate value to clients, can spot market trends and identify targets for growth, improve compensation models, lower overhead…you name it.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The set of data we can make available to ourselves is enormous, and the tools to analyze that data set are cheaper and easier to use than ever. There’s a cost that firm leadership has to pay, however. Management has to educate itself so that it can read and converse with the data (and their geek squads) on their own terms. The Complete Works of Shakespeare might be high art, but only if you can read English. Otherwise it’s a 1500-page doorstop.

Case in point: in my practice, we discovered a number of years ago that search engine optimization was an underutilized avenue for bringing in business in our market. Like many lawyers, we first looked to experts to tell us what to do. We figured we’d hire a few nerds, they’d do some whiz-bang programming, and the phone would start ringing. It wasn’t that easy, and I eventually realized the problem was me. I couldn’t speak the language of SEO. That meant consultants could give me generic, off-the-rack advice with lots of jargon that wasn’t all that valuable, but I didn’t know. Salespeople could tout knowledge and results that I had no way to verify. In the SEO world, lawyers make easy prey. My ability to identify what I needed and convey that to my vendors was limited by my inability to speak their language.

The solution was to roll up my sleeves, get my hands dirty, and learn the industry. I got SEO tutors, went to conventions to learn, and started to understand more and more what we needed to do. Our team started seeing opportunities and taking them. We tracked endless amounts of data — conversions, bounce rates, ROI, any other statistic we could think to generate. Slowly but steadily, we crept up the Google rankings until we started to hit number one, and the phone calls were flooding in. We weren’t smarter than anybody. We didn’t have any SEO savants on our team. We definitely didn’t have charisma on our side. The difference maker was that we were willing to do the work, learn the wonky side of the business, and develop our strategy from there. We embraced our inner nerds.

It’s cliché to say that lawyers hate numbers, but aversion is no excuse anymore. Cats hate water, but they still need to take a bath. Data analytics is an important opportunity for growth for today’s law firm leaders, and tomorrow’s leaders will have to be fluent as a matter of course. Smart leaders will dust off their calculators and get to work.

# The Biglaw Firms That Said No To Trump
## Guess which big firms had no interest in representing the president...

There was lots of speculation surrounding the[ selection of Marc Kasowitz](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/marc-kasowitz-will-you-accept-this-rose/) as outside counsel to Donald Trump. A list of finalists was revealed, and the legal gossip started in ernest until Kasowitz was revealed as the winner.

But now it seems Kasowitz may not have been Trump’s first choice.

Yahoo is [reporting](https://www.yahoo.com/news/four-top-law-firms-turned-requests-represent-trump-122423972.html) that at least four Biglaw superstars told the president they would not accept his rose. Brendan Sullivan of Williams & Connolly, Ted Olson of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, Paul Clement and Mark Filip of Kirkland & Ellis, and Robert Giuffra of Sullivan & Cromwell are all on the list of those who reportedly just said no to Trump.

While none of those lawyers provided a comment, because discretion really is the better part of valor, there are sources willing to talk. There are, of course, the usual scheduling issues, but Trump’s seeming [inability to take legal advice](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/trump-proves-his-own-lawyers-have-been-lying-to-the-courts-regarding-the-travel-ban/), the PR blowout from repping Trump, and the potential fallout from other clients were among the reasons these lawyers were hesitant to accept the gig. And, of course, Trump has… issues paying on time:

[A] consistent theme, the sources said, was the concern about whether the president would accept the advice of his lawyers and refrain from public statements and tweets that have consistently undercut his position.

“The concerns were, ‘The guy won’t pay and he won’t listen,’” said one lawyer close to the White House who is familiar with some of the discussions between the firms and the administration, as well as deliberations within the firms themselves.

Sounds about right.

# Associate Bonus Watch: Huge Smiles At A Huge Law Firm
## One of the world's five largest firms announces its bonuses.

DLA Piper is B-I-G big. Boasting almost 3,800 lawyers at last count, it’s the world’s [fourth-largest law firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/the-global-100-the-richest-law-firms-in-the-world-2016/2/). So its bonus announcement, issued last week, affects many, many lawyers.

Which is why it’s so surprising that we’ve heard from so few sources. The ones we have heard from are pleased:

- “Midlevel associate, secondary market — hit my hours through a combination of billable and pro bono — got a ‘market’ bonus. Very happy.”
- “Happy.”
- “Seems to match Cravath. Associates are happy. Firmwide associates’ committee is sending around a survey to be completed and then we will have more numbers.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
These reactions are consistent with the operative language from the memo:

2016 Bonuses. Bonuses again were determined based on seniority, performance rating and total bonus hours (including billable, billable equivalent, shadowing, and pro bono hours), with the top bonuses being awarded to the highest rated associates with the highest hours. The vast majority of our high performing associates will receive bonuses at or above the widely published “market” scale. As in the past, bonuses may be reduced due to certain performance or other management concerns.

The firm retains discretion to pay above or below the market, but it sounds like market matches for most. And people seem to be fine with that, making for [a second year in a row](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/associate-bonus-watch-a-giant-law-firm-exceeds-its-associates-expectations/) of good bonuses at the firm.

Are our sources a representative sample of DLA Piper sentiment? That’s always the challenge for bonus coverage. We could end up updating this story, or posting a new story, if we get some of those survey results from the associates’ committee, or if we hear from additional tipsters. But as of now, when it comes to DLA Piper sources, that’s all they wrote.

# Wither The Law Firm Technology Subsidy?
## This is a compensation cut.

If your firm expects you to have the most expensive data plan, shouldn’t they be giving you something for the inconvenience? I mean, perhaps it’s not an inconvenience because you’re busy streaming Friends episodes on the subway and forcing yourself to pretend you’re watching something clever. But the firm doesn’t know that you’ve got terrible taste in television.

Practicing law in the 21st century requires more costly tools than it used to. Attorneys need laptops, smartphones, wifi access at the bare minimum, and potentially licenses to a suite of security products. Firms rarely issue all of these products anymore, both out of respect for the choices of individual associates and in recognition that cloud-based solutions make the specific product choice largely irrelevant. But many firms recognize that they’re still making an ask of their attorneys and respond with a little something to ease the burden.

Firms like [Simpson and Paul Weiss offer tech stipends](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/biglaw-firm-blows-competition-out-of-the-water-with-tech-spending-stipend-for-associates/). [Brown Rudnick even tops those offerings](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/actually-this-tech-stipend-blows-the-competition-out-of-the-water/). It’s a nice gesture to cover the cost of equipment that firms absolutely expect an associate to have. For years, we’ve advocated for every firm to follow suit and kick in to cover the cost of the tools of the trade.

But unfortunately some firms are starting to pull back. Womble Bond Dickinson just informed its associates that it will no longer subsidize their data plans:



We all know how much the UK appreciates its counterproductive austerity, and even though the US entity is technically quasi-independent, maybe the Brits are rubbing off on the firm.

Make no mistake, this is a compensation cut. When every associate relied upon this reimbursement, taking it away cuts their take home, after tax, compensation by… what?… a few hundred or so? It’s not a lot, but that’s a student loan payment for these people. Or maybe half a student loan payment.

In any event, this is a troubling sign that firms might be moving toward the nickel and diming  their own associates. So if you’re looking at firms, remember to take some time to check out the perks.

# George Mason Law Changing Name To Antonin Scalia School Of Law
## If George Mason just wanted to appeal to conservative students, they could have called themselves the Chick-Fil-A School of Lawsauce.

Justice Scalia

George Mason was a founding father. He was one of the men who was responsible for the Bill of Rights — he wouldn’t sign the constitution without it (or at all, ultimately). Now, the law school at the university that bears his name is changing its name to the Antonin Scalia School of Law at George Mason University.

Amazingly, this is not an April Fool’s joke. [Richard Kelsey](http://www.law.gmu.edu/administration/kelsey_rich), Director of the Mason Law Community, tweeted out the news:

It is now public … George Mason has named it's law school … ""The Antonin Scalia School of Law""

— Rich Kelsey (@RichKelsey) [March 31, 2016](https://twitter.com/RichKelsey/status/715602893471092737)

This was after Nina Totenberg [first reported the news](https://twitter.com/NinaTotenberg/status/715576949465157632) on Twitter. I [said out loud](https://twitter.com/ElieNYC/status/715587584223809536) that Totenberg “got GOT, fools,” and… well, now the [WSJ Law Blog](http://www.wsj.com/articles/george-mason-university-to-rename-law-school-after-justice-antonin-scalia-1459452145) has confirmed this news.

Good lord. You are deemphasizing the name of a founding father to honor a man who fetishisized the beliefs held at the founding? A guy who didn’t go there, or have any connection to the school, who wouldn’t have hired a George Mason law student as a bathroom attendant, much less a Supreme Court clerk? That’s the guy you are renaming your law school after? Your Twitter hashtag is now #ASSLaw (Antonin Scalia School of Law). Who was in second place, Donald Trump?

Is there any reason for this?

It's good that they will stop pretending to be anything other than a conservative policy shop with students. [https://t.co/T5sjwBmWIx](https://t.co/T5sjwBmWIx)

We talk a lot about the law school application crunch, and how that crunch disproportionately dings middling law schools like George Mason. There is a flight to quality, there is a flight to “free,” and schools that are neither are having a heck of a time filling their seats.

But branding themselves as “Antonin Scalia,” who most people even lightly interested in law have heard of before, versus “George Mason,” who you should have learned about in AP History but probably didn’t because he’s not a Kardashian, might help them.

Even if Scalia Law generates some push in application and matriculation revenue, especially from right-of-center students, would it be enough to offset the negatives? Changing the school’s name in this way is sure to piss off some alumni.

If George Mason just wanted to appeal to conservative students, they could have called themselves the Chick-Fil-A School Of Lawsauce, and still pocketed the money.

Money, of course, is the other factor in this change. From the [WSJ](http://www.wsj.com/articles/george-mason-university-to-rename-law-school-after-justice-antonin-scalia-1459452145):

The school expected to unveil the name change Thursday afternoon, along with an announcement that it has received two donations totaling $30 million, including a $10 million grant from the Charles Koch Foundation.

LOL… the Koch brothers, man. They want so desperately to spread the gospel of conservative values that they’re willing to shove aside a founding father to make their point. I hope all of you soon-to-be “Scalia Alums” enjoy having that follow you around for the rest of your life.

If you are a conservative-leaning person, your parents will be proud that you went to “Antonin Scalia.” Your friends will just think you are an ASS.

UPDATE (5:29 p.m.): We’ve posted the George Mason Law press release [on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/george-mason-law-changing-name-to-antonin-scalia-school-of-law/2/).

UPDATE (6:01 p.m.): Lat here. We just heard back from Dean [Henry Butler](http://www.law.gmu.edu/faculty/directory/fulltime/butler_henry), whom we called a little before 2 p.m. when trying to nail down this story. He apologized for the delay in getting back to us, noting that the news was embargoed and changes were still being made to the press release, and expressed thanks for our recent story about [Mason Law’s SCOTUS bobblehead collection](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/a-curious-law-school-pitch-to-prospective-students/).

I asked Dean Butler about the required approval for the name change from the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (mentioned in the press release on the next page); he described that vote as a “formality,” and noted that Governor Terry McAuliffe supports the name change. Finally, he touted the considerable financial benefits associated with the renaming: “Thirty million dollars in scholarships is nothing to laugh at.”

(Flip to the next page for the full press release.)

# How To Make Your Lateral Move Whole

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors. [Michael Allen](http://www.laterallink.com/about/team/1) is Managing Principal at Lateral Link, focusing exclusively on partner placements with Am Law 200 clients and placements for in-house attorneys.

Have you ever wondered, “Am I forfeiting my bonus if I leave before year’s end?”

Associates are often reluctant to leave their current positions out of fear they may lose out on year-end bonuses. Right now, we are seeing bonuses approaching and often exceeding the $100k – $200K range for associates, making it seemingly difficult to justify a late season move.

What most associates may not realize, however, is that from now through the end of 2016, there are many ways to keep your full compensation – and even increase it. This is where working with a recruiter comes in handy. Because we have intimate knowledge of how many candidates are looking to make a move at any given time, we can definitively say that from this point now through the end of 2016 is a very solid time to make a move. We recommend starting with a target list of firms that will make you whole – that is, earn 100 percent or more of the compensation you would expect to receive. Right now, we are helping associates procure year-end and signing bonuses equal to, and in excess of, the amount they would have earned by staying with their current firm.

One of the keys to procuring these bonuses is identifying the firms that will lose out on business by not having someone to service it. Firms do not generally have established policies concerning signing bonuses, and will typically present the bare minimum to sway a lateral decision. Approaching the table with market intelligence tilts the conversation in your favor and increases the likelihood that the firm will, in fact, make you whole.

Signing and year-end bonuses are not your only means for recovering lost revenue from mid-to-late year lateral moves. If you are one of the unlucky few locked into the old compensation model, targeting a firm on the new model can also help you bridge or beat the gap between your prior compensation with bonuses and your new compensation even without bonuses.

This summer is an advantageous time for associates to consider a move. Typically, there is less supply and more demand for practices that have growing needs in a candidate-driven market. Additionally, the recent[ salary](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises/) [shake-up](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises/) has many people wondering if they are [earning the right salary for the city they live in](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/is-ny-to-180k-hurting-the-new-york-market/). Because of these favorable market conditions, associates have a good chance of lateralling up to an even better firm that will also make them whole.

Most importantly, we help you identify the firms that match each of your requirements and preferences. Your practice, your compensation, and firm fit are only part of the puzzle to navigating the course of your legal career over the years. We help our clients thoroughly evaluate every facet of a lateral move from its overall efficacy to the minutia of details when it comes to charting the milestones of your career.

A[ federal lawsuit](https://www.law360.com/articles/1575685/attachments/0) has been filed against California attorney Sara King and King Family Lending LLC. According to the complaint, LDR International Ltd. invested $10+ million in King’s lending company. But despite the influx of cash, King reportedly only has $12 in her bank account.

So, where’d all the cash go?

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“Plaintiff is informed and believes that King moved into the Wynn Las Vegas resort and hotel, lived there for six months, and gambled 24/7,” LDR said in its complaint.

Well, that’s not a great look.

As [reported by ](https://www.law360.com/legalethics/articles/1575685/calif-lawyer-scammed-investor-out-of-10m-suit-says)Law360, these are the details of the scheme:

LDR began loaning money to King Lending in January 2022, with a $195,000 investment that was supposedly secured by Audemars Piguet and Richard Mille watches.

King Financial cut more deals with LDR over the next 10 months to fund loans that she said were backed by yachts and diamonds, Aston Martins and Lamborghinis. Among the biggest-ticket items, though, were supposedly sports contracts for the National Hockey League, Major League Baseball, National Football League, Major League Soccer and National Basketball Association, the complaint said.

When the loans reached maturity, though, King did not pay back LDR, the company alleged. Instead, she claimed that over $6.3 million in loans had been repaid and “redeployed” to fund more loans, according to the complaint.

“In fact, there were no loans to any third-party and, therefore, no repayment of any loans to third-parties,” the complaint said. “King falsely represented to plaintiff that a total of $19,370,000 had been loaned to third-party borrowers.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
King has paid LDR $2 million in interest but the $10+ million loan principal is still owed, according to the complaint.

This isn’t the first financial scheme King has been accused of participating in. King is named in a lawsuit alleging she failed to repay a $125,000 loan, and there’s a separate accusation she pocketed a $62,000 loan. She also has default judgment on a debt owed to Citibank.

# Stop Using Stare Decisis To Justify Lousy Policies And Inefficiencies

In offering mindfulness workshops at law firms, I’m often in the position of gaining insights about how the people within a firm work together. One common friction is between what I’ll grossly generalize as the Millennial / Baby Boomer divide.

Often, there’s a sense that the older attorneys have become comfortable with the narrative of “this is the way it’s always been done, and therefore, it’s the only correct way of doing this.” It makes sense. Those older attorneys have broken boundaries and have done much to improve the firm they’re working for. Plus, lawyers live by stare decisis.

The younger attorneys, as has been the case with every previous generation, have their own perspectives, wishes, desires, and ideas about the type of legal workplace they would like to work for. Again, generalizing, but the younger attorneys value autonomy much more. They want to feel a sense of purpose in the work they are doing. They value working in collaborative teams towards shared purposes or values.

One place where I often notice friction between the two generations is on the issue of what a standard work day or work week should look like. As has been the case for many generations, the standard 40+ hour work week where you get dressed each morning and report to an office at an expected time and stay at the office all day was the norm. The number of hours you were physically in the office was, of course, directly correlated to the number of hours you could bill.

When I started practicing law in 2004, I was given a lot of advice about the importance of “face time.” If you didn’t spend enough time at the office, other associates would take notice and make assumptions about you. She’s not that serious about her job. It was often seen as a lack of commitment to the firm. In some strange way, the amount of time you spent at the office was more valued than the work product you produced.

Recently, I had a conversation with a young attorney at a Biglaw firm. To my surprise, she shared that one of the partners she worked for told her she should be “at the office more.” I cringed a bit. I remember being told the exact same thing, some 10 years ago. I asked her what her response was.

She asked the partner why he felt she should be at the office more. He seemed surprised by her question and responded by saying, “Because you have to be at the office to do your work. Working from home is a privilege you earn.”

She then asked the partner if he was satisfied with her work product. It surprised her that this partner was telling her that she needed to come into the office more frequently because his feedback of her work had always been positive. I thought this was an excellent line of inquiry.

In this age of telecommuting and more attorneys desiring (and valuing) a flexible work schedule, it makes sense to question the assumption that you should always be at the office. The partner responded that he was perfectly happy with her work product.

The partner told her that in his younger days, associates were expected to come into the office before and stay after the partner has left. In other words, he was saying this is the way it’s always been done and you should do it this way too.

The attorneys were having a deeper conversation about values and how people interpret and express those values. Of course, both of the attorneys value providing excellent work product to their clients. But the way they deliver the quality work product differs. One attorney may need to have the structure of coming into the office every day, while another attorney for many reasons (including other obligations), or simply preference, prefers to do her work elsewhere.

The younger attorney may value the ability to take care of both her work, personal obligations, and having some semblance of balance.

So often, we fail to challenge our deeply held assumptions. For example, more time at the office is always better, and results in more billable hours. Or that it’s required to become a good attorney. I want pause here to make clear that I am not saying this assumption is true or false. It’s also possible that like many things in life, it’s partly true, and partly false. Or an answer you should all be very familiar with — it depends.

Sadly, too many law firms are losing a segment of their talent pool, namely women. There are, of course, many reasons for this dip. One reason is that the firm structure disproportionately places an undue burden on this group. The lack of flexibility and lack of autonomy over one’s schedule is often the reason for why women leave the workplace.

In this radically and rapidly changing legal landscape, it’s more critical than ever to challenge the status quo. The response — it’s always been this way — is no longer a satisfactory response. In fact, it’s a dangerous way of thinking.

P.S. If you’re a self-identified woman lawyer and are interested in intimate conversations around Wellness + Wealth + Wisdom, you’re invited to our upcoming [Shape the Law](https://newyorkshapethelaw.splashthat.com/) Unconference in New York City on October 28th. Connect with me by email, [hello@jeenacho.com](mailto:hello@jeenacho.com), or on Twitter, [@jeena_cho](https://twitter.com/Jeena_Cho).

# No Longer A Rarity: More Partners Leave Cravath, Heading To Rival New York Firms
## In what was once considered unheard of, partners are heading for the exits at Cravath.

Within Biglaw circles, Cravath has long been romanticized as the ideal firm. Not only does Cravath control the Biglaw salary scale, but it’s known for supporting lawyers from the cradle to the grave, raising them up from associate to partner. Attorneys are known to stay at the firm for their entire careers, and they even enter and exit partners’ funerals as a group in a respectful procession that’s been referred to as the [“Cravath walk.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/no-lawyers-arent-doing-any-cult-like-chanting-during-cravath-partner-funerals/) (And no, there is no [cult-like chanting](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/lawyers-apparently-perform-this-weird-ritual-during-cravath-partner-funerals/) going on, as was once rumored.)

Unfortunately, it seems as if there’s trouble in paradise, as things are quickly changing at Biglaw’s dream firm. Not only has Cravath finally deviated from existing with only an equity partner tier — it introduced [a salary partner tier](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/cravath-cracks-on-non-equity-partnerships/) in 2023 — but the firm recently started hiring lateral partners, a move that was previously a rarity. Now, partners are heading for the exits — another previously unheard of feat.

As noted by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/cravath-partner-jumps-davis-polk-marking-latest-exit-2024-01-22/), these departures are becoming more common as other firms are now willing to “pay a premium to poach top talent.” Relatedly, Cravath recently lost two of its partners to rival firms. Reuters has additional details on the partners making lateral moves:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Law firm Davis, Polk & Wardwell said on Monday that it has hired civil litigator Rory Leraris from Wall Street rival Cravath, Swaine & Moore, marking at least the fourth Cravath partner to follow the same path since 2021.

Another former Cravath partner also landed at a new firm on Monday, as Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer said it brought on M&A lawyer Sanjay Murti in New York. Damien Zoubek, who is the co-head of U.S. M&A at Freshfields, left Cravath for the London-founded firm in 2021. …

In addition to hires by Davis Polk, Latham & Watkins and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison each brought on former Cravath partners in 2023.

How much are competitor firms willing to pay to lure away Cravath partners, and which Cravath partners will be the next to take the bait? We suppose we’ll see, but in the meantime, Cravath wishes its former partners well.

According to a [ 2022 ATL survey](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/what-do-associates-think-of-the-new-normal/), more than 40 percent of associates plan to leave their firms within the next couple of years.

Is firm “loyalty” a meaningful concept for young attorneys? As the path to partnership seems less fixed than ever, how do millennials envision their future?

Last month, we launched a series of short surveys in partnership with Major, Lindsey & Africa to capture the perspectives of the millennial generation. [This installment](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8GHW7taR6ULBLb8) addresses career goals.

Please [share your thoughts here](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8GHW7taR6ULBLb8). As always, the survey is anonymous. (And note that we are not only interested in hearing from millennials; lawyers of all ages are encouraged to participate!)

If you have not yet completed the other two installments in this series, please take a few minutes to do so:

# Biglaw Firms Made Fewer Summer Associate Offers This Fall
## This could spell future employment troubles given the size of the Class of 2024.

What is clear is that the entry-level job market in the private sector is currently not growing fast enough to absorb the additional students in the Class of 2024 and that unless there is a strong 3L hiring market this year — which seems unlikely given recent trends — a greater percentage of these students may need to look at other market segments for employment after graduation.

— [Nikia L. Gray](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikia-l-gray-212b488/), executive director of the National Association for Law Placement, commenting on what the [state of the Biglaw job market](https://www.nalp.org/uploads/PressReleases/NALPPressReleasePerspectivesFebruary2023.pdf) may look like for the law school Class of 2024 (i.e., this year’s summer associates), considering current market trends. According to a [recent NALP report](https://www.nalp.org/uploads/perspectives_2022_recruiting_activity_final.pdf), the number of offers made for law students to work as summer associates this year decreased by about 2% compared to the last summer’s hiring program. This could be bad news, given that the Class of 2024 is nearly 12% larger than the Class of 2023.

Lawyers and legal departments are increasingly looking to expand their practices internationally. For many American lawyers, the U.S. is no longer their sole source of legal issues and opportunities. Attorneys wanting to explore different markets have rapidly been setting their sights across the nation’s borders.

There are challenges, however, when it comes to expanding internationally, so prepare yourself with these tips for building an international career:

Do your research on the legal landscapes of different countries so you know where your services would be most in demand. For example, if you’re a corporate lawyer, investigate markets experiencing economic growth or those that have recently implemented new regulations.

When you know your target market, you can start identifying the types of clients you want to work with and the kinds of cases you want to take on.

Get Involved In Global Organizations

There are many organizations, within and outside of the legal profession, that offer opportunities to get involved in international work. For example, the American Bar Association has several committees and programs focused on global legal issues.

Joining these organizations can help you network with other lawyers who are interested in working internationally and give you a better understanding of the global legal landscape.

Learn Or Perfect Another Language

This may seem obvious, but it’s important to remember that not everyone speaks English. If you want to work in a country where English is not the primary language, you’ll need to learn at least some basics of the local language.

Not only will this facilitate communication with clients and colleagues, it will also show that you’re invested in doing business in the country and understanding its culture.

Consider An LLM Or Other Advanced Degree In Another Jurisdiction

If you’re serious about working internationally, you may want to consider pursuing an advanced degree in law, such as an LLM. Many of these programs offer coursework focused on international law and global legal issues.

Earning an LLM can also be helpful in make connections with other lawyers and professionals who work internationally.

Be Prepared To Adapt

When you’re working in a foreign country, you may need to adjust the way you practice law to comply with local regulations. For example, if you’re used to handling cases electronically, you may need to switch to paper files if a country requires all legal documents to be filed in person.

You may also need to be flexible in your billing arrangements, as countries have varying rules about how lawyers can charge for their services.

Be Aware Of Cultural Differences

When you’re working in a foreign country, it’s important to be aware of cultural differences and company policies that may impact your work. For example, in some countries, it’s common for lawyers to give gifts to clients or government officials to show appreciation or build relationships. In other countries, however, this could be seen as a form of bribery and could get you into trouble.

Of course, you should also be aware of differences in business etiquette, such as how to dress for meetings or the appropriate way to address clients and colleagues.

Conclusion

Expanding a legal practice internationally can be a daunting task, but, with the right preparation, it can also be an immensely rewarding experience. Knowing your target market, getting involved in global organizations, and learning another language can all put you well on your way to establishing yourself as a successful international lawyer.

# Someone Deserves To Be Shot Over This

The horror! The horror! Multiple sources have forwarded us the MP3 of the frightening [Nixon Peabody](http://www.nixonpeabody.com/) “theme song,” which is now making the rounds by email.

We didn’t receive it directly from a source at the firm, so it’s theoretically possible that it’s fake. We have contacted Nixon Peabody for comment and will let you know if and when we hear back from them. But in the meantime, we’re inclined to agree with this tipster:

“I wanted to believe it wasn’t real, but it’s so professional. Hard to believe that this wasn’t the product of a misguided recruiting effort and wasted bonus dollars.”

Update (12:05 PM): We’ve been in touch with a Nixon Peabody spokesperson about the song (which is real). We’ll be posting a statement from the firm shortly.

On the musical merits, the song itself is just as horrific as the idea of a law firm theme song. Yes, we miss the eighties, but not this much. The lyrics include such gems as “Everyone’s a winner at Nixon Peabody” (the chorus) and “It’s all about the team, it’s all about respect, it all revolves around integri-tee yeah.”

Check it out for yourself below. But we’re warning you: even though the Nixon Peabody anthem is dreadful, it’s as catchy as HPV. If that “everyone’s a winner” chorus gets stuck in your head for the rest of today, don’t blame us.
But if you’re a plaintiff’s lawyer who wants to file a class action against Nixon Peabody, on behalf of all listeners who do get [earworm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earworm) from this song, please include us in the plaintiff class. Thank you.

(The reason the screen says “Digital Media Converter Trial Version — Please Download” is because we converted the mp3 file to video using a free trial of this [file conversion program](http://www.filetrial.com/convert/download.html).)

# alt.legal: If We Build It, Will They Come? The Problem Of Legal Tech Adoption

Yesterday, [Evolve Law](http://evolvelawnow.com/) held [an event](https://twitter.com/EvolveLawNow/status/775827986822094851) in the offices of Dentons in downtown Atlanta. The topic of the discussion: legal tech adoption. I was honored to join a panel of other distinguished guests to discuss trends in legal technology and, specifically, the problem of technology adoption among legal professionals.

This is a topic of special interest to me because my role at Thomson Reuters has changed recently to focus more on managing our product portfolio, including [our new ediscovery product](http://legalsolutions.thomsonreuters.com/law-products/solutions/ediscovery-point). It’s now my full-time job to care about this.

And here’s what I understand so far.

The Hurdles

The hurdles to adoption are (at least) four:

The first and most-cited issue is that most lawyers are simply not technology savvy. This is not an industry craving technology solutions like you might find in banking, accounting or healthcare. Lawyers and legal professionals, on the whole, chose their careers directionally away from math or science, or even process engineering. This is changing, but on the whole, the lack of technology aptitude continues to be depressing. (Casey Flaherty explains this well [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-business/wp/2015/02/23/lawyers-could-you-pass-this-test/).)

What’s more, it did not help that historically, legal technology was far from intuitive. Among the many reasons for this is the fact that legal technology did not present the massive ROI opportunity that was so obvious in other industries. We’ve now gotten past this—there’s some very interesting legal technology in the market and some attention from capital investors. The result is the proliferation of better, more advanced technology solutions.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
But with better tools, legal professionals are now faced with a different set of problems. First, there is the problem of switching costs. A lot of early adopters invested heavily into complicated tools, frequently on premises and with substantial hardware and labor expense, and now have developed [path dependence](http://wwwpub.utdallas.edu/~liebowit/paths.html) (a “lock-in” effect). The switching costs were already high for many with low technical aptitude, but with business commitments to outdated tools, it becomes difficult to switch to new tools.

Another frequently discussed response to advanced legal technology: a primal fear of becoming obsolete. Legal is not unique here—most technological advancements across industries were accompanied with a reaction of panic around imagining human utility. By definition, disruptive innovation threatens the status quo. Therefore, many legal professionals take a suspicious or hostile stance to adopting technology as an existential line of defense. “If technology learns how to templatize trusts and wills and immigration paperwork, that’s my entire practice!” wonders a solo practitioner, somewhere.

At the Evolve Law panel, several voices articulated this fear with the (now somewhat overplayed) question: are robots coming for our jobs? Is technology going to make lawyers obsolete? Tired of diplomacy, I responded with an affirmative yes—it is better to live according to and responding to that fear than to pretend that threat is not real. Sure, human legal judgment is important and the fiduciary nature enshrined in the attorney-client relationship is also important, but lawyers billing hundreds of hours on high-volume, repetitive tasks should expect their lives to radically change. Ultimately, this transformation serves to grow the overall practice, but there will be casualties in the interim shifting.

In summary, the hurdles to adoption were initially low tech savvy among lawyers and poorly developed legal technology tools. Later, with the improvement of the technology, new barriers emerged around high switching costs and self-preservation anxieties.

Is there a path forward?

The Catalysts

Law firms: firms need to adjust and drive change. As noted on the panel last night, it’s not easy to walk into a room of millionaires and tell them they are doing everything wrong, especially when “more efficiency” sounds a lot like “less billable hours.” We need a new generation of law firms, hungry to gain a competitive advantage over their peers by using technology to be more efficient and finding more ways to provide more value to their clients.

Corporate legal departments: speaking of clients, in-house counsel are best positioned to drive adoption. General counsel have noted that simply hiring the right law firm is no longer a tenable strategy when reporting to the C-suite and boards of directors. They need to see that technology is creating more efficiency, and vote with their spend when it comes to rewarding the attorneys that are leveraging technology productively. Corporate counsel have more influence on this than perhaps anyone.

Law schools: some programs are actually doing something about this. My hope is that one day, basic legal technology becomes part of the core curriculum, like legal writing, as a necessary skill to prepare for practice.

Technology companies: when you go to legal technology conferences (for instance, ILTACON two weeks back), you hear a lot about how technologists in the legal space should simply forge ahead and continue pushing innovation, regardless of whether any practitioners are coming along or not. While I love the rebellious spirit, companies can do much to focus on adoption rather than sprinting ahead of the pack.

A Strategic Bridge To The Future

Some big ideas were discussed yesterday, like changing the rules on non-lawyer ownership to invite new sources of capital. My view is that we need to look at a transition state before the rapid watershed moment where technology experiences mass adoption. The strategy to accomplish the transition state has a handful of components:

Ease of use – legal technology products must become easier to use. There is plenty to draw on in terms of usability and intuition from the software development world outside of legal. iPhones don’t need instruction manuals, and neither does Gmail, Pinterest, Pokémon Go, or most mobile apps. The usage is self-explanatory, even a pleasure to learn.

Increasing knowhow with better training – this comes through better training and assessment among lawyers. Many are focusing on this now with better pedagogical approaches, gamification, creating value around industry certifications.

Managed services – this is what I believe is the immediate bridge. You can make tech easier to use, you can teach people how to use it, but at the end of the day, lawyers respond well to having people do things for them. If engagement into a technology platform starts with getting the attorneys up and running and starting the workflow, it may prime the pump to make an easier transition. Let someone else “do technology” for you, and you’ll be more likely to catch on yourself.

The Coming Revolution?

In 1962, James C. Davies presented a [j-curve theory of military revolutions](http://www.popularsocialscience.com/2013/04/17/james-c-davies-j-curve-theory-of-revolutions/). Essentially, there was a point in a society where what people wanted diverged dramatically from what people were getting, and it would be the catalyst for a military revolution. Prolonged unrest led to dramatic upheaval.

It’s difficult to say whether the legal industry is in a state of prolonged unrest, but my view is that a watershed moment is coming, and civil unrest may be easier to identify than dissatisfaction with inefficiency. Until then, law firms, corporate legal departments, law schools and legal tech companies should seek to build avenues to a brighter future, strategizing around overcoming a looming hurdle of adoption.

# Complying With California's Legal Framework For Climate Claims Under AB 1305
## AB 1305 will require companies to ensure that their climate claims are more than aspirational.

In October 2023, California enacted the Voluntary Carbon Market Disclosures Act (VCMDA) — [AB 1305](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB1305).  AB 1305 has lurked in the background of flashier climate disclosure regulations. It’s time for legal professionals to take it off the shelf and look at what their companies need to do to comply.

In addition to new obligations for companies that purchase and sell offsets within California, AB 1305 includes significant disclosure obligations for companies that make claims regarding their climate performance. These claims include targets like “carbon neutral” and “net zero” as well as green claims related to products (climate claims). There is no financial threshold. If you are doing business in California and you make a climate claim — AB 1305 applies.

Under this statute, companies that make climate claims must state on their website “all information documenting how such a claim was determined to be accurate or actually accomplished, and how interim progress toward that goal is being measured.” This information may include third-party verification of emissions, science-based targets, sector methodology, and third-party verification of emissions.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
AB 1305 is short. There currently is no guidance on how it will be interpreted and applied by courts or regulators. However, legal counsel should consider established practices within the carbon accounting world in determining how to craft an AB-1305 notice.

A great place to start is looking at how net zero and carbon neutral are defined in carbon accounting.

Net Zero 

The commonly accepted standard for setting a net-zero target is defined in the “Corporate Net-Zero Standard” created by the [Science Based Targets initiative](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/net-zero) (“SBTi”). To qualify for SBTi certification, a corporation must have a credible pathway to reducing its carbon emissions 50% by 2030 and 90% by 2050. The 50% and 90% thresholds are hard reductions that cannot be covered by offsets. For purposes of a net-zero target, offsets can only be applied to the last 10% of a company’s footprint.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Companies start the net-zero certification process by submitting an application to SBTi. It commonly takes companies two years to be approved. A company setting a net-zero target must provide substantial amounts of information including answers to the following questions:

- What is the organizational boundary of the target?
- What is the base year that will be used as the measuring point for the target?
- What scopes are included in the target (i.e. Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3)?
- What method is used to measure the reduction (absolute or sector-specific)?
- What is the target year for achieving the reductions?
All of this relies on having solid emissions data for the organizational boundary — ideally, at least for three years. Growth expectations must be factored into plans for how to achieve absolute reductions. The process of setting a net-zero target under SBTi requires expertise and leadership commitment.

Carbon Neutral

Carbon neutral is different than net zero. A carbon neutral target is achieved when an entity removes as much carbon from the atmosphere as it produces. Unlike a net-zero target, carbon neutral does not require an organization to reduce its emissions. Corporations can rely completely on offsets to achieve this standard. To qualify, a corporation must be able to answer these questions:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
- What is the organizational boundary of the target?
- What is the year for which carbon neutrality is claimed?
- What scopes are included in the target (i.e. Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3)?
- What were the total emissions for the applicable year?
- What offsets were used to balance the organization’s carbon footprint?
The carbon neutral standard is a much lower bar than net zero. However, carbon-neutral claims have come under fire recently in greenwashing litigation. Plaintiffs question the validity of the carbon offsets that corporations use to support carbon-neutral claims. If the offsets are not effective, then the claims are not what they seem. This concern is the origin of AB 1305 which also sets standards for companies selling carbon offsets.

These definitions sound very technical to anyone outside of the carbon accounting world. So how can legal teams get started with AB 1305 compliance?

- Review communications. Conduct an audit of external communications to identify any climate claims. This is an evolving area. It’s possible that a climate claim appeared in a sustainability report or a press statement without legal review. Discover what’s out there.
-  Audit claims. If you identify any climate claims, ask questions to determine whether they are supported by evidence. For net-zero and carbon-neutral claims, you can get a good sense by asking the questions above. Remember to also consider any claims that a product is green or somehow low carbon. Look for whether a recognized standard has been followed.
- Triage. If a climate claim has been made without proper verification, you will need to carefully weigh how to proceed. Some organizations may simply take down unverified climate claims. Others may need to publish a statement addressing or retracting the claim.
- Prepare to disclose. Finally start preparing any required AB 1305 disclosures. AB 1305 notices are due on company websites by January 1, 2025. Some companies, like [Kaiser Permanante](https://about.kaiserpermanente.org/commitments-and-impact/healthy-communities/improving-community-conditions/environmental-stewardship/ab-1305-emissions-disclosure), are already publishing these notices.
AB 1305 sets a standard for corporate climate claims that emphasizes transparency, accountability, and responsible practices. It will require companies to ensure that their climate claims are more than aspirational. As legal professionals, guiding clients through this process involves not only understanding the legal framework but also providing strategic advice on navigating the climate terminology and standards.

Next week, thousands of lawyers and vendors are expected to descend on midtown Manhattan for the annual [Legalweek ](https://www.event.law.com/legalweek)conference, to be held in person for the second time since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We wanted to know: after three years of online meetings and virtual happy hours, how do people feel about attending events in person? Do they look forward to the opportunity to travel and mingle in real life or would they rather sit back and stream from the comfort of their own homes?

To find out, we surveyed more than 500 people, including attorneys in private practice, in-house counsel, law firm professional staff, legal ops professionals, government lawyers, academics, judges, and a handful of law students.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
What we learned is that many — but by no means all — of you are ready and even excited to go to conferences again. “Bring it on!” urged one respondent. It’ll be “good to see real human beings.” Some believe a return to in-person events is “way overdue.”  



Others are more conflicted, prepared to show up but concerned about the COVID precautions: “It’s ok as long as health safety protocols and attendee reminders are in place.”

But nearly 25 percent of respondents told us, “No way.” They “do not feel comfortable attending live events” yet, viewing them as “a public health risk.”

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Another smaller group dismissed the need for in-person events at all, describing them as a “complete waste of time,” especially when “virtual options are more accessible and budget friendly.”



Here is a sample of the feedback we received.

Comfortable, happy to get back to it

- “No concern at all. Earth to ATL: The world has moved on. If people don’t attend live events now, it’s because they don’t see the value, not because of COVID. Some folks will die in their basements. Their sad choice. I have traveled to Europe (x3) and the Middle East and 15 states in the past 3 years.”
- “I could not possibly be more enthusiastic — they are brilliant!”
- “Best way to learn and network.”
- “Excited and grateful. I no longer attend conferences virtually because the ROI is negative.”
- “Perfectly fine. I look forward to them. You get so much more time just to catch up with folks and talk about mundane things.”
- “It is imperative to get back to live events. COVID is endemic and folks in certain categories might want to be careful, but otherwise we are back to live events, including jury trials.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Cautious, conflicted

- “Worried about catching COVID but it’s nice to see people.”
- “Mostly not interested unless it is in a place where they take health precautions seriously.”
- “Fine, although I wish more people wore masks.”
- “Frankly, nervous. Participants do not appear to be cautious. But with some I don’t feel that I have a choice but to attend in person.”
- “Mixed. The event has to be important enough to assume the risk.”
Not comfortable

- “Guarded. Unlikely to attend new conferences except virtually.”
- “Not good. Someone always gets COVID.”
- “It’s not safe and not worth the risk.”
- “Not comfortable given lack of COVID mitigations.”
- “You are only as safe as the dumbest attendee that is willing to say, ‘I’m not sick [cough, cough] I just have allergies.’ Then you are out of commission for 10-15 days or dead.”
- “The worst idea ever. Too many people, too long of a day, and I can’t even do it in my pajamas.”
In-person events are unnecessary anyway

- “I don’t like taking time away from family.”
- “Little need for it. Virtual options are more accessible and budget friendly.”
- “The pandemic completely exposed the farce that is traveling around the country and paying for lodging, expensive schmoozing meals, and endless in-person meetings when all it does is take you away from the work you need to be doing.”
- “Even if I wanted to attend a live event, which I do not, law department budgets often preclude such attendance/travel.”

# Vault's Top Law Firms By Practice Area And Region (2022)
## Which law firms are considered to be at the top of their game? Let's find out!

Last week, Vault released its closely watched rankings of [the nation’s 100 most prestigious law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/vault-100-rankings-the-most-prestigious-law-firms-in-america-2022/). It was there that we learned Cravath held onto its title as the most prestigious firm in America for the sixth year in a row, and that Wachtell had returned to its No. 2 spot after being edged out by Skadden last year for the first time in the history of the rankings.

But what if your firm wasn’t top-ranked in the Vault 100? Perhaps your firm isn’t the most prestigious, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have clout. Some law firms reign supreme when it comes to certain practice areas, and others are known to dominate entire regions of the country.

Which law firms are considered to be at the top of their game by practice area and region in our post-pandemic world? Let’s find out!

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
For the purposes of the practice area ranking, Vault asked associates to vote for up to three firms they think of as the strongest in their own practice area, and the overall ranking indicates the firms that received the highest percentage of votes. Associates were not allowed to vote for their own firm, which we’re sure made many recovering gunners very, very sad. Current gunners may find this list useful if they know which area they’d prefer to practice in. Pay attention, prospective laterals, because this is useful for you, too.

We’ve picked out a dozen of the practice areas that were ranked by Vault (you can see the full list [here](https://www.vault.com/best-companies-to-work-for/law/best-law-firms-in-each-practice-area/antitrust)):

Appellate Litigation: Gibson Dunn

Bankruptcy/Restructuring: Kirkland & Ellis

Energy, Oil and Gas: Vinson & Elkins

General Commercial Litigation: Quinn Emanuel

General Corporate Practice: Cravath

Intellectual Property: Fish & Richardson

International: White & Case

Labor and Employment: Littler Mendelson

Private Equity: Kirkland & Ellis

Real Estate: Fried Frank

Securities/Capital Markters: Davis Polk

Tax: Skadden

Next up, we’ve got a ranking that matters to those who think “location, location, location” is the most important thing in life. Vault’s regional rankings are based on votes tabulated from associates who were asked to rate firms on a 1 to 10 scale based on their prestige within the region.

# Associate Bonus Watch: $10 Starbucks Cards For Top Billers
## Base compensation may be market, but bonuses at this law firm amount to a hill of (coffee) beans.

For any associate complaining about a humdrum bonus season, consider that it could always be worse. You could find yourself sucking back coffees you earned at a rate of a dollar for every 270 hours billed.

Two days ago, we implored readers [not to rely on their fellow associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/bonus-season-isnt-over-its-just-getting-harder-to-decipher-without-your-help/) to tip off Above the Law because all too often we don’t get the complete picture because associates hold their tongues in the hope that someone else will reach out to us.

Well, this post kicked up a firestorm at Brewer Attorneys & Counselors, the former Bickel & Brewer, because we received a deluge of messages from a number of associates and former associates over the following 24 hours and everyone who reached out was hopping mad. I’m assuming it was all the coffee they’ve been drinking:

Brewer, Attorneys & Counselors (formerly Bickel & Brewer) does not pay bonuseswhatsoever. They handed out starbucks gift cards at the office Christmas party and joked about how that was the bonus. But it was not a joke — they did not pay bonuses last year, either.

And not just any Starbucks cards — TEN WHOLE DOLLARS WORTH OF STARBUCKS CARDS! Does that even buy a whole coffee/daylight milkshake at Starbucks these days?

worked over 2700. received a $10 Starbucks gift card. base salary is market. please stop perpetuating the lie that this firm pays above market. people come here after reading that, and the partners tell incoming associates there are “discretionary bonuses”. there aren’t.

That’s simply not true! It’s totally possible to get a higher bonus at management’s discretion. From a [recent Glassdoor post](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Brewer-Attorneys-and-Counselors-Reviews-E118967.htm):

I have been working at Brewer Attorneys & Counselors full-time (More than 3 years)
Pros
My bonus was twice as much as many other Associates’
Cons
My bonus was a $20 starbucks card
Advice to Management
Maybe Dunkin’ Donuts next year?

See?

We wrote Brewer Attorneys and asked for information about their 2017 bonuses but received no response.

But the assertion that we here at Above the Law and our fellow legal sector journalists are “perpetuating the lie that this firm pays above market” is serious and only further underscores the importance of tipsters keeping us in the loop at all times. Firms committed to hiring associates at a discount rely on some crafty wordsmithing to confuse media coverage, knowing that the rank-and-file don’t regularly speak up. One popular technique some firms employ involves announcing a starting salary for first-years at or slightly above the prevailing “Cravath scale” and bank on the reporting of that standalone fact to convey between the lines that the firm pays above market across the board. Generally, we try to flag every time a firm only publicizes first-year salaries as a firm likely to “smush” the scale for older classes, but every mention of “starting salary” can’t include a lengthy footnote.

Brewer, on the other hand, does pay market, but according to these associates, Brewer relies on the word “discretionary” to carry a lot of water when it comes to the bonuses. Which is an “accurate” statement, but a fundamentally unfair one. Yes, the dictionary would tell you that “discretionary bonuses” mean firms are free to offer $10 Starbucks cards if they want, but it’s disingenuous to [ignore the context of the legal labor market](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/associates-dont-deserve-bonuses-argues-woman-who-isnt-an-associate/). Lawyers at firms paying market understand “discretionary bonuses” to mean “a fluctuating amount that generally tracks Cravath’s holiday announcement.” “Discretionary” means that number shifts from year to year, not that the firm can just ignore it.

Lawyers make decisions about their careers based on this understanding and if firms don’t match the market when it comes to bonus season, they are — regardless of base compensation — below market. Which is fine… but people need to know that.

# Law Firms Conduct Layoffs, Slash Salaries In Response To Pandemic
## We sympathize with anyone who has to deal with the anxiety of a global health crisis AND financial insecurity.

With states going on lockdown and forbidding nonessential businesses from opening their doors amid the coronavirus crisis, we knew it was only a matter of time before [more law firms started conducting layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/law-firm-layoffs-amid-covid-19/). Today, we can report on two more New York firms that have decided to part ways with their personnel thanks to the global health crisis.

Sources tell us that Am Law 200 firm Goldberg Segalla conducted staff layoffs “in large numbers” this past Friday. In an email to [Law.com](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2020/03/24/2-ny-law-firms-cut-staff-salaries-amid-coronavirus-crisis/), managing partner Richard Cohen said the people who lost jobs were “largely … those whose responsibilities would be unessential or moot in the current work environment.”

He said the cuts “followed the firm’s previously established business continuity plan, which outlined reductions across various departments based on the circumstances for invoking the plan.”

He said the firm has provided severance but said it hopes to rehire once the situation improves. “Our expectation is that many of these team members will return to our firm as soon as possible,” Cohen said.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
We’re told that those who were laid off at the firm will receive health insurance benefits through April.

Another firm that’s decided to conduct layoffs in the wake of COVID-19 is Belkin Burden Goldman, a Manhattan-based real estate firm. While co-managing partner Jeffrey Goldman politely said the firm had made “some adjustments to staffing,” former employees were a little more blunt:

Two sources, including a person who previously worked at the firm, told Law.com that about two-thirds of the firm’s professional staff, which had totaled about 25 people, was laid off without severance, while some staff and lawyers had their salaries halved.

Goldman declined to comment on the number of layoffs, severance or salary cuts, but wrote, “Our firm is committed to making every effort to retain all staff at the highest salaries possible until this crisis passes, with an intention of trying to return to full staffing as soon as economic circumstances permit.”

We wish all of the individuals who may be affected at both firms the best of luck while they seek new job opportunities in the legal industry and beyond.

# Biglaw Managing Partner Opens Up About Alcoholism
## This Biglaw partner is combating the stigma of substance abuse.

Steven Wall

In March 2009, [Steven Wall](https://www.morganlewis.com/bios/swall) became managing partner of Biglaw giant Morgan Lewis & Bockius, but that doesn’t mean he’s had a picture perfect ascension into a position of power and authority. In fact, the opposite is true. Wall struggled for years with alcoholism, and in the latest episode of the [Legal Speak podcast](https://www.law.com/2018/05/18/big-law-leader-shares-struggles-with-alcoholism-challenges-for-profession/), he is sharing his story in an effort to shatter the stigma surrounding the disease of addiction.

One of the key points that Wall makes in the podcast is that the disease of addiction is nondiscriminatory — your professional status will not stop the disease. And, in fact, according to a 2016 study sponsored by the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation and the American Bar Association, lawyers suffer from alcoholism and other mental health issues at rates higher than in other professions.

The next logical question is why are lawyers so affected by substance use? Wall believes this is a complicated question, and the answers to the question are varied. Complicating the answer is that many lawyers abuse alcohol or indulge in it in problematic way, but not every lawyer who abuses alcohol is an addict. But too often alcohol and other substances are used by lawyers to deal with the pressure of being an elite lawyer.

Wall’s struggles with alcohol began as a student. At an Ivy League school for both undergrad and law school (Cornell for both), he was singularly focused on being the best student possible. When he was a young attorney, that perfectionism translated to his efforts to be the best lawyer possible. With that self-imposed pressure, for Wall, alcohol became a release. That, coupled with a biological predisposition towards addiction (both of his parents died from alcoholism), caused Wall to lead a double life where he was climbing the legal latter and still “managing the consequences” of his drinking because he couldn’t manage his drinking.

For much of Wall’s career there was a stigma around alcoholism. He recalls a senior partner at the firm saying to him, in total ignorance of the reality of the disease of addiction:

Steve, you are one the strongest, brightest people I know — I don’t understand why you cannot control your drinking.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Wall believes Biglaw firms are finally “waking up to reality” that the wellness of attorneys needs to be a priority. He says firms need to treat the wellness of attorneys the same way we treat their billable hours. Wall points out that the assets of a firm boil down to their attorney talent and their clients, so taking care of the talent has to be an important consideration for the firm or they’ll lose their clients.

At Morgan Lewis there are a few concrete steps the firm has put in place to prioritize employee wellness. The first is providing (and supporting with sweet tech hookups) remote working options for up to two days a week. This gives their attorneys the ability to deal with their life outside of their job, whether it be a doctor’s appointment or a contractor coming to the house. Wall says that lawyers work so many hours that the ability to work from home — and not have that be viewed negatively or somewhat less than — is important.

Morgan Lewis is also rolling out mandatory ethics CLEs in their offices on alcoholism/substance abuse. Wall says that the program, designed to help employees recognize and address addiction issues, takes the stigma from the disease away.

Wall deserves a lot of credit for making his own addiction issues public so that other struggling with substance abuse in Biglaw can see they aren’t alone and seek treatment.

# Top 30 Biglaw Firm Introduces 2-Day, In-Office Work Week For Its January 2022 Return

New year, new firm? That’s what seems to be going on at Paul Hastings, which just unveiled its hybrid office policy for 2022.

Here’s an excerpt from a memo that chairman [Seth Zachary](https://www.paulhastings.com/professionals/sethzachary), co-managing partner and chair elect [Frank Lopez](https://www.paulhastings.com/professionals/franklopez), and co-managing partner [Sherrese Smith](https://www.paulhastings.com/professionals/sherresesmith) sent to all personnel at the firm’s U.S. offices yesterday (emphasis added):

As the entire legal profession adapts to a new paradigm, we are embracing this moment to create new and innovative opportunities for the Firm and our people to thrive. We have been actively engaging with team members from all Offices and Departments, who have expressed a growing desire for professional development, reengagement with colleagues, and the sense of connection that comes only from being together. At the same time, we all have different considerations that shape our personal and professional lives. As we prepare to return to our offices, we do so with an understanding that a flexible working environment will be a key element in the post pandemic workplace.

With these considerations in mind, and to allow us to balance the need for connection and collaboration, as well as to allow you to take advantage of the professional development activities and events that we will be offering, beginning Monday, January 10, 2022, we recommend that all lawyers, client service support roles, paralegals and other timekeepers begin working from the office at least two days each week. Team and Department leaders will coordinate directly with the rest of the firm-wide departments on schedules that ensure full coverage. Local operations and IT support will continue with existing in-office service coverage. We recognize and understand that personal circumstances will vary, and anyone with questions or concerns should contact their leader.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
This “two days each week” business is a marked change from the firm’s stance [this past May](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/paul-hastings-reopening/), when lawyers were told that “by default, we should work from the office when we are able.” The firm later [walked back](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/paul-hastings-reopening-redo/) its “by default” language in June, stating its intention to remain a flexible workplace. Now, Paul Hastings seem ultra flexible when it comes to its employees’ time, and full-time, in-office work will no longer be the “by default” norm at the firm.

(Flip to the next page to see the memo from Paul Hastings.)

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

The Biglaw bonus train continues to gain steam. Yet another Biglaw firm has decided to pony up cold hard cash to tell associates just how much they appreciate their hard work during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This time it is Baker Botts giving out the big bucks. The firm, ranked 58th on the Am Law 100 with $751,070,000 in gross revenue in 2019, announced special bonuses. And of course, as you’d expect from such an elite firm, they’re meeting the market rate set last month by David Polk.

The payment schedule is as follows:

Deem Date	First Payment	Second Payment	Total
2020	$4,500	$7,500	$12,000
2019	$6,000	$10,000	$16,000
2018	$12,000	$20,000	$32,000
2017	$16,500	$27,500	$44,000
2016	$19,500	$32,500	$52,000
2015	$22,200	$37,000	$59,200
2014+	$24,000	$40,000	$64,000
Payments will be subject to the firm’s traditional bonus hours requirements. If an associate does not meet the annualized hours requirement by May 31, they’ll be able to make up the hours and receive the full bonus amount with the second.

# Biglaw Firm Completes Massive... Merger?... Acquisition?... What Should We Call This?
## Another pair of big-time acquisitions makes Dentons bigger than ever.

Dentons, a global behemoth just coming off major expansions in [South Korea](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/massive-law-firm-to-become-even-more-massiver-dentons/) and [Africa](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/09/biglaw-chair-slams-the-traditional-law-firm-model/), set its sights on America, launching Operation Golden Spike and [picking up two new firms and coverage in a even more markets](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/10/07/dentons-combines-with-two-us-firms-in-one-go-launching-new-american-strategy/).

Bingham Greenebaum brings 176 lawyers in Indianapolis (and a couple of smaller Indiana cities), Cincinnati, and Louisville and Lexington. Cohen & Grigsby is adding 140-plus in Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, and Naples, Florida.

The expansion brings another 300 attorneys under the Dentons umbrella which would sound like a lot to any firm other than Dentons, where 300 lawyers is a rounding error. Not that Dentons intends to stop at 300 new lawyers. American Lawyer reports that Dentons is talking to two more firms this week and another four by Thanksgiving.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Most interesting about this expansion is its unique character. It’s not so much a merger as it is a completely new animal. The tie-up involves the a “dual partnership,” allowing the firms to carry on while their partners also become Dentons partners. The theory is that betting on firms that are already successful doing what they’re doing is better than trying to recast a winning culture. But how do people get paid?

The economics are based on the premise that half of a firm’s profit, or margin, derives from originating the work. When different firms under the Dentons U.S. umbrella share work, in a process that will be guided by the leaders of the firm’s national practice groups, the firm that brought in the client will earn half the margin, while the firm handling the matter will earn the other half.

When all is said and done, Dentons aims to have 1,100 attorneys in the U.S.

“Clients are seeking seamless service and one-stop shopping,” said Dentons global CEO Elliott Portnoy. “They simply can’t get that today in all of the markets that matter to their business in the U.S.”

Once again, the leadership at Dentons seems to understand the business model of a lot of prolific businesses and while they may object to [being compared to Applebees or Starbucks](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/ever-growing-dentons-has-expansion-down-to-a-science/), in reality they’re following the precise business philosophy that made those institutions into massive successes. The secret to any company with multiple outposts is providing a marker of familiar quality in a new landscape. When a Dentons client in New York needs an attorney anywhere from Lexington to London, they now know who to call to get the same service they’re accustomed to.

We talk a lot about client loyalty is on the decline, but don’t really dig into why. Clients may not see the value proposition in blindly sticking with the firms that used to handle all their business but that’s not necessarily an indication that the client wants to be juggling multiple firms, just that they’re no longer asking hard questions about what firm is offering them the best fit. Dentons seems to understand that offering truly global coverage for markets large and small offers clients something that others don’t… and a new avenue to locking up a client’s whole range of business.

# Judge Tells Biglaw Firm To Stop Wasting His Time In Entertaining Benchslap
## According to this judge, size does matter.

When you’ve repeatedly submitted motions that surpass a court’s required page limitations and the judge on the case later begins an order with the following quotes, you know you’re probably going to be on the receiving end of a benchslap:

Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
I will be brief.
— William Shakespeare, Hamlet (Act 2, Scene 2)

I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.
— Blaise Pascal, Lettres Provinciales (English tr.)

It seems that attorneys at Faegre Baker Daniels, after complying with a 10-page limit on motions and briefs in its representation of Sinclair Pipeline Company in a case that had been in the Colorado District Court system since at least 2012, recently decided to ignore that page limitation, submitting pleadings that ranged from 15 pages all the way up to 24 pages. Judge [Todd Taylor](https://www.courts.state.co.us/Bio.cfm?Employee_ID=472) was not particularly pleased with this course of conduct.

Aw crap, he broke out the French. Lawyers from Faegre Baker Daniels never asked Judge Taylor for permission to exceed the court’s 10-page limit on pleadings, and he writes that even if asked, he wouldn’t have approved the request. Judge Taylor goes on: “Slipping something that the judge has not actually ordered into a proposed order is never a wise tactic. And not slipping something into a proposed order—so that a party can then argue that the court has acted by omission—is even less wise.”

Judge Taylor then continues his assault on the lawyers from Faegre Baker Daniels, taking care to mention that size does matter in some cases (emphasis added):

Judge Taylor even brings up a case from the 1500s, related to the imprisonment of man who submitted a pleading that was incredibly lengthy. That prisoner was later paraded around an English court wearing the paperwork around his neck — after his head was put through a hole cut in it by the prison warden. “I do not often wax nostalgic for the rigors of the common law. But, then again, sometimes I do,” writes Judge Taylor.

Because the lawyers from Faegre Baker Daniels succeeded only in pissing off Judge Taylor, all of the firm’s too-long motions and briefs were struck from the record, except for one, but only because it was fully briefed and ripe for ruling. Ouch.

On the bright side, at least Judge Taylor didn’t put the lawyers in jail.

# Biglaw Firm Kicks Off The Weekend For Associates With Raises And Bonuses
## This Biglaw firm is making it a fun Friday for associates.

What better way to start the weekend than with news that you’re getting a raise — and a big bonus, to boot? This Biglaw firm sure pleased associates all over the world when it made this announcement earlier today.

Brown Rudnick — a firm that brought in $216,367,000 gross revenue in 2020, putting it in 144th place in the most recent Am Law 200 ranking — notified its US, London, and Paris associates that they’d be receiving more money in their pockets. This is what the salary scale looks like at Brown Rudnick… and it seems to be a *record scratch* [Milbank match](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/):



Well, this was two salary scales ago, but more money is more money.

The firm also announced bonuses today, and surprise, it’s a Cravath match:



Salary increases at the Brown Rudnick are retroactive to February 1, and US associates can expect to see the money in their April 8 paychecks. Congrats to everyone at the firm. Maybe someday these Milbank salary matches will turn into Cravath salary matches.

(Flip to the next page to see the memo from Brown Rudnick.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And I’ll tell myself we must test you.

BLE Member Opening Statement

Greetings and welcome to the Board of Law Examiners Zoom meeting to discuss why you think that you deserve not to kill yourself to take a test that is simply an entry barrier. We would have held this meeting in person, but to ensure our safety we decided Zoom would be better. Why do we even [have a bar exam](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/kill-the-bar-exam/)? Sure, you might cite this [amazing Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/danielle__craig/status/1276889746405384192?s=20) about the [racist history](https://theappeal.org/2020-bar-exam-coronavirus-inequities-legal-system/) of the bar exam, but we’re here only to ensure that the bar continues with the dignity and professionalism you’ve come to expect from us BLE members.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Now, some of you have been clamoring for an online exam. We can’t have that without delaying the bar exam, costing you more money. But hey, we know you like bar loans. And, to be honest, we love all the bar exam peripheral markets, too. [Some of us](https://twitter.com/diplomaprivileg/status/1279616321966051328?s=20) are even on the [NCBEX board!](http://www.ncbex.org/) Some state Supreme Court justices, too! Bar loans, Barbri, and, of course, the fees we charge you are ways to make sure you feel like you’ve worked hard for this.

Sure, you might have suggested that we should have planned for a COVID-19 spike all along, but we are not fortunetellers! It’s not like anyone else expected that there would be a surge in cases. Jeez. We’re doing the best we can with the information we occasionally read in the Bar Journal. Ooh, here’s a lovely article about how much we in the profession care about your mental health! I mean, once you’re in the profession. Not now.

Let’s talk about the [meeting agenda](https://theappeal.org/2020-bar-exam-coronavirus-inequities-legal-system/). We will let the deans advocate on your behalf first. Because we recognize that they represent some semblance of the profession. But they don’t have your interests at heart! They just want to make money for their schools. We don’t see ALL of THEIR SCHOOLS going online! See? Only we truly care about you. For that reason, we will be very rude to them and hold them in utter contempt. We will roll our eyes at them and make sure you are very clear that we do not like them.

Next, we will eagerly await your stories about why you’re a lazy-ass piece of … I mean, concerned about your health. Some of us will look like we are bored or falling asleep, but that is because you have moved us so much that we can barely keep the tears from falling out of our eyes.

You might be outraged and try to take pictures of our seemingly snoozing and bored faces and claim we are cold-hearted, but we want you to keep in mind how important it is that you maintain your professionalism. You haven’t gone through character and fitness yet! No, we aren’t threatening you. We just want to make sure your deans do.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
In any event, the death rate for COVID-19 is dropping, so please stop being so dramatic. There’s no reason that you all can’t show up and dress in three-piece suits (okay, in Virginia we’ll let you [lose the tie](https://barexam.virginia.gov/bar/barmdc.html)) to take the bar exam.  This is about professionalism! And part of being in a profession is treating people like shit! Ask many senior partners at major law firms!

Did I mention that I took the bar exam while having appendix surgery?  These are different times indeed, my fragile test takers!

Now, some of you have actually had COVID-19 and have asked for an extension. Well, guess what? Life’s hard in the big law. Denied! Suck it up!   Yeah, sure you have COVID-19. Whatever. Just [take the damn bar exam](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/just-take-the-damn-bar-exam/)!

By the way, did you see that great article in the Bar Journal about healing with compassion?

Speaking of which, we are very concerned for your health. For that reason, we’ll be making you show up early and quarantine at the bar exam site, where we have set up cots. But that is only after you have passed our mandatory [$150 COVID-19 test](https://twitter.com/BarExamTracker/status/1280259513875140609?s=20). While you await the result, you must sleep in your car. Please be dressed professionally.

Also, you’ll need to sign a [waiver](https://twitter.com/BarExamTracker/status/1279175362212134912?s=20). Basically, you absolve us of all liability for forcing you to take this exam. Consider it professional courtesy.

Lastly, I just want to say how important it is that we are very civil to one another during this heated time. Please make sure to keep your remarks civil. Don’t engage in any personal attack (like pointing out that we’re sleeping or maybe have conflicts of interest). This isn’t personal. It’s business! I mean, uh, professionalism.

Speaking of which, please catch the latest mandatory professionalism CLE after you pass the bar. Professionalism is important!

By the way, if we change the bar exam date and time, we’ll let you know at the last possible minute. Because being needlessly frustrated is all part of professionalism!

Okay, let’s hear from the deans while I do some online shopping!”

# The Akin Gump Partner Compelled To Testify Against Paul Manafort
## It isn't typical for lawyers to testify against clients.

Melissa Laurenza

Usually lawyers can be confident that their communications with their clients and any work they do on their behalf will remain shielded from public consumption through the attorney-client and work-product privileges. We do not live in usual times.

When former Trump campaign adviser [Paul Manafort was indicted](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/this-31-page-manafort-indictment-feels-like-flip-bait/) on Monday, one of the documents unsealed was a decision by U.S. District Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the District of Columbia (the judge overseeing the grand jury empaneled by special counsel Robert Mueller) compelling one of his former lawyers to testify before the grand jury. Though that order redacted the name of the lawyer, the [National Law Journal  is reporting](http://www.law.com/sites/nationallawjournal/2017/10/31/akin-gump-lawyer-was-compelled-to-testify-at-manafort-grand-jury/) the attorney in question is [Melissa Laurenza](https://www.akingump.com/en/lawyers-advisors/melissa-l-laurenza.html), partner at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld whose practice focuses on campaign law and lobbying registration.

Judge Howell found a “crime fraud” exception to the attorney-client and work-product privileges, writing:

When a person uses the attorney-client relationship to further a criminal scheme, the law is well established that a claim of attorney-client or work-product privilege must yield to the grand jury’s investigatory needs.

Laurenza initially refused to testify, due to her ethical obligations to keep silent about communications with her client. However, in the decision Howell notes Laurenza’s lawyer says she will comply with the subpoena as long as that’s “within the bounds of her ethical obligations to her former clients.”

Mueller’s team sought testimony from Laurenza to determine if the information submitted by Manafort and his business associate Rick Gates to the Department of Justice under the Foreign Agents Registration Act was intentionally misleading. As such, Laurenza’s testimony before the grand jury was limited:

Mueller’s prosecutors, according to Howell’s ruling, would ask “narrow questions to confirm the source of the facts she submitted to the government, including whether her clients gave her the information represented in the letter as coming from them and/or reviewed a draft of the letter for accuracy.” According to the ruling, Mueller’s team stressed that it was not seeking “witness interview notes or to probe which witnesses she believed” but rather “just seeking to confirm that the source of the factual representations is what it purports to be: the clients’ recollections.”

Manafort and Gates have pleaded [not guilty](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/the-predawn-raid-on-paul-manaforts-house/) to the 12 counts against them which include: conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, unregistered agent of a foreign principal, false and misleading FARA statements, false statements, and seven counts of failure to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts.

# Biglaw Firm Skipping Their 2021 Summer Associate Program In Response To COVID-19
## First Biglaw firm to forego this year's summer program.

With the COVID-19 appreciation bonuses sweeping Biglaw, it’s easy to think the legal industry escaped the economic turmoil of the last year unscathed. And, while it is certainly true that, on balance, the legal industry did better than most, it isn’t all sunshine and rainbows.

Indeed, lots of people in the legal industry[ lost their jobs](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/layoffs/) during the raging pandemic. One firm that [made news for their layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/one-of-vaults-best-firms-in-the-mid-atlantic-is-laying-off-associates-and-taking-other-steps-to-cut-costs/?rf=1) — not just staff layoffs, but associate ones as well — is Saul Ewing Arnstein & Lehr. A 2017 merger brought together Saul Ewing and Arnstein & Lehr to create the obviously named Saul Ewing Arnstein & Lehr, and the firm seemed poised for growth, taking the 15th spot in [the Vault ranking](https://www.vault.com/best-companies-to-work-for/law/best-law-firms-in-each-us-region/mid-atlantic) of most prestigious Mid-Atlantic firms, and ranking 131st on the [2020 Am Law 200](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=164148&name=Saul-Ewing-Arnstein-%26-Lehr-LLP) after raking in $239,077,000 in gross revenue in 2019.

But Above the Law has learned the COVID-19 upheaval hasn’t ended with layoffs at the firm. According to tipsters, the firm has communicated to law students interested in their 2021 Summer Program that they will not be hosting one. From the email students are receiving ([available in full on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/saul-ewing-canceled-summer/2/)):

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Unfortunately, given the uncertain nature surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm has made the difficult decision not to host a 2021 Summer Program.  The Firm remains committed to hiring excellent law students such as yourself and we hope you will consider keeping in touch and reapplying in the future.

Remember on-campus interviews at most law schools were [pushed from the fall to January](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/winter-oci-is-coming-lets-keep-it-that-way/) this year (again because of COVID). So while Saul Ewing is the first we’ve heard doing away with their 2021 summer program ([2020 was its own special shit show](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/every-summer-associate-program-change-in-one-chart/)), who knows what we’ll see before the cycle ends.

We reached out to the firm to ask for a comment on their 2021 Summer Program and a representative provided this statement:

It is not correct that we “canceled” our program. We had not planned to host a summer program in 2021 due to our desire to fully integrate other new lawyers into the firm from the Classes of 2019 and 2020 and the inherent difficulties of running the kind of program that we want in a virtual way. The decision was driven less by “economic upheaval” and more by the genuine desire to focus on our new lawyers, including those who will be first years in the fall, and to avoid a summer program that is in any way less effective than our traditional program because of the remote environment. We fully expect to return to our normal full program in 2022.

Good news is fairly difficult to come by these days. So kudos to Akin Gump for giving some welcome news to their associates.

Of course the firm, with its $1,208,738,000 in gross revenue and fancy 33rd Am Law ranking, told associates that they too would be sharing in the wave of raises that is sweeping Biglaw.

That means some pretty big salary numbers for Akin associates, as per the salary grid below:

Class Year	Salary
2014+	$396,500
2015	$381,000
2016	$360,500
2017	$335,000
2018	$293,500
2019	$250,000
2020	$225,000
2021	$215,000
The increases are retroactive to January 1 and will hit associates’ bank accounts with their March 31 paycheck.

You can read the [full memo on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/akin-raises-22/2/)

# More Law Firms Should Have Mentorship Programs
## If partners expect (or at least hope) that associates will stick around their firms for a while, they should consider establishing law firm mentorship programs.

Most law firm associates do not receive any kind of formal support as they begin their first few years as practicing attorneys. At some law firms, junior lawyers are thrown into the deep end and are expected to complete their tasks with little or no support from partners. Indeed, at several of the law firms at which I worked before starting my own practice, I was expected to just pick up the skills I needed to know on the job, and I was not assigned any mentors. However, when I was an associate in Biglaw, I was part of a law firm mentorship program. More law firms should consider hosting such programs since associates and partners can benefit from this approach.

While working in Biglaw, my law firm mentoring experience began as a summer associate. At the time, I was assigned two law firm mentors, one was an associate who was several years older than me and the other was a partner who was decades into his career. I met with each of my mentors once a week, and if the circumstances permitted, we would grab coffee or lunch outside of the office so that we could have less restrictive conversations.

The mentorship experience was very beneficial to me. The associate mentor told me about his own experiences starting out at the law firm and gave me valuable advice about how to be a more effective law firm associate. Perhaps most importantly, the associate mentor gave me tips about how I could navigate some of the bigger personalities around the office, which was very helpful in ensuring that I was liked by the partners who had the most “juice” at that shop. The partner mentor told me about all of the steps I would need to complete to be considered for partnership and gave me other feedback that people who were decades into their careers would know.

When I joined that law firm as a full-time associate, the mentorship program continued. As I got busier with work, I met with my mentors less and less, but I still met with the associate and partner mentors on a regular basis. In addition to these two mentors, I also had a writing mentor who would give me tips about my writing. I regularly get trolled online for how poorly written my Above the Law articles are, so perhaps this mentor did not do such a good job! However, this mentorship was really meaningful to my training as a lawyer.

After I wrote a memo or a brief section, my writing mentor would review the piece of legal writing and provide notes. Often, we would spend the better part of an hour going over my writing, and my mentor gave me tips on how to economize my language and format my writing to be more easily digestible to the reader. The person who was designated as my writing mentor was a great writer himself, and he wrote some of the most important briefs and other pieces of legal writing at our office. I won’t say that I ever reached his level of proficiency with legal writing, but my writing mentor gave me numerous tips about legal writing that improved my writing as an associate at that firm and that I continue to use in my legal writing today.

Law firms might not want to have established mentorship programs for many reasons. Lawyers have limited amounts of time, and most law firms are focused on billing the most hours possible rather than developing associates into better attorneys. At many law firms, associates rarely stay at the shop for more than a year or two, so it does not make too much sense to invest so much time on training these lawyers to be better practitioners. Moreover, some legal work does not require much emphasis on writing, so this component of the mentorship program I experienced might not be appealing to some lawyers.

However, if partners expect (or at least hope) that associates will stick around their firms for a while, they should consider establishing law firm mentorship programs. Such programs can help new associates build connections with a law firm that can make it more likely that lawyers will stick around a shop for a longer time. Moreover, law firm mentorship programs can help associates improve their skills and become more seasoned practitioners, which can have a positive impact on the work these associates perform for clients.

# Blue’s Clues... And You

Blue’s Clues was a children’s television program developed in the 1990s with the cooperation of child psychologists. The show was unique because it sought to incorporate the findings of cognitive psychology research on children into its content and presentation — a goal that produced surprising results.

What the researchers discovered in the course of their work was that children crave repetition, to a surprising degree — it comforts them. How much repetition do they crave? The results were unexpected, to say the least. It turns out most pre-schoolers are happiest watching exactly the same television show five times in a row. And so that’s what the producers of Blue’s Clues did — broadcast the same exact half-hour episode every weekday for five days in a row, every week. The kids loved it.

You might not be surprised by this outcome if you’ve ever sat a pre-schooler on your lap and read him a children’s book. You know what it’s like to finish “Thomas the Tank Engine,” then point to a stack of other books and suggest, “Hey, how about we read ‘Mike Mulligan and his Steam Shovel’”? only to get shouted down: “No, read Thomas again!”

“But I just read it to you…”

“Read. It. Again!”

And so you do. Again and again and again until you’re getting kind of sick of it, until at last, little pre-schooler nephew lies comatose in your lap amid a spreading puddle of drool. Awwwww… how cute.

# Biglaw's Most Recent Summer Associate Class Was The 'Most Diverse Ever'
## Congratulations on these historic gains, Biglaw!

Without doubt, this summer associate class was the most diverse ever measured in every way, and it holds the promise of a law firm world that is truly more diverse, equitable and inclusive. The challenge for the industry is to retain, train, develop and promote this talented and diverse pool of new lawyers, so that five years from now, the associate ranks as a whole reflect similar diversity and representation, and 10 or 15 years from now, we can celebrate a partnership class that is similarly diverse.

— [James Leipold](https://www.nalp.org/nalp_staff), executive director of the National Association for Law Placement, commenting on the [major progress for diversity](https://www.nalp.org/uploads/PressReleases/NALPDiversityReport_PressRel_Jan2022.pdf) that was displayed in Biglaw’s most recent summer associate class. The percentage of summer associates of color increased by about 5 percentage points this past summer, to 41.34%. This is the greatest increase in the nearly 30 years that NALP has been tracking this information. Women and LGBTQ summer associates also had their gains noted in NALP’s [2021 Report on Diversity in U.S. Law Firms](https://www.nalp.org/uploads/2021NALPReportonDiversity.pdf), with the percentage of summer associates who are women increasing by 1.4 percentage points to 55.06%, and the percentage of LGBTQ summer associates increasing by about a percentage point, moving up to 8.41%, a historic high.

# Morning Docket: 02.11.19
## * “We take the allegations against Justin very seriously.” Justin Fairfax, the lieutenant governor of Virginia who’s embroiled in a sexual assault scandal, has taken a leave of absence from Morrison & Foerster, where he’s a partner, as the firm itself conducts its own investigation into the allegations. [[National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/2019/02/08/justin-fairfax-takes-leave-from-mofo-as-firm-opens-investigation/)] * High revenue and even higher demand resulted in law firms posting their best results since just before the recession, with Am Law 50 and niche/boutique firms outperforming the rest of their industry counterparts. Unfortunately, all of this good news could come to an end in 2020... [[American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2019/02/10/inside-law-firms-best-results-in-a-decade/)] * Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), a former partner partner at Dorsey & Whitney and Gray Plant Mooty, has officially announced her candidacy for president, making her the fifth major player who’s a lawyer to join the Democratic race for 2020. [[POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/10/amy-klobuchar-2020-presidential-candidate-1162576)] * Thanks to the PBS show “Finding Your Roots,” Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) recently learned that he’s not the only lawyer in his family. The show helped him discover that his third great grandfather — a 1786 law graduate of the University of Granada — graduated 210 years before he graduated from Miami Law.

And she should stay out of jail until this case runs it course.” A lawyer for Michelle Carter, the Massachusetts woman who was convicted for involuntary manslaughter in her friend’s suicide-by-text, has vowed to take her case to the Supreme Court.

As the minutes tick by .6 at a time, attorneys at Biglaw firms across the country are impatiently waiting to see whether they’ll soon be the lucky recipients of a special bonus memo.

The wait is over at Lowenstein Sandler, where associates, counsel, and senior counsel just found out that bonus bucks are not only on the table, but they’re a match for the incredible [Davis Polk scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/). “We are extremely proud of the resilience and adaptability exhibited by so many of our colleagues that resulted in a successful 2020 and first quarter 2021,” writes Gary Wingens, the firm’s chair and managing partner. “Thank you for contributing to that success.” Here’s what the bonus scale looks like at Lowenstein (full memo available on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/lowenstein-sander-special-bonus-2021/2/)):

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Salary Class	June 30 Bonus	September 30 Bonus	 
Total

2020	$4,500	$7,500	$12,000
2019	$6,000	$10,000	$16,000
2018	$12,000	$20,000	$32,000
2017	$16,500	$27,500	$44,000
2016	$19,500	$32,500	$52,000
2015	$22,200	$37,000	$59,200
2014	$24,000	$40,000	$64,000
2013	$24,000	$40,000	$64,000
Bonuses will be paid to those who are on track to reach an annualized minimum of 1800 client billable hours and at least 150 firm directed hours (e.g., pro bono, diversity efforts, recruiting, practice group activities, or additional billable hours) from October 1, 2020 through the applicable measurement dates (April 30, 2021 and July 31, 2021). The firm will offer catch-up payments for anyone who misses the mark on April 30, but meets the eligibility threshold at July 31.

The good news doesn’t end there, because as noted by Wingens, these special bonuses are in addition to Lowenstein’s regular year-end bonuses, which are expected to be paid “in at least the same overall magnitude as in 2020.”

Congratulations to everyone at Lowenstein!

Is “Bob has a spreadsheet” your firm’s answer to most business intelligence queries? 

Or is your other tab right now a self-service dashboard, providing instant access to well-curated KPIs? 

“What gets tracked gets done,” as the saying goes, but law firms are all over the map on gathering BI-related metrics.

That’s why we want to know about yours.  

Please take a minute to complete our (always) brief and anonymous survey. 

You’ll be helping benchmark a key industry practice, and as a thank you, participants will receive a chance to win a $250 gift card.

What’s a fun way to ensure your associates will not only have a fabulous Friday but a wonderful weekend as well? How about an early morning memo about their shiny new salaries? That’s exactly what the latest firm to match [Milbank’s new salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/) did just a few short hours ago.

Thanks to Milbank, there’s yet again a new prevailing salary scale, and Biglaw firms are racing to increase their own salaries in response to the move. Which firm is the latest to adopt $215,000 as its new starting salary?

That would be Fried Frank, a firm that’s currently ranked at No. 60 on the Am Law 100. The firm took about [a week to match](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/fried-frank-raises-21/) the last round of raises, but they’re not joking around this time. Here’s the firm’s new salary scale:



The firm’s salary increases are retroactive to January 1, and associates will see more money in their February 15 paychecks. Congratulations to everyone!

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Fried Frank.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Milbank) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Milbank”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Biglaw Firm Lays Off 50 Lawyers And Staff Due To COVID-19
## The firm is also considering cutting its real estate footprint in view of decreasing its head count.

For many Biglaw firms, the worst of the economic upheaval caused by the coronavirus crisis seems to be over. Some firms that conducted austerity measures like salary reductions are now reassessing their finances and either partially or completely removing those compensation cuts. Other firms are rolling out COVID-related bonuses that range up to $40,000 (or in some cases, $50,000). Things seem to be coming along quite nicely — but unfortunately, it looks like there are some firms that are still struggling.

Across the pond in the United Kingdom, Ince Gordon Dadds, an international Biglaw firm that’s listed on the London Stock Exchange, revealed in its most recent financial disclosure that layoffs had occurred due to the pandemic. It’s been reported that approximately 50 lawyers and support staff were let go across all of the firm’s offices.

The [Global Legal Post](https://www.globallegalpost.com/big-stories/ince-reports-50-covid-19-staff-layoffs-and-signals-significant-post-pandemic-office-space-savings-99139818/) has additional information on what’s happening at Ince:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The measures are revealed in an AGM statement and trading update published today that also confirmed that dividend payments remain suspended in the light of the pandemic’s impact on business.

The statement said a “limited global programme” of redundancies had taken place affecting lawyers and support staff “in areas where it is not expected that business will recover sufficiently in the medium term” from the Covid-19 pandemic.

And, in recognition of the fact “that working practices are likely to change over coming years” and that its current office space “may be too large or may no longer be suitable” it noted that it had the opportunity to make “significant further operational cost savings” in the medium term.

Yikes, it certainly sounds like more cuts could be coming for this firm. Best of luck to all those who are affected by the layoffs at Ince.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries or restoring previous cuts, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs/Salary%20Cuts) or text us (646-820-8477).

# Biglaw Firm Claims Partners Are Not Employees
## Another twist in this Biglaw case.

Kerrie Campbell

The legal maneuvers in this case just keep on coming!

Quick recap for those not following along at home:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Chadbourne & Parke partner Kerrie Campbell [filed a $100 million lawsuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/chadbourne-swings-back-over-gender-bias-suit/) claiming women partners are paid less than their male counterparts and there is a pattern of gender discrimination. A bunch of female partners at the firm [insisted there’s nothing amiss](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/these-biglaw-partners-are-super-pissed-someone-filed-a-class-action-lawsuit-on-their-behalf/?rf=1) there. Then an [amended complaint,](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/theres-now-allegedly-videotape-in-the-latest-biglaw-lawsuit-twist/) which [added a named plaintiff](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/biglaw-pay-discrimination-case-adds-a-new-plaintiff/), followed by an [aggressive answer](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/chadbourne-swings-back-over-gender-bias-suit/). And now comes this motion to dismiss.

The MTD features a interesting argument — one that could have ramifications for other women partners looking to challenge the [pay disparity](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/from-the-obvious-files-male-biglaw-partners-make-more-than-female-ones/) between male and female partners — that partners, or at least equity partners, don’t constitute employees under employment law. This argument rests on a few facts: that there is no reporting relationship for equity partners, that they operate autonomously and set their own hours, and that they determine the manner in which they practice the law. (This “partners are owners” argument was raised by Sidley Austin a defense to an age discrimination case years ago, but it was never ruled upon because the case [settled](http://www.law360.com/articles/36837/sidley-austin-to-pay-27-5m-to-end-age-bias-suit).)

A Chadbourne spokesperson had this to say:

Our motion makes clear that this case never should have been brought. The plaintiffs as partners of the Firm are its owners, not its employees, and thus are not legally entitled to bring claims against the Firm under the employment laws that they are trying to invoke.

The case also was never proper to bring as a class action. These are uniquely individual claims, and plaintiffs cannot inflate the group they purport to represent to a level that warrants class action treatment under controlling law.

Notwithstanding the fanfare with which this lawsuit was announced by the plaintiffs, the fact is that it is plagued by fundamental legal defects that require it to be dismissed.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Campbell’s attorney, [David Sanford](https://sanfordheisler.com/team/david-sanford/), responded to the motion in a statement to [American Lawyer](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202772327264/Chadbourne-Asks-Judge-to-Toss-Partners-Gender-Bias-Suit):

“Chadbourne’s latest filings are simply another attempt to silence two women who had the courage to speak out against the culture of entrenched sexism and chauvinism at the firm,” Sanford said. “We are confident we will defeat Chadbourne’s motions and ultimately will vindicate the rights of female attorneys at the firm. Chadbourne may continue its assault on the equal rights of female partners but it should have no doubt that Ms. Campbell and Ms. Johnson will continue their pursuit of justice.”

Can’t wait to see what he actually puts in the filed response.

# When Are Lawyers In Their Prime?
## The test does not involve thumping the lawyer's head to check for a deep, hollow, knocking sound.

A lawyer in his prime.

I was talking recently to a surgeon friend of mine who finished his training a few years back when he was in his early 30s. This friend related that depending on the specialty, surgeons might only have a few decades during which they are in their prime and able to do their best work. This is because surgeons generally require a lot of training, and physical limitations might impact surgeons later in their careers. This got me thinking about the fact that some lawyers may also operate in their prime for a set time in their careers. This is highly dependent on the individual lawyer, the practice area, and what the lawyer did previously in their career.

Lawyers rarely enter their prime right out of law school. Like other professionals, lawyers need to gain experience and practice in order to perfect the art of being a lawyer. Also, law school does little to teach people how to be practicing lawyers. Some individuals can go to certain educational programs and expect that they will be trained practitioners upon graduation. However, lawyers usually need to spend months after graduating from law school studying for the bar exam and practice for years before they are seasoned enough to be trusted to work on matters by themselves.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)

Moreover, lawyers rarely enter their prime after graduating from law school since people might not trust them to handle work, and their contemporaries are not advanced enough in their careers to refer business to them. I once had a partner say to me that he did not mind more gray hair since he could generate more business with his gray hair because people knew that he was older and more experienced with practicing law. Individuals who recently graduated from law school may not inspire the same type of confidence as practitioners who have been in the profession for decades.

Sometime around the middle of the careers of many lawyers, attorneys enter their prime. It is hard to quantify when this occurs, and this likely varies for different lawyers, but this seems to usually be between 10 to 15 years after graduating from law school. At this point, lawyers have enough experience under their belt that they can give prospective clients examples of past situations when they handled matters similar to a client’s and the results they were able to obtain. In addition, lawyers have a broader breadth of experiences a little later in their careers which gives they a solid background to help clients facing a variety of issues.

At some point in the middle of a lawyer’s career, their contemporaries in-house and people they know from all facets of their lives start to progress in their own careers and might be in positions to give the lawyer work. This could be because a friend who works in-house is now senior enough that they might have some say over who gets assigned projects, and this might include a colleague at a similar phase of their career who works at a firm. Moreover, individuals outside of the law might have businesses that developed to a point that they need legal counsel, or they are promoted within a business to a position that has some say over who to assign legal work.

There is also a point later in the careers of many lawyers when they are outside of their prime. Let me first say that I adore and have much respect for senior lawyers. Lawyers who have been practicing for decades are often extremely generous with their time and are usually more willing to explain things to attorneys who are just beginning in the profession than others. Moreover, senior lawyers often have a wealth of experiences that can enrich their own practice and the practices of those with whom these attorneys interact. As explained in a prior article, lawyers who have been practicing for decades [are often bolder](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/older-lawyers-can-be-bolder-than-others-in-how-they-practice-law/) with how they approach legal matters, which is usually a delight to see in practice.

However, as attorneys progress in their careers, their in-house contemporaries might retire, and the people who replace these individuals may want to work with people with whom they have experience. Moreover, the contacts of senior lawyers who are not lawyers may also retire and these referral sources may disappear. Many firms also have succession policies that explicitly off-track partners after they reach a certain age to make room for the next generation of lawyers. A partner I worked with had perhaps one-fifth the book of business he had at 70 than he did at 58 likely because of this phenomenon. Of course, I also know lawyers that have amazing books of business in their 70s, so this is by no means a hard and fast rule, but lawyers can be out of their prime as they advance later in their careers.

In sum, there is assuredly a period in each lawyer’s career when they are in their prime and reach their best practice and earning potential. Lawyers should recognize that this might be a limited time so that they make the best of the years they have in their prime.

# In-House Counsel Denounce Rising Biglaw Bills As 'Out Of Kilter With Reality'
## UK in-house attorneys are feeling the financial strain of outside counsel costs. What's happening in the US?

It’s making clients look elsewhere for lawyers. They’re not going to the usual suspects anymore and want to speak to three or four firms before making their decision. They’re not just trusting the big names.

— Somaya Ouazzani, CEO of legal partner search firm Mimoza Fleur, commenting on outside counsel’s steep rate increases and how [general counsel in the UK are trying to work their way around them](https://www.law.com/international-edition/2022/04/11/uk-gcs-slam-unfair-astronomical-fee-rises-as-some-bills-more-than-double/). Ouazzani says in-house lawyers are no longer willing to “swallow fees,” even for Biglaw firms with which they’ve had longstanding relationships. In-house counsel have described the fee hikes as “astronomical,” “out of kilter with reality,” and “unfair.” These legal fees have been criticized in courts as of late, with eye-popping hourly rates and bills being referred to as “excessive.”

We thought we entered Biglaw bonus season last week, but after Cravath rolled out a higher bonus schedule, the majority of firms responded with silence. What’s going on, and is someone finally going to break that logjam?

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

According to the Cushman & Wakefield 2023 Legal Sector Leasing Trends report, [leasing activity hit record levels in 2022](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/biglaw-lawyers-must-return-to-the-office-to-justify-managements-reckless-office-space-leases/), with leasing volume booming in the first quarter of 2023. By how much did leasing activity increase last year?

Hint: The Cushman & Wakefield report notes that leasing volume in 2023’s first quarter was higher than in any previously recorded Q1.

# The Insufferable Nonsense Biglaw Is Spouting Over Milbank's Raises
## Firms that aren't matching Milbank aren't ‘not raising,’ they're functionally cutting salaries.

Milbank just [raised the associate salary scale by $10K](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/milbank-raises-associate-salaries-and-announces-year-end-bonuses/). It’s a welcome move for associates in a market where stealth (and not-so-stealth) layoffs have dominated headlines this year.

And yet, instead of matches all we’re seeing is anonymous shade from the peanut gallery. Take, for example, [this quote we featured yesterday](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/top-biglaw-firm-leaders-criticize-milbanks-money-moves/) from an unnamed Am Law 50 firm leader:

[It’s] tone deaf. It’d be like saying, ‘Look how rich I am,’ when the economy is struggling.

Oh bullshit. The PPEP numbers your firm reports to Am Law is “like saying, ‘Look how rich I am,’ when the economy is struggling.” Paying your employees an extra 400 bucks per pay period is not saying a damn thing other than your firm isn’t afraid to reward the talent that feeds those gaudy numbers.

And yet, somehow, this wasn’t the most ludicrous quote out there. Another anonymous Am Law 50 executive said this:

All we’re doing is continuing to put targets on these kids’ backs. Increasing salaries… causes them to increase salaries up the chain [and] increase billable hours for them. I just think they’re taking this pound of flesh out of them.

This is just gaslighting. Just like [Milbank’s 2018 raise](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/why-the-milbank-raise-is-not-that-big-of-a-deal-and-why-it-is/), this isn’t a raise as much as a cost of living adjustment. Inflation is under control now, but associates lived through an inflationary cycle that folks haven’t seen since the 80s. An extra $10K is exactly in line with that.

So it’s entirely disingenous to act like this raise requires attorneys to bill more. Lawyers aren’t making more money, they’re getting back to even. Honestly, this is the same salary in real terms that associates have made for over 20 years. Plug the old $125,000 scale from 1999 into an inflation calculator and it is — SURPRISE — $230K. There’s nothing “more” about this raise and associates shouldn’t have to bill a second more than they did in 1999 to deserve this compensation.

The greatest trick the devil ever pulled is convincing employees that they’re getting a raise when their compensation goes down in real terms.

All the credit in the world to Milbank for making this move, but let’s stop calling this a raise and call it what it is: firms that don’t match Milbank are cutting associate salaries.

Winter is creeping up on us, and with Hanukkah behind us, Christmas nearly upon us, and everyone in the legal profession ready to ring in the New Year, it’s time to reveal the seven finalists for our thirteenth annual holiday card contest. But first let’s give shout-outs to some honorable mentions (click on each firm’s name to see its card):

1. [Rakower Law](https://rakowerlawpllc.cmail19.com/t/ViewEmail/j/DA72BF1B4DC1CEED2540EF23F30FEDED/FD90A2E78267AF0C4D402EFBD42943A3?alternativeLink=False): A cute little card that hones in on our Zoom way of life in the law, and even features Lawyer Cat. Choose a charity of your choice and the firm will make a donation based on selections received before December 23.

2. [Butler Snow](https://www.butlersnow.com/holiday-card-2021/): It pains me to have to only give this one an honorable mention, but the submission was late and when it comes to this contest, rules are rules. This is a fantastic take on the law creeping up into every single aspect of a lawyer’s life. Check it out.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And now, the seven finalists, in alphabetical order. Again, click on each firm’s name to view its card. Please note that most of these cards have SOUND, so you might want to turn your sound off or down, or use headphones. Explanatory comments come from firm representatives unless otherwise indicated.

1. [Davis Wright Tremaine](https://vimeo.com/647874508): A relaxing holiday card? Yes, it exists, and this Biglaw firm did it oh so well. “Does anyone need more gifs, jokes, twinkles, and distractions this year? No! What everyone most needs after a year that started with an insurrection and ended with a new variant is just a minute to breathe in peace. That’s the idea behind our card this year, which takes its cue from popular apps like Calm, and was produced entirely in-house, including the voice-over by DWT’s Web Content Coordinator.”

2. [Faegre Drinker](https://vimeo.com/653016725): A law firm holiday party, with a twist — and this time, it’s not COVID. “The story focuses on a professional who is trying to return to the office for a holiday party as a way to insert some normalcy back into her life. From attending meetings in pajama bottoms and shuffling through toys on her way across “the office,” to dusting off her work clothes, our professional has experiences familiar to many of us this holiday season as we look to find ways to reconnect with colleagues. While she ultimately finds that she is the only one able to attend in person, she is met with the warm and friendly faces of her co-workers, who are just as excited to see her virtually as they would be in person. It is a reminder, that despite our current circumstances, and the distance that may separate us, the Faegre Drinker family is always connected.”

3. [Holland & Hart](https://experience.hollandhart.com/2021-holiday-card): For those who like an interactive experience, this firm’s holiday card won’t disappoint. “We’ve all had enough sober and distressing news the last two years, so our team decided we and our clients needed an escape from reality. Our ‘Have an Unbelievable Holiday’ card tracks the adventures of the Holland & Hart Yeti exploring the firm’s office locations. Viewers join the Yeti on its journey, seeing the Yeti in action through video, and participating in fun games like ‘Dress the Yeti’ and ‘Find the Yeti.’ The best part: our team had an amazing experience collaborating on this project and we’ve had unbelievably positive reactions from clients, colleagues, and friends! To demonstrate our commitment to the Yeti, the firm made a donation to the National Forest Foundation to help preserve the Yeti’s habitat in the Mountain West, which is also where we live, work, and play.”

4. [Kramer Elkins & Watt](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2021/12/Kramer-Elkins-Watt-LLC-2021-Holiday-Card.pdf): It’s a holiday card in the form of a pleading, and this is one you’ll actually enjoy reading. From the firm: “Our motion speaks for itself, so no brief will be provided.” Please take a look. You’ll at least get a little chuckle out of it, we promise.

5. [McBrayer](http://www.mcbrayerseasonsgreetings.com/): “After advising Santa on legal issues a few years back, we were happy to welcome him back for more stellar legal advice in a number of our practice areas. As always, we had a great group of attorneys willing to provide some excellent legal assistance, and an even more game group of attorneys and staff willing to play the role of Santa. These cards are our opportunity to display some of the human touch that we bring to our client service by bringing a bit of holiday fun to the world of law.” We think you’ll really like Santa’s legal debacles, and there’s even a cameo appearance from the Easter Bunny (who could also use some legal assistance).

6. [Venable](https://www.venable.com/happy-holidays-2021): A pop-up card that’ll make your heart soar. This Biglaw firm is supporting schools during a time when they need the most help of all. “At Venable, we continue to seek meaningful ways to connect with one another and with those in the communities in which we live and work. Our 2021 holiday e-card reflects this sentiment, highlighting the Venable Foundation’s recent impact grants targeting education. In November, the foundation awarded impact grants totaling $500,000 that benefited nine organizations in the firm’s respective communities, including Baltimore, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, and Washington, DC. These organizations are providing enhanced services for school-aged youth that aim to bring students up to grade-level proficiency through intensive tutoring and family engagement.”

7. [Wolf Greenfield](https://info.wolfgreenfield.com/happy-holidays-from-wolf-greenfield-2021): Yet another quality submission from the perennial winner of our holiday card contest. From the nominator: “IT’S TIME TO INITIATE HOLIDAY MODE! ‘Teletransport’ into the Wolf Greenfield snow globe with us. We loved the magical and immersive world of animation so much last year that we decided to utilize that medium again for 2021. (Besides, 2021 felt like an extension of 2020 anyway, so it only felt right.) While the medium is the same, the entire look and feel of the card is vastly different – almost opposite! We left the quaint mountain town from 2020 because we’re dreaming of a futuristic holiday…and the future looks both fascinating and familiar! It’s funny how dreams of the future can bring with them a feeling of nostalgia. Modes of transportation may change – like flying vehicles, jet packs, and even teleportation – but they still get us to our favorite places and people. Because nothing beats a long-awaited hug from family and friends! We hope this year you engage in your own version of HOLIDAY MODE whether that means seeing your loved ones, giving back to others, or simply snacking on a festive treat (cookies remind us of George Greenfield to whom this card is dedicated).”

Now it’s time for our audience to vote. We’ll keep the polls open through FRIDAY, DECEMBER 31, 2021, at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time). This gives you ample time to campaign for your pick over the holidays (but please, please, please don’t cheat).
