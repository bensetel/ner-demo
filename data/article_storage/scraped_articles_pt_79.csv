# Big Player In Smaller Market Joins The Raise Train -- With A Catch
## Where are those bonuses?

As this raise season has played out — at times interminably slowly — associates have reached out to us to air their anxieties over their missing raises. As one might expect, everyone thought they worked for the only firm or in the only market in the whole country that hadn’t announced raises. This was, of course, not true at all, but waiting on money can make a person do some crazy things. Just ask any loan shark.

One of the most popular “when are you going to shame them because they’re the only holdouts?” themes focused on the Atlanta market, where the cadre of major local players simply hadn’t moved, even though this raise was, theoretically, a mere cost of living adjustment. Firms had no trouble providing raises — even if they didn’t fully embrace the scale — two years ago.

Today, Alston & Bird announced their raises. But the raises don’t apply equally across the country. Details are still coming in, but if their raise is anything like their 2016 raise — and we suspect it’s everything like that raise — then the $190K scale will only apply in New York, Washington, Los Angeles, Silicon Valley, and — bizarrely — Dallas. Meanwhile, Atlanta, Charlotte, and the NC Research Triangle will rest along a different pay scale and one that is no doubt compressed at senior levels.

UPDATE: We’ve received a copy of the Charlotte scale —



We’ve heard some tales of light compression at senior levels in the major markets as well — basically seniors logging in $5K off of market for their level.

But at least everyone’s getting a raise.

What everyone’s not getting is a summer bonus. In the firm’s announcement, Alston’s Professional Personnel Partner [Liz Price](https://www.alston.com/en/professionals/p/price-elizabeth-a) acknowledged the existence of summer bonuses and dismissed them by noting that the firm’s end-of-year bonus regime:

provides us with the discretion to award bonuses greater than those that are awarded at the top of the market…

Associates writing into Above the Law have a dimmer view of that prospect, noting that in practice the policy is less about exceeding the market and more about justifying higher bonuses in other markets. Which isn’t necessarily a bad thing — certain markets should be paid more for cost of living reasons — but to deny a market bonus going into recruiting season based on a vague promise seems unwise.

UPDATE: Some Alston associates from the bigger markets have written in to assure their colleagues in smaller markets that they aren’t getting market bonuses either! According to these tipsters, beyond the first couple of years, Alston associates make a fraction of the standard Biglaw bonus and that the targets they have to meet to reach the above market bonus hinted at in this memo are unattainable.

So a muted congratulations to Alston & Bird associates across the country.

## Much of Biglaw has overshot the needs of, and therefore become overpriced for, many -- but not all -- of its clients.

As someone who’s served as a legal CTO for almost 10 years now, I’ve seen a lot of legal technology come and go; some of it phenomenally useful, some of it not worth its cost of adoption or implementation. Legal tech is a great industry with lots of great advancements, but also a lot of Rube Goldberg machines. It takes some hands-on experience to know the difference.

One thing I’ve noticed over the years is the tendency for many law firms, especially Biglaw, to hope that technology — either its actual use, or (more often) a PR campaign pretending that it’s being used — will distract clients from deeper and more fundamental problems with the firm’s business model.

I divide the types of innovation in law, including technology, into two broad categories: additive innovation and subtractive innovation.

The first means trying to do more with more. In other words, hoping that some magical tool or new process can just be layered onto the existing model and solve your problems. Buy that shiny new software, and hopefully it’ll save your lawyers some time, and clients will be happy with the added value.

The latter means doing more with less. This is harder to implement, obviously, because it means making cuts. It means assessing all the costs of a law firm’s business model, and honestly asking yourself: is X or Y really needed to do what clients are really paying me to do?

Additive “innovation” lends itself to much sexier PR. But in my experience operating within the growing ecosystem of elite lean boutique law firms, subtractive innovation more often produces the results that clients actually want: materially lower rates without lower quality.

Fundamentally for a lot of clients complaining about the legal industry, “the rates are too damn high.” If your magical software that shaves off maybe 3–5% of billable time, while sometimes adding inflexibility into your processes, isn’t moving the needle on that problem, you’ve achieved very little.

If the real problem is simply that the rates are too damn high, the obvious next question is why, in fact, are they so high? The percentage of the rate actually paid to the lawyer doing the work is often a small fraction of the overall price. There are a number of possible responses to this question.

First, too high for whom? Very expensive large firms serve a variety of diverse clients. Not all of those clients complain the same about the rates. It is very possible — in fact, this is my opinion on the matter — that much of Biglaw has overshot the needs of, and therefore become overpriced for, many but not all of its clients.

Speaking only for the clients that really, truly think the rates are too damn high, the most material reasons that come to mind are:

- extremely expensive offices designed to signal “Ferrari tier” branding;
- too many disjointed practices under one roof that make it impossible to optimize for efficiency on a narrower, more aligned “menu” of practices; and – time to really bring some of the spice…
- equity partners with extremely high profits per partner expectations that, while almost certainly brilliant and extremely hard working, simply aren’t needed to deliver the services that non-Ferrari clients actually want.
The subtractive innovation of newer, leaner law firm models executes on the above reality. Clients aren’t that impressed if you take a $1,000-per-hour lawyer and adopt some shiny software to shave 3% of their time. Take that same lawyer, and make their rate $550 or $600, without changing her compensation, and now you’ll have their attention.

Technology absolutely plays a role in this new kind of legal innovation, but that role is much more in the background. It’s not about asking lawyers to automate everything imaginable, even when clients often prefer flexibility. It’s also not about forcing all lawyers to work with a project manager, assistant project manager, billing specialist, alternative billing coordinator, and God knows who else 24/7.

All my love and respect to the software vendors and new nonlawyer legal professionals helping the $1,000- to $2,000-per-hour lawyers try to make their rates more palatable to clients. You are fighting a good fight.

But some of us have a different take on the matter. The real issue for many clients is, very simply, the rates are too damn high. Subtractive innovation is how we can lower them, without lowering the compensation of the lawyers actually delivering the goods on a day-to-day basis.

I say all of this not to poo-poo those trying to make Biglaw more efficient, including with new technology. Rather, sometimes there’s value in “zooming out” and looking at the bigger picture. Entrepreneurial lawyers today have a wide open field to try new business models for profitably delivering the services that even many high-end clients demand. As they explore those models, they should keep in mind that asking “What can I buy?” is often the wrong question. Sometimes the right question is: “What can I cut?”

The legal landscape may be [“blah” as we head into 2018](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/2018-looks-like-another-year-of-blah-for-the-legal-industry/), but that doesn’t mean there’s no good news. While the majority of the industry is seeing flat demand overall, it seems there is a bright spot of expansion in Boston with several Biglaw shops setting up or expanding their operations in the city.

Quinn Emanuel has decided to open up an office in Boston. The firm sees a unique opening for their litigation-only business model. As reported [by Big Law Business](http://biglawbusiness.com/quinn-emanuel-sets-up-shop-in-boston/), firm leaders John Quinn and William Urquhart believe the lack of conflicts from transactional side work will be a benefit for their Boston office:

“We have been looking at Boston for a long time,” Managing Partner John B. Quinn said in a Dec. 26 statement emailed to Bloomberg Law. “We are convinced there is a market for a top tier litigation-only firm that is relatively free of the conflicts which full service firms have. Boston is also a high-tech hotbed,” Quinn said

“It is a well-known fact that almost all the big, full service firms that are among the AmLaw 100 will not bring suit against the money center banks because doing so would endanger their transactional business, which is the life blood of most of these firms,” William Urquhart, managing partner, told Bloomberg Law Dec. 27, in an email.

“We are one of a very few law firms which will do that and it is not at an informational or resource handicap as with the big transactional firms,” Urquhart said.

“Our firm has recovered literally tens of billions for our clients as a result of trial judgments and settlements from the big banks,” Urquhart said.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

Kirkland & Ellis is also[ making moves](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2017/12/28/kirkland-quinn-emanuel-beef-up-in-boston/) in Beantown. The firm opened an office in Boston earlier this year and just hired Michael Sartor, a private equity partner from McDermott Will & Emery, for that office. In October, K&E also picked up another private equity partner for the Boston office, grabbing [Jason Serlenga](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=12349), formerly of Ropes & Gray.

DLA Piper also made a big move in Boston, adding former private equity practice group chair from Nutter McClennen & Fish, Adam Ghander, as part of the firm’s expansion plans. As [Law.com reports](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2017/12/11/dla-piper-nabs-nutter-practice-leader-in-boston/), DLA’s Boston office has more than doubled in size since it opened in 2003:

DLA Piper’s Boston base officially opened in January 2003 when predecessor firm Piper Rudnick absorbed a group of 33 lawyers from Hill & Barlow, one of the city’s oldest law firms that dissolved in December 2002. DLA Piper’s Boston office now boasts a 76-lawyer team, which ironically enough will be the smallest firm office that Ghander has worked in, he joked.

Hogan Lovells has a new presence in Boston too. [In October](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2017/06/15/hogan-lovells-heads-to-boston-after-local-merger/), they absorbed a litigation boutique, Collora, in an effort in increase their life science practice. Hogan Lovells CEO Steve Immelt also notes the benefits HoLove will reap in having a Boston base:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“The Boston region is a key strategic market in the United States.  Although we have worked closely with clients in the area for years, it more recently became clear to us that there was a need for an office that had strong roots in the community,” said Hogan Lovells CEO Steve Immelt. “Collora is a firm that shares our values, our culture and our approach. We have worked with them for many clients over the years. It has highly regarded practices in litigation and investigations, with a particular focus in life sciences, which fits very well with our own practices. We also intend to focus on the financial services, technology industries and education sectors, where we already have strong practices in other markets. We are delighted to welcome the Collora team and look forward to working with them for the benefit of our clients.”

Womble Carlyle Sandridge & Rice became [Womble Bond Dickinson](http://www.dailyreportonline.com/id=1202788256096) following a merger with Bond Dickinson and opened a Boston office this fall. As part of that expansion, they also added three intellectual property partners to the new office — Danielle Herritt, Deborah Vernon, and Cristin Cowles, formerly of McCarter & English. The[ firm noted ](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2017/10/02/new-boston-base-of-womble-welcomes-three-new-hires/)client needs as a motivating factor in the growth:

“It basically comes down to clients [and] each of our offices has been opened in response to client needs,” said Sarah Keefe, who relocated from Raleigh to become managing partner of Womble’s Boston office.

We’ve gotten used to somewhat grim reports on the state of the legal profession, so it’s nice to see this Bostonian bright spot on the horizon.

Lee Casey and David Rivkin

Two partners at BakerHostetler, [David Rivkin](https://www.bakerlaw.com/DavidBRivkinJr) and [Lee Casey](https://www.bakerlaw.com/leeacasey) — who’ve both previously worked for Republican administrations, recently took to the [pages of the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/begging-your-pardon-mr-president-1509302308) to offer President Donald Trump some unsolicited — and awful — advice. They argue that the investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller is partisan, and therefore the president should issue widespread and blanket pardons for anyone that may be implicated by the investigation.

Mr. Trump can end this madness by immediately issuing a blanket presidential pardon to anyone involved in supposed collusion with Russia or Russians during the 2016 presidential campaign, to anyone involved with Russian acquisition of an American uranium company during the Obama administration, and to anyone for any offense that has been investigated by Mr. Mueller’s office. Political weaponization of criminal law should give way to a politically accountable democratic process. Nefarious Russian activities, including possible interference in U.S. elections, can and should be investigated by Congress.

That’s not even something Richard Nixon would say.

And if the president wants to avoid even the possibility of wearing orange — a reference to prison jumpsuits, not to the presidential complexion — the good (?) news is they assert such a pardon would a cover Trump as well:

The president himself would be covered by the blanket pardon we recommend, but the pardon power does not extend to impeachment. If Congress finds evidence that he was somehow involved in collusion with Russia, the House can determine whether to begin impeachment proceedings. Congress also is better equipped, as part of its oversight role, to determine whether and how the FBI, Justice Department and intelligence agencies might have been involved in the whole affair, including possible misuse of surveillance and mishandling of criminal investigations.

An unpopular and divisive president using pardons in a questionable overreach of powers? I’m sure that ends well and there is nothing at all that can possibly go wrong.

Surprisingly, John Yoo — you [remember him](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/john-yoo/), the George W. Bush attorney that authored the “torture memos” — agrees that while likely constitutional, such [pardons would be a bridge too far](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/opinion/trump-pardon-manafort.html), motivating Congress towards impeachment. And even Rivkin and Casey acknowledge there isn’t much the president could do about that. (It should be noted Yoo does say Trump can always fire Mueller, which [plenty](http://www.newsweek.com/trump-impeachment-fire-mueller-republicans-696675) of [other](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/30/trump-would-be-impeached-if-he-tried-fire-mueller-former-prosecutor.html) [experts](http://thehill.com/homenews/news/357979-bharara-if-trump-fires-mueller-he-should-be-impeached) say could also spark impeachment wild fire.)

Unless, of course, Trump has a secret “impeachment wish.”

# The Mystery Of In-House Titles
## Titles alone aren’t helpful. If you want to know more about a person’s role or a particular job opening, you will need to do a little digging.

When I first entered private practice, I understood there were essentially two titles in law firms: associate and partner (or shareholder). I was clearly one, and the goal was to get to the other.

As I grew in my experience, I also began to see other titles like senior associate, equity partner, and variations on counsel: of counsel and special counsel, for instance. What was interesting was how the term counsel was elusive and could mean different things at different firms, although it usually meant that you were not on the partner track.

Even more mystical are titles of in-house counsel. I didn’t pay that much attention to in-house titles when I was a young law firm lawyer. To me, all in-house counsel was either my client or a prospective client, and I operated as such. But now that I am on this side of the house, I have to admit that the titles although more familiar to my ear, are still a mystery.

A large part of the reason why titles are confusing to me is because what the titles actually mean can vary across companies, depending on size, geography, industry and company culture. Contrary to presumption, you can’t always tell hierarchy or decision-making authority or level of influence from titles alone.

You may wonder why we pay attention to titles at all. If you are outside counsel, you may want to rely on title as a context clue as to whether someone in-house has hiring authority or the ability to give you business. If you are already in-house counsel, a common use case is when you are approached about a new opportunity or when you may be actively looking to make a move to another role. You may want to rely on title as a context clue as to the level of influence of the role, such as whether it is a leadership role.

Here are some titles and what they could mean.

Chief Legal Officer: this term is the least ambiguous and references the top executive or leader in a legal department. Other terms for this role could also be chief counsel, head of legal, and general counsel. If a company is large enough, there could be separate general counsels who lead specific segments of the company.

Deputy General Counsel: this term is often used to refer to a second-in-command or the next line beneath the top executive in a legal department. Essentially they are “deputized” to act as general counsel as the GC may need.  Other terms used may be vice president of legal, associate general counsel, or assistant general counsel. Sometimes they are simply second-in-command and are general practitioners because they are responsible for a number of different legal areas. Other times they may only be responsible for one subject matter area such as labor and employment. I have also seen associate and assistant general counsel titles be used to connote “lower tiers” in the leadership hierarchy.

Senior Counsel: I’ve seen this term used to describe an in-house lawyer with a lot of experience or tenure. They may (or may not) manage other lawyers.

Managing counsel is also a generic term. This happens to be my title where I work, and although I don’t have any direct reports, I’ve seen this title at another company, and their managing counsel does supervise others.

The takeaway here is that titles alone aren’t helpful. And operating on presumption alone is ill-advised. If you want to know more about a person’s role or a particular job opening, you will need to dig deeper and develop a relationship so you can ask (if not that person, then someone else who knows).

# What Is The Owner Of A Law Firm?
## If you are spending a lot of time complaining but little time doing anything to address whatever it is you are complaining about, you really aren’t thinking as an owner.

The best employees are never employees. They are owners from the moment they start their jobs to the moment they retire.

Owners don’t need to be told what their job is as they know their job is to do whatever is meet and proper to do to grow the law firm and help it succeed.

Owners aren’t above menial tasks that they think others below them should do.  Whether a first-year associate or a senior partner, if something needs to get done, they do it.

Owners help everyone around them succeed in their careers. Of course they hope for help back, but that isn’t how they are thinking because they get joy and fulfillment from seeing those around them thrive and succeed. And they know as an owner of the firm that the others thriving will help the firm succeed.

Owners are accountable for results on their first day at work. They know that the heart of their job is pleasing the client and even if they don’t know how to do it at first, they know that one way or another an owner makes the client happy or gets it to happen somehow.

Owners that contribute greatly to the firm’s success expect to be rewarded for those contributions — of course, as they are not idiots. However, they are respectful — and even over-respectful — to the contributions of others and realize that it can never be “all about me.” This for the simple reason that “me” is not a law firm. A law firm is at heart a team.

Owners know that their job description is a combination of performing excellent legal work for clients and at the same time building the culture of the firm they work in. Even on day one of work, they know that at its heart, a law firm is a bunch of lawyers who are together just because they want to be together, and if they don’t want to be together then they leave and the game is over. For this reason, owners realize that part of the job is doing their best to make the work environment as positive for their colleagues as possible.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Owners see their partners and colleagues as humans and cut them a break when they need it. They know everyone has those stressed-out, rough days and they don’t hold grudges. Instead, they move onward and upward, recognizing that they themselves aren’t perfect every day.

Owners look for good in their colleagues and clients, as opposed to dwelling up on their flaws.

……

So as we consider the law firm of the future, it is clear that as much as possible that law firms must attract and retain owners.

You may think this is firm management’s job — and it is — however, if you are reading this, it is your job too if you hope to have a successful and impactful career.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
If you are spending a lot of time complaining but little time doing anything to address whatever it is you are complaining about, you really aren’t thinking as an owner.

To conclude, the law firm of the future should, in my view, focus on creating as much as possible true owners of the business.  However, this focus is not solely for management — it is for everyone in the firm from the top to the bottom.

# Biglaw Firm Moves Into 2018 With $190K Scale Announcement
## In more ways than one...

Back in 2016, when Biglaw firms began the drive to a $180K payscale, one firm came out and tried to [get their associates to look away from the compensation frenzy and just be happy that they have jobs at all](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/one-firm-decides-to-pump-the-brakes-on-this-whole-raise-thing/). They [ultimately caved to market pressure](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/holdout-firm-flip-flops-on-salary/) that year, but managed to avoid joining its Am Law peers in raising salaries in 2018.

Well, as the legal landscape shifts to $205K, Seyfarth Shaw is adopting a scale that looks a lot more like the 2018 norm.

Seyfarth Shaw is 63rd in the Am Law 100 with $717,032,000 in 2020 gross revenue, though its rate structure isn’t quite the same as the firms around it on the list, so it’s not entirely unreasonable that it might not go all the way to the prevailing top Biglaw pay structure.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Here’s the multi-tiered scale structure:



Adding to the time warp aspect, it appears that Seyfarth is joining the trend that other Biglaw firms jumped on back in 2016 and unmooring the top scale from New York. Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Washington, and both LA offices are going to be paid the same as the New York associates now.

It’s an interesting development considering this cycle has seen a few firms go the other direction and [embrace office differentiation](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/top-ranked-biglaw-firm-announces-market-raises-but-only-for-associates-in-some-offices/).

# Associate Lateral Moves Increased By Nearly 149% In 2021
## Wow! This is unprecedented.

Lawyers know that the lateral market was hot, hot, HOT in 2021. But how hot was it? Thanks to the National Association for Law Placement (NALP), we finally know, and the numbers are simply mind-blowing.

When the COVID-19 pandemic first took hold in 2020, early hiring pauses led to a 30% decline in lateral movement but last year was absolutely on fire when it came to law firm hiring. According to NALP, lateral hiring was up by 111% in 2021, making it the largest year-over-year increase since the organization first started tracking this information more than two decades ago. In fact, associates saw an incredible boom in lateral hiring, with their moves increasing by almost 149% in 2021. Overall, about 7,700 lawyers made lateral moves last year.

James Leipold, executive director of NALP, had this to say about the wild lateral ride that attorneys experienced last year:

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“The fact that the lateral hiring market was red hot in 2021 does not come as a surprise to anyone working in the industry, but even so it is startling to see these numbers, and it is good to be able to quantify the change in the market that firms have been grappling with this past year. I was surprised to see that the change in lateral associate hiring was so much greater than the change in lateral partner hiring, though both markets were more than brisk, as NALP members working in the trenches trying to fill vacancies know only too well.”

Here are some other key findings from NALP’s Survey on 2021 Lateral Hiring (emphasis added):

The average number of lateral associates hired per office/firm in 2021 was about 11 and the median was 4 compared to an average of approximately 2 and a median of 1 for lateral partner hires. Lateral associate hiring accounted for 69.2% of lateral hiring in 2021 and lateral partner hiring accounted for 14.7%. Other lateral hiring comprised 16.1% of lateral hiring.

While overall lateral hiring was up across the board, offices in firms of 251-500 lawyers experienced the largest increase in lateral hiring (137.9%), and offices in firms of 250 or fewer lawyers had the smallest increase (79.3%).

On a regional basis, the level of lateral hiring per office was highest in the Northeast, with a median of 10 and an average of 18 lateral hires in 2021. In terms of aggregate volume change, volume was also up the most in the Northeast region (177.5%).

So, how are things looking for laterals this year? “Lateral lawyer hiring at this level is likely unsustainable over time, and I expect the lateral market to cool a bit in 2022, or at least level off,” Leipold noted, “but for now it remains a volatile and fast-moving market. Coupled with rising associate salaries, it’s a bit of a battlefield out there for mid-level associate talent right now.”

In fact, he says this sort of thing happens “daily in private law firms.” [[POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/17/greg-craigs-manafort-trial-1331697)] * In case you missed it, on Friday afternoon, the American Bar Association adopted a controversial new bar-pass accreditation standard that requires at least 75 percent of a law school’s students to pass the bar within two years of graduation. How many law schools are going to close thanks to this new rule? [[Law.com](https://www.law.com/2019/05/17/aba-toughens-bar-pass-standard-for-law-schools/)] * Stormy Daniels has reached a settlement with Michael Cohen in a suit that was filed by her former attorney Michael Avenatti over Donald Trump’s affair hush money, saying she’s “ready to move on and put these cases behind her.” [[Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-stormy-daniels-cohen-avenatti-davidson-20190517-story.html)] * Is the billable hour what’s driving all of the mental health and burnout issues that lawyers are facing?

# Biglaw Firm Announces Raises For Anxiously Waiting Associates
## How quickly will the rest of the market follow?

[Fresh off of getting some flack](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/firms-good-deed-couldnt-bee-a-worse-metaphor/) for not jumping on the Biglaw raises bandwagon fast enough, Fenwick & West has announced raises for its hardworking associates.

The firm, which made $543,079,000 in gross revenue in 2020 making it 72nd on the Am Law 100, announce the compensation change today, after [Milbank raised associate salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/) last month. But despite the antsy associates, the firm is actually on the early side of matches. [Over a month](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/time-to-pay-up-these-am-law-top-50-firms-havent-announced-raises-yet/) after the first raises, the [bulk of the market has still not matched](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-raise-tracker-2022/).

But the wait is over for Fenwick associates! The new salary scale — for attorneys in good standing and on track to bill 1,950 hours — is as follows:



These raises will be retroactive to January 1 — the same [effective date as the Milbank bump](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/) — and counsel compensation will be individualized. You can read the full memo [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/fenwick-raises-22/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

# Another Biglaw Firm Institutes A 'Reduction In Force,' Laying Off Attorneys And Staff
## 2022 was not the firm's best year.

Seems like every [Biglaw prognosticator](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/sorry-but-the-biglaw-layoffs-arent-quite-over-yet/) is busy throwing up warnings over how the anticipated economic decline is going to impact the legal industry. And with good reason — we’ve already heard associate layoff news from[ Cooley LLP](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/cooley-layoffs-2022/) and [Goodwin](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/am-law-20-firm-begins-layoffs/) and [Shearman](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/shearman-sterling-associate-layoffs/) and [Gunderson](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/biglaw-firm-makes-2-rounds-stealth-layoffs-billable-work-disappears-gunderson/) and[ Kirkland](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/stealth-layoffs-arrive-at-worlds-richest-biglaw-firm/).

Now another Biglaw firm joins the layoff ranks. Procopio, a firm that made $128,919,000 in 2021 gross revenue, making it 194th on the Am Law 200, recently announced a “reduction in force,” letting go both attorneys and staff as part of the cost-cutting measure.

As the firm revealed in an internal email:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Consistent with many of our peer firms, 2022 was not Procopio’s best year. Most experts see “economic headwinds” during 2023. Management has been looking at cost-cutting measures and is in the process of implementing accounts receivable and practice management policies mandating best practices at all levels in the firm, starting at the top with the partners. You hear more about this in the near future.

Over the last couple of days we let go several attorneys and staff as part of a Reduction in Force. This was an especially difficult decision because it impacts our friends and colleagues. We’ve asked our Human Resources team to do everything they can to ease the transition process. We are grateful for their contributions to the firm.

You can read the firm’s full email announcing the cuts below.

If your firm or organization is reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

His latest attempt at making a pen pal involved writing 51 law firms to warn them that he thinks hiring diverse attorneys violates the Supreme Court's college admissions opinion. [[Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/1700941)] * Senate panel poised to pass Supreme Court ethics package that will die on the vine after this. [[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/senate-panel-set-vote-us-supreme-court-ethics-reform-2023-07-20/)] * Government unveils new merger guidelines to replace the old guidelines that encouraged bigger and bigger mergers.

[[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/19/business/ftc-justice-dept-mergers-antitrust.html)] * A profile of retired Judge David Tatel as he heads to Hogan Lovells to work on pro bono matters.

# Am Law 100 Firm Makes Second Round Of COVID-19 Austerity Measures, Slashing Salaries
## Furloughs were not enough at this firm.

[Life comes at you fast. ](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/life-comes-at-you-fast)And if you thought that was true in ordinary times, that’s been supercharged in a COVID-19 world. Just a few weeks ago, Am Law 100 firm Sheppard Mullin (ranked 54th on[ the most recent Am Law 100](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/04/21/the-2020-am-law-100-ranked-by-gross-revenue/#)) [announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-furloughs-staff-no-other-cost-cutting-measures-for-now/?rf=1) they were furloughing a small number of staff members. Now the firm has made what is hopefully the last austerity measure they’ll need during the global pandemic, salary cuts.

In a statement from the firm ([available in full on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/sheppard-mullin-cuts/2/)), Sheppard Mullin Chair Guy Halgren had this to say about the most recent cost-cutting measures:

“The adjustments we are making today are fair and equitable and will help secure our strength through this challenging time. We reiterate our intent to not RIF or furlough our associates, special counsel and staff attorneys; not RIF or further furlough our staff; and commit that the partners will shoulder a meaningfully larger percentage compensation reduction than associates, special counsel, staff attorneys and staff.”

So what is going on at the firm? First are foremost, they’re furloughing an additional 17 staff members [(in addition to the 33 previously furloughed](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-furloughs-staff-no-other-cost-cutting-measures-for-now/?rf=1)). Plus there are salary cuts, because, of course there are salary cuts. Here’re the deets:

The salaries of associates, special counsel and staff attorneys will be reduced by 12% through the end of the calendar year. Given that the reduction is for two-thirds of the year, that calculates to an annualized reduction of 8%. The firm will conduct a special look-back at the end of the Measuring Year to recognize busy associates. The 2020 associate bonus program will more take into account non-billable activities and will include more focus on the discretionary component. Promotions in class at the end of 2020 will take into account that not all associates could effectively Work From Home.

Staff members making between $70,000 and $90,000 will have their salaries reduced by 5%/3.33% annualized (not to be reduced below $70,000) and those making more than $90,000, by 10%/6.67% annualized, through the end of the calendar year. We are not decreasing the salaries of any staff members making less than $70,000.

The firm will also institute a Workshare program for staff members without a full-time load of work available. This will allow the firm to cut the hours/compensation of those staff members by 20 percent (those employees would also be eligible for unemployment and other federal benefits).

Partners are also having their salary cut. Though there aren’t specific percentages provided, the firm says the partner cuts will be at a “meaningfully greater percentage.”

# Biglaw Raises Keep On Coming
## Welcome to August... we're still hearing about raises.

It’s August and we’re still hearing about Biglaw raises. This time it’s Foley & Lardner, who apparently made the move to paying its first-year associates $190K.

Foley, who clocks in at 54th on Am Law’s gross revenue tally, informed young associates in major markets that they’ll be moving up to the Milbank/Cravath pay scale. Unfortunately, we’re not quite clear on what happens to the elder associates. There’s no firmwide memo out there, so we only know about this raise based on individualized memos we’ve heard about.

Still, it must be a relief for Foley & Lardner associates who’ve been waiting nervously after seeing [Foley Hoag hand out raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/law-firm-raises-salaries-for-young-associates-senior-associates-left-to-wonder/) forcing the firm to keep up with the Foleys.

# Apologize, Or You’ll Be Sorry
## The legal industry’s allergy to apologizing is damaging us all professionally and personally.

In 1995, Georgetown Professor Deborah Tannen wrote about an experience with an attorney that still scans as frighteningly plausible today. Tannen [reported](https://hbr.org/1995/09/the-power-of-talk-who-gets-heard-and-why) in Harvard Business Review, “I observed with some amazement an encounter among several lawyers engaged in a negotiation over a speakerphone. At one point, the lawyer in whose office I was sitting accidentally elbowed the telephone and cut off the call. When his secretary got the parties back on again, I expected him to say what I would have said: ‘Sorry about that. I knocked the phone with my elbow.’ Instead, he said, ‘Hey, what happened? One minute you were there; the next minute you were gone!’”

How many of us can instantly picture someone we work with pulling this kind of two-bit stunt?! I fear it’s far too many. I’ve discussed in this space before how bad lawyers traditionally are at [admitting when they’re wrong](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/getting-it-right-when-we-get-it-wrong/). I’d argue we’re even worse when it comes to actually apologizing for our errors and bad behavior.

The Sorry State

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The practice of law isn’t exactly structured to teach us to give apologies to those we’ve wronged. Quite the opposite, actually. Many of us spend most of our time locked in adversarial situations, advocating on behalf of others. Whether we’re negotiating deals across a table or arguing cases across a courtroom, we often find ourselves wanting to project power and authority, or at the very least unimpeachable competence and dogged pursuit of our clients’ goals. The conventional wisdom many of us are taught or absorb is that apologies negate that professional image we try to cultivate when heading out into the world to do our jobs.

Apologies are implicitly a recognition that both the giver and receiver are subject to an equal playing field, governed by rules and norms that are larger than the specific circumstances we find ourselves in. By apologizing, we’re acknowledging that we did something wrong and that we owe some social debt or obligation to the recipient of the apology. Admitting that can seem, to some of us, unacceptable when engaging in legal battles where every inch of metaphorical battleground counts. Why show a sign of weakness to opposing counsel, who might use that weakness to our client’s disadvantage?

The problem with this philosophy is that apologies exist for a reason. They’re a necessary social construct, a way of acknowledging and making amends when we’ve damaged our relationship with someone. Thousands of years of cultural development have given us a bounty of ways to apologize and repair the wrongs we’ve committed. When we convince ourselves that apologies are an unacceptable sign of weakness, we’ve taken an important tool out of our toolkits. Chefs don’t cook food without salt. Painters don’t work without brushes. Why should attorneys, who are fundamentally communicators, leave one of our most important tools unused?

The mindset that apologizing is a sign of weakness is deeply toxic to its adherents, both personally and professionally. On the professional side, refusing to acknowledge wrongs done damages our standing in our communities and often makes our work more difficult. I could probably list 10 opposing counsel off the top of my head that I dislike working with because I know they’ll abuse my team without even a hope of apology. My cases against those attorneys are uniformly less pleasant, more time-intensive, and less efficient for everyone involved, whether client, attorney, courthouse personnel, or professional staff. It’s bad for everyone’s sanity, bad for clients’ bottom lines, and bad for the practice.

Not Just Wrong, But Harmful

The basic premise is also, to some extent, bull. Refusing to acknowledge that you’re wrong doesn’t make you strong or tough. It makes you unreflective, crass, and probably less effective than you could otherwise be. Anyone who’s studied negotiation in depth for any amount of time will tell you that brute-force dominance is rarely a winning negotiation strategy. Finesse, rapport, and finding unexpected common ground are usually far more effective, and apologizing for wrongs done can actually be an asset to those strategies, rather than a detriment.

The anti-apology mindset also unfairly undercuts those attorneys who don’t subscribe to it. Some attorneys aren’t afraid to recognize the wrongs they do and take care of others around them by apologizing. In work environments where apologizing is seen as weakness, these attorneys can be looked down upon or dismissed, consciously or not.

Bringing It Home

We also should remember that, as Kurt Vonnegut said, we are what we pretend to be. When we adopt an all-offense, no-apologies mindset for our work against other attorneys, that mindset tends to bleed into our nonprofessional lives. No one should treat their spouse, children, or loved ones the way they treat opposing counsel, but maintaining a firm divide between those worlds is tricky at best. If we spend 2,000 hours a year at work treating apologies as a sign of weakness, why would we be surprised if we continued doing that during our off hours? If you ask [Malcolm Gladwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)), by our fifth year we’ve basically trained ourselves into experts at disregarding the wrongs we do to others. If we spend our days being bullies, we’ll probably spend our nights as bullies, too.

Pushing back or emphatically making a point can be part of practicing law, and unless something fundamental changes about the human psyche, learning to deploy an apology from time to time is going to be a skill every attorney needs to learn. That’s still no excuse for being a jerk. Our business is one of communication and relationships. If we can’t allow ourselves to take care of one another, to acknowledge our mutual humanity and apologize when we hurt someone else, we’re making ourselves worse attorneys and worse people. That’s simply not an acceptable outcome.

Our profession stinks at apologizing. Recognizing that apologies are a sign of compassion, and not weakness, is a good first step.

Congratulations to the three lawyers who will join the partnership of [Willkie Farr & Gallagher](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/willkie-farr-gallagher-llp/), effective January 1:

- [Elliot J. Gluck](http://www.willkie.com/professionals/g/gluck-elliot-j): Currently counsel in the Asset Management Group, Gluck is based in New York. He graduated from Yeshiva University (1999) and Fordham Law (2004).
- [Jennifer Hardy](http://www.willkie.com/professionals/h/hardy-jennifer): An associate in the Business Reorganization and Restructuring Department, Hardy works out of Houston. She’s a graduate of UT (2003) and NYU Law (2007).
- [Carly Glover Saviano](http://www.willkie.com/professionals/s/saviano-carly-glover): Saviano is an associate in Willkie’s real estate practice. She is based in New York and graduated from Lafayette College (2002) and UVA Law (2007).
We’ve been paying attention to the diversity of new partner classes at top firms, and we commend Willkie for the strong representation of women in this trio. It’s a marked contrast from the partner classes of [2016](http://www.willkie.com/news/2016/01/firm-announces-new-partners-and-counsel) (one woman in a class of five), [2015](http://www.willkie.com/news/2015/01/firm-announces-new-partners-and-counsel) (zero women in a class of nine), and [2014](http://www.willkie.com/news/2014/01/willkie-announces-new-partners-and-counsel) (one woman in a class of eight).

And in news that should surprise absolutely no one, Willkie matched the [Cravath bonus scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2016-associate-bonuses/) this morning. Bonuses will be paid on December 21 — a Wednesday, but “consistent with our customary practices,” per the memo from the Executive Committee.

“We are all working very, very hard,” said a source, “but everyone is happy with flat bonuses given the bump in base salaries.”

When your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. You can also text us if you prefer, at 646-820-8477.

If you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

# Corporate vs. Litigation: Which Associates Are Happier?
## The kind of law you practice makes a big difference on your perspective, according to this ATL survey.

Earlier this year, we surveyed more than 500 associates to get their perspectives on life in the “New Normal.” The results, which are available in this [free report](https://470182.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/470182/ATL_Associate-Perspectives-New-Normal_2022Report.pdf), were revealing in many ways. One aspect that stood out is the differences between practice areas. 

Corporate lawyers had some of the highest job satisfaction ratings of all practice groups. The contrast is especially sharp compared to responses from litigation associates. Corporate associates are happier with virtually every aspect of their jobs — e.g., caliber of work, interactions with partners, compensation, career trajectory — except work-life balance. “There is no end to the work,” in the words of one respondent.



Meanwhile, many of the lowest ratings came from litigators, for areas including firm leadership, firm communication, and work environment. Litigators also reported experiencing to a higher degree feelings of isolation, lack of structure, and a sense that their colleagues are unhappy. Many are convinced that management doesn’t care about their well-being, whereas corporate associates are more likely to believe that management is actively trying to address associate concerns.


Litigators were the least positive about their firms’ handling of the pandemic. Less than half of litigation respondents said their firm handled it “pretty well” or “excellently,” and one in five said “horribly” or “not very well.”



These feelings of (dis)satisfaction also seem to shape associates’ career expectations. While one in three corporate respondents sees partnership in their future, just one in five litigators do. 



Litigation associates are more likely to have an eye on the door. Almost 30 percent plan to leave their firms within the year and another 23 percent expect to leave within two years. The primary reasons include unfulfilling work, dislike of the firm culture and/or management, disconnection from colleagues, and the opportunity to make more money elsewhere. 

While these are also factors for some corporate associates, by far the most common driver for corporate associates planning to leave their firms is a desire for better work-life balance, cited by almost 80 percent of respondents.


For more on the corporate vs. litigation divide, as well as other insights into associates’ experiences, [download your free report](https://470182.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/470182/ATL_Associate-Perspectives-New-Normal_2022Report.pdf) today.

# These Biglaw Partners Are Super Pissed Someone Filed A Class Action Lawsuit On Their Behalf
## These partners may have a point, but some of their language is dangerous.

[Remember Kerrie Campbell](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/biglaw-firm-hit-with-100-million-class-action-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/?rf=1)? The former Chadbourne & Parke partner made headlines last month for filing a $100 million class action against the Biglaw firm alleging the all-male management committee chronically underpaid female partners. Now some of the purported class members, other women in the ranks of Chadbourne partnership, have spoken out about the lawsuit — let’s just say they disagree.

In a [letter](http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/2016_0912_chadbourneletter.pdf) to Campbell’s attorney, David Stanford, 14 women partners have made it clear they do not believe they’ve been discriminated against:

It is somewhat ironic that your firm advertises on its website that it “level[s] the playing field so that your voice is heard,” when you have only listened to the voice of one current female partner – your client – in filing the complaint. By attributing Ms. Campbell’s allegations to a proposed class, you have represented to the outside world that you consider us a part of that class. Your firm filed a class action on behalf of 26 women – each of whom you must have identified prior to filing the purported class action given the precise count of 26, and yet your firm made no effort to speak to any of us before filing the lawsuit. You did not make our voices heard, as you claim, but rather have attempted to silence us for your own purposes.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Fair enough, if these women who’ve worked at the firm disagree with the allegations in the complaint and do not wish to be part of the class action, so be it. And I was going to leave it at that, “hey there seems to be some difference of opinion, maybe discovery will shine some light on the allegations.” But then they wrote this line:

The complaint you crafted makes a group of very accomplished, assertive and intelligent professional women look like they are victims unable to hold their own with their male colleagues.

All right, hold on there. The notion that some women are too smart or strong to be discriminated against is a pretty dangerous one. It subtly — or not-so-subtly — shifts the blame onto women for not being “good” enough to rise above or for “letting” herself be discriminated against. The ability to “hold [your] own” with male colleagues doesn’t insulate someone from discrimination. Would that it were true.

I’m glad these women don’t feel like they’ve been discriminated against, and I wish more women at law firms felt the same way. If these partners don’t think the lawsuit speaks for them, and they want to let that be known, that’s great. However, let’s not suggest gender discrimination can be avoided if only you’re a good enough lawyer.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Maybe there were discriminatory practices at play here, and maybe not. The litigation is in far too early a posture to have a definitive opinion. But attitudes that suggest that smart, successful women cannot be victimized by oppression don’t help anyone.

# Fired Biglaw Partner Suspended From Practice Of Law For Approving Settlements Without, You Know, Asking His Client First
## This is a pretty basic problem.

Partners may have wide latitude to run their practice as they see fit, but one of the fundamental principles of legal representation is, you know, that you are representing the interests of a client. So that means — as a bare minimum — lawyers cannot settle cases without approval from their client first. Yes, even when the client is an insurance company.

Asher Brooks Chancey was fired from his position as a partner in the Philadelphia office of [Am Law 200 firm](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=34934&name=Goldberg-Segalla#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20National%20Law,2020%20Am%20Law%20200%20ranking.) Goldberg Segalla in May 2018. This was after he settled cases he was working on without informing the insurer, Knight Insurance Group, that hired his then firm. Chancey [self-reported the lapse](https://www.law360.com/legalethics/articles/1286921/ex-goldberg-segalla-atty-suspended-for-unapproved-deals) in judgment to ethics regulators in September 2019 and was temporarily suspended at that time. Now, the the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has weighed in with [its final judgment.](https://lawprofessors.typepad.com/legal_profession/2020/06/unauthorized-settlements.html)

Chancey has been suspended, on consent, from the practice of law for three years, retroactive to his temporary suspension in September. In settling on the punishment, the court cited mitigating factors including his self-reporting, lack of other misconduct, remorse, and Chancey’s diagnosis of depression and anxiety.

As [reported by ABA Journal](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/law-firm-partner-suspended-for-approving-settlements-without-telling-insurer-client), Knight Insurance has filed malpractice claims over the conduct:

Chancey is accused of agreeing to settle auto accident cases in amounts ranging from $35,000 to $1.5 million without informing the Knight Insurance Group. He is also accused of failing to tell the insurance group about scheduled arbitration hearings and default judgments, failing to file court documents, failing to respond to discovery requests, and failing to pursue evidence.

Chancey has not commented on his suspension.

### [ The Digital Transformation Journey: Lessons For Lawyers Embracing AI ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-digital-transformation-journey-lessons-for-lawyers-embracing-ai/)
The journey from the days of leather-bound law books to the digital age -- and now toward an AI-driven future -- offers valuable lessons for embracing change.

# Why Georgetown Law Alum Taylor Weaver Is Planting An Urban Energy Garden And Helping Others Pursue Their Passion Projects

“You see you wouldn’t ask why the rose that grew from the concrete had damaged petals / On the contrary, we would all celebrate its tenacity / We would all love its will to reach the sun…” — [Tupac](https://genius.com/2pac-the-rose-that-grew-from-concrete-lyrics)

This week, Taylor Weaver (Georgetown Law ’17) was featured on [Winston & Strawn LLP’s (W&S) career site](https://www.winston.com/en/careers-winston/spotlight-ontaylor-weaver-winston-and-strawn-corporate-associate.html). While W&S has made a financial commitment to Weaver’s non-profit foundation, [Urban Energy Garden](https://uegnow.com/) (UEG), the firm has also provided the resources for Weaver to blossom in his career.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As a young lawyer, Weaver has already been recognized among his colleagues as a budding leader in the M&A and private equity areas. “He’s outstanding. He’s been able to balance the hours dedicated to his non-profit while providing essential support in several billion-dollar transactions such as our recent representations of Icahn Enterprises L.P. and Federal-Mogul LLC,” said W&S Partner Bruce Toth.

Last month, I had the opportunity to catch up with Weaver at a brunch in Chicago where I hosted young up-and-coming attorneys from firms such as Sidley Austin, Kirkland & Ellis, Gordon Rees, and W&S. In the not-so distant past, Weaver and I shared a summer as [law clerks](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/stop-blaming-the-pipeline-for-the-lack-of-diversity-in-the-legal-profession-and-start-investing-in-it/) for a firm in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Even back then, it was apparent Weaver was motivated to be a leader and give back to his community.

Because Weaver played college football for my law school alma mater, Southern Methodist University (SMU), I was familiar with his name even before I had met him. As a novice student-athlete, I’ve always been impressed with those uber-talented people who can both excel in the classroom and on the field — especially law students. Since graduating from Georgetown Law, he has embarked on a Biglaw career and established a non-profit, while helping other colleagues pursue their passion projects. It is no wonder why he has been highlighted as a budding leader within his firm.

Without further ado, here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation:

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Renwei Chung (RC): How did you choose SMU for undergraduate school and then decide to enroll in law school, specifically Georgetown Law?

Taylor Weaver (TW): My speed trainer, Billy “White Shoes” Johnson, knew SMU’s then head coach, June Jones, from their time together in the National Football League. Like many others, Jones had high regards for Coach Shoes, and when Coach Shoes asked Coach Jones to consider me for his 2009 team, Coach Jones didn’t hesitate to offer me the opportunity.

Football was great, but it didn’t last — hence the whole “becoming a lawyer” thing. I didn’t realize that when I agreed to attend SMU, I would have the opportunity to learn from and work with such an incredible teaching faculty. I can’t say that I would have been as successful at Georgetown without the tutelage I received from Elsie Johnson, Keiko Flores, Jim Hollifield, Ling Shiao, Chelsea Brown, Bruce Levy — the list goes on.

As I mentioned in the [GULC Newsletter](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/news/taylor-weaver-l17-from-student-entrepreneur-to-pro-bono-service/), Georgetown was (and will always be) my “dream” law school. The faculty members (primarily the professors) are in a league of their own and our alumni network is top-tier. There’s probably a Hoya in every Vault’s Top 100 or Am Law 200 law firm. Alumni are easy to contact too.

RC: What motivated you to start [Urban Energy Garden](https://uegnow.com/) and what are your plans for UEG going forward?

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
TW: Professor Anthony Cook. While working with Professor Cook, I uncovered research demonstrating that minority college students with science and technology backgrounds were lacking: 1) career opportunities to pursue their passions in environmental sustainability; and 2) the resources to pursue these passions.

When I discussed my research results with Professor Cook, he told me to fix the problem. With the help of Kimberly Chappell, Rauland Sharp, Carla Whitlock, and Junita Turner, UEG offers office, lab and field internships with the U.S. Department of Energy. We also spend $23-$26K on each student depending on their location (includes salary, and living and travel expenses) — so we provide the resources too.

Ideally, we will increase spending for our public sector students to $35K per student. At its capacity, UEG will serve 35 students in the private sector and 40 students in the public sector every year (3-year plan).

Out of the 37 students that applied this year from Stanford, UC Berkeley, University of Michigan and Georgetown, the GPA range was 3.61-4.0. We are already working with companies in the oil & gas, and food & drug industries to expand the program. Our interns have also expressed an interest in working with companies that dominate their specific industry such as AECOM, Tertra Tech, Patagonia, and others.

RC: You mentioned that you recently helped your friend Angela Johnson, litigation counsel at Uber, with the legal process of setting up a non-profit foundation. Can you tell us more about this?

TW: Yes. Angela is remarkable. She mobilized professionals from over 40 organizations (including Uber, Facebook, Google, and Zendesk) to foster community engagement among minority employee resource groups, nonprofits, community members, and small business owners. She united the group around a common desire — to plan educational programs and events that uplift black communities for Black History Month. Her team raised nearly $90,000 and organized 14 events, hosting over 1400 attendees.

Based on the positive feedback and energy from the first year, Angela decided to launch [Coalition of Black Excellence (CBE)](https://www.cbeweek.com/mission) as a nonprofit organization. She reached out to me for guidance on securing 501(c)3 tax-exempt status. As a result of the guidance I provided, I now have the honor of serving as the Legal Director for the organization.

CBE is operated by 32 volunteers with expertise across multiple sectors. [CBEWeek 2019](https://www.cbeweek.com/) will be from February 19-24, and will encompass a two-day summit, networking opportunities, as well as community engagement events. It’s the only conference that unites black professionals and business owners from multiple industries to uplift minority communities.

RC: How would you describe your support system?

TW: God blessed me with the best dad anyone could ask for (hands down the only reason why I’m here), but the black women in my life have been absolutely incredible. These women have opened so many doors for me. Elsie Johnson, Tiffani Darden, Goldie Pritchard, Sheryll Cashin, Donna Daley, Donna Fisher-Lewis, the list goes on. I want them to know that I will always remember them.

Lest I forget to mention, Donna Daley is my executive coach. Donna and I have been working together on the “Taylor Weaver Project” since the beginning of my third year in law school — albeit, she used to give me the student discount. Donna has been an executive coach for over a decade and her clients include executives at EY, Deloitte and of course, Winston & Strawn.

RC: What skillsets would an attorney need to run a successful side business?

TW: Probably the most important skill set is knowing how to fundraise. I’ve seen organizations fail despite strong leadership teams and incredible missions simply because the founders were unable to raise enough capital.

If you can’t fundraise, then someone on your team needs to know how to fundraise. If you don’t have anyone on your team who can fundraise, then find someone or move on to a different project.  (Weaver has been successful at fundraising — raising nearly $133,000 for UEG’s pilot program.)

RC: What advice do you have for incoming law students?

TW: Decide early on the type of professional you want to be. Spend the next three years working on your craft and become an expert at helping people.

# How Dedicated To Diversity Is Your Biglaw Firm? There's A Ranking For That!

Biglaw firms across the country are implementing all manner of initiatives to bring attention to the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion among their ranks and within the legal community at large, with many going so far as to make diversity-related activities billable and bonus-eligible. What better way to see which firms are truly honoring their commitments to diversity from the top down than a new ranking of sorts?

Bloomberg Law recently introduced its inaugural Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) Framework, a methodology the company says is the legal industry’s first — and only — way to measure law firms’ performance in this critical arena. Here’s a short summary on what the DEI Framework takes into account:

The members of the DEI Framework were recognized based on their level of disclosure of diversity-related metrics and distinguished performance against six core pillars: demographics, leadership and talent pipeline, recruitment and retention, business innovation and strategy, marketing, and diversity and inclusion in the community.

A more detailed description for the DEI Framework is available [here](https://pro.bloomberglaw.com/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-framework-for-law-firms/). And now, without further ado, the members of Bloomberg Law’s 2021 DEI Framework:

- Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP
- Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz, PC
- Cadwalader, Wickersham, & Taft LLP
- CDF Labor Law LLP
- Chamberlain, Hrdlicka, White, Williams & Aughtry, PC

- Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP
- Ogletree, Deakins, Nash, Smoak & Stewart PC
- Potomac Law Group, PLLC
- Reed Smith LLP

“Clients are looking to law firms that reflect their values and have demonstrated a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion.” said Joe Breda, president, Bloomberg Law. “[T]he 28 firms that we’ve recognized as part of the inaugural Bloomberg Law DEI Framework clearly fit the bill.”

Congratulations to all of the law firms that made the cut for this important list.

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)
Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Legal Technology Innovation: Navigating Complex Team Dynamics And Resolving Issues
## Navigating and escalating sensitive issues requires emotional intelligence, and resolving issues where there is resistance from team members requires soft skills and a focus on relationships.

As plans and budgets are getting finalized for the coming year, the fourth quarter can be a relatively stressful time of year for all kinds of professionals – including lawyers and legal technology professionals. For those interested in driving tech adoption and innovation within their organization, it may be a good time to rethink how to address issues your team may be having with a project or a new tech solution. I was recently in a mentoring session when a question came up about how to raise or escalate an issue when at an impasse, and I think it’s a topic that many people have to grapple with — particularly when there’s new technology involved. This month, I’ll be stepping away from the white noise of artificial intelligence to share thoughts to help with navigating complex issues when innovating.

Successful innovation involves people, processes, and technology. For a new legal technology to be successful, it inherently will affect people and the way work is accomplished. Managing and leading change is often the reason an innovation project fails. The technology itself is typically not the problem, although it is easy to lay the blame on technology alone. Taking a fresh look at how to resolve issues related to change may help drive forward innovation.

Most everyone leading projects or change has experienced situations where team dynamics create a major blocker on an initiative. You know what the issue is and want to solve it, but there is resistance. And if you’re the person responsible for that team or project, you are accountable for the success or failure of the effort. In short, you may be between a rock and a hard place.

Once the issue has been identified, it often feels like the only solution is to escalate it to management. But shining a light on the issue may make others uncomfortable or even look bad. Depending on how you handle the situation, it could alienate you from the team members needed to support the success of the project. If you handle the situation poorly, it could be career limiting. But if you handle the situation well, it could be a career enabling move and can benefit your organization. Navigating and escalating sensitive issues requires emotional intelligence, and resolving issues where there is resistance from team members requires soft skills and a focus on relationships.

Here are three techniques to help move legal technology innovation forward when confronting issues within a team environment.

Involve Others And Listen

Some questions you can ask your fellow team members include: “What do you think?” “How do you feel?” “Why is this project struggling?” “What do you think is going to happen if this fails?” “What would you do if you were in my position?” “I need your help and insight. Do you have any advice for me?” “Why do you think we have differing views on this issue?”

You may be surprised at their answers. Perhaps there are facts or unspoken issues you weren’t aware of that can help provide common ground — and asking for their input also demonstrates that you care about their perspective and are taking it into consideration. It is also OK to ask questions privately. People are more willing to provide open feedback in a private setting if there is trust.

Ask people who don’t have a stake in the project

Do others in your organization have a perspective on the project or the project goals? Are there people you can trust who are not associated with the situation? What does an objective person with no involvement think about it? Perhaps there are different perspectives, or maybe someone can ask a question that you can’t. If you have a coach or mentor outside your organization that you’re consulting, be sure to anonymize the situation so you don’t share confidential information.

Step Back

Be introspective 

Sometimes, those who are too close to a situation can lose sight of the big picture. Even a logical person can get emotionally invested and lose objectivity. Recognizing when you are in uncharted territory is important. Perhaps there is a need to get some extra distance and personal distraction over a long weekend to regain more objectivity.

Ask yourself questions

Is there new learning from the people you spoke to that are in the know? Is the issue really important? Is the impact of the issues measured in millions of dollars, or is the issue really more about style or approach? If it is the latter, it is wise to let the issue go.

Revisit the goals of the initiative

As projects progress, it is easy to forget what the desired business outcomes were in the first place. Take time to reread the project charter and, if necessary, ask those that approved the project to reconfirm what success looks like — there may be more than one way to achieve success.

After asking questions and stepping back for some self-reflection, you may find a way to resolve an issue without the need to escalate; and that is a good thing. If, however, the conclusion is that senior management needs to be involved, you may need to escalate.

Techniques To Escalate

Escalate as a team

More voices are better than one. You may be the project lead, but a team that speaks in unison will be better received. The team may not be collectively as bold as you desire, but finding some common ground may help provide a forum for others to ask questions and see the broader challenges.

Come equipped with solutions

It’s important when raising issues to have alternatives and potential solutions. This shows initiative and provides confidence to senior management. Raising an issue alone puts the onus of finding a solution on senior management. Help guide senior management and present them with decisions they can make to move the initiative forward or pivot if needed.

If possible, escalate outside of your management chain

Let’s say a team member disagrees with you or isn’t making your initiative a priority. If you find yourself at an impasse, consider suggesting a meeting with you, your team member, and their manager to help resolve. In other words, escalate up your team member’s management chain. This may be a safer place for the other individual. Ask questions and focus on your collective needs, and a positive resolution may occur. If there isn’t a positive resolution, you’ve demonstrated initiative and have more information to help others in management weigh in if additional escalation is required.

Innovation can be challenging at times. To be successful, one must focus on positive business outcomes. Some problems are outside of your control. Take time to reflect and thoughtfully engage others to build a bridge. This will help improve the likelihood of success for the team, your organization, and for you personally.

Hey, it’s Juneteenth. If you don’t know what that is, I hate you.

To be honest, I haven’t felt much like having a freedom jubilee these past couple of years. Juneteenth is always supposed to be about [continuing the unfinished work of liberation](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/juneteenth-celebration-police-brutality-justice/530898/), but during the Trump era, that work seems so very “unfinished.”

But don’t mind me. Juneteenth is important because it’s important that we remember and resolve to move forward. Let’s check in with how Kirkland & Ellis is commemorating the day:



Oh dear. Slave chain-breaking clipart is probably NOT the way I would have gone. Like, we all get what they’re going for but… “Come be free of the SHACKLES OF BONDAGE at our soulless corporate breakfast” just doesn’t hit the right note here.

At least they’re trying. I wish Joe Biden had gone to the Kirkland breakfast for Juneteenth, instead of [praising his own ability to be friends with segregationists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/06/19/joe-biden-james-eastland-herman-talmadge-segregationists-civility/?fbclid=IwAR20-WhOgDfddGA_gqYaejEUb1JyERr_IdNcpIxMMRCrM4JzkijXxBR4gKw&utm_term=.6bab34a58460).

# The Election To Partnership (Or, The Demise Of Hard Choices)

Sometimes, you should put people to a hard choice.

I know that we don’t like to do this: It’s easier, of course, to make an easy choice.

But, sometimes, you should force the hard choice.

Like, for example, when firms are considering elevating associates to partnership.

Once upon a time, a partnership decision was a real, up-or-out, decision. The firm made the candidate a partner, or it let the candidate go. The choice was black and white.

But now, there are many shades of gray. The firm can defer the partnership decision for a year (or two, or three). The firm can make the associate a senior counsel and defer a partnership decision for a while (or forever). The firm can make the associate a non-equity partner and leave the former associate in those ranks for a year, or a decade, or a career. The firm can invent some other category of non-partner lawyer, and put the associate in that group for a while. Anything other than making a hard decision.

Of course, when the firm is permitted to make the easy choice — keep the person around, but don’t share the partnership’s wealth — it naturally chooses that route. So virtually everyone is deferred, or re-named, or moved into the non-equity ranks, or somehow treated in a not-quite-associate, but not-quite-partner way. For a while. Or forever. Who knows?

On the one hand, this helps associates: They don’t lose their jobs.

But, on the other hand, this hurts associates: They don’t get promoted into the partnership ranks.

Maybe it would be better (for associates) to insist that firms made the hard choices.

(I’m thinking here about associates only. It may not help the firm to require hard choices; the firm may prefer to kick the can down the road. And it may not help clients to require firms to make hard choices; clients might lose the services of lawyers who perform good work. But, from the associates’ point of view, maintaining hard choices may be in their best interest.)

Where else do we permit easy choices when we historically required hard ones?

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The decision whether to prosecute a company.

Once upon a time, prosecutors had to decide whether companies were guilty of crimes (and should be prosecuted) or were not guilty of crimes (and should not be prosecuted).

No longer.

Now, prosecutors can choose to make (relatively) easy choices: They can enter deferred prosecution agreements, or non-prosecution agreements, or, I suppose, something else that suffices to show that the prosecutor’s office is doing its job, without putting the prosecutor to the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

So what do prosecutors do?

They make the easy choice: They enter agreements that don’t require prosecution.

Companies often yield (because the companies avoid prosecution), and the law may be distorted (because the prosecutor can extract a pound of flesh for not-quite-criminal conduct that the prosecutor couldn’t-quite-prove violated the law), but everyone goes home sufficiently satisfied.

Be wary of this.

We think we’re being clever when we eliminate the need for hard choices. But sometimes a hard choice is precisely what the situation requires.

# Open Letter To The DOE: Put Above The Law In Charge Of Accreditation

To Whom It May Concern:

It has come to our attention that the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (the unfortunately acronymed “NACIQI”) recently advised that the Department of Education strip the American Bar Association of its [authority to accredit law schools](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/aba-may-be-stripped-of-power-to-accredit-new-law-schools/). At least that’s the polite way of putting it. A more accurate description of the NACIQI hearing and finding is an old-fashioned ass-chewin’ that completely blindsided the ABA. Anyway, as we’re sure you’re aware, going through with such a bold move would leave a vacuum in the important task of serving law students and advancing the legal profession through education.

Thankfully, the field of legal education would not have to fear the ABA’s absence. We respectfully submit that, should the Department choose to heed the recommendation of NACIQI, Above the Law — armed with its 10 years of trailblazing coverage of legal education — is more than prepared to accept this heavy responsibility. Indeed, we are prepared to excel in this role!

We understand the problem, we know the solution, and we have a passion for punishing the host of tin horn academic institutions out there ripping people off. We are the avenging angels cruising the boulevard of broken legal careers just waiting for the power to drop some real Old Testament brimstone on these schools. Give us this opportunity. When you consider the grave situation in legal education, we trust that you’ll determine that you have no choice.

If we were to sum up our philosophy in one sentence: raise standards generally and start being honest about the role different tiers of law schools play… and should cost.

Student Debt Standards

This is the easiest selling point we can make to the Department: at least we understand that this is a problem, which is more than we can say for the ABA.

After all, the suggestion of suspending the ABA’s duties was broached, in part, over the committee’s concern about student debt. The [transcript of NACIQI’s hearing with the ABA](http://www.abajournal.com/files/naciqi-transcripts-062216.pdf), released last month, reveals that the committee raised considered, difficult questions about debt that the ABA was, astonishingly, unprepared to answer. As committee member Paul LeBlanc put it:

This feels like an agency that is out of step with a crisis in its profession, out of step with the changes in higher ed and out of step with the plight of the students that are going through the law schools.

But even after the NACIQI vote, Barry Currier, the managing director of accreditation and legal education for the ABA, did not seem to appreciate the gravity of the committee’s concerns:

In an interview with the ABA Journal, Currier said that setting a standard for law school loan amounts has never been considered. “Really it’s just fruitless to go into a longer conversation about it. It certainly would be complex,” he said.

“Fruitless”? This is the not the response any Department wants to hear after posing an important question.

Above the Law, on the other hand, thinks this discussion is pretty freaking fruitful.

Our [Top 50 Law School Rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/2016-law-school-rankings/) already employ tuition as a factor in evaluating school quality. Armed with the proper authority, we can easily expand this into a formula that takes tuition, average public/private debt loads, and employment prospects to determine whether the average student is walking out of that law school in a position to thrive in the profession or embark on a lifetime of mastering the perfect macchiato pour.

And to ensure that students properly grasp the data at their disposal, we’ll express these as pot odds.

That’s the whole problem, isn’t it? Everyone at these schools think they’re the exception — the valedictorian who will brook the odds and become the first Ave Maria grad to become Cravath’s managing partner. Just saying “there’s a 90 percent chance you won’t make it” isn’t enough. That’s where poker comes in. Balancing the debt vs. the odds of future income and putting a dollar amount on that risk can make someone see futility really quickly.

Mandatory Drug And Alcohol Testing

All students planning to attend law school must submit to a substance test. We’re not anti-drug crusaders here. We propose a sliding scale of drug and alcohol abuse. To wit, if a student is planning to attend Yale, they can be shooting heroin with the aplomb of a young Keith Richards and we wouldn’t care. But if the student is eyeing Thomas M. Cooley, they must be as clean as a Quaker. We have to make sure that no one makes a horrible life decision under the influence!

Getting LSAT/GPA Cutoffs Right

There are two primary objections to tightening admission standards:

1. It stifles diversity; and
2. The justice gap requires more lawyers from “lower-tier” schools.

There is, of course, the real risk that tightening standards based on a standardized test and undergraduate grades will only reinforce pre-existing advantages and make the profession less diverse. But you know what’s a bigger risk? That lower-tier law schools are dangling an unrealistic goal in front of students who can barely afford to pay for it and then wrapping themselves in the noble rhetoric of diversity to dupe the powers-that-be into giving them a pass. Screw those people. We’re not going to fall for that.

The LSAT is a strong predictor of eventual success on the bar exam and undergraduate grades are — assuming the student isn’t from some grade-inflating Ivy — an effective indicator of work ethic and smarts. If a law school is making a habit of admitting students with LSATs in the 140s and grades that would [make Blutarsky blush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKS0GVvoE9I), then they shouldn’t be in the law school business.

Diversity requires seeing through potentially unrepresentative raw numbers to find students who will enrich the educational experience. It doesn’t mean creating an expensive pipe dream factory. As accreditors, Above the Law would impose a hard LSAT/Grades cutoff average. We’re not going to handcuff a school that sees promise in individual students, as long as it demonstrates an overall commitment to admitting students with strong academic indicators.

And we’re also going to tie that average to tuition because we’re definitely not going to handcuff a school willing to take the tuition hit to extend legal education to communities that may underperform on the standard admissions metrics. For instance, UNT Dallas, a school that the ABA scoffs at — or at least decided to scoff at after the NACIQI put them on blast — would receive our provisional endorsement because they’ve coupled their decision to take on more students at risk of failing the bar with a commitment to keep the [out-of-pocket costs of these students low](https://bol.bna.com/should-law-school-in-texas-be-rewarded-or-punished-for-unique-approach-perspective/).

It’s really simple: if you aren’t Harvard, why are you charging like Harvard? Again, we’ll raise standards generally and then hold schools to charging what their admissions policies demand and accredit them accordingly.

Minimum Bar Passage Requirements

Oh, look! An ABA committee has just now decided that [bar passage rates may need to be tighter](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/committee_oks_proposal_to_tighten_aba_bar_pass_standards_some_members_hope). No kidding? All it took was a threatened suspension and watching a law school [pass only one student](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/worst-bar-exam-results-ever-only-one-person-from-this-law-school-passed-the-bar-exam/) to figure this out. The Department of Education can do better than relying on that kind of reactive governance.

We’ll be tossing schools that can’t get their students across the bar exam threshold. These are, ultimately, professional schools and if they can’t get their pups into the profession then they shouldn’t be in business. Once again, we’ll tie this to tuition — if a student is out $10K for a 20 percent bar passage rate, that’s not nearly as bad as being out $250K for a 50 percent bar passage rate. Schools should be rewarded for what they’re showing us on the field — if they’ve taken on middling students and gotten middling passage rates, then that’s to be expected. As long as the students aren’t suffering on the back-end — see the above cutoffs discussion — this is an acceptable outcome.

Administrative Salary Cap

One reason why law school is so expensive is the [explosion of administrative positions and salaries](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/opinion/sunday/the-real-reason-college-tuition-costs-so-much.html). It’s not just that deans are paid huge salaries to forego better opportunities to try and score a sponsor for the new dorm they don’t actually need to build, it’s the proliferation of assistant deans performing wholly unnecessary jobs. Across higher education, the “full-time non-faculty professional” saw the [largest percentage expansion](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cKKWboVtfuE/VSvfhL1YjlI/AAAAAAAAC4s/698ZEQY7Ea8/s1600/EmployeeGrowth1975-2011AAUP0314.png). And what does the “Senior Associate Dean of Strategic Thinking” or some nonsense even do? Other than trying to justify massive tuition hikes to themselves, not much. There’s no need to pay someone a premium to reprint their business cards.

We want a salary cap. It works for professional sports, so why not law school?

After conducting an exhaustive study of law school salaries, we will recommend an ample salary cap, relative to full-time faculty expenditures and size of the student body, for senior administrative salaries. Skimp on your dean if you want more bodies walking around with fancy titles, but let’s rein in the out of control spending to get schools back to the basics of providing a quality legal education for a reasonable price.

Instituting An Annual Purge

On one day, every year, all crime in the law school should be legal. Not only is this a good way to work out aggression and student/faculty angst to create a better law school environment, but it creates a treasure trove of potential fact patterns for future crim exams.

My bet’s on Laurence Tribe coming out of this on top — he seems like a cagey competitor.

Three Years?

The third rail of legal education is the “third year” discussion. President Obama suggested a two-year law school and professors started demanding his birth certificate. While it may be rough on academics to excise the useless “Law and…” courses that populate every 3Ls schedule, it’s time to move on.

The predominant argument for the third year is the specious claim that it’s needed to make students “practice ready,” which they are never going to be anyway. Clinical experiences may make students “closer” to practice ready — and we applaud those efforts in a world married to the third year — but with the power to accredit, we would no longer require schools to offer a third year of instruction. This will rob the schools of some revenue to be sure, but it should also invite the necessary streamlining to bring costs down and it’ll minimize the outlay of students who don’t make it.

An often underemployed, but better, argument is that the third year is necessary as a disincentive to the casual student who we don’t want in the profession. It’s a fair concern. But given the success of functional diploma mills in the status quo, it seems the third year isn’t the talisman necessary to keep people out. Let’s reform tuition and the academic qualifications for entry rather than rely on poor potential lawyers to balk at a third year.

Law school is about learning to think like a lawyer and they handle that in about 18 months. Everything else is just profit-taking. Schools willing to go to a two-year model will be seriously considered for accreditation.

Conclusion

There you have it, Education Department honchos! Don’t fret slapping the ABA with a little suspension. Legal education will be in good hands over here at Above the Law. And, hey, maybe when that year is up you might decide we’ve got the better procedure over here.

Stranger things have happened over the last 10 years.

Some Biglaw firms are really hitting it out of the park this week, and one of them is Sheppard Mullin. Hot on the heels of the firm’s announcement of its new [“Unplug & Recharge” policy](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/top-50-biglaw-firm-announces-new-unplug-recharge-program-making-time-off-billable-and-bonus-eligible/) — a program that will make up to 40 hours of time spent relaxing both billable and bonus eligible — the firm has now announced its annual bonuses.

Associates are happy as can be with the Cravath/Davis Polk match. Here’s what the firm’s bonus package looks like:

C2	          11,500	          17,250	          23,000
As you can see, Shepard Mullin awards base year-end bonuses at the 2000-hour mark, and those who go over on their billing will be rewarded even more handsomely. Specifically, associates who record 2200 and 2400 hours (and meet an 1850 billable hour requirement) will receive 110% and 120% of the market based bonus. In addition, once an associate’s billable hours goal is met, unlimited pro bono hours and 75 hours of firm creditable time (including Diversity and Inclusion hours, Business Development and Training/Mentoring, etc.) will count towards the firm’s hours-based bonus program.

Congratulations to Sheppard Mullin and its associates on a wonderful year!

# 2022 Associate Bonuses: Celebrating The Early Announcers
## Most announcements have essentially matched the market rate, as is typical, but the most notable differences have been in how quickly firms have made their announcements.

It has been more than a month since associate bonus season kicked off with Baker McKenzie’s [first-mover announcement](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/biglaw-bonus-season-begins/) of its bonus scale on November 21. Since then, numerous Am Law 50 firms have announced their bonus plans, converging around a scale that starts at $15K (pro-rated) for the Class of 2022 and rises to $115K for the Class of 2015.

Although the content of the announcements has been subtly different from one firm to the next, most announcements have essentially matched the market rate, as is typical. The most notable differences have been in how quickly firms have made their announcements. As usual, several Am Law 50 firms were quick to match once the market scale was established. But weeks later, no announcement has been made by the majority of Am Law 100 firms.

Some might argue that any delay ultimately won’t be that important: it’s likely that many of the radio-silent Am Law 100 firms will eventually match. But in a time of economic uncertainty, we believe that promptly announcing a (matching) bonus scale has greater value than it would in most years. Given all the talk about recession, you’d rather see your firm’s commitment in writing than to just trust that the money will arrive in due course.

For example, if you’re a Gibson Dunn associate, should you be concerned at the firm’s slow pace in committing to the market scale? The chances you’ll receive your money obviously get slimmer the longer the firm delays payment. Chatter about impending recession could just serve as an excuse not to pay associate bonuses despite healthy firm profits.  

And even for associates who ultimately suffer no adverse financial impact, this matters from a motivational perspective. It certainly feels better to be at a firm that’s quick to display appreciation for your efforts, as compared to working for a partnership that drags its feet.

So with New Year’s Eve festivities almost upon us, let’s talk a moment to celebrate the firms that stepped up and matched quickly. Here is the list of Am Law 100 firms that issued announcements in the week of November 28, roughly one week after Baker McKenzie’s first-mover announcement:

Baker McKenzie [first mover]

Cravath

McDermott Will & Emery

Skadden

Fried Frank

Cleary Gottlieb

Davis Polk

Paul Weiss

Debevoise

Baker Botts

Paul Hastings

Hogan Lovells

Milbank

Ropes & Gray

Willkie Farr

O’Melveny

Morgan Lewis

Note: firms are sequenced by date of communication, with earlier-announcing firms towards the top of the list. The source of this data is the helpful [AboveTheLaw tracker](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/biglaw-bonus-tracker-2022/).

Congratulations to associates at the early mover firms! Here’s hoping that your firm’s swift announcement made for a more relaxing holiday season.

# Mega Law Firm Finally Steps Up With Summer Bonuses
## Finally! Summer bonuses!

Summer 2018 has really been the summer of money for Biglaw associates. Milbank [got the party started](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) by finally bringing NY (and its other offices) to $190K. Simpson Thacher upped the ante just two days later by matching the new salary scale and [adding in special summer bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/). And just a few days after that, Cravath reasserted its dominance as the firm that sets the market standard by [increasing the standard base salary for senior associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/) over what was set by Milbank. After this trio of firms worked together to set the new market standard, it’s really only been a question of who will match.

The giant law firm of DLA Piper [got its sh*t together last week when it comes to base associate salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/but-will-associates-in-the-mutara-nebula-get-a-cut-of-these-raises/?rf=1). That’s when the firm announced they’d match the prevailing market standard for associate compensation — at least in “major markets.” But inside sources were understandably sad that the firm did not announce any special summer bonuses, which had become the standard at elite Biglaw firms.

But now DLA is recognizing that summer bonuses are essential for the biggest of Biglaw firms. Yesterday, the firm announced bonuses for associates on track to bill 2100 hours. They haven’t committed to a specific bonus scale, instead opting for individualized bonuses, though they assure associates they’re are committed to “aggregate compensation that meets or exceeds the market.” And for associates with practices that naturally peak in the second half of the year, the firm has said they’re aware of that ebb and flow and will take that into account when end of the year individual bonuses are announced.

You know that you want that job. Badly. And you know that you are oh-so-qualified.

But you don’t get it. You – who are top of the class!

Ever hear of [hiring bias?](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/biglaw-hiring-bias-men-with-high-class-hobbies-more-likely-to-get-summer-associate-interviews-than-women/)

We like to think – hell, we are long-trained to think – that objective evidence of merit is or should be the sole criteria in hiring. You know – the ability to do the job and who can do it best.

But not so fast. Humans being humans, subjective criteria creep into the process – some legal and some not-so-much, some conscious and some not.

Tribes And Stereotypes

Let’s start with the obvious: we all want to work with – and hire – people just like us. Humans are tribal and don’t like, or are at least suspicious of, other tribes. Some refer to this as the [similarity-attraction hypothesis](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1965-12050-001).

And we just love stereotypes – we use them to classify and understand those who we don’t know. Workplace stereotypes are not illegal – unless they are (see Title VII), and when it comes to hiring we tend to hire who we (think we) know, and base a lot of this on stereotypes.

In the 21st century, stereotypes could not be easier to use – just look up an applicant on Facebook or LinkedIn, and bingo! You can tell gender, age, race, and ethnicity, as well as social class. What else do you need to know? (P.S. This is one reason employment lawyers try to talk clients out of using social media for hiring).

As Olga Mack and Katia Bloom recently noted [in these pages](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/combatting-unconscious-hiring-bias/?utm_campaign=Above%20the%20Law%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=44835059&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9uv7nNXqbIQfXt_UZDikFL1Iod1_U6KjYLEsEZqfD4HqjoDAd_zzxVFvbP8sY2ncCnkxUT1LYr0XLfJOHNUnznVH0-d6mTOksbK-zWWk5rmuPBG9o&_hsmi=44835059), “The use of gender-specific language predicts the gender of the person you hire at the end. A highly masculine listing makes it twice as likely that the position will be filled by a man. Similarly, a highly feminine listing makes it twice as likely that the position will be filled by a woman.”

“[Studies](http://plum.io/blog/the-realities-of-bias-in-the-hiring-process/#.WNWKK4WcFZU) have shown that people with[ ‘white’ or ‘domestic’ names ](http://www.nber.org/papers/w9873)get more interest from employers than those with ‘black’ or ‘foreign’ names.”

And the Wall Street Journal reported on a study using dummy résumés and social-media profiles which found that up to one-third of American companies searched social media “profiles” which, when indicating that applicants were Muslim, resulted in fewer interviews than Christian applicants.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Moreover, one writer [said that ](http://www.businessinsider.com/unconscious-biases-in-hiring-decisions-2015-7)“Americans tend to assume Indians who come to the U.S. are skilled at math,” and commented that “people were more likely to hire a male candidate over a female candidate to perform a mathematical task, even when they learned that the candidates would perform equally well.”

So Should We Hide An Applicant Behind A Sheet?

Not a bad idea.

One expert [said that ](http://www.skillsurvey.com/blind-hiring-more-prevalent-to-overcome-hidden-bias/)“blind hiring”– hiding personal information, such as faces and names – may be useful, and he cited an oft-told story. “More than fifty years ago, several orchestras began to experiment with auditioning candidates behind a sheet to shield a performer’s gender or race from the selection process. It made a dramatic difference in getting more women and minorities onto the stage.”

Short of a sheet, [we can ](https://www.recruiter.com/i/4-tips-to-remove-unconscious-bias-from-the-hiring-process/)“remove identifying information, such as names, gender, etc., from résumés. Candidates can’t be unfairly discriminated against on the grounds of gender and race if they are only identified by a number.”

Even Zip Codes?

Another writer [noted that ](http://www.skillsurvey.com/blind-hiring-more-prevalent-to-overcome-hidden-bias/)“It’s also common to draw conclusions about a person based on what zip code they live in, where they attended school, where they worked in the past, or their gender or ethnicity based on the derivation of the candidate’s name.” How do you avoid that?

And what’s worse, a [Harvard study ](http://extranet.cccco.edu/Portals/1/TRIS/Research/Research/Abstracts/ResearchMethods/zip.pdf)even found “some pitfalls in the use of postal zip codes” which are used for research, which they referred to “spatiotemporal mismatches.” What this may mean is that you are your zip code, even if the zip code demographics are not accurate.

Oy.

Can Computers Hire?

Maybe [we can ](https://www.recruiter.com/i/4-tips-to-remove-unconscious-bias-from-the-hiring-process/)“let[] computers do the selection. … they don’t have a subconscious and simply don’t carry all that unconscious baggage around with them like mere mortals do. This arguably makes them bulletproof against claims of stereotyping and bias.”

Wrong.

The New York Times [discussed](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/upshot/algorithms-and-bias-q-and-a-with-cynthia-dwork.html?abt=0002&abg=0&_r=0) that “there is growing evidence that [algorithms and other types of software can discriminate](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/upshot/when-algorithms-discriminate.html). The people who write them incorporate their biases, and algorithms often learn from human behavior, so they reflect the biases we hold.”

And there’s another problem called “redundant encoding” – The Stack [gave an example](https://thestack.com/world/2016/10/11/google-brain-machine-learning-discrimination/): even if gender is not included in a loan application, “gender can be inferred from other data factors which are included: for example, if the applicant is a single parent, and 82% of single parents are female, there is a high probability that the applicant is female (emphasis added).”

So we can infer gender — or even age or race – from the accumulation of other big data?

Not good.

So Tell Us Finally – Why Can’t “Higher-Class” Women Get That Biglaw Job?

I commend to you a [fascinating article ](https://hbr.org/2016/12/research-how-subtle-class-cues-can-backfire-on-your-resume)by two professors who discuss “subtle class cues” and [prior research](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10457.html) which shows “that hiring in top professional services firms is highly skewed toward applicants from wealthy families.” They note that résumé items such as extracurricular activities can signal class status (see playing polo v. interning with a dentist).

They came to a disturbing conclusion: “coming from an advantaged social background helps only men” and hurts women. But why?

Biglaw apparently deems “higher-class women as ‘flight risks,’ who might desert the firm for less time-intensive areas of legal practice or might even leave paid employment entirely. [They] cited ‘family’ as a primary reason these women would leave.”

So résumés that somehow signal “higher-class woman” may be bad for your chances at that plum job.

Oh well. Guess we are not at bias-free hiring yet.

Just about every private practice lawyer can deliver sound legal advice, of course. 

Many go further by learning their clients’ full business operations to deliver broad-based guidance. 

But what truly differentiates a lawyer whom a general counsel would look to as a long-term partner?

The question was posed to a panel of top GCs at the [Legal Marketing Association’s annual conference](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/today-at-lma-ai-deep-dive-fishbowl-sessions-keynote-kickoff/) in San Diego last week. 

The GC panel is a perennial favorite of the conference, bringing frank insights from the clients themselves on business development topics. 

This year’s panel was held on the main festival-style stage to a room packed with many of the conference’s 1,200 attendees. 

When it comes to outside counsel, “a lot of studies show that, really, the table stakes are not enough, right?” said the moderator, Morgan MacLeod of Cubicle Fugitive Inc., addressing the in-house panelists.

“Really, you guys are looking for way more proactive, pragmatic, actionable advice that people can get going on right away,” she added. 

Here are some insights from the discussion. 

Smaller Firms May Offer Unique Value

If you’re a marketer for a small or midsize firm, you may want to highlight your firm’s ability to build deep relationships in your branding. 

And you shouldn’t rule out the largest companies in your outreach.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Google, for example, doesn’t always opt for the biggest of Biglaw in its hiring, noted Judy Shu, Senior Counsel at the company.

Shu works with midsize firms and even solo practitioners, she said, and her department benefits from direct interactions with a smaller group of people and the knowledge retention it fosters. 

These firms can often offer lower rates than the largest firms. They also provide certainty in what a client will pay for a particular matter and what the client is receiving in return, she said. 

Shu particularly sends these firms deal negotiation work — maybe a bulk amount of contracts that need to be finalized. 

“A lot of times, we’ll reach out to our smaller firms and say, ‘Hey, can you handle this for us?’” she said. “And we kind of can forget about it, because we know that we can put them in touch with our internal business clients.”

“They can build that same kind of trust and relationship.” 

GCs Aren’t Primarily Concerned With Seniority

In their quest for responsiveness and value, in-house counsel often find success by looking beyond the most senior partners and involving their junior colleagues in the relationship. 

Justin Witzmann of NuVasive, for example, noted that, among lawyers with deep knowledge of a particular practice area, more junior attorneys often show an increased willingness to dive into the client’s business operations.

“We’ve built out, in products and employment, especially, some national counsel that are really like an extension of our legal department,” he said. 

For law firms and their corporate clients, this is a two-way street — and a place where business development professionals can be proactive.  

Savvy law firms and in-house counsel alike should look to connect junior professionals across their respective organizations to build more productive relationships.

“I don’t like being the bottleneck,” said Terezka Zabka, the San Diego Padres’ General Counsel. “So I try to connect as many people as possible.” 

For law firms, it’s also all about staying top-of-mind with in-house counsel. 

Increasing engagement with a law department’s more junior professionals — through firm-sponsored events and other efforts — can be an effective way to do this. 

“Invite our law clerks out to lunch or take our law clerks to a baseball game or dinner,” said Thomas Santram, General Counsel at Cineplex Entertainment. “Because they actually are the ones doing the work. And I will listen to them if they like someone, if they want to work with someone, and I try to let them work with the people they want to work with.” 

Mailing lists are also a good way to stay top of mind, but firms shouldn’t overdo it. 

“When emails come in,” Santram said, “if you keep getting too many emails from the same person, you skim them carefully.”

GCs Want Advice Beyond Legal Issues

Of course, lawyer communications that help a GC’s business will always be well received. 

For Zabka, the Padres GC, broad communication from outside counsel is a major value-add when providing legal guidance.

In discussions with her lawyers, Zabka is not looking just for an answer to her legal questions. She also wants additional information her lawyers may have read or discussed over coffee at their firm. 

Zabka welcomes regular communication of high-level articles and commentary related to her organization or practice — even sports items that could possibly be viewed through a legal lens.

“It’s as simple as sending a tweet, sending a text, something like that,” she said. “It doesn’t have to be a long sort of article or anything, but just letting me know that I’m top of mind is always nice.”

Another way a private practice lawyer can deepen a relationship, ironically enough, is to refer a colleague from another firm. 

Santram remembers calling an outside counsel to handle a matter, and being told: “Tom, we could do it, but we’re not the right people for you to do it. You should go across the street.”

The situation convinced Santram that the referring lawyer wasn’t just looking to bill hours, but that he genuinely sought a deep relationship. 

“He’s building a relationship, and he’s really a trusted adviser now,” Santram said. “I respected that. I really appreciated that.”

Gloria Cannon

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://www.laterallink.com) team of expert contributors. [Gloria Noh Cannon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glorianohcannon/) is a Principal based in the Los Angeles office where she oversees attorney placements in California, Arizona, and Nevada. Gloria received her J.D. from Loyola Law School, and a B.A. from University of California, Los Angeles. Gloria started her legal career as a financial restructuring associate with the Los Angeles office of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, where she worked for over four years and was a member of the hiring committee and recruiting committee. Gloria then was a member of the in-house legal department for over five years at Oaktree Capital Management, LLC, serving as a Vice President.

As 2017 continues to unfold and with the somewhat recent round of salary raises, there is more pressure than ever on the incoming class of first-year associates to hit the ground running. The first year of an associate’s practice is largely predictive of how that attorney’s career will unfold. A strong first year will invite more opportunities and responsibilities the next year, a cause and effect that is recursive throughout an associate’s career. Consequently, it is vital that associates keep five key principles in mind to make their first year, and ultimately their Biglaw career, a success:

- Be a self-starter and seek out work. Law school teaches you how to think about the law, but as a career student, most attorneys come out of school unsure of how to be a good employee. The best legal minds are net losses for firms if they are underperforming or underutilized. If you are hoping to make partner one day, you want to demonstrate from the start that you are a team player, and that you will take initiative in finding and taking on work — similar to how partners seek out clients. If firms see that you are being proactive and passionate about your work, they are more likely to entrust you with important roles and interesting cases.
- It’s never too early to start networking. As much as I would like to claim that law practice is a pure meritocracy, the reality falls short of this mark. Networking is one of the biggest boons to an attorney’s career, but it alone won’t transform a lackluster associate into a partner. However, it can catapult competent attorneys to the front of the line when an exciting, high-profile case or deal is being staffed or promotions are being considered.So with whom should you be networking? Working in close proximity will make you inexorably intertwined with the associates and partners in your practice. While you should devote a considerable time to maintaining that relationship, don’t neglect attorneys outside of your practice and even your office — especially ones that have overlapping practices. These contacts can bring in referral work, give you a vote of confidence for a prospective partnership position, and help you secure jobs at other firms should they make a lateral move. Moreover, networking within your own firm will help you become a better at networking where it really matters: business development.Great business development skills are largely what differentiates between someone who gets a Counsel title and a Partner title. Unless you work at a firm with institutionalized clients, it does not matter how good of a lawyer you are if you cannot demonstrate that you have the ability to bring more business into your firm. If you start honing these skills from day one, you will be well ahead of the curve and have a much better chance of making partner. In addition, it is never too early to start developing potential clients. Even if the friends you make now at companies are in junior positions, they will someday become the decision makers who choose outside counsel. Business can come from the most unlikely contacts. For example, as a junior associate, I successfully brought in an international fashion design company as a client to my firm when my roommate’s boyfriend (who had previously been a medical malpractice attorney) became the General Counsel of the company.
- Don’t be afraid of saying no. While taking on new work shows initiative and responsibility, missing deadlines and fumbling the extra work is outright proof that you cannot handle it. It is better to maintain your sanity and track record then it is to push yourself to the brink and lose both. Law is a long career. Many attorneys burn out after a few years of Biglaw because they push themselves too hard. Take on an amount of work that keeps you busy and shows initiative, but not so much that you cannot meet deadlines. I remember coming back from vacation as the only first-year in my practice group, and literally every attorney in my group gave me an assignment the minute I stepped back into the office. It would have been impossible to get every single project done within the requested deadlines; thus, I spoke to my mentor senior associate within the group who helped take some of the projects off my plate.Conversely, do not be afraid of saying yes. Don’t turn down projects because you want to be out of the office by 5 and have no work on the weekend — this has not been the norm in law for a long time. You want to show partners that you are a team player that is always willing to do what it takes to get the job done.
- Find a mentor. Donne wrote, “no man is an island,” and the same applies to Biglaw attorneys. The ecosystem of Biglaw requires both cooperation and an informal succession of responsibility from senior to junior associates. If you enter Biglaw intending to practice in a self-reliant manner, with no help, you will be sadly disappointed. It is imperative to find a partner or senior associate to both guide you professionally and personally. Firms generally will not invest a significant amount of time in your career development. Why? The likelihood of you being with the same firm in five years is very small these days — so why waste the resources? You are responsible for your own career development and there is no surer way to keep your career on track than to have someone who has already walked the path and can help guide you to success. This person does not have to necessarily be within your practice group or even within your office. One of my best mentors during my time as a Biglaw associate was a partner in the New York office who was always willing to answer any questions I had, both professional and personal, regarding a wide variety of topics. This partner was a fantastic resource, and from an early stage in my career was guiding me as to how to make partner within my firm and had I chosen to try to make a run at partner, would have been invaluable.
- Keep your finger on Biglaw’s pulse. A majority of associates will lateral to another firm within three years and chances are so will you. The one-company career days are over, your loyalty will not supersede your practice, and firms will not offer you a partnership just because you have been there for the entirety of your career. Like most fields, the majority of career advancement coincides with lateral moves. You may be a superlative attorney, but if there is not a strong need for your practice at your firm, you can end up being a senior associate with no chance of making partner and very few lateral possibilities. Finding a firm that is a career fit is only one part of the equation. Every firm has a discrete identity and culture that fits some more than others. Finding a firm that fits both requirements is difficult to do without outside help, and this is where a good recruiter can pay dividends.Your first-year reputation will precede you for years to come and will shape how the rest of your career unfolds. If are a first-year associate who has questions about your first year or a seasoned associate with career questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me or any of my fellow recruiters at Lateral Link.

# The Kind Of Unhinged Departure Memo That Would Have Been WAY Funnier Before The Marathon Attack
## I don't usually say this, but this ""departure memo"" was way too soon.

Around here, we love crazy [departure memos](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/departure-memos/). Today, we have us a real whooper.

Unfortunately, some guy sent out a crazy, slightly unhinged “renunciation” of his U.S. citizenship to some of his law school classmates just this past Saturday, mere hours after Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing, was finally captured. All of a sudden, a dude claiming that he’s going to go into the Florida wilderness and will return as a “revolutionary” sounds less “OMG, look at this crazy law graduate,” and more “Umm, is anybody taking a look at this crazy law graduate?”

I mean, we’re talking about a guy who apparently changed his name to “Augustus Invictus.” So we’re almost certainly talking about some kind of troll. A “too soon” troll, at least I hope….

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  

“Augustus” got his law degree from DePaul University. From there, he went on to open his own practice in Florida. A practice that he is now evidently closing.

A tipster reports that a few of his DePaul classmates received this aggressive letter (reprinted in full on the next page). Here are some “highlights”:

Witness ye the glory of my life at 29 years of age: I have four children, each of whom should be the envy of every parent in the world; I have attained a Baccalaureate Degree in Philosophy with honors; I have attained a Doctorate in Law, cum laude; I have acquired licenses in the profession of law in the States of New York, Illinois, and Florida; I am scheduled to acquire two more such licenses in North Carolina & Massachusetts; I am Editor-in-Chief of a poetry journal; I run an independent publishing company; I have opened my own law office in downtown Orlando; I am an MBA candidate; and I have accomplished a few other things that will remain off the record for now.

I am of genius intellect & cultured, well-educated & creative, well-mannered & refined. I am God’s gift to humankind where the English language is concerned, and I also happen to have a basic knowledge of Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, and Italian. I am musical & artistic; I am athletic & possessed of militant self-discipline; and I am many other things. I have a Cadillac & a poodle, multiple computers & a personal library; I live in an apartment downtown, right across the street from the courthouse; I have been to Paris & Vancouver, to Cairo & Dubrovnik, to Mexico City & Siracusa. I dress better than all of you, pronounce my words perfectly, and have a winning, professional handshake. I am everything you ever wanted to be.

I challenge any of you, then, to accuse me of being a failure in this artificial civilization of yours. For it is beyond dispute that I have played your petty game, and I have won.

But your game no longer holds any interest for me. Your architecture is vapid & worthless, as is your decadent culture, the mindless drivel you call music, the filth you call democracy. You waste your lives watching pure excrement on television, shopping at the strip malls, planning your vacations to resorts & theme parks. The Internet, with its infinitude of information, is used for reading celebrity gossip & watching sitcoms. You have begun to reduce argument to memes & human communication to trite sound bites. Life has become trivial – and if you cannot feel the human spirit decaying, you are already dead.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The vague threats of violence continue at the end:

HEAR YE MY FINAL WORDS IN PEACETIME:

I have prophesied for years that I was born for a Great War; that if I did not witness the coming of the Second American Civil War I would begin it myself. Mark well: That day is fast coming upon you. On the New Moon of May, I shall disappear into the Wilderness. I will return bearing Revolution, or I will not return at all.

War Be unto the Ends of the Earth,

Augustus Sol Invictus
Orlando, Florida, USA
XX Aprilis MMXIII Satvrnvs

We reached out to Invictus, to ascertain the seriousness of this missive and to see why he sent it so soon after a national tragedy. He has not yet responded.

I think a “return to normalcy” would involve us making fun of Mr. “I have played your petty game, and I have won,” with a DePaul Law degree serving as the [“Dodge Stratus”](http://www.hulu.com/watch/3526) of this email.

But it just feels too soon — too soon to send this, and too soon to be lighthearted about its contents. I just want somebody to check in on this guy and make sure everything is okay.

# Biglaw Billing News Spells Opportunity for Others
## For those lawyers and firms -- the ones that are not charging (or compensating) at the very highest levels -- these stories could present a significant opportunity.

David Perla

By now, you’ve heard the big stories about billing practices at large law firms. First came the news, via the BTI Consulting Group, that the billing rates of the priciest lawyers in the country [have reached $2,000 per hour](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/how-much-would-you-pay-for-the-very-best-lawyer/). Shortly thereafter, Above the Law broke the news that Cravath has elevated [first-year associate salaries to $180,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/), with many peer firms [rushing to follow suit](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises/).

You’ve also probably heard some of the reaction to these stories, not all of it positive. With regard to the $2,000 per hour lawyer—[the ranks of which](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/2000-an-hour-lawyers-thats-one-way-to-fund-salary-increases/) reportedly include David Boies, Paul Clement, and Ted Olson—some have said that lawyers of such quality are worth every penny. But there are also grumblings of discontent. One source told The American Lawyer that the $2,000 per hour lawyer “[seems so crazy and out of market](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202757535252/Billing-2K-an-Hour-Study-Says-Clients-Will-Pay-If-Lawyers-Deliver?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=1)”; that speaker, believe it or not, is a leader at a Wall Street firm. The word from corporate clients, unsurprisingly, has been similarly unenthusiastic on the topic of the $180,000 first-year lawyer. The global general counsel for Bank of America, for one, let the nation’s largest law firms know that he doesn’t intend to absorb the cost of the salary increase. “While we respect the firms’ judgment about what best serves their long-term competitive interests,” [he wrote in an email that has become public](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/some-clients-are-super-pissed-about-associate-raises/), “we are aware of no market-driven basis for such an increase and do not expect to bear the costs of the firms’ decisions.”

These billing stories are being discussed vigorously, as well they should. Most of the talk, however, has centered on their implications for Biglaw. What you are less likely to have heard is what they mean for other practitioners. And yet, for those lawyers and firms — the ones that are not charging (or compensating) at the very highest levels — these stories could present a significant opportunity.

Some years ago, the Association of Corporate Counsel led a pushback against the rates being charged by outside firms, stoked in part by inside counsels’ incredulity over the $160,000 salary for first years. (The ACC still runs its “[Value Challenge](https://www.acc.com/valuechallenge/)” campaign.) With these two billing stories happening at the same time, the climate feels ripe for another backlash moment, in which “value” firms may have particular appeal to corporate legal departments.

Fortunately for them, the resource gap between firms inside and outside the Am Law 100 has never been narrower or less meaningful. With the many tools available today, smaller providers of legal services have the capacity to present (in both appearance and reality) truly viable alternatives to their elite competition. This is true both for individual lawyers and for law firms as a whole.

There may have been a day when it was difficult for lawyers working outside a coterie of elite firms to catch the attention of in-house counsel. The advent of digital publishing and social media platforms, if nothing else, has changed that dynamic entirely. Those tools have democratized the conversation of sophisticated legal issues, and made it much easier for individual lawyers to establish reputations as thought leaders in their areas. Today, lawyers and firms with something to say can create strong personal and institutional brands, and catch the attention — and business — of corporate counsel, whether they work in New York or Peoria, Illinois, at a megafirm or a solo shop.

The barriers to entry have fallen for firms as well. Once, firms with armies of associates could do things that smaller firms could not: 50-state surveys, large discovery projects, complicated M&A deals, complex litigation, and more. Now, with advances in technology (like drafting tools, complex search and retrieval tools, heat maps, chart builders, technology assisted review, etc.) and business processes (like outsourcing, legal project management, etc.), smaller firms can accomplish those tasks relatively easily. Meanwhile, publishing software and the existence of the web itself allows the smallest law firms to prepare world-class materials and market themselves to a vast audience.

Indeed, with tools available today, small and medium firms can legitimately claim many, if not all, of the benefits of much larger operations. Most importantly, the powerful informational tools on the market now make it possible for firms to credibly claim expertise in a broad universe of topics, even with limited number of attorneys. Even the larger firms’ most durable advantage—their number of physical locations—has been eroded. Lawyer referral networks have become commonplace, allowing even small shops to act as a one-stop source for work in a large number of practice areas and locations. Members of the World Services Group, for instance, can give their clients access to a 19,000-lawyer network, including those from powerhouse firms such as Hunton & Williams and Haynes and Boone. Ditto that for Lex Mundi, which includes numerous domestic and offshore law firms, from widely known national firms to much smaller and less well known regional and local firms, in countries around the globe.

It’s true that best lawyers and firms will always attract clients. But it’s also true that the news stories making the rounds may be putting an unpleasant taste in the mouths of corporate counsel. If that’s the case, it’s an ideal time for firms outside the Biglaw elite to find out what’s possible.

You’ll forget the sun in his jealous sky/As we walk in fields of gold

That’s from Sting’s Fields of Gold, which was the best gimmick I could come up with for Freshfields.

As gimmicks go, it’s not bad: it’s got “fields” and associates are definitely putting aside any jealousies to enjoy a kind of gold. Could I have worked in “magic” somehow? Maybe… that’s definitely a weakness here. I’m giving myself an A- on this one.

These bad puns and pop culture references are really the only thing that gets me motivated covering Biglaw in December.

Anyway, yeah, Freshfields has matched the emerging bonus consensus. This is the first Magic Circle firm we’ve heard match so far, which means we’re shifting over to the G200 ranking where Freshfields places 17th with [$2,341,256,000 in gross revenue at last check](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/law-firm-profile/?id=111&name=Freshfields-Bruckhaus-Deringer).

And without further ado, here are the bonuses that associates in the firm’s US offices will be getting on December 15:

Class	Bonus
Class of 2022	$15K (pro-rated)
Class of 2021	$20K
Class of 2020	$30K
Class of 2019	$57.5K
Class of 2018	$75K
Class of 2017	$90K
Class of 2016	$105K
Class of 2015+	$115K
Congratulations! Check out a pic of the memo on the next page if you’re so inclined.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# How Did Biglaw Firms Fare Financially In 2020?
## Pretty, pretty well, in terms of both revenue and profit.

Color me surprised — or even shocked. I’ve been following the American Lawyer’s [early reporting on Am Law 200 law firm financials](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/02/24/early-reports-the-2021-am-law-200-financials/) for 2020, and the numbers so far are good, even great.

Despite the coronavirus pandemic and recession that made life so miserable for millions last year, law firms did very well for themselves. Check out this table, showing the firms that Am Law has covered so far and the year-over-year change in their revenue per lawyer (RPL) and profit per equity partner (PPEP):



(If you like, you can access this spreadsheet as a Google Doc [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c9WAOEQO_W5N2LqX91uNG9uSXKoWGIbcSJ2hvxTRFUg/edit?usp=sharing), which also allows you to sort the firms by the change in their RPL and PPEP.)

Of the 29 firms listed above, all posted increases in profit per partner, many of them well into the double digits. The highest figure so far, a 46.6 percent increase, was reported by Crowell & Moring (which led me to declare Crowell my [Law Firm of the Week](https://davidlat.substack.com/p/judicial-notice-february-20-2021) last week). But the firm had plenty of company, with eight other firms posting PPEP increases of 20 percent or more.

Now, the increases in profit per partner might be somewhat understandable, given how the pandemic and working remotely led to dramatic drops in many firms’ expenses, such as rent (in [some cases](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/second-biglaw-firm-litigates-over-rent-on-unoccupied-offices-during-pandemic)), utilities, travel, and entertainment. And yes, some firms did engage in layoffs last year as well.

But revenue per lawyer, which industry observers generally regard as the better metric of law firm financial health (since it’s less subject to manipulation than PPEP), also increased for almost all firms — not as dramatically as PPEP, but still significantly. In recent years, RPL growth in the low single digits has been quite common in Biglaw; but last year, if these early numbers are representative of the whole, perhaps half of Am Law 200 firms enjoyed RPL growth of 5 percent or more in 2020.

In light of these robust revenues and profits, one can understand why law firms paid out “COVID bonuses.” Take Cooley, which kicked off the trend by announcing “[appreciation bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cooley-bonuses/)” in September 2020. The firm posted PPEP growth of a whopping 25.4 percent in 2020. Had Cooley not paid out special bonuses, then reported PPEP growth in excess of 25 percent, it would have had a lot of unhappy campers among its associates and staff.

Congratulations to these firms on their strong performances in 2020. People like to say that lawyers are not good businesspeople, but clearly lawyers are doing something right. The ability of the legal sector to do so well during a period of great difficulty for many other industries is a testament not just to the talent and hard work of Biglaw lawyers and staff, but also to firm leadership. So the next time you encounter one of your firm’s leaders, perhaps in a Zoom town hall rather than in a hallway or conference room, thank them for successfully shepherding your firm through some very dark days.

What do these strong numbers mean for lawyers interested in lateral moves? They indicate that now is a safe time to transition to a new opportunity. Last spring, when the pandemic was at its peak, the economy was in a recession, and law firms were very worried about how they’d fare, it was a risky time to move; candidates feared moving to firms that might hit rough patches after their arrival, threatening their job security as associates or their practices as partners. But now that the economy is on the mend and law firms are not just surviving but thriving, it’s a good time to move to a firm where you’d be more fulfilled.

If you’re thinking about a possible move, please feel free to reach out [to me](https://www.laterallink.com/team/david-lat/) or any of [my colleagues](https://www.laterallink.com/team/) to discuss possible opportunities. We look forward to hearing from you.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

Years ago, students chatting during the precious breaks in on-campus interviewing cattle calls would ponder who among them would really be interviewing with Chadbourne & Parke. The now-deceased firm — sucked up into the Norton Rose Fulbright megalith — was on everyone’s radar as one of the firms representing big tobacco against allegations that the company had willfully deceived the public about health risks for decades. Everyone may deserve an attorney, but not everyone deserves you as an attorney, and for law students at elite schools back then, future lawyers that every law firm would love to have, this was an opportunity to exert some social pressure on a firm tying its bottom line to a public health crisis of the client’s own making.

A couple of decades down the road, law students are taking a page from the past and upping the ante. Last night, law students at HLS [staged a protest at a Paul Weiss recruiting event](https://www.facebook.com/EcoWatch/videos/1393557204148425/) demanding the firm drop Exxon as a client, arguing that Paul Weiss attorneys have facilitated Exxon’s efforts to undermine climate change action. From the group’s press release:

As law students and firm partners mingled at the upscale reception with glasses of wine and hors d’oeuvres, a representative from Paul, Weiss began to address the room. Within seconds, a group of students unfurled a banner reading “#DropExxon” and began chanting over the firm’s speaker. “We, students of Harvard Law School, will not work for you as long as you work for ExxonMobil. Our future is on fire, and you are fanning the flames. If you want to recruit us, then drop Exxon and join us in fighting for a livable future.”

After continuing to fill the reception with chants and songs for 15 minutes, the law students left the room to rally with fellow students and community members who had come together outside the reception to show their support for the action.

The protest in the room ended after 15 minutes as the students moved outside to join more students, including the activists involved in the Yale-Harvard football protest. The organizers are in touch with students at other elite law schools and suspect that this is only the beginning of the high visibility protests against the firm’s fossil fuel work.

“This is a do-or-die moment in human history,” said Aaron Regunberg, a first-year student at Harvard Law School and former Rhode Island state representative. “We have just a few years left to rein in corporate polluters and address the climate crisis. This firm’s enabling of corporations like Exxon to continue blocking climate action and evading accountability for their malfeasance is, simply put, not compatible with a livable future.”

Paul Weiss is certainly not the only firm representing entities like Exxon with a long history pushing regressive positions in environmental litigation, but the reputation Paul Weiss carries in the legal industry is one reason why the protest focused on that firm first. Paul Weiss is known for its liberal lean and high profile pro bono efforts, making the firm one of the most likely to respond to direct action from top-tier law students. While some firms would respond to a protest like this by releasing the hounds and then spend the rest of the night building a styrofoam bonfire to own the libs, Paul Weiss values its role as a bridge between its corporate clients and a conscience. It’s part of their DNA!

This is exactly why the firm got more public flack over its lack of a diverse partner class while [other firms with worse track records fly under the radar](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/sullivan-if-a-biglaw-firm-falls-in-the-woods-and-no-one-issues-a-press-release-about-its-lack-of-diversity/) — part of accepting the mantle as a socially conscious firm is accepting criticism when tensions arise. When it comes to diversity in the partnership, Paul Weiss [responded this year](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/after-taking-heat-last-year-paul-weiss-spent-2019-providing-firms-a-blueprint-for-improving-diversity/).

# Latest Bonus Announcement Leaves Some Important Details Fuzzy
## Is there any catch-up provision here?

Bonus announcements are largely formulaic affairs: “Thank you, blah blah blah, continued success, blah blah blah, here’s the table, make your hours, keep up the hard work.” Which is why any announcement that deviates from the standard is so glaring. It may well be that Mayer Brown is matching the DPW bonus scale the same way most everyone else is. On the other hand, the fuzzy wording really makes you wonder.

First things first, here’s the bonus table. It’s a backloaded match paid out in June and November.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  


So far, so good. Associates have to be on track with their hours as of May 31 and October 31 to qualify for the respective bonus. That’s also pretty standard. But look at the precise wording.

Counsel and associates who do not qualify for the first payment will be eligible to receive the second payment if they achieve the required annualized hours as of October 31.

While most memos include language indicating that someone who misses the first payment will be eligible to catch up if they’ve made up their hours by the time of the second payment detection zone, this seems to say only that missing the first payment doesn’t disqualify someone from the second bonus. Does that mean if someone billed on track from May 31 to October 31 — regardless of where they are for the whole year — they will get the second bonus? Or just that catching up by October 31 only nets the backloaded $7500 to $40K? It feels like the latter. That’s definitely how the tipsters who have written in so far are interpreting it.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And that suspicion seems confirmed by the following line:

Counsel and associates who do not meet the relevant hours requirement at either May 31 and/or October 31, but who do meet that requirement by the year end will be considered for a discretionary Special Bonus payment at that time.

That’s saying that an associate who makes it to the requirement — 2000 “client equivalent hours,” of which 1900 are chargeable — by virtue of an absolutely brutal November and December is only in line for a discretionary bonus. Yikes. By the way, that 2000 number comes from a follow-up memo we got that was sent to Chicago associates noting that this detail was missing from the original. That means they’re aware that the language was fuzzy and still only clarified the hours part.

This isn’t necessarily out of character for Mayer Brown. The firm notoriously uses hours thresholds to determine class advancement too, meaning third-year associates who don’t hit these hours, will still be making third-year money the next year when they’re technically fourth-years. We’ve heard rumors there are senior associates still getting compensated — both base and bonus — as mid-levels.

The [full memo is on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/mayer-brown-special-bonuses/2/). We won’t bother the Mayer Brown people any more today so they can get back to billing!

# Gone Are The Days When A Seat At The Table Was A 'Nice To Have'; It Is Now A 'Must'
## Making sure the 'GC has a ‘seat at the table’ is no longer a good idea -- it’s good business and good governance.'

It has been long debated whether the general counsel should report to the CFO or the CEO. [Ben Horowitz](https://a16z.com/author/ben-horowitz/), cofounder and general partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and author of the New York Times bestseller, “The Hard Thing About Hard Things,” makes a compelling case for why the GC should always report to the CEO and not the CFO in his blog post, [Why I Did Not Go to Jail.](https://a16z.com/2014/02/06/why-i-did-not-go-to-jail/) According to Horowitz, the GC should report directly to the CFO to “guard against employees purposely or accidentally breaking the law in pursuit of their goals.”

In his blog post, Horowitz recounts a time when his new CFO reviewed his company’s practices and processes to ensure that they were both compliant and competitive. After completing that review, his new CFO made some suggestions regarding how his company could modify its stock option granting process to be more competitive. His CFO not only took the position that the proposed process was compliant with the law, she doubled down by asserting that the outside counsel for her former company had designed the process and that the auditors of her former company had also approved it. Before moving forward with the change, Horowitz checked in with his GC, who recommended against it because he felt it exceeded the bounds permitted by law. Because of his GC’s advice, Horowitz did not move forward with the policy change.

As it turns out, it was a good thing. Almost two years later, the SEC announced that it was investigating his CFO’s previous company for stock option accounting irregularities and that it would be launching an investigation into all of the Silicon Valley companies and their stock option accounting practices. When it was all said and done, the SEC found 200 companies guilty of some sort of irregularity and Horowitz’s CFO actually spent three and a half months in jail for the part she played in her former company’s stock option practice.

For the Association for Corporate Counsel (ACC), there is no debate — the GC must report to the company CEO. As [Veta T. Richardson, ACC president and CEO](https://docket.acc.com/author/veta-t-richardson), observes in her article, [What Happens When GCs Aren’t Empowered](https://docket.acc.com/what-happens-when-gcs-arent-empowered), “[c]ompanies that fail to position their general counsel properly do so at their peril — exposing themselves to the dangers of corruption, scandals, and lawsuits.”

Using the resignation of the Danske Bank CEO following a billion-dollar money laundering scandal as her example, Richardson makes the case that making sure the “GC has a ‘seat at the table’ is no longer a good idea — it’s good business and good governance.” She goes even further and not only argues that boards “should pay greater attention to the role and positioning of the GC” but also argues that boards should see the GC’s absence from the executive team as “a red flag that could indicate that laws, ethics, and compliance are insufficiently prioritized by the company.”

Richardson also observes:

“GCs must be properly positioned on the executive team in order to effectively serve their organization.”

“While we may debate different governance models, most GCs agree that at the very least, a direct reporting line to the CEO — and exposure at the board level — elevates their credibility and stature within the organization, empowering general counsel to impact company culture, while demonstrating the company’s commitment to ethics and compliance.”

“General counsel are allies to the executive and, more importantly, to the board — the body charged with an organization’s ethical leadership.”

“The GC’s positioning within the company truly impacts the cultural tone of the organization.”

I hope you read this blog post in full and see these two cases as cautionary tales. If you know of a GC or if you are a GC who reports to anyone other than the CEO, reach out to ACC for resources, starting with [acc.com/governance](https://www.acc.com/governance?_ga=2.41730215.488765987.1687192418-1212157638.1676321617).

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Reinventing The Law Business: Thoughts Inspired By Bill Gates

[Altman Weil](http://www.altmanweil.com/) did a very interesting survey of law firms recently. I don’t think I can provide a link since it was not a public document. However, one thing I found very provocative and interesting was a quote they attributed to Bill Gates:

“We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten years.”

I found this very scary actually, because it made me really think about what the law business might look like in ten years. More importantly, it made me think – maybe for the first time – about what “my” part of the law business would look like in ten years.

As you read this, consider how this applies to you. Don’t think about the next two years but instead think of the next ten, as Gates advises.

I am a real estate lawyer. I handle real estate deals for clients. These deals involve the drafting and negotiation of documents. Of course some of the work we do is relatively simple, but the heart of our business is handling very complicated transactions that require a combination of brainpower and expertise. But let us consider the life-cycle of legal work (the “LifeCycle”).

At first the legal matter at hand, whatever it is, is very difficult to do. No one has done it before. It requires cutting-edge legal thinking to put the pieces together (which I will define as “Brain Work”). Only the highest-quality lawyers at the top law firms can do this Brain Work. If you have read my earlier articles, you will recall the phrase I have coined, [“intellectually fearless,”](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/reinventing-the-law-business-intellectually-fearless/) to describe the lawyers with this capability. These lawyers are very valuable; they can charge almost whatever they like for Brain Work, and clients willingly pay.

But then, the moment the work is completed and sent out by email to the other law firms – and clients – on the deal, the law firm that created it loses ownership of it and many other law firms are capable of following in the groundbreaking firm’s footsteps and doing the legal work (which I will define as “Intermediate Work”). Before long, more and more law firms are capable of doing this Intermediate Work. It is still pretty “hard” though, and not just “anyone” can do it; however, more and more law firms are capable of pulling it off. Pricing of the work drops moderately because clients are now able to comparison shop to a moderate degree since they know that other law firms are doing this Intermediate Work so it cannot be incredibly difficult to do and, hence, not worth as much.

Then as time goes on the legal work becomes more and more mainstream. Someone writes a book with forms and templates and a “how to” guide and, alas, the work becomes subject to the dreaded “commoditization” that not only lawyers, but businesspeople too, fear (and I will define the work as “Commodity Work”). At this point, just about anyone at just about any law firm can do this Commodity Work. Comparison shopping is easy for clients and it is a quick race to the bottom of profitability for the law firms. Pretty soon almost no one is making much of a profit from the legal work.

So, now consider how the pace of change in the legal world is accelerating. One hundred years ago, the LifeCycle I describe above could itself take 100 years to complete. Thirty years ago, when I started my career, I would guess the LifeCycle was about 15 years long. Ten years ago, I bet that LifeCycle was about 5 years. And today – yikes – I bet that the LifeCycle is a year or two at most. The bottom line is that the LifeCycle of legal work – from Brain Work to Intermediate Work to Commodity Work – is shrinking in length, and probably very quickly.

So what will happen in ten years?  It makes me wonder – and worry, although maybe I might worry less since ten years from now will probably be marking the end of my legal career. This is because I bet that in ten years the LifeCycle of legal work will be truncated still further and probably dramatically so. What are the implications of this?

Of course I don’t have a crystal ball; however, I think that legal work will be of two kinds, and not three (as in my LifeCycle above). I suspect legal work will be composed solely of Brain Work and Commodity Work, with little in between, i.e., Intermediate Work will gradually disappear. And the time for the legal work to move from Brain Work to Commodity Work will be very short in length.

So now, apply my thinking to your practice. How are things going to look for you in ten years? And of critical importance, how will you be able to make a profit as a lawyer if I am right? If I am correct in my prediction, you will have to be intellectually fearless on a continuous basis in order to be able to command premium pay for Brain Work or, alternatively, you will have to be very creative about how to produce Commodity Work to be able to eke out a profit, possibly through economies of scale.

I wonder if anyone will reread this article in ten years to see if I am right…

Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Diverse Legal Teams Perform Better — Fact
## With another recruiting season upon us, what is your law firm doing differently to improve diversity?

“I don’t wanna say nothing wrong / But it’d be wrong if I ain’t say nothing / Imagine if I ain’t say something / Wouldn’t anyone say nothing.” – [Kanye](http://genius.com/Kanye-west-champions-lyrics)

Acritas Research recently released its [2016 Diversity Report](http://www.acritas.com/diversity-insight), which uncovered the positive impacts of a fully diverse legal team. Acritas claims that “for the first time in the legal industry we can reveal scientific evidence on the hot topic of diversity.” Few, if any, research reports provide data results exclusive to the legal profession that reveal the specific benefits of diversity.

Based on interviewing more than 20,000 law firm clients over the last decade, Acritas discovered that diverse teams:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
- Earn 25% higher share of wallet.
- Are more than one and half times as likely to achieve a “perfect ten” performance score.
- Receive over three times higher Net Promoter Scores (Bain & Company client satisfaction index).
Not only do diverse teams perform better according to the report, they ultimately receive [25 percent more](http://www.law360.com/articles/795446/gcs-will-pay-more-for-diverse-legal-teams-study-finds) of their corporate clients’ legal spending. As Acritas CEO Lisa Hart Shepherd notes, Acritas’s “robust analysis has proven for the first time in the legal industry that a lack of diversity is detrimental to long-term financial success for law firms.”

The main factors law firm clients mentioned as ways law firms can demonstrate greater diversity include:

- Gender
- Race
- Ethnicity
- Nationality
- LGBTQ
- Industry Experience
- Cross-section of society
- Age

How does your law firm measure up on these diversity factors? “All law firms, no matter your size or focus, can profit from understanding how small changes can lead to big benefits,” according to Acritas.

Other findings from the diversity research include:

- Male general counsel get paid more than female general counsel.
- Male GCs plan to spend more on legal services than female GCs.
- Major differences in legal buying behavior exist between men and women.
Acritas found [only 25 percent of legal teams are very diverse](http://www.acritas.com/news/diversity-delivers-25-higher-share-wallet), and yet the benefits of diverse teams are clear as more diverse teams generate higher performance levels, an increased share of spending, and higher likelihood of being recommended to clients’ peers.

The [business case for diversity](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/5-takeaways-from-mckinseys-diversity-matters-report-for-the-legal-profession/) is strong, so what else will it take to improve diversity in the legal profession? Business as usual will yield only more of the same. While 25 percent of legal teams are considered very diverse, far fewer law firms could claim the same. With another recruiting season upon us, what is your law firm doing differently to disrupt the status quo on this front?

# Another Firm Offers Unlimited Vacation For Associates
## The new ""take all the time you need"" vacation model sounds great on paper, but is there a cynicism behind it?

The new trend sweeping Biglaw is the “unlimited vacation” policy. Paid vacation freed from an arbitrary “four week” restraint! You can finally take that two-month African safari! Who could possibly object to that?

Well, a lot of people actually. Because when you really think about these hip new policies, many lawyers are gonna get burned.

[Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/hogan-lovells/) has joined the “unlimited vacation” party train, though it’s hardly the first participant. When reached for comment, the firm explained:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The firm has joined a number of its Am Law 100 peers in moving to an open vacation leave model which will allow attorneys to take unlimited vacation time as needed throughout the year. We recognize that our attorneys are professionals and, as such, it is increasingly important for them to have flexibility as they plan their schedules to fulfill both their work and personal obligations.

Let’s consider the pros of this policy. Flexibility is certainly a virtue. And in a world where firms are tagging people with vacation days [even when they work for half a day](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/10/sullivan-cromwell-scales-back-vacation-caps-overtime-dinners-in-leaked-memo/), removing the artificial limit on vacation protects the poor sod who ended up turning a document at the beach. But really isn’t the better answer “stop charging vacation days when people have to work anyway”?

There’s also something to be said for having the freedom to take an “adventure” vacation before you’re too old to enjoy it. And yet, most people don’t actually like to vacation that way. After a week or two the silent majority of us just want to sleep in our own beds.

And isn’t “being a lawyer” the biggest impediment to flexibility? Certainly more so than whatever limit the firm places on vacation days. One tipster put it this way:

Attorneys will be able to take an unlimited amount of vacation time, but no one will be paid out for accrued but unused vacation time when they leave the firm. Pitched by management as “take all the time you need” — but no one needed more vacation time when we can’t even use what we have. Pretty clear the firm just wants to stop paying out for accrued vacation time. Not sitting well with associates.

And there’s the rub. In an industry based on billable time, bonus-eligibility targets, and an almost constant stream of work on multiple matters with completely independent schedules, taking 10 vacation days a year is almost impossible already. Firms may not like paying out for unused vacation, but it’s the premium associates get for keeping their noses to the grindstone. It’s the just reward that the young, unmarried lawyers get for keeping themselves chained to their desks covering for everyone on taking days off to watch their kids perform in terrible plays.

I’m sure there’s a good proportion of decision-makers who honestly see this as a fair policy. But as I’ve said [before](http://www.thestreet.com/story/13353752/5/unlimited-vacation-policies-are-on-the-rise-these-companies-aren-t-counting-your-days-off.html):

I think [partners] all know, the kind of gun to your head honesty, they all know they’re setting the associates up for failure, because [those associates] just won’t be able to use it….

But hey, if you’re planning to lateral, my advice would be to take a nice couple-month vacation right before you announce it. You’re not going to be getting your bonus anyway, right?

# Chicago-Based Biglaw Firm Ponies Up The $$$
## The salary wars that started in New York have spurred this firm into action.

Well, well, well. Looks like the moniker “NY to 180” really will have to be changed to “Biglaw to 180.” Chicago-based Biglaw powerhouse Mayer Brown has moved to the Cravath compensation scale for all U.S. offices.

Though it is still headquartered in Chi-town, and that remains the firm’s largest office, it isn’t a slouch in New York. The Big Apple outpost boasts more than 200 lawyers, and it looks like the salary wars that started in New York have spurred this firm into action.

As per the firm’s memo, the raises apply to summer associates and the class of 2016, and they are effective July 1 — all of which are aligned with market trends.

# Chuck Cooper Withdraws From The Solicitor General Sweepstakes

Earlier this afternoon, after posting a story predicting that [Charles “Chuck” Cooper was about to be named solicitor general](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/congratulations-to-the-new-solicitor-general/), I heard from sources of mine who warned me off this angle. So I appended the following note to the piece:

UPDATE (5:03 p.m.): I’ve received pushback from sources claiming that this isn’t quite a done deal — so maybe Chuck Cooper shouldn’t start measuring the drapes at OSG just yet.

I wonder if they had an inkling about this stunning development, just reported by Eliana Johnson and Tara Palmeri of [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/chuck-cooper-solicitor-general-withdraws-consideration-234869):

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Chuck Cooper, the conservative Supreme Court litigator, is withdrawing his name from consideration to be the next solicitor general, opening the door for the husband of Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway to be appointed to the role.

“I am deeply honored by any consideration that I may have received by Attorney General Sessions and President Trump for appointment as the Solicitor General, but I have asked them to discontinue any further consideration of me for that critically important position,” Cooper said in a statement Thursday.

Whoa!!! You can say many things about the early days of the Trump Administration, but they’re certainly not boring.

UPDATE (6:20 p.m.): See, e.g., the just released [Ninth Circuit ruling on Trump’s travel ban](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/9th-circuit-upholds-temporary-restraining-order-on-trumps-muslim-ban/).

What’s behind Chuck Cooper’s surprising, perhaps even shocking, decision?

In an interview on Thursday afternoon, Cooper told POLITICO that he wasn’t prepared to undergo the grueling confirmation process. “Life is too good and too short,” he said.

In his formal statement on the decision to withdraw, Cooper added: “After witnessing the treatment that my friend Jeff Sessions, a decent and honorable man who bears only good will and good cheer to everyone he meets, had to endure at the hands of a partisan opposition that will say anything and do anything to advance their political interests, I am unwilling to subject myself, my family, and my friends to such a process.”

Sure, Chuck, you would’ve had to endure some criticism over your involvement in such matters as the Bob Jones litigation, Hollingsworth v. Perry, and the federal government’s treatment of job applicants with AIDS back in the 1980s. But come on — solicitor freaking general! Arguably the [best legal job in America!](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/a-great-legal-job-or-the-greatest-legal-job/)

But look, Cooper has had some amazing jobs over his long and distinguished career, including Supreme Court clerk and head of the Office of Legal Counsel. If he has made the calculus that he doesn’t want to subject himself to bruising partisan politics, that’s his choice to make. Best of luck to him in all of his future endeavors.

Does this clear the way for longtime Wachtell Lipton partner George T. Conway III to become SG? Here’s what his wife, presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway, [told Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/chuck-cooper-solicitor-general-withdraws-consideration-234869) earlier this week (before Jeff Sessions got confirmed as attorney general):

George is a brilliant and accomplished lawyer who is willing to serve this president. At the same time, I’ve been quiet about the specific roles for him partly because of my role here and because the attorney general has not been confirmed. He’s willing to serve and I know that’s a decision he’s made. He would be the first Asian solicitor general, but he could also be a judge.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Based on my [firsthand knowledge of George Conway](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/an-exciting-new-entrant-in-the-solicitor-general-sweepstakes/), he would be outstanding as solicitor general or on the other side of the bench. Good luck to him as well, wherever he might land.

UPDATE (7:22 p.m.): How did Chuck Cooper go from frontrunner yesterday to withdrawing from consideration today? Well, consider this: last night, Rachel Maddow ran [an extremely harsh, 15-minute segment](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/republican-actions-on-race-are-no-accident-873191491574) — takedown or hit piece, depending on your point of view — all about Cooper. It wouldn’t be shocking if Cooper viewed that as a harbinger of the brutal battle ahead and said, “Thanks, but no thanks.”

UPDATE (10:09 p.m.): Expect a decision on the SG within the next week:

.[@potus](https://twitter.com/POTUS) [@realDonaldTrump](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump) to me in hallway""I will be making a decision on the Solicitor General in the next week"" SG argues before SCOTUS

— Kelly O'Donnell (@KellyO) [February 10, 2017](https://twitter.com/KellyO/status/829843779259621377)

UPDATE (2/10/2017, 9:35 a.m.): Is the race opening up again? Per Ariane de Vogue and Eli Watkins of [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/09/politics/chuck-cooper-solicitor-general-donald-trump/):

A source told CNN that Trump was still in the process of interviewing candidates for solicitor general. The source said potential candidates include George Conway, husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, as well as Kannon Shanmugam and Christopher Landau.

After all these weeks, have we come full circle? I discussed Shanmugam and Landau as possible SG contenders in my [very first post on this subject](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/who-will-be-the-next-u-s-solicitor-general/), back in December. It sounds like the identity of the next SG is anyone’s guess.

# After Layoffs Last Year, Cooley Delays Start Date For First-Year Associates
## More austerity measures at the firm.

At the [end of last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/classic-stealth-layoffs-those-performance-based-layoffs-at-cooley-hit-high-billers-too/), Silicon Valley Biglaw mainstay Cooley LLP instituted layoffs for associates due to “[overcapacity](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/cooley-sees-a-double-digit-income-drop-amid-layoffs-due-to-overcapacity/)” issues. But that didn’t signal the end of their issues.

According to a tipster at the firm, “they emailed incoming first years yesterday that they will be pushed to January 2024” — the class was originally scheduled to begin their employment in November of this year. As [reported by Bloomberg Law, ](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/cooley-delays-start-date-for-next-crop-of-first-year-associates)to help the soon-to-be associates deal with this change in status, they’ll receive a $10,000 stipend from the firm.

Back in September, however, after things had just started to go south, the firm was said to have [implemented an associate hiring freeze](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/hiring-freezes-and-stealth-layoffs-hit-top-50-biglaw-firms/), but denied the official existence of such a program at the time.

# Mental Health In The Legal Profession: Why It’s Time To Cease And Desist
## We need to reduce the mental health stigma as a profession and an industry.

This past weekend, in preparation for an upcoming move, I found myself digging deep into cleaning out old boxes of letters and cards. Among old birthday cards and handwritten letters, I also came across a printout email chain of correspondence between a supervising partner and myself from 2007 when I worked in Biglaw. I chuckled as I read the lines, “I should not have to remind you of your job obligations. I have no confidence you are doing as you are told.” I held onto those emails for a reason: I wanted to be able to reflect on them a decade later and remember just how far I had come.

I could still remember the feeling of sheer terror when I first received his emails back in 2007. The sad part is that I received daily berating emails from him. He would print his motions out to the main printer in the hallway and send me an email telling me to retrieve them for him like I was his gofer. And, if by chance, I didn’t make it to the printer to grab my draft motion before another male associate grabbed it, I would receive a lecture on how I needed to proofread my drafts before they hit the main printer so I didn’t embarrass him or the department with errors in my draft motion (which was three rounds shy of proofreading). I was the only female associate in the department. I had no one to commiserate with, and on my worst days, I would lock myself in the bathroom stall and let tears pour out until I could venture back to my closet-sized office and continue being his gofer. On paper, I was working for a prestigious law firm, building my resume, and I was earning a lot more money than some of my law school classmates. What other alternative did I have?

According to the [ABA Journal, a recent study](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/more-women-than-men-lawyers-engaging-in-risky-drinking-study-finds) reported that depression symptoms, anxiety, and stress are higher in women attorneys since the pandemic, and 1 in 4 women have considered leaving the profession due to mental health concerns. A new [ABA report](https://www.americanbar.org/news/abanews/aba-news-archives/2021/05/new-aba-report-examines-experiences--challenges-faced-by-women-l/) openly discussed the problems that women lawyers face, which span from disparity in power, disparity in promotions and pay, discrimination, and lack of opportunity.

I have never forgotten what it was like to work for this partner, or subsequent others who followed closely in his footsteps. Like the women in the ABA report, I too have faced harassment, discrimination, and pay disparity. Many of those examples led me to not only want to leave law but seek help for anxiety that developed from being in such abusive environments. Wrapped up in my insane work ethic was a relentless perfectionist who worried about disappointing others and herself. On one hand, it propelled me to be a high-achiever and high-performer in my business, so I didn’t have to go back to working for a nightmare Biglaw partner. On the other hand, the stress during the higher-than-normal flows of work felt like an endless bout of worry that consumed me internally with how much I need to do.

When I [got COVID-19](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/how-my-battle-with-covid-19-taught-me-its-okay-to-take-those-sick-days/) in mid-March, it was a giant wake-up call for my physical and mental health. I began to create more boundaries and truly acknowledge that I am only one person and that I can tackle only so much in a day. I realized that without my health or quality sleep, I cannot thrive in my work or personal life. I am now transparent if I need an extension or need to push something out on my calendar because I have too much on my plate that day, week, or month. As lawyers, we are trained to say “yes” to the partner, to the CEO, to our client, and to everyone else who we feel “owns” us. But, at what expense or detriment to us?

We need to reduce the mental health stigma as a profession and an industry. We need to stop treating young associates like they are gofers and stop making them fearful they are replaceable at any moment. We need to start valuing paid time off and safeguarding our weekends so our batteries can be recharged for better productivity. We need to respect the “out of office” message or the notice of unavailability. After all, we are human beings first.

# The Legal Industry Keeps On Losing Jobs
## Should you panic yet?

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) had [more bad news for the legal industry](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/legal-sector-loses-1100-jobs-in-october/) on Friday. That’s when it released the jobs data from February and reported the legal sector lost 200 jobs that month — this on top of 1,200 jobs that were lost in the industry in January.

The BLS numbers were, overall, rosy for the economy. As [reported by ](https://www.law.com/2018/03/09/legal-employment-dips-even-as-u-s-exceeds-job-growth-expectations/)Law.com, 313,000 jobs were added overall in February:

While Friday’s employment release from BLS shows a slight dropoff in the number of legal services jobs in the United States, the country’s economy as a whole enjoyed strong job growth results in February. The agency reported that the U.S. economy added 313,000 jobs in February, marking the country’s 89th consecutive month of job growth. The results [reportedly outpaced](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/09/business/economy/jobs-report.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news) the expectations of economists, who had anticipated that about 200,000 jobs would be added in the month.

So where did all the legal sector jobs go?

Well, the BLS numbers include more than just lawyer jobs — job losses for paralegals, legal secretaries, and other members of a law firm’s staff are counted too. So the [Biglaw trend](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/biglaw-firm-announces-hundreds-if-not-thousands-of-buyouts-across-the-country/) of cutting back on administrative positions in an effort to streamline costs — one that [isn’t ending anytime soon](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/staff-layoffs/) — tanks the numbers.

# NFL Lock Of The Week: Players Will Lose Their Disciplinary Appeals
## Take Paul Clement minus anything.

For Dallas Cowboys fans who see a [vast conspiracy against them](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/dallas-cowboys-fans-see-judicial-conspiracy-in-elliott-ruling/), those fears weren’t allayed yesterday when the [Second Circuit rubberstamped](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/nfl-lock-of-the-week-players-will-lose-their-disciplinary-appeals/2/) Judge Katherine Polk Failla’s denial of Ezekiel Elliott’s effort to enjoin his six-game suspension. Just as they deflated Tom Brady’s hopes of avoiding suspension, the Second Circuit took one look at the collective bargaining agreement and swiftly sent Elliott and the NFLPA packing.

There’s a time for a union to zealously defend its members, and there’s a time for them to save their resources and realize they completely botched the last agreement and gear up for the coming strike. This is the latter occasion.

The last collective bargaining agreement gave Roger Goodell god-like powers over the lives of the players and, somehow, [the union agreed to this](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/nflpa-continues-to-ignore-the-awful-cba-it-agreed-to/). It sucks, but wasting hundreds of thousands of dollars on Winston & Strawn’s Jeffrey Kessler (as well as a team from Gibson Dunn) isn’t going to make that agreement go away. Kirkland’s [Paul Clement](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=12018), taking a break from his usual work eroding the fundamental pillars of 20th Century American society, is going to win these cases for the NFL every goddamned time.

Maybe if the Trump administration would go ahead and nominate Clement to the federal bench instead of [Scrappy Doo over here](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/trump-judicial-nominee-is-a-ghost-hunter-proving-the-bar-can-always-go-a-little-lower/) the union could stand a chance. But between the Kirkland team Clement would leave behind and Akin Gump (who is also repping the NFL) they’d still be more than capable of dropping the CBA in front of the judges and saying, “Take a look at the pages I flagged, we’re going outside for a cigarette, so call us when you’re done.”

The union deal is so terrible that they’re looking to Jerry Freaking Jones [as their savior](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/sports/jerry-jones-nfl-roger-goodell-david-boies.html). He’s brought 2017’s Most Popular Lawyer In America, David Boies, on board to support his nascent coup to oust Goodell. Newsflash for Goodell — if you start noticing [Israeli spies following you around](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/david-boies-takes-responsibility-for-enabling-harvey-weinstein/), you’re toast.

Still, there’s a bittersweet justice at work in watching Roger Goodell get an education in the plight of the players:

It’s just bitter that the players’ union can’t figure out how to be the ones teaching that lesson and have to depend on the NFL’s wackiest owner getting a bee in his bonnet to see some progress.

# The State With The Poorest Lawyers
## That's a lot less money.

Whenever Biglaw offers another salary boost — as they did last year — many of us allow the Cravath-approved scale to serve as a stand-in for lawyer salaries generally. But Biglaw isn’t the norm and attorneys around the country can and do get by on lower salaries, even if law school isn’t appreciably cheaper for them.

Forbes recently took a look at [attorney salaries across the country](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewdepietro/2019/11/18/lawyer-salary-state/#7740115a79a1) and the compensation gains lawyers have made over the past few years. Unsurprisingly, California and New York have the country’s richest lawyers on average. But what state has the country’s poorest lawyers?

It’s Montana, where the average lawyer salary is a mere $88,600. How bad is that? To put it into perspective, that’s almost $10K less than the state with the second lowest average salary (which is Mississippi at $97,990).

It’s a little surprising that Montana is so low on this list. No one expects New York salaries in Missoula, but the state has powerful ranching and energy interests that one might have thought could support some high-priced attorneys to inflate that average.

But, as the author of the Forbes piece notes, things are arguably pretty good for Montana attorneys because salaries are actually up 17.6 percent since 2013. Watch out, Mississippi!

# The Biglaw Firms On A Lateral Hiring Spree, Despite The Pandemic

Even though COVID-19 continues to rock the legal world (yes, coronavirus austerity measures are still happening), not every firm is cutting back. Indeed, some Biglaw firms are going the opposite direction and hiring more attorneys, pandemic be damned.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2020/06/30/buoyed-by-recent-gains-firms-embrace-opportunistic-hiring-amid-pandemic/) Law.com, Lowenstein Sandler is one of those firms, and they are even holding (socially distant) interviews in managing partner Gary Wingens’s Livingston, New Jersey, backyard. And they’re looking to hiring in a number of different practice areas:

Wingens, whose firm added a new head of life sciences transactions in late April, views the current moment as the start of a brand new economic cycle. That means a focus not just on the “practice of the moment,” but those expected to grow in coming years, like privacy and cybersecurity, investment management and technology.

“We’re trying to figure out where that proverbial puck is going, rather than where we are today in this somewhat surreal work world,” he said.

Cozen O’Connor is another firm going on a lateral hiring spree. Since the beginning of March, they’ve added 25 new attorneys, eight of whom are partners, mostly in the transactional and class-action litigation spaces,

Haynes & Boone is also in growth mode, adding 39 attorneys in 2020 with a focus on health care, IP, and fund formation practices. Eleven of those hires are partners, the most recent of whom are life sciences attorneys, and the firm is using the tumultuous times to their advantage:

“We’ve stuck with the plans that we’ve had, and we’ve been able to maximize those,” [Managing partner Tim Powers] said. “Any time there is a market disruption and you are a beacon of stability within that disruption, you can show that stability.”

Sound finances are critical, too. Haynes & Boone had its best first quarter in the firm’s history, according to Powers, who added that the firm, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary, was already looking to grow moving into 2020.

Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo’s managing partner Bob Bodian also expressed that the pandemic was a time for his firm to surge forward, and not be conservative:

Mintz, which announced the hire of a former[ Boies Schiller & Flexner partner](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/06/29/mintz-picks-up-boies-protege-who-counts-sony-ron-howard-as-clients/) Monday, had the benefit of closing its fiscal year March 31. According to Bodian, the firm beat its budget for equity partner profits by 25%. That allowed the firm to increase hold backs while keeping distributions above what would have been expected at budget. This follows a five-year spell where the firm is up 50% in both profits and revenues.

“We sort of hit the pandemic running,” said Bodian, who promised several more announcements in the coming weeks.

So despite how bleak the legal landscape may seem, there are definitely some firms out there taking advantage of COVID-19.

There’s a lot of Millennial bashing in the media and most of it’s stupid. Boiled down to its essence, hating on Millennials amounts to [calling them weak](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/12/millennials-this-is-why-you-fail/) for being on the losing end of the financial crisis every other generation dropped on them. Throw in a dig about using their phones too much and you’ve got a fully formed and perfunctory op-ed that the New York Times will [gladly publish](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/opinion/making-modern-toughness.html).

But there is a problem with the Millennials out there that no one is talking about. They are way, way, way too nice.

At the Association of Corporate Counsel annual meeting, a lively panel discussion tackled the generational gaps in the practice of law in Bridging Generational Gaps: How to Reveal and Deal with Implicit Bias, featuring [Ryan Evans](https://www.accmeetings.com/am17/FacultyRecord.aspx?id=12676), Director, Corporate Counsel at Jack in the Box; [Elizabeth Henries](https://www.accmeetings.com/am17/FacultyRecord.aspx?id=12703), Corporate Counsel at Donna Karan; [Welly Tantono](https://www.accmeetings.com/am17/FacultyRecord.aspx?id=12699), Country Counsel at Hewlett-Packard Asia Pacific; and moderated by [Camille Olson](https://www.accmeetings.com/am17/FacultyRecord.aspx?id=12325) of Seyfarth Shaw LLP.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

It’s a timely topic now that the workplace is as age diverse as ever before. Whether you want to blame medical science or the gutting of the social safety net for seniors, around 18 percent over workers over 50 say they have no desire to ever retire. Just one more obstacle for the next generation hoping to get their bite at the apple! If offices are going to thrive, everyone needs to understand their coworkers and, most importantly, avoid letting their implicit biases poison the workplace.

The Builders: This is the moniker the panel gave those born before 1945. They’re not quite the Greatest Generation, and they weren’t old enough to fight in WWII, but they came of age during the conflict or the Depression, giving them, generally, a heightened sense of dedication and sacrifice.

The Builders respect hierarchy and loyalty — qualities that workplaces had back when they started out — and want to be consulted based on their experience as workers who’ve earned their stripes. The Boomers describe these workers as too structured, which is some serious Oedipal stuff right there. The Gen Xers tend to appreciate the Builders but think they need to be more adaptive. Meanwhile Millennials think they’re trustworthy and brave and good leaders. Jesus, bootlickers.

The Boomers: According to the panel, these folks are enjoy being on teams and “proving themselves to the team.” That seems like a fancy way of saying “narcissists,” but to each their own. Just to underscore this, the panel explained that Boomers are uniquely driven by affirmation of their contributions. But they hold 70 percent of the disposable income in the country, so we’re all at their mercy.

The Builders think Boomers are too open, Xers say they lack work-life balance and have skewed priorities, and the Millennials think they’re cool and up-to-date on the new music. Seriously, what is up with these kids?

Gen Xers: Global thinking, work-life balance, self-reliance, and a sharp distrust of corporations. They “see problems and want to fix them.” Like, you know, good people.

The Builders don’t like that Gen X doesn’t respect the beaten path. Is it just mean or would the Builders make wonderful ants? Millennials think Gen X is “too negative.” Well at least the Millennials could be bothered to criticize one generation. But the most precious reaction came from the Boomers who feel Gen X is “sometimes too direct and hurt people’s feelings.” Damn right, get over it snowflakes.

Millennials: The most diverse generational segment and, finally, the one most represented in the workforce. They’re open to new ideas of how to achieve and even though no one plans to be with any one employer long-term, they have a pro-business attitude and tend to like their companies.

It’s a generation inspired by civic duty, community, tech, and — as the above suggests — optimism. How?!?!? They’ve grown up in Satan’s dumpster fire! The economy robbed them of their jobs, they get routinely crapped on by every hack with a keyboard, and they’ve come out of this happy? Perhaps they really are a redux of the Builders. Great Depression/Great Recession. WWII/War on Terror. There’s something there. The Builders certainly see that kinship, describing Millennials as smart and well-behaved. The Boomers think “they need more personal attention than we did,” which seems impossible. Xers think not community focused enough, probably because they’re too corporate. Tellingly, no one thinks they’re the layabouts that make the Sunday op-eds.

Yet another leading law firm has matched the Cravath salary scale. Wait a second, you might be thinking. Didn’t this firm announce a salary update just last week? Why, yes, yes, it did! This is going to be happening a lot, so we hope there’s no confusion.

Paul Weiss — a firm ranked at No. 20 in the most recent Am Law 100, with $1,543,730,000 in 2020 gross revenue in 2020 — was one of the first firms to [match Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/paul-weiss-raises-22/), and now it’s one of the first firms to match Cravath. The firm announced its second set of salary increases according to the following grid:



The firm didn’t even bother to update the salary grid with its adoption of the Davis Polk scale because it happened such a short time ago that the money hasn’t even reached associate bank accounts yet.

The firm’s re-raise is retroactive to January 1. Congratulations, yet again!

Andrew Caspersen (Park Hill Group)

As we mentioned [earlier today](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/morning-docket-03-29-16/), Andrew Caspersen, a 39-year-old Harvard Law School graduate turned Wall Street executive, just got hit with federal charges alleging a $95 million fraud scheme. Federal prosecutors accuse him of stealing $25 million from investors and planning to steal an additional $70 million. For an excellent explanation of Caspersen’s alleged fraud, see former [Dealbreaker](http://dealbreaker.com/) editor Matt Levine’s [detailed post at Bloomberg View](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2016-03-28/real-investment-adviser-sold-some-fake-investments).

For present purposes, let’s focus on Andrew Caspersen’s status as legal-world and Wall Street aristocracy. Ever passed time in the Caspersen Student Center at Harvard Law School? Same Caspersen family. Andrew’s father and three brothers all graduated from HLS.[[1]](#f1)

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Andrew Caspersen’s father, Finn M.W. Caspersen, was heir to a family fortune tied to the Beneficial Corporation, the consumer-finance company he led as CEO before it got sold in 1998 for $8.6 billion. In 2008, Finn Caspersen pledged $30 million to HLS.[[2]](#f2) In 2009, Finn Caspersen [took his own life](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/16/business/16suicide.html), amid reports that he was battling kidney cancer and under investigation for tax evasion.

Andrew Caspersen seems to have spent all or most of his post-HLS career in business, according to the [American Lawyer](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202753495634/Feds-Charge-Harvard-Law-Grad-With-95-Million-Scheme?mcode=1202615717726&curindex=0&curpage=1). Before joining the Park Hill Group investment advisory firm, where he worked from January 2013 until just now (he got fired after being charged), he spent one year at Westby Corp., a real estate company controlled by the Caspersen family, and nine years at London-based Coller Capital Inc. But two of his three older brothers have stronger ties to the legal world. The oldest brother, Finn Caspersen Jr., worked for a predecessor firm to WilmerHale and is now general counsel at Peapack-Gladstone Bank in New York. The third Caspersen son, Samuel Caspersen, worked at Sullivan & Cromwell and is now in-house counsel at Westby Corp., the same family-controlled real estate company where his brother Andrew once worked. (The second of the four Caspersen boys, Erik Caspersen, is a partner at New York-based 9W Capital Management.)

Here’s another Biglaw tie-in, noted by [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-28/andrew-caspersen-charged-by-u-s-with-95-million-fraud-scheme). Although Andrew Caspersen is now married, he previously dated the late Catherine Fairfax MacRae, granddaughter of one of the founders of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae. LeBoeuf Lamb, of course, was one of the two predecessor firms to the ill-fated Dewey & LeBoeuf. After Catherine MacRae lost her life in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Caspersen reportedly worked with her family [to establish a memorial fund in her honor](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202753495634/Feds-Charge-Harvard-Law-Grad-With-95-Million-Scheme#ixzz44ImSvW00).

One obvious question raised by the allegations against Andrew Caspersen: why would the scion of a fabulously wealthy family, who also earned [more than $3 million a year](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-29/banker-accused-of-25-million-fraud-arose-from-a-gilded-legacy) from his job at Park Hill Group, risk it all to, well, just make even more money? That’s not clear. At a court hearing yesterday, Caspersen’s lawyer, federal prosecutor turned McKool Smith principal [Daniel Levy](http://www.mckoolsmith.com/professionals-Daniel_Levy.html), alluded to his client suffering from mental health and substance abuse problems.

It’s also not clear how much wealth Caspersen still has. Opposing the prosecution’s $20 million bail request, Levy claimed that “losses have eviscerated any assets” (presumably referring to losses Caspersen suffered while trading options on the S&P 500, which is what he allegedly did with some of the $25 million proceeds). Magistrate Judge James Francis [released Caspersen](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/business/dealbook/private-equity-executive-accused-fake-investments.html) after he posted a $5 million bond, co-signed by three people and secured by two properties.

Princeton and Harvard Law is quite the pedigree, as reflected in the meteoric rises of Justice Elena Kagan and Senator Ted Cruz. But pedigree is not destiny; just ask Andrew Caspersen.

[ [1]](#reff1) Will the Caspersen Center get renamed? Probably not — the alleged sins of the son shouldn’t affect the late father’s donation, and even though Finn Caspersen himself was being scrutinized for possible tax offenses at the time of his death, he was never convicted. I suppose it’s possible, though; if the HLS crest or seal [isn’t sacred](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/harvard-law-school-takes-a-scythe-to-its-wheat-crest/), then nothing is (except for, I hope, the [Falik Men’s Room](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/02/true-story-harvard-law-sells-naming-rights-to-its-new-bathrooms-and-a-berkeley-law-professor-couldnt-be-happier/?rf=1)).

[ [2]](#reff2) As noted by the [American Lawyer](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202753495634/Feds-Charge-Harvard-Law-Grad-With-95-Million-Scheme?mcode=1202615717726&curindex=0&curpage=1), the elder Caspersen’s contributions to Harvard Law over the years got a shout-out in a 2007 book by Daniel Golden, [The Price of Admission: How America’s Ruling Class Buys Its Way into Elite Colleges](http://amzn.to/1RI2zhC) (affiliate link). Commenting on the book, Finn Caspersen’s [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_M._W._Caspersen) states, “All four of his sons were graduated from Harvard Law School, though Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and Harvard alumnus Daniel Golden, in a book criticizing the role of privilege and wealth at elite colleges, attributed their admission to the prestigious law school to their father’s generosity.”

# Rudy Giuliani Tries To Pay Mounting Legal Fees One Awkward Birthday Greeting At A Time
## Cameo becomes Giuliani's next trick.

(Screenshot via Cameo)

Having been [stiffed by the former president](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/trump-stiffs-rudy-for-all-his-amazing-legal-services/), looking at a [flopped Gofundme](https://www.businessinsider.com/rudy-giuliani-allies-legal-defense-fund-aid-investigation-lawsuits-2021-6), and [without a Biglaw job as a safety net](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/rudy-giuliani-cut-loose-by-biglaw-firm-3-years-ago-why-is-he-still-claiming-to-work-there/), Rudy Guiliani has to find some way to pay the legal fees piling up in those pesky criminal probes he’s landed in. Where is a guy to turn when the Eastern European lobbying… er… “consulting” dries up?

Apparently, the answer is Cameo.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Rudy Giuliani announced on Twitter that he would be joining Cameo, offering his surely deeply thought out and personal greetings for $400 a pop (which is up from $199 the day before this story… do with that information what you will). And you thought Biglaw billing rates were unjustified.

But Rudy isn’t expecting people to shell out that kind of money without offering us a sample of just how seriously he takes his new job. His [Cameo page](https://www.cameo.com/rudygiuliani?%24web_only=true&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=video_share&utm_medium=ios_app&_branch_match_id=699723756825580213) — which you really should check out — offers some demo videos.

Folks, they are a journey.

First, we have a birthday greeting to “Molly,” who we’re told has a beautiful voice and a podcast. At this point, Rudy pivots to explaining that, as it happens, he TOO has a podcast. Fully a third of the message is then dedicated to laying out how to subscribe to “Rudy’s Common Sense” podcast. The Cameo game seems a little fuzzy to me, but I’m pretty sure it’s not supposed to be a sales pitch. If I wanted to spend money just to hear someone else’s sales pitch, at least promise me a time share!

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Our second birthday greeting is for “Joe,” who eats too much Wendy’s and tries to meet pretty girls doing beach yoga. Sounds like a guy who really has his shit together. You know you’re winning at life when your friends are asked to sum you up as a human being for the benefit of a disgraced politician and all they can come up with is “he likes Baconators and being a creep.” Oh, he also has bad taste in quarterbacks, which Rudy doesn’t understand because fantasy football seems lost on him.

Only a 20-second plug for Rudy’s Common Sense this time! Did you know it’s free to subscribe?

Rudy’s also got pep talks! He gives “Johnny” a congratulatory message as he enters his first year at NYU with a dream of eventually becoming a lawyer. To be fair, this is Rudy’s best Cameo because he earnestly approaches it like the deadbeat uncle you haven’t talked to in years who just showed up at your graduation party. Giuliani shares his story about going to NYU for law school, “which I’m sure you’ll see every day on the way to class… Hayden Hall.” Hayden is a dorm, but whatever. Also, I went to NYU for law school and there was nothing to suggest Giuliani went there… and he was inexplicably popular back then.

But he really does offer useful advice and encouragement mixed with the usual platitudes. As for being a lawyer, he explains that “there are a lot so many different ways to be a lawyer, you can be a trial lawyer, a commercial lawyer, a business lawyer”… or you can be a farting your way through a bogus election challenge kind of lawyer. The world is your oyster!

Unfortunately, Johnny will never learn how to subscribe to Rudy’s Common Sense because it slipped Giuliani’s mind this time.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

“Andre” gets a 50th birthday message from “Alexandria.” She didn’t fill out the form very well because Rudy’s got absolutely nothing to work with here other than how old the guy is. But pop in a vague “you’re as young as you want to be” reference

Finally, “Rich” has retired and gets a call from America’s Dingbat Mayor. Ole Rich is moving to Florida and hates cancel culture. Of course he does. Rudy takes this opportunity to say that people from the Northeast are moving to Florida because of Democrats as opposed to year-round summer weather.

While we assume Giuliani signed up for Cameo thinking he was locking down a cameo in a major motion picture, only later learning that the platform is the “Total Landscaping” of bit movie parts, we certainly wish him the best in his new endeavor. And if you ever want to let a friend know about Rudy’s Common Sense, it’s just a $275 investment away.

# Associates Left Law Firms In Droves Last Year. Why'd They Go?
## Associate attrition was at the highest recorded rate last year.

NALP Foundation for Law Career Research and Education[ released](https://www.nalpfoundation.org/news/nalp-foundation-releases-update-on-associate-attrition-for-calendar-year-2021) an update on associate attrition. And, as hinted at by [the hot lateral market](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/biglaw-job-offers-without-interviews-what-hath-the-hot-lateral-market-wrought/) for associates in 2021, attrition was also at a high.

So, about that attrition rate — it was 26 percent in 2021, which, it was 16 percent in 2020… yup, that’s a pretty stark difference. In fact, it was the highest attrition rate recorded in the history of the survey, which began in 2006. Associates of color were even more likely to leave their law firms, with an attrition rate of 34 percent last year, compared with 18 percent in 2020.

Overall, 7,278 associates were hired in 2021 — compared with only 2,772 in 2020. And, while, yes, some were part of the normal associate churn that requires firms roll out the red carpet for law students in the hopes they’ll join the firm post graduation, a whopping 53 percent were laterals.

All this attrition talk is certainly noteworthy, but most startling are the associates that left their firms less than a year after being hired. That figure clocked in at 8 percent, broken out into 10 percent of laterals and 6 percent of newbie lawyers.

So why are associates bailing on their firms? The survey lists the pursuit of specific practice interests as the top reason at 19 percent of respondents, a career change to another type of legal job came in second at 17 percent, third was the answer we’ve all not-so-secretly been waiting for — better compensation at 12 percent, and wanting to move to a new geographic location came in at fourth with 10 percent of respondents.

Whatever reasons associates left their firms in 2021, here’s hoping their new job is a better fit.

Jose Baez and Casey Anthony (Photo by Joe Burbank-Pool/Getty)

Earlier this week, news began to spread that Jose Baez, the trial attorney who rose to fame through his representation of acquitted murderess Casey Anthony, may have acted very unethically throughout the entirety of their attorney-client relationship.

In an affidavit filed last month in connection with Anthony’s Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, Dominic Casey, a private investigator who was hired by Baez to work with the defense team during Anthony’s murder trial, alleged that not only had Baez told him that Anthony had murdered her daughter, but that Baez had worked out a deal with Anthony to trade sex for legal services. Here are some details from the [New York Daily News](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/casey-anthony-paid-lawyer-sex-court-papers-allege-article-1.2650617):

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The private investigator recalled one night in 2008 when he watched Baez cancel a TV interview on Anthony’s schedule after the mom said she didn’t want to go through with it.

“He called the network, saying they would have to take a raincheck, hung up the phone and said to Casey: ‘You now owe me three [blow] jobs,’” Casey said.

Did Jose Baez allegedly have a quid pro blow relationship with Casey Anthony? Dominic Casey claims that Baez’s inappropriate behavior only grew worse as time passed. Here’s an excerpt from Casey’s affidavit (available in full on the next page):



For his part, Baez has threatened to sue over Casey’s statements, issuing a categorical denial in a written statement given to [PEOPLE](http://www.people.com/article/jose-baez-hits-back-dominic-casey-allegations-sexual-relationship-with-casey-anthony): “I unequivocally and categorically deny exchanging sex for my legal services with Ms. Anthony. I further unequivocally and categorically deny having any sexual relationship with Ms. Anthony whatsoever. I have always conducted my practice consistent with the high ethical standards required of members of the Florida Bar. My representation of Ms. Anthony was no exception.”

James Quinn

Where do you go after spending more than four decades at one of the world’s leading law firms? The golf course might be the answer for many — but not for [James W. Quinn](http://www.bafirm.com/attorney/james-w-quinn/), who left Weil Gotshal & Manges to join the New York office of one of the nation’s top litigation boutiques, [Berg & Androphy](http://www.bafirm.com/).

During his time at Weil, Jim Quinn handled some of the firm’s biggest cases, including a number of headline-making sports law matters. He also served in firm leadership, as longtime head of the litigation department and as a member of the management committee. At Berg & Androphy, which he joins as of counsel, Quinn will continue to try cases and also expand his [mediation practice](http://www.jwquinnlaw.com/).

If you spend even a small amount of time with Jim Quinn and David Berg, founding partner of Berg & Androphy and a top trial lawyer himself, you’ll be struck by their easy rapport. They finish each other’s sentences, interrupt one another frequently (without getting on each other’s nerves), and generate lots of laughs. You’d think they had been partners for decades.

And in a sense they have. They first worked together in the mid-1990s, defending Westinghouse Electric Corp. at trial against allegations that it provided a nuclear power plant in Texas with faulty generators that were leaking radioactive material.

Working as co-counsel doesn’t always generate close ties, but it’s more likely to when you spend as much time together as Quinn and Berg did. “There’s no bonding experience like a jury trial,” as Berg told Gabe Friedman of [Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/no-retirement-71-year-old-lawyer-leaving-weil-wants-more-trials/) — and that’s especially true when the trial lasts for six months and takes place in Bay City, a tiny town in southeast Texas.

After that matter ended successfully, Quinn and Berg stayed in touch, both personally and professionally. As Berg mentioned to Brian Baxter of [Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/top-stories/id=1202776977505/Two-Top-Sports-LawyersOn-Opposite-SidesSwitch-Firms?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=1&slreturn=20170018124740), Quinn would sometimes refer work that he couldn’t handle at Weil because of conflicts — including one case in which Berg [obtained a $420 million settlement](http://www.bafirm.com/result/david-berg-as-plaintiffs-lead-counsel-obtained-a-420-million-settlement-of-a-suit/) from Marriott.

David Berg

A few years ago, Berg started to spend more time in New York City, mainly for personal reasons. In July 2015, Berg & Androphy [launched a New York office](http://www.bafirm.com/2015/07/law-firm-focus-berg-androphy-opens-new-york-office/), led by former Kasowitz Benson partners Michael Fay and Jenny Kim. In the middle of last year, Quinn and Berg started exploring the possibility of Quinn coming on board.

Now it’s official — and it makes perfect sense. Although Quinn has been recognized as a [“legendary litigator”](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/renowned-trial-lawyer-james-quinn-joins-berg--androphy-in-new-york-300392422.html) by the Legal 500, the “L word” doesn’t do him justice; he is a true trial lawyer, one who brings cases before juries — and wins. So he’s a great fit at Berg & Androphy, a firm full of seasoned trial lawyers — including David Berg himself, [described by one former general counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/5-litigation-lessons-from-joe-jamails-trial-strategy-in-pennzoil-v-texaco/) as “the St. Jude for bet-the-company cases.”

Berg and Quinn hope to try cases together once again, although they recognize that the litigation environment isn’t what it was back in the 1990s. The major change: many fewer cases go to jury trial. About [1 percent](https://bol.bna.com/no-retirement-71-year-old-lawyer-leaving-weil-wants-more-trials/) of federal cases reach a jury today, compared to more than 10 percent back in 1962.

I spoke with Berg and Quinn by phone earlier today — while Quinn was on break from a mediation, showing that he’s not missing a beat as he transitions from firm to firm — and I asked them: what’s behind this trend of the vanishing jury trial, and what can be done about it?

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
“One of the main causes is that folks have gotten more risk-averse, especially when it comes to going to trial before a jury,” Quinn said. “It’s due in large part to the enormously increased cost of going to trial, especially in large commercial cases. I personally think it’s unfortunate. As for the likelihood that it can be reversed, I’d love to see that, but I’m not confident it can be.”

Some of the fault for the decline of trials can be assigned to the U.S. Supreme Court, Berg said. In a series of cases, covering such subjects as pleading requirements, the standards for granting summary judgment, and alternative dispute resolution (especially arbitration), the Court “has created procedural hurdles that do an end run around the Seventh Amendment right to a civil jury.”

Another culprit, according to Berg: the Chicago school of law and economics and one of its leaders, legal academic turned Seventh Circuit judge Richard Posner. Although Posner is “so smart and funny, I kind of hate him,” the economic analysis of law that he pioneered “has really undermined the law, especially for the little guy.”

The declining number of jury trials led us naturally to chat about alternative dispute resolution — particularly mediation, which Jim Quinn will focus on at Berg & Androphy. He couldn’t resist referring me to the website for his mediation practice, [JW Quinn ADR LLC](http://www.jwquinnlaw.com/) (which led Berg to humorously mutter, “Just stand outside in a sandwich board!”).

“One of the reasons I started my mediation practice is that so many of these major commercial cases are being mediated,” Quinn explained. “Mediation doesn’t always lead to settlement, but there’s almost always going to be a mediation, sometimes as a matter of course. As a result of mediation and other forms of ADR, there are fewer and fewer cases available to go to trial.”

A desire to grow his mediation practice was a big part of Quinn’s decision to leave Weil for Berg & Androphy. As he explained to both [Am Law](http://www.americanlawyer.com/top-stories/id=1202776977505/Two-Top-Sports-LawyersOn-Opposite-SidesSwitch-Firms?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=1&slreturn=20170018124740) and [Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/no-retirement-71-year-old-lawyer-leaving-weil-wants-more-trials/), working at a Biglaw firm like Weil Gotshal, while wonderful in many ways, can create a perception of being too closely tied to large corporate clients. Because one key to being a successful mediator is getting the parties to trust you early on, such perceptions, even if inaccurate, can be limiting.

James Quinn is far from the only prominent lawyer to leave a Biglaw firm for a boutique. I asked him for his outlook on the future of Biglaw. Does he buy into the predictions of doom, or at least those of a massive winnowing of hundreds of firms down into dozens?

“There will be some winnowing in the middle ranges,” Quinn said, “but Weil and the established firms will continue to thrive. They have the ability to bring together a huge amount of legal firepower, not just in litigation but also in various types of corporate law, which large companies will continue to want for the things that really matter — the biggest deals and litigations.”

Of course, Jim Quinn cautioned, some Biglaw firms have true trial lawyers, and some do not. If you are a client looking for a firm to represent you in a matter that might go to trial, you need to make sure that the firm has true trial expertise — like Berg & Androphy.

“Jim and I look forward to trying some cases together,” David Berg said. “We did very well the first time, and I suspect we’ll do fine in the future. What made this happen is that we have a great deal of respect for each other’s trial skills. In fact, I think Jim worships me.”

“As far as our trial skills go, David’s great,” Quinn said. “But I’m greater.”

Spoken like true trial lawyers. Best of luck to James Quinn and David Berg as they enter the newest chapter of their long and illustrious careers.

# What Should I Use For A Writing Sample?
## There's no perfect answer -- but here are a few guidelines, from veteran recruiter Abby Gordon.

In addition to your resume, representative matters sheet, and J.D. transcript**, as a lateral litigation associate candidate, you will need to include a writing sample with your application materials. Candidates often ask me for guidance on what type of writing to use.

Unfortunately, there is no perfect answer, as each reader is different. But here are a few guidelines:

- There must be absolutely, positively NO typos or grammatical errors in the writing.
- The writing should be very clear and not convoluted. Do not confuse complex writing with good writing. Stay away from overly academic writing.
- The closer the writing is in terms of style and industry focus to something you’d be writing in your new position, the more helpful it will be in terms of assessing your abilities. That being said, good writing is more important than subject matter.
- You must be able to say honestly that you were the primary drafter of the work, with limited edits/revisions from others. But everyone understands it’s unrealistic if you’re producing work you did for a firm that NO ONE else has given any input.
- Most firms are looking for something in the 8-15 page range — give or take. I wouldn’t get hung up on exact length unless the firm specifies. If needed, you may send something longer and direct the reviewer to a specific 8-15 page section.
- Be sure the writing is redacted for any confidential information, if necessary. In particular, redact the client/parties’ names and any other key identifying items. It’s often best to play it safe by using a brief, motion, or other writing that has been filed publicly — if you don’t have to redact, the writing is likely to flow better. But client memos are just fine if properly redacted.
- Be sure you can talk about the subject of the writing articulately (after refreshing your memory at least). Be prepared to discuss the writing and the matter in an interview.
- Some decision-makers will give the writing sample more weight; others will not read it at all. We don’t always know the reason why a candidate is not selected for interviews, but I’d be shocked if the writing sample makes or breaks it. Don’t overthink it!
My best advice? Go with your gut. What do you feel (not think) is the best example of your best writing?

** Generally, when applying to a firm as a lateral associate, you will need to provide a resume, representative matters sheet (a “deal sheet” for corporate associates), a J.D. transcript, and a writing sample for litigation candidates. Very few positions will also require an undergrad transcript. For more senior positions, a business plan might be helpful. Of course, it’s also essential to convey to a firm your reasons for wanting to make the move, but when applying through a recruiter, it’s the recruiter who drafts the cover note; you do not need to draft a formal cover letter.

In February of 2018, Andy Sandler retired from the practice of law, leaving the firm he co-founded, Buckley LLP, which used to be known as Buckley Sandler, to serve as chairman of the financial services industry consulting firm  Treliant Risk Advisors, and be CEO of compliance software provider Asurity, and to run the private investment company, Temerity Capital Partners. But according to a statement by Buckley’s managing partner, Benjamin Klubes, the retirement came amidst an investigation into Sandler’s misconduct.

As [reported by](https://www.law360.com/articles/1208122/buckley-co-founder-retired-amid-misconduct-probe-suit) Law360, the firm says that allegations against Sandler were made in 2017 and they promptly launched an investigation into his behavior. Klubes also said that Sandler refused to participate in the investigation, and instead, retired:

Klubes said the initial allegation against Sandler came to their attention in late 2017 and, “consistent with firm policy,” management quickly hired Latham & Watkins LLP partner Kathryn Ruemmler “to conduct a fair and confidential investigation into the allegations in a manner that respected the privacy and confidentiality of the individuals who raised concerns.”

“Mr. Sandler refused to cooperate with the investigation, or to answer any questions from Ms. Ruemmler, and instead chose to retire from the firm,” Klubes said. “Buckley acted swiftly to address the allegations while protecting the privacy and confidentiality requested by each of the individuals who had raised concerns about Mr. Sandler’s conduct. While we promised that confidentiality to those individuals, we never sought or required confidentiality from them.”

The sordid background of Sandler’s departure from the firm became public because of an insurance battle. The firm’s insurer is trying to avoid paying the firm a $6 million payment for “loss of a key employee” over Sandler’s retirement. The insurer, Oxford Insurance, said in a court filing that during their investigation, Sandler said his departure was actually involuntary, and that the allegations of misconduct predated the effective date of the policy:

An independent claim adjuster hired by Oxford found that by December 2017 — before the policy went into effect — three Buckley partners were aware of allegations of misconduct against Sandler “from years earlier,” “which could lead to Mr. Sandler being terminated by Buckley,” according to the complaint. Oxford did not detail the nature of the allegations, and Buckley’s managing partner, Benjamin Klubes, declined to elaborate.

According to Oxford, despite having knowledge of the allegations, neither Sandler nor any of his colleagues disclosed them when applying for the insurance policy.

Klubes’s statement also said the firm is “confident that the full factual and legal record will demonstrate that it handled the matter appropriately and that it is entitled to payment under its ‘key person’ insurance claim.”

# Turns Out 'Special Bonuses' Are Just Money From COVID Salary Cuts At This Biglaw Firm
## These aren't the same special bonuses as other Biglaw firms.

When you hear Biglaw “special bonuses,” what do you think of? Probably money on top of an associate’s expected compensation. But as associates at Ogletree Deakins are learning, that isn’t always the case.

Ogletree instituted some severe austerity measures as a result of COVID-19 which included [furloughs, cutting their summer associate program](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-cuts-salaries-offers-unpaid-leave-cancels-summer-program-with-no-pay-no-guarantee-of-employment/), and [reduced pay](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/not-satisfied-with-unpaid-leave-am-law-100-firm-slashes-salaries-for-all/) for equity partners, associates, and highly compensated staff. But come the fall, they were able to [restore compensation](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/am-law-100-firm-restores-pay-to-pre-pandemic-levels-keeps-special-associate-bonuses-in-play/). And they announced [a special bonus of $10,000 that was supposed to pay associates who bill 1,700 hours in 2020](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/am-law-100-firm-offers-special-bonuses-for-associates/) (associates who bill 1,900 hours were to receive an additional $10,000 on top of the special bonus, and those who exceed 2,000 hours qualify for a bonus based on a percentage of their salary).

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Notice how I say “supposed to”? Now that year-end bonuses have rolled around, an email sent by managing partner C. Matthew Keen paints a different picture ([full email available on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/ogletree-bonuses/2/)):

I’m pleased to announce that, in light of the improved economics of the firm, all associates will receive at least 100% of their regular compensation in 2020. For most of those that hit 1700 hours in 2020, the $10,000 special bonus the firm adopted earlier this year will more than cover the 5% pay reductions that occurred between May and August of this year. Those that did not hit the 1700 hours will receive a payment equal to 5% of annual compensation by December 31. Those for whom the $10,000 bonus does not equal 5% of their annual compensation will also receive payment by the end of the year to account for the difference. All other bonuses (1900 hours, hours over 2000, originations, etc.) will be paid in addition to regular compensation. For 2020. those associates that exceed 1900 hours by December 15 will receive their $10,000 Program 1 bonus on or before December 31. Associates exceeding 1900 hours after December 15 will receive their payment in March of next year, when bonuses are normally paid.

So, those “special bonuses” were really just associates’ normal salary. That… doesn’t seem so special. And tipsters at the firm are less than pleased:

This is laughable. In September the firm announced a special $10k Covid bonus if you hit 1,700 hours and then all the normal bonuses would remain the same for 1,900+. Now they are just taking away the covid bonus and saying we’ll repay salaries in full that were cut. That’s nice but all this does is reward those who didn’t bill much. How cheap can the firm get? How about you pay us all back the salaries you cut AND also keep in place the covid bonuses?

What we are left with is a normal year’s program that rewards low billers and does nothing to acknowledge the difficulties of 2020. Shameful. I bet the shareholders did better than ever this year too. It is no wonder associates have been fleeing.

Really shows the steep drop from haves AmLaw25 to the have nots

Listen, [restoring salary cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/biglaw-firm-announces-full-retroactive-salary-restorations-for-all-plus-some-bonus-news/) is great![ Retroactive payments](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/am-law-50-firm-offers-retroactive-pay-for-all-plus-amazing-benefits-for-lawyers-who-became-caretakers-during-pandemic/) of those [cut salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/billion-dollar-biglaw-firm-will-completely-eliminate-its-covid-cuts-restore-full-pay/) is [even better](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/this-am-law-100-firm-has-reversed-all-salary-cuts-and-is-making-good-on-promise-of-back-pay/)! But they aren’t special bonuses (which is why other firms call it[ back pay](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/am-law-100-firm-announces-end-to-salary-cuts-and-compensation-for-all-pay-lost/), [make-whole payment](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/duane-morris-rollbacks/),[ retroactive salary restorations](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-firm-restores-pay-cuts-retroactively/) or something similar). Especially not in a year when Biglaw is handing out actual money *in addition to salaries and year-end bonuses* because that is a “special bonus.” Not the sleight of hand Ogletree is pulling.

But I guess it’s good news that things are at least back to normal at the firm.

As always, we depend on you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

Biglaw bonus season started really early in 2018, and some firms are just now getting around to handing out extra cash to their associates. Another bonus announcement just reached us from Hughes Hubbard & Reed, and the firm has what a source describes as a “complicated, tiered bonus structure.” Oh goodie…

Before we get into that hot mess, the firm also announced its salary scale for its New York, New Jersey, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, and Miami offices. HHR is offering up [Milbank scale’s](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) first-year salary for its associates, and not [Cravath’s improved 2018 scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) for the rest of them, but [Cravath’s 2016 scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) instead:

- Class 2018: $190,000
- Class 2017: $200,000
- Class 2016: $210,000
- Class 2015: $235,000
- Class 2014: $260,000
- Class 2013: $280,000
- Class 2012: $300,000
- Class 2011+: $315,000

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Now, about those bonuses. From what we understand, the firm has a minimum of 1700 client-billable hours to be eligible for a bonus in the first place. Thereafter, associate bonuses are broken down into four tiers (1900 hours, 2050 hours, 2250 hours, and 2450 hours), including total client-billable hours, Quality GO, pro bono, and business development hours. On top of that, the firm has even more qualifying caveats for bonus eligibility. We see why our source said this was “complicated”:



And now for the moment you’ve all been waiting for, HHR’s bonus tiers. Unfortunately, if you’ve done the bare minimum at this firm, it looks like you’ll be in OPM 404: Market Bonus Not Found territory, but if you’ve been working yourself to the bone, you’ll come out ahead of the market. Check it out:

So take, for example, a class of 2011 associate. The market bonus (aka [Cravath bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/breaking-cravath-announces-annual-bonuses/)) for that seniority level is $100,000. At Hughes Hubbard, a class of 2011 associate will get a little over half of market for billing 1900 hours ($60,000), a shade over market for billing 2050 hours ($108,333), even more over market at 2250 hours ($118,333), and for 2450 hours — which is a ton of hours — that associate will get a decent amount above market ($138,333).

On the bright side, if you didn’t qualify for a tiered bonus based on hours, HHR allowed just 20 associates to apply for a $5,000 consolation prize bonus (i.e., a little pity bonus of sorts that was less than the prorated stub-year bonus being offered at almost all other Biglaw firms).

Congratulations to the associates at Hughes Hubbard who really put their noses to the grindstone, because they all came out on top. Those who believed in work/life balance or were in practice groups without a lot of work to go around found themselves woefully under-market during bonus season.

Remember: as soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. You can also text us if you prefer, at 646-820-8477.

# Harlan Crow's Lawyers Tell Senate They're Going To Take Their Chances With Contempt

Clarence Thomas BFF #1 Harlan Crow engaged Michael D. Bopp of Gibson Dunn to inform the Senate Judiciary Committee that he won’t be cooperating with its inquiry into the [hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gifts](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/paragon-of-virtue-clarence-thomas-has-been-given-millions-of-dollars-in-value-off-the-record-and-it-totally-hasnt-impacted-his-judging-not-one-bit-nope/), [free tuition](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/clarence-thomas-ethics-scandal-kid-school/), and [gratuitous living expenses](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/appearance-of-bribery-political-megadonor-wants-us-to-believe-he-bought-and-improved-justices-moms-house-off-the-record-because-of-history-or-something/) he’s doled out over the years.

The [full letter](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/harlan-crow-gibson-dunn-senate-letter-clarence-thomas/2/) (gathered by Emily Birnbaum and stitched into a single file by Mark Joseph Stern) fills several pages with words just to hammer the same non sequitur that the Senate can’t impose ethical rules upon the Supreme Court and therefore the body has no business investigating exactly how much Clarence Thomas collected over the years. To wit:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
After careful consideration, we do not believe the Committee has the authority to investigate Mr. Crow’s personal friendship with Justice Clarence Thomas. Most importantly, Congress does not have the constitutional power to impose ethics rules and standards on the Supreme Court. Doing so would exceed Congress’s Article I authority and violate basic separation of powers principles. That precludes the Committee from pursuing an investigation in support of such legislation.

Except… they absolutely possess the constitutional power to impose public disclosure requirements on the Supreme Court. Which we know because that’s the federal law that Clarence Thomas has already broken.

The 1978 Ethics in Government Act imposed the disclosure requirement that apparently — [and repeatedly](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/judiciary-thomas-ethical-lapses-2012/) — slips Clarence Thomas’s mind. The 1989 Ethics Reform Act included a provision barring officials — including the justices — from “accept[ing] anything of value from a person . . . seeking official action from the individual’s reporting entity [or] whose [financial] interests may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the individual’s official duties.” That’s a prickly one when [Harlan Crow had business before the Supreme Court](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-24/clarence-thomas-friend-harlan-crow-had-business-before-the-supreme-court).

In other words, Congress has broad power over the justices as government officials generally and an entirely reasonable legislative interest in determining whether or not its existing reporting rules have been breached and, if so, how they should be amended.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Gibson Dunn manages to never cite either of these laws over the course of the letter, locking in on the “imposing a code of judicial ethics” canard. Simply ignoring the most salient counterarguments and hoping no one notices is certainly one strategy, though it’s a strategy elite law firms generally avoid.

Except when they know they have no answers.

Though the firm does such a slapdash job arguing Crow’s “good” argument that it might be for the best that it never attempted to tackle the weaker ones. Because there may be a separation of powers argument for limiting congressional inquiry into the judiciary but this ain’t it:

Unlike the lower federal courts. the Supreme Court was established by the Constitution, not by an act of Congress. See U.S. Const. art. III. § 1 (“The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court.”). Thus. while Congress’s enumerated powers include the power to “constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court.” and that power entails a degree of control over the operations of the lower courts, no similar authority exists with respect to the Supreme Court.

The letter explains that Congress is limited to jurisdiction stripping and impeaching justices. But the Constitution doesn’t set the size or structure of the Supreme Court. Rather, the Constitution granted those powers to Congress, which we’ve known since at least 1789 when the legislature passed the Judiciary Act setting up the Supreme Court. That’s not to say a colorable separation of powers argument doesn’t exist out there… but it sure as hell isn’t hiding in the Framers’ interpretation of how Congress relates to the Court.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Gibson Dunn writes “as noted, there is no enumerated power that endows Congress with the authority to regulate the Supreme Court’s internal affairs.” Really? In the 1789 Judiciary Act, Congress set the meeting times and quorum requirements for the Supreme Court! Does no one do any research over there?

The answer, it turns out, might be “no.”

Later in the submission, Crow’s lawyers argue passionately that the courts have the right to “manage th[e] [Court’s] own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases” citing Link v. Wabash R. Co., 370 U.S. 626. 630-31 (1962). If you think those are a suspicious number of brackets… you’ve got a keen eye. Link is about the power of lower courts to sua sponte dismiss cases for failure to prosecute.

This is the best they came up with for this proposition? Maybe it’s the best there is for this proposition, though that’s not encouraging for Crow.

Then they cite Chambers v. NASCO, 501 U.S. 32 (1991) in support of a trial court’s power to hold lawyers in contempt. Cool cite, bro.

But the letter saves the best for last, using its final section to scold the Committee that investigating Thomas personally is not a legitimate legislative purpose. Which might be true as far as it goes, but then the letter gratuitously inserts this:

It is clear that the Committee’s investigation is part of a larger campaign to target and intimidate Justice Thomas and unearth what the Committee apparently believes will be embarrassing details of the Justice’s personal life.

But… but… Thomas is already legally obligated to disclose all this! It’s not targeting or intimidating when it’s already the law! How did a major law firm allow this sentence to go out under its letterhead? It may not be the Senate’s job to cross-reference Thomas’s disclosures with Crow’s files, but it’s a bizarre choice to characterize “following the law” as intimidation.

Wading through the legalese gibberish, the letter amounts to a lengthy declaration that Gibson Dunn is advising Harlan Crow that it doesn’t think the Senate Judiciary Committee has the resolve to take the necessary steps to trigger a contempt of Congress charge.

Which might be the only thing about the whole letter that rings true.

What losing presidential candidate joined the firm of Miller, Boston and Owen. The firm was promptly renamed, giving the candidate’s name top-billing… where it remains today.

Hint: Even though he lost, Gallup polling months after the election indicated a whopping 60 percent of Americans felt he would have made a good president.

See the answer on the next page.

# Ex-Biglaw Partner Alleges 'Toxic Boys Club Locker Room' In Lawsuit
## The firm disputes the allegations.

A former non-equity partner at Biglaw firm Thompson Hine has filed a complaint against the firm and three of the equity partners alleging gender discrimination. The lawsuit calls out Richard DePalma, former vice chair of litigation, for creating a “toxic boys club locker room” in the firm’s New York office. Rebecca Brazzano filed the complaint in the Southern District of New York late last week, seeking $15 million. She alleges DePalma acted inappropriately to her and other women in the office, and funneled work to male attorneys.

The pro se complaint alleges, “Thompson Hine cloaks their equity predators, like DePalma, behind the camouflage of its Ivory Tower, and enables rampant and disturbing discriminatory conduct by partners with actual ownership to strategically veil and shelter their unlawful conduct from the unforgiving scrutiny of the Courthouse.”

Specifically, “DePalma implemented and perpetuated the old boys’ network and created a hostile frat boy work environment in the Business Litigation Group in the New York office, including his command performance litigation meetings were [sic] he merely recanted tales of his weekend escapades which were off topic and off color.”

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/02/26/ex-partner-sues-thompson-hine-over-toxic-boys-club-locker-room-environment-in-nyc/) Law.com, the complaint also details how Brazzano’s billables were impacted by the culture of the office.

As vice chair of litigation, DePalma allegedly hoarded litigation workflow “to falsely increase his own billable hours” or directed the work to male attorneys. From the time DePalma assumed vice chair at the end of 2010 until Brazzano’s departure from the firm in 2022, she stated that he never steered incoming work in her direction.

Brazzano said DePalma’s harassment, while not “physically threatening,” was “humiliating,” as DePalma allegedly “bad-mouthed” her to colleagues. Brazzano alleged DePalma went as far as to recommend against Brazzano’s elevation to non-equity partner.

Brazzano, who was elevated to non-equity partner in 2013, was asked to leave the firm in 2022 over alleged performance issues.

However, the complaint paints a different picture, with Brazzano saying it was her refusal to approve expenses that were contrary to the firm’s pro bono policy on a pet project of DePalma’s that led to her dismissal.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“It is alleged here that Plaintiff’s exposure of DePalma’s sham pro bono endeavor, along with Plaintiff’s stated intention to close DePalma’s ability to enter any new related time entry, triggered a volatile reaction,” she said in the complaint. “The prospect of a female lawyer…exerting authority over him proved insufferable, resulting in a tumultuous and visceral eruption of DePalma’s ego and further fueled his discriminatory conduct directed at Plaintiff.”

The firm disputes the allegations in the complaint with a spokesperson saying, “Ms. Brazzano’s complaint does not have merit and the firm intends to defend fully against her allegations.”

# Am Law Top 50 Firm Finally Weighs In On New Compensation For Associates
## New salaries will be given to 'mostly all associates.'

We’re now into the first full week of July, and we’re still hearing about Biglaw firms that have finally decided to match the new market starting salary of $205,000 for first-year associates. Some of those firms, however, seem to be doing things a little differently.

Last week, we heard rumors that K&L Gates — a firm that brought in $1,019,674,000 gross revenue in 2020, landing it at No. 40 on the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — called a meeting for associates to announce that the firm would be matching the new salary scale. Those who attended were told that “mostly all associates” would receive individualized emails concerning their new salaries. “Mostly all associates”? Why not all? Hmm….

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
On Friday, an insider at the firm let us know that “some” associates had received word about their raises that day. Sources say the firm didn’t supply a compensation scale, but that those who were “lucky to get a increase” received an email from Amy Horn, the chief people officer of K&L Gates, which stated the following:

I am writing in follow-up to messages you would have received from your Office Managing Partner or their designee regarding the Firm’s market based associate compensation adjustments. You will find on Peoplesoft a letter confirming your revised annual salary by clicking HERE. This will be your compensation beginning on July 1 and behind. This will be reflected in your paycheck received on Thursday, July 22.

Congratulations to those at the firm who received individualized salary increases on the $205K scale. To those who still haven’t heard about their new compensation (or won’t be receiving raises at all), may the odds be ever in your favor for more money — the firm certainly has enough of it to go around.

(Flip to the next page to see the memo from K&L Gates.)

# Goodwin Is Conducting 'Performance Reviews' That Have Resulted In Job Cuts
## The line between layoffs and performance-based cuts is growing awfully blurry.

Goodwin Procter kicked off 2023 with a [round of layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/am-law-20-firm-begins-layoffs/), eliminating about 5% of the firm’s timekeepers, including associates and all manner other attorneys. With the band-aid ripped off, other firms began to conduct their own reductions in force, and some have started to defer their incoming associate classes. Now that we’re halfway into the year, rumors of layoffs at Goodwin have surfaced once again. What’s going on at the firm?

According to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/06/27/goodwin-performance-reviews-lead-to-cuts-as-mid-year-reviews-increase/), Goodwin is in the middle of performance reviews which have resulted in out-of-work associates. If that sounds like the firm is performing stealth layoffs, you may be right on the money based on past precedent.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Here are some additional details from Am Law:

One source with knowledge of the matter said the cuts were part of a biannual performance management process, which yielded fewer departures than is customary in a typical biannual review cycle.

“We conducted a reduction in force in January 2023, as widely reported at that time. We have not conducted a reduction in force since then,” Goodwin said in a statement.

The firm declined to provide any more information. As a policy, it does not comment on performance-related cuts.

How can you tell the difference between a stealth layoff and a genuine review-based termination these days? Liz Soderberg, a legal recruiter at Lateral Link, spoke to Am Law and noted that performance-related cuts are happening across firms because associates are now being held to a higher standard amid economic turbulence.

“People that in a healthy year might be floating by are on the chopping block,” Soderberg said. “We’re seeing more of that. Firms are being opportunistic. They have the advantage over talent now.”

# The Clerkship Whisper Network
## Many students know little about the work environment they’re entering when they take on this particularly consequential first legal job.

Law students — regardless of their law school’s ranking and financial resources — overwhelmingly lack transparent information about judges as managers and clerkship experiences. The legal profession places an enormous premium on judicial clerkships, treating them as a “gold star” or a necessary check box for many jobs in the government, academia, law firms, and even a later judgeship. Yet many students know little about the work environment they’re entering when they take on this particularly consequential first legal job.

Students and clerks regularly describe the clerkship application process as “opaque,” “nebulous,” and “a black box.” They rely on their law schools for information. Unfortunately, because many law schools prioritize their relationships with the judiciary over their duty of care to students, clerkship hiring has long resisted transparency, standardization, and reform.

How do law students obtain information about judges? And is enough candid information accessible to them?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The [clerkships whisper network](https://columbialawreview.org/content/the-clerkships-whisper-network-what-it-is-why-its-broken-and-how-to-fix-it/) is the backdoor, secretive, fear-infused method of partial information sharing, whereby clerks “whisper” about mistreatment. But few prospective clerks exist in the coveted circles to hear these whispers. Even if they are fortunate enough to obtain some candid information about judges, clerks may assume they won’t be mistreated or that they can handle it. But they should not have to endure mistreatment simply because the judiciary is unwilling to hold bad actors accountable.

Due to law schools’ imbalanced and overly optimistic clerkship messaging, students lack the tools to properly evaluate information. Schools continue sending clerks into unsafe work environments rather than holding judges accountable for misconduct, thereby perpetuating the whisper network and contributing to a cycle of workplace mistreatment.

We are entering another busy season of 2L clerkship advising. But is this advising effective? Law schools tell students to [“do their research”](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/do-your-research-stick-it-out-and-other-things-law-schools-should-stop-telling-students-about-clerkships/) about judges before applying. But current practices — Google, The Robing Room, The Almanac of the Federal Judiciary, and anonymous T-14 blogs — could hardly be called “research.” A few law schools conduct post-clerkship surveys of their alumni. Some — but not all — make those accessible to students. (A few would prefer to “filter” the information themselves.) But the responses are overwhelmingly positive, rendering them basically useless to students seeking candid information. Law clerks are told — including by clerkship advisors — never to say anything negative about a judge, and certainly to never put it in writing.

Furthermore, because law clerks have historically been [overwhelmingly white and male](https://www.nalp.org/0221research), survey responses are not representative of applicants’ identities or lived experiences. A black LGBTQ+ female applicant’s clerkship experience with an older white male judge will likely be different from that of a straight white male clerk. But post-clerkship surveys are not racially representative due to the persistent lack of diversity among clerks. Since approximately 1,700 federal judges and more than 30,000 state court [judges](https://iaals.du.edu/sites/default/files/documents/publications/judge_faq.pdf) hire clerks annually, and new judges are appointed and elected each year, no clerkship advisor knows about all the judges students will apply to. There will always be gaps in schools’ knowledge.

Students are also encouraged to reach out to current or former clerks for information. But many schools don’t maintain robust alumni networks. The response rate to students’ cold outreach on LinkedIn is low. Furthermore, consider the type of clerk who is willing to field this type of outreach: they probably enjoyed their experience. Mistreated clerks ignore outreach from prospective clerks: they fear saying anything negative about a judge but don’t want to steer applicants toward the judges who mistreated them.

Every law school has a ceiling on the number of judges they know about, restricted by who alumni have clerked for in the past and their willingness to share information with their schools. When the experience is negative, clerks do not share this with anyone, especially the law schools that facilitated these clerkships. When students apply for clerkships with judges the school doesn’t know about, some clerkship advisors contact colleagues at other schools. For every single interview. To connect a student with just one or two clerks. This is both incredibly inefficient and likely unrepresentative of the full range of clerkship experiences.

Law schools know some judges mistreat clerks. Yet they share that information selectively, filtering it or whitewashing it. They message that even [a “challenging” clerkship](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/law-students-ask-the-right-questions-before-clerking/) — a euphemism for mistreatment — is “worth it” for the prestige. Too many students accept taxing clerkships — not fully understanding the role they’re taking on — harming their mental and physical health and possibly their future career prospects.

I’ve spent the past 18 months creating a system for clerkship transparency — a [Centralized Clerkships Database](https://www.legalaccountabilityproject.org/clerkships-database) — to democratize information about judges and encourage information-sharing across law schools. Yet some clerkship directors, deans, and faculty members would rather perpetuate the clerkships whisper network than possess concrete written evidence that some judges mistreat clerks. Because then they might need to consider acting on it, which could, they fear, decreasing their number of prestigious clerkship placements.

Law schools have historically [been part of the problem](https://yalelawandpolicy.org/inter_alia/law-schools-are-part-problem-they-can-and-should-be-part-solution). They’re part of a dependency feedback loop with the judiciary and legal employers. Confronted with a solution — greater transparency and access to thousands of surveys about judges they don’t know about, from law clerks and courthouses across the country — too many are skeptical. A few are even hostile.

Some clerkship advisors have told students that I want to “abolish” clerkships. They claim they’re “blessed” to work with “only good judges,” and “all” their alumni have positive clerkship experiences. They tell me most mistreated clerks “just want to keep their heads down and move on.” They’ve asserted they don’t believe judges mistreat their clerks: “it’s just women adjusting to their first jobs.” And my alma mater — in addition to telling me it’s their “official policy” not to warn students about judges who mistreat their clerks — [wondered aloud to Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/judging-judges-new-database-lets-law-clerks-speak-out-2023-06-14/) how anyone could ensure law clerks wouldn’t make false statements about judges — evidencing a total lack of understanding about the culture of silence, fear, and gross underreporting that plagues judicial clerkships.

Law schools should be held accountable for this poor behavior. Students look to them for clerkship information — and often not much further. Students deserve to know their law schools have competing interests to balance — student and alumni wellness versus clerkship numbers, public perception of the school, and relationships with judges. Schools are incentivized to downplay challenging work environments and oversell the benefits of clerking.

Some clerkship advisors enjoy their gatekeeping role. They’d like every applicant to seek their advice. But students who feel the advising is not culturally sensitive deserve transparent information too. When law schools gatekeep information, applicants don’t obtain the information they need before applying, or they opt not to clerk at all, which has career ramifications.

At some schools, professors are the clerkship gatekeepers. Unfortunately, they too lack firsthand knowledge of workplace treatment and [judges’ managerial styles](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/not-every-good-jurist-is-a-good-manager/). Their priority is to protect their existing judiciary relationships by sending candidates each year. Furthermore, not all students can connect with these “rainmaker” professors, foreclosing opportunities. The clerkship system is inequitable and unjust.

Some law schools don’t want proof that judges mistreat clerks. They suspect it. They hear whispers. But with concrete information, perhaps they’d have an obligation to warn students, or dissuade them from clerking for certain judges. They’d prefer not to, especially if the clerkships are prestigious, the judge is an alumnus of the school, or the school has a relationship with the judge. Schools will prioritize their relationship with every single judge — even those who mistreat clerks — over their obligation to students, until they’re called out forcefully.

Why wouldn’t law schools want students to have more not less information about judges? Applicants deserve the unvarnished truth straight from the keyboards of clerks who experienced it, not half-truths filtered to law schools’ comfort levels.

A third-party, independent repository of clerkship information is the solution. Law schools won’t be faced with the “difficult” decision of whether to share negative information about judges with students. Students can search for it themselves.

It’s time for everyone in the legal profession to acknowledge some uncomfortable truths, recognize their roles in perpetuating problematic behaviors, and commit to achieving solutions. Some clerks are mistreated because they lack information about the work environment they’re entering. Others are mistreated because law schools filtered information about judges and messaged the positions as “challenging” but “worth it” for the prestige. Too often, information is not shared by those who have it — law schools and former clerks — with students who need it because mistreated clerks do not have a safe, anonymous way to share information without risking their careers and reputations. Furthermore, law schools cower in the face of the judiciary, refusing to stop sending clerks to notorious harassers or implement large-scale, industry-disrupting changes that recognize their role in the problem.

As the key facilitators of judicial clerkships, law schools should be part of the solution. Clerkship hiring is based on an outdated apprenticeship system: it’s beyond time to improve the judiciary through better clerkships.

We should tell [the truth about judicial clerkships](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/we-should-tell-the-truth-about-judicial-clerkships/): they are not an unadulterated good. Conversations about clerking that don’t broach [potential downsides](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/options-for-law-clerks-to-address-wrongful-conduct/) do a disservice to law students and law clerks. The longer that powerful people — including law school deans, clerkship directors, and faculty members — refuse to speak out and fix the system, the more harm we do to the legal profession. Law clerks are the next generation of thinkers and leaders, and they deserve better.

# From In-House To Law Firm: Returning To Private Practice Is A Growing Trend

A common career path is to graduate from law school, spend a few years practicing at a firm, and then take a job as an in-house counsel. Biglaw associates are drawn to in-house opportunities to escape the billable hour and to benefit from a less demanding and more predictable schedule. The lawyers who make this transition traditionally have not looked back. That’s partly because they haven’t wanted to return to law firm life and partly because firms have preferred to hire lateral candidates currently working in private practice.

But in 2021 — an exceptional year for the legal industry in many respects — a novel trend is emerging. We at Lateral Link are hearing from a striking number of in-house lawyers who are interested in making a lateral move to a law firm. And firms are displaying an unprecedented openness to hiring such candidates.

The in-house grass is not looking so green

Any lawyer who accepts an in-house role understands that the transition presents certain tradeoffs. A paycut is generally required, and even for those fortunate enough to land an in-house position with similar current compensation, it’s unlikely that the rate of growth in future years will match the financial upside of private practice. Relatedly, upward mobility in the in-house context is constrained: a law firm practice group can support multiple highly compensated partners, but only one member of an in-house legal department can be General Counsel.

In the current environment, some in-house counsel are finding those tradeoffs starker than they bargained for. Most notably, sharply escalating base salaries and special bonuses for law firm associates have widened the pay disparity between firms and in-house legal departments. That disparity is especially painful for in-house counsel who find themselves working long hours. (It turns out the absence of billables doesn’t necessarily guarantee a better lifestyle!)

Another important factor is work-from-home flexibility. In many industries, employees have already been called back to the office full-time, barring a medical exemption or other special circumstance. The same is true of some law firms, but as a general matter, hybrid arrangements in Biglaw are easy to find. Firms historically have not been known as bastions of flexibility, but the pandemic has forced real change on that front. For in-house lawyers whose companies are insisting on full-time office attendance, the relative flexibility of law firms has become a selling point.

Firms are prepared to hire in-house counsel

In the past, most law firms would have been hesitant to hire lateral candidates from in-house roles — lawyers currently in private practice are considered a safer bet. But in the current war for lateral talent, firms have been forced to cast a wide net. Just as they have become more open to candidates with less prestigious educational and prior firm backgrounds, firms are increasingly willing to extend offers to in-house counsel.

Candidates returning to private practice tend to return to the same type of work that they were doing prior to their in-house transition. We are seeing candidates join practice groups such as M&A, finance, and IP. Litigation is tougher, both because firms are less desperate for lateral litigators and because firms tend to view in-house roles supervising litigation as less directly relevant to their practices.

We advise in-house counsel who may be interested in exploring a return to private practice to start the process soon. The current demand for lateral hires is exceptional, and it won’t last forever. Now is the time to test the market, before the window closes.

# What Made That Summer Associate Slap A Biglaw Lawyer?
## The dumbest fight ever.

UPDATE 6/2/16 5:44 p.m.: Per a tipster claiming firsthand knowledge of the incident, our earlier information wasn’t exactly true… Read on to hear the new info.

It’s the “Slap Heard ‘Round The Biglaw World.” When a [summer associate hauled off and slapped a second-year associate](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/did-a-biglaw-lawyer-just-get-slapped-by-a-summer-associate/), it got tongues wagging in all corners of the legal world. Even though we hear that the firm involved — which certainly in no way rhymes with “Madden Harps” — is telling its folks to keep a lid on the tale, it was far too late for the law school rumor mill.

What could trigger such a violent reaction? Was it something untoward or was one (or both) of these folks being a drunk fool?

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It turns out it might very well be absolutely nothing. Just a stupid argument that got out of hand, deserving of a few laughs and a lecture on the perils of alcohol, but absolutely not some a firm-wide gag order.

Per a tipster familiar with at least one version of the story, which took place in the context of a firm event, a fact that should give you a contact drunk upon hearing it:

They were fighting about who was older. He thought he was older, and after an escalation along the lines of “no I am NO I AM” the associate informed him that they were 29, at which point the summer said “fuck I thought I was older” and then says that he “jokingly” slapped the associate.

Alcohol can easily take jokes too far but it’s not acceptable to slap someone, especially the elderly. Slappy Summer may not have intended this to go too far, but it did, and they should apologize for it — and consider laying off the sauce for awhile.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
UPDATE 6/2/16 5:44 p.m.: A tipster with firsthand knowledge affirms that a slap was made “jokingly,” but says our earlier intel is incorrect beyond that:

There was no altercation or argument about who was older or any disagreement at all. A summer associate mistook an associate as a fellow summer associate and slapped him jokingly. Any other information is incorrect.

So it was just out of the blue? That seems… much worse. Well, actually the tipster claims it was a case of mistaken identity and that the associate wasn’t the intended recipient. Evaluating this testimony in my role as Slap Bet Commissioner, I’m pretty sure the associate owes the summer 3 return slaps to be delivered without warning over the course of the summer program and the intended victim gets one free slap on principle. So sayeth the Commish!

But it looks like this firm — again, in no way sounding like Ladden Carps Bayer Prom — is just off to an all-around wild summer:

At the same event, another summer puked on the staircase and they were all asked to leave.

Solid outing.


Artist’s rendering.

Cue the bitchfest over how awful millennials are, but this isn’t a generational thing. Young people do stupid and inappropriate things, especially when dropped into a bro-dominated Biglaw culture that already treats the mass consumption of alcohol as a point of pride and then competes for the love of law students by throwing generous open bar events. These things happen. It’s not a reason to cancel events, it’s not a reason to (automatically) no-offer anyone, and it’s not a reason to shore up your own lack of self-worth by pretending your generation is just better than the next one. It’s a thing that happens, and it’s a learning experience for law students transitioning into proper professionals.

We have some incredibly unfortunate news to report out of the New Jersey legal community, where a young Fox Rothschild partner recently passed away. [Harry S. Jackson III](https://www.foxrothschild.com/harry-s-jackson-iii), 33, became a partner at the firm in 2021. According to news reports, he died in a crash on the PA Turnpike when his car collided with a jackknifed tractor-trailer. Jackson’s untimely death came about one week before he was supposed to get married.

Jackson, who was involved in the firm’s gaming practice and was developing an expertise in e-sports, had been named as co-chair of Fox Rothschild’s American Indian Law practice group. He worked out of the firm’s Atlantic City office. As noted in the [New Jersey Law Journal](https://www.law.com/njlawjournal/2022/08/04/crash-kills-fox-rothschild-partner-33-remembered-for-kindness-community-service/) by C.J. Fisher, co-chair of the firm’s gaming practice, his colleagues are “truly devastated.” Here’s more:

“It’s still hard to believe that Harry is gone. He was truly one of the kindest, nicest people that you will ever meet, and that has been the resounding theme from everyone who has shared their fondest memories of Harry,” Fisher said.

Jackson was “renowned for his unwavering kindness, generous spirit and affable manner,” and was “an ascending star and respected partner in our gaming department,” Fox Rothschild said in a statement. “He will be deeply missed by his colleagues in the Atlantic City office and the gaming department and all those upon whom he left an indelible impact throughout the firm.”

Jackson was a member of the Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape Tribal Nation, and served as an elected member of its nine-member trial council. His family has requested that any donations be sent to the Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape Tribal National general fund at 118 E. Commerce St. Bridgeton, New Jersey, 08302, or to a memorial scholarship fund established in his memory. Donations to the scholarship fund can be made by sending a check payable to the Atlantic County Bar Association (make sure to write “Harry Jackson memorial scholarship” in the note), 1201 Bacharach Blvd., Atlantic City, New Jersey, 08401.

We here at Above the Law would like to extend our condolences to Harry Jackson’s family, friends, and colleagues during this difficult time.

With talk of a potential recession making some candidates hesitant to explore lateral moves, it’s especially important to ground our assessment of the market in data. Analysis of lateral hires in 2022 indicates continued strength, not just in the largest cities like [New York](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/new-york-market-update-strong-lateral-demand-though-with-variation-across-practice-areas/) and [Chicago](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/an-update-on-the-chicago-lateral-attorney-hiring-market/) but also in many smaller markets. Taken together, Kansas City, St. Louis, and Detroit offer a useful case study.

These smaller midwestern markets are more than holding their own. In both St. Louis and Detroit, hiring this year has outpaced the level of 2021. In Kansas City, it has been comparable to 2021. Unlike in markets such as [Austin](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/texas-market-update-lateral-opportunities-abound/), where multiple office openings and large group moves have supercharged lateral hiring, growth in these smaller midwestern markets has mainly been driven by individual hires into existing offices.

Robust hiring across these markets

Lateral opportunities have been especially plentiful this year in the St. Louis and Detroit markets. According to Leopards data, in the first half of 2022, there were 42 lateral moves in St. Louis (partner, counsel, and associates), a jump from 35 in the first half of 2021. Detroit saw 59 lateral hires, as compared to 48 in the same period of 2021. (The Detroit totals are for the broader southeast Michigan region, including offices in Bloomfield Hills, Birmingham, Ann Arbor, and Troy.) Kansas City was trailing its 2021 pace at the mid-way point this year, but activity picked up in July with 11 additional lateral moves.

Kansas City is the only market with a notable new office opening: K&L Gates set up shop, bringing over a team of Energy attorneys from Husch Blackwell. Detroit has seen some group hiring, with corporate attorneys leaving a smaller firm to join Dinsmore and Honigman, but even there, individual one-off moves predominate.

A diversity of practice area strengths

Although all three markets are expanding, there are meaningful differences between them in terms of practice area growth. In Kansas City, litigation and real estate appear to be growing most strongly, while corporate hiring has slowed. Real estate historically punches above its weight in KC, which has a smaller proportion of corporate attorneys than in some comparable markets. In St. Louis, in contrast, there has been a significant uptick in corporate/banking hiring, whereas litigation has remained steady. IP is also significantly more active than in 2021: in the first seven months of 2022, there were double the number of lateral moves seen in all of 2021. In Detroit, corporate/banking lateral moves are also notably outpacing 2021, with litigation/L&E, real estate, and IP close to matching last year’s pace.

Hiring numbers are low in all markets for tax, trust & estates, and ERISA/comp & benefits, but it does appear that hiring has increased in 2022 compared to 2021. That reflects a trend we have seen in larger markets as well. It will be interesting to observe whether the corporate practice groups continue to build in these smaller markets, even in a period when they seem to be cooling slightly in the largest cities.

Salary increases have attracted new talent

In Detroit in particular, several firms have raised salaries to at or just slightly below the major market level. Examples include Foley, Jones Day, Honigman, and Gunderson. These increases have been especially effective in attracting candidates from Chicago Big Law offices. The Michigan firms have understood that many Chicago-based associates grew up in the Detroit suburbs but started their legal careers in Chicago to take advantage of higher compensation and more extensive Big Law opportunities. Some members of this group have jumped at the chance to move home without taking a substantial pay cut.

In the Missouri markets, salaries remain below the national market scale, but the largest players such as Bryan Cave, Polsinelli, and Husch Blackwell have raised pay substantially over the past year. Those increases have widened the gap between the highest-paying Missouri firms and their smaller peers in these markets. Local candidates who previously believed that the incremental pay difference wasn’t worth Big Law hours requirements have been reconsidering that assessment. Although at first glance one might expect Missouri offices to face difficulty attracting top talent from larger markets without paying on the national scale, it’s worth noting that cost of living remains quite low in both Kansas City and St. Louis. Going forward, it will be interesting to monitor whether the leading firms in these markets have done enough to bring in a significant number of major-market laterals.

If attorneys aren’t sending emails, they’re probably drafting documents. 

But there’s a lot that technology can do to help — from document assembly to document management. 

In this episode of the Non-Eventcast, we brought on a couple of guests to discuss how attorneys can modernize their approaches to document management: Adrian Bailey of DocStyle and Arman Samani of MyCase. 

It seems like you can’t have a legal technology podcast these days without addressing all of the acquisitions happening across the legal landscape — so, we started there (7:03). Next, we discussed formatting and style options, and why it never pays to use comic sans (9:56). 

Later, we addressed the movement from desktop, or legacy, document platforms to cloud-based services, which has been slower in document management, than in other product categories (17:23). Last but not least, we discussed what a truly integrated experience looks like for document management in a modern law firm (24:49).

Document management in the cloud is real, and it’s spectacular. Tune in to this episode of the Non-Eventcast to gain a better understanding of the tools and options now accessible to law firms in the document management space.

# After Multimillion-Dollar Loss, World's First Publicly Traded Law Firm To Conduct More Layoffs

Slater & Gordon, the world’s first publicly traded law firm, has been in some trouble for quite some time. If you recall, Slater & Gordon took a [$700 million hit](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/a-700-million-loss-puts-a-law-firm-on-the-ropes/) in early 2016 thanks to its acquisition of the legal services branch of UK-based insurance claims processor Quindell (now known as Watchstone Group), and later in the year it was revealed that it had [slashed 640 jobs](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/worlds-first-publicly-traded-law-firm-slashes-640-jobs/) to “streamline the firm.”

Slater & Gordon has been in restructuring mode since that time, and thanks to yet another humongous loss of $546.8 million, the solution to get the firm off the ropes seems to be — you guessed it — additional layoffs. Here’s some additional information from [Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/slater-and-gordon-plans-to-cut-80-staff-as-the-law-firm-restructures-2017-9):

Slater and Gordon has completed a strategic review and plans to cut 80 staff in Australia as part of a transformation plan to bring the law firm back to health.

According to a short note to the [Australian Securities Exchange], the plan includes cost reductions and about 7% of its 1,140 staff Australian will go.

“A number of office locations nationally are impacted, but the majority of our existing national office network will be maintained,” the company says.

“The company believes that the implementation of a business-wide transformation plan, including cost reductions and structural changes, is necessary for the future sustainability of the Australian operations.”

Unfortunately for Slater & Gordon, it seems to have gotten itself into such a financial predicament that only 80 layoffs might not do much at all. We have a feeling that in order to save face, the firm may conduct stealth layoffs in addition to the relatively small number that have been announced publicly.

We wish all of the affected individuals at Slater & Gordon the best of luck while they seek new job opportunities in the legal industry and beyond.

If your firm or organization is closing its doors or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# Many Biglaw Associates Are Not Compensated As Well As You'd Think When You Consider How Much They Work
## These associates are working their asses off and have little to no free time. It's not as good as you think it is.

It is undeniable that Biglaw associates are among the most highly paid attorneys in the legal profession.  Indeed, many of the nation’s most prestigious firms recently increased salaries, and associates in Biglaw now make insane sums of money.  It can be easy to think that Biglaw associates are the most well-compensated lawyers in the legal industry, and if you consider salaries alone, this would be accurate. However, it is difficult to say definitively that Biglaw associates are the best-compensated attorneys when you consider how hard attorneys in Biglaw typically work.

It is a well-known fact that attorneys in Biglaw work long hours.  Of course, lawyers in many parts of the legal profession work numerous hours a week, and I personally know a number of public interest attorneys and small firm lawyers who work insane hours.  However, it is safe to say that on average, attorneys in Biglaw work more than attorneys in other parts of the legal profession.

I can attest to this reality from my own personal experiences.  When I was an associate in Biglaw, I was in the office at least 60 hours a week.  I usually had to work on nights and weekends, and I remember one stretch of time when I worked for 100 days straight without having a single day off.  This might sound like a lot of work, but I actually had it easier than most associates who work at large law firms.  My firm was having financial difficulties throughout much of my time in Biglaw, and this generally meant that my colleagues and I [were less busy than attorneys who worked at other large law firms](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/balance-side-hustles-main-job/).

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
It is difficult to estimate how many hours an average associate at an ordinary Biglaw firms works a week.  This number is definitely not 40 or 50 hours a week, and I would estimate that the average Biglaw associate works 60 to 70 hours a week.  I am aware of some Biglaw associates who routinely work 80 hours a week or more, but 60 to 70 hours a week is probably average.

This amount is far more than the number of hours attorneys at other firms and in other parts of the legal profession typically work.  At least this has been my own personal experience.  At every job I worked after leaving Biglaw, [I rarely spent more than 45 hours a week in the office](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/extra-money-main-job/).  Again, I know there are many attorneys at smaller law firms and in public interest jobs who work insane hours, but it is undeniable that attorneys at smaller shops on average work less than attorneys in Biglaw.  And this, of course, makes sense.  One of the reasons why attorneys in Biglaw are paid so much money is because they are expected to work longer hours and during nights and weekends.  One of the advantages of hiring a Biglaw firm is that exigent matters will be handled on short notice because attorneys are on call and are working longer hours.

When you look at the numbers, it becomes clear that associates in Biglaw typically work around 25 percent or more hours than attorneys in other parts of the legal profession.  And if you divide the salary of an attorney in Biglaw with the number of hours they work, the amount Biglaw associates are paid per hour of work is closer to the amount attorneys in other parts of the legal profession are paid per hour.  Of course, Biglaw associates are still paid a lot more per hour than other attorneys, but not as much as you might expect when simply evaluating their salaries alone.

It is also undeniable that attorneys who do not work in Biglaw usually have more free time than people who work in Biglaw.  It can be argued that [free time is much more valuable than money](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/time-side-hustles/).  This is because free time is a lot more liquid than money, since you could use free time to make additional cash through side-hustles, or use this time for relaxation, personal pursuits, or a number of other purposes.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
During my student debt repayment saga, [I used the additional free time I had after leaving Biglaw to pursue a number of side-hustles](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/introducing-side-hustles/).  I had a few primary side-hustles that netted me the [lion’s share of the money I made on the side](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/primary-side-hustles/), and I also had a number of smaller side-hustles I worked as well.  I really enjoyed working side-hustles, not only because they provided me with money I could use to pay off my student loans, but also because the side-hustles gave me a sense of financial security.  I knew that if anything ever happened to my main job, I could make money by working side-hustles, and I appreciated that I had multiple income streams.

I’d be lying if I said that my income from my main job and side-hustles exceeded the amount of money I might be able to earn in Biglaw.  However, when you consider how I had much more free time after leaving Biglaw, and how I had income from multiple sources, my total income and benefits were close to the amount of money associates in Biglaw earn.

All told, it is easy to read the news about Biglaw salary raises without thinking about how Biglaw associates typically work longer hours.  And when you divide the number of hours a typical Biglaw associate works with how much they are paid, this amount is closer to how much attorneys in other parts of the legal profession are compensated.  Of course, Biglaw associates are still paid more per hour than other attorneys, but their income is not as insane as might be believed when considering their salaries alone.

# Howard 3L Allegedly Earns $430,000 In Last Year... Though The Legal Term Would Be 'Embezzled'
## He was also set to work in Biglaw, but I don't think that's going to happen now.

Turns out ’embezzlement’ is the one crime where it’s hard to find a stock photo of a black man doing it. I hate you, stock photos.

There’s a [fairly epic student loan scandal](https://thegrapevine.theroot.com/black-twitter-goes-in-on-howard-university-student-at-t-1824160503) enveloping Howard University just at the moment. Reports have surfaced that Howard officials stole nearly $1,000,000 in student financial funds through a series of fake scholarships and grants. The university has already fired six people.

[The Heavy report](https://heavy.com/news/2018/03/tyrone-hankerson-howard-university-financial-aid-theft/)s on the details of the scam:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
[B]ogus grants were “created and awarded to financial aid employees who were also registered for University courses. In some cases, these employees qualified for tuition remission and therefore weren’t charged tuition for their classes. Despite this, they still received large grants and scholarships that exceeded amounts generally awarded to normal students. These grants almost always exceeded legally allowed amounts.”

At or near the center of this scandal is Howard Law 3L Tyrone Hankerson Jr., a former student-employee at the financial aid office. He might also be a “former” law student, but while some people are saying he’s been kicked out of school, Hankerson says he’s still there.

Hankerson allegedly embezzled $429,000 from the Howard between 2014 and 2017.

A student and employee, between 2014 and 2017, Tyrone Hankerson was “repeatedly awarded a $65,000 ‘University Need Based Grant,’” the Medium blogger wrote.

“In 2014, Hankerson was awarded another $22,683 scholarship, labeled as a Mock Trial Scholarship. Sources who have been involved with the mock trial, including past leadership, say the team has never awarded a scholarship of that amount and wouldn’t even have had the budget to accommodate a scholarship of that amount.”

This is the part where I’m supposed to make an incisive point about the dangers of so-called “merit-based” financial aid. I’m supposed to talk about how we need to reduce the price of law school at its source, and not allow schools to artificially inflate their prices beyond what the market will bear by copious financial aid grants. Going to school should be free, and it would be if we were a country committed to educating our youth.

But… instead of all that, let’s look at Tyrone Hankerson’s Instagram, because the brother was getting stuff with (not) his money.



Y’all can’t even spell embezzlement [#Tyrone](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tyrone?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#HowardUniversity](https://twitter.com/hashtag/HowardUniversity?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/wR78cZhzYr](https://t.co/wR78cZhzYr)

Tyrone didn’t think the financially flush times would end after law school. Our sources tell us that he has secured a Biglaw job at Arent Fox. From a tipster:

[Tyrone Hankerson] was a summer intern at Arent Fox in the summers of 2016 and 2017, a current law clerk, and was a recipient of their $15k 2016 Diversity Scholarship. The firm has attempted to remove all evidence of Hankerson being an employee and scholarship recipient.

Screenshots (that have been deleted)





That’s gonna leave a mark.

Above the Law asked Arent Fox about Hankerson’s job status. Here’s a statement from the firm:

Mr. Hankerson’s relationship is now on hold pending the outcome of an investigation. We have no further comment at this time.

Hankerson, for his part, maintains his innocence.

ABC News has received the following statement on behalf of Tyrone Hankerson Jr. [pic.twitter.com/hIA8uaIlG3](https://t.co/hIA8uaIlG3)

Hey man, at least he’s not graduating from law school with any debt! And I bet restitution can be discharged through bankruptcy a lot easier than student loans.

# Another Magic Circle Firm Decides To Raise Associate Salaries -- In The U.S.
## Now this is a great way to start the weekend.

Good news for associates at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer — well at least those in the New York and D.C. offices — they’re getting raises and special summer bonuses. The firm may have gotten its start abroad, but they know how to play ball here in the U.S. The firm is meeting the market standard set established by a trio of firms — the [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/)/[Simpson](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/)/[Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) scale — effective July 1.

Earlier today another Magic Circle firm (that’s British for big deal law firm), [Clifford Chance](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/magic-circle-joins-the-raise-party/), also moved on associate salaries. Hopefully for associates this means the latest round of raises will go around to more than just firms with a New York focus (though quite a few California firms have, so far, remained mum on the question of raises).

For your gawking pleasure, here are the new salaries and bonuses the lucky associates will be receiving:

— [Kent Zimmermann](https://www.consultzg.com/consultants/kent-zimmermann/), a law firm management consultant at the [Zeughauser Group](https://www.consultzg.com/), commenting on the [corporate clients who will have to bear the brunt](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/06/05/the-190k-question-will-clients-balk-at-rising-associate-salaries/) of Biglaw firms’ salary increases to the [new $190K scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises-2018/?rf=1), which was [implemented by Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) earlier this week.

# Biglaw Firm's Bold Pro-Oppression Stance
## Not a great look for the firm.

([Check out the update to the story](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/facing-backlash-mayer-brown-dumps-client/) — Mayer Brown pulls out of the representation.)
Mayer Brown’s been on the receiving end of some negative attention. The firm is representing the University of Hong Kong — they’ve apparently been clients for a while — and they’ve demanded the removal of artwork. But it’s not just any piece of art.

The Pillar of Shame is a sculpture by Danish artist Jens Galschiøt designed to commemorate the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre in Beijing. The sculpture was unveiled in 1997 and is [reportedly](https://www.npr.org/2021/10/13/1045574697/hong-kong-pillar-of-shame-tiananmen-sculpture-removal) the only memorial to the massacre still on Chinese soil. But the historical significance didn’t stop the demand letter.

[#BREAKING](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BREAKING?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) The University of Hong Kong [@HKUniversity](https://twitter.com/HKUniversity?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) demanded the [#HKAlliance](https://twitter.com/hashtag/HKAlliance?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) to remove the Pillar of Shame from its campus by 5pm on October 13.

And it’s true that Biglaw firms like Mayer Brown have tons of representations every year, but this isn’t the sort to just get swept under the rug. Indeed, 30 NGOs have [signed an open letter](https://www.facebook.com/ncal.hkclub/posts/1657365924468176) asking the firm to bow out of the problematic representation:

The Mayer Brown law firm stated as their mission to “contribute when and where we can have a great impact. We encourage and enable our lawyers and business services to play a role in making a positive difference in the lives of others.”

The sculpture has been at the University of Hong Kong campus for over 20 years. For the Mayer Brown law firm to demand that it be removed after all these years when there had been no objections from the university officials nor from the student body in the past, shows that Mayer Brown has violated its stated mission to make a positive difference in the lives of citizens in Hong Kong.

We therefore expect Mayer Brown law firm to safeguard their reputation and their integrity in defending the right of freedom of expression by rescinding their agreement with the University of Hong Kong.

While others have gone even further to condemn the Biglaw firm’s actions.  Galschiøt, the artist, condemned the act as an “attack on art.” Dennis Kwok, a former member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council and an opposition leader to China’s rule, [told Bloomberg Law’s Viva Chen](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/oops-they-did-it-again-mayer-browns-debacle-in-hong-kong), “This is a U.S. firm that’s complicit in the suppression of human rights. It’s not good enough for them to say that they’re just acting as lawyers.”

And, as Chen went on to note, this is not the first time Mayer Brown has found itself in a disturbingly similar situation:

What’s weird is that Mayer Brown has been in similar hot water before. In 2014, I wrote about the firm’s “uncomfortable” clients—deniers of the existence of “comfort” women—Korean, Chinese, and other Asian women who were forced into sexual slavery by Japan during World War II. The plaintiffs, who were of Japanese descent, had sued the city of Glendale, California to remove a statue commemorating the women. The plaintiffs said they were “offended” by the statue, calling it “an unfairly one-sided portrayal of the historical and political debate surrounding comfort women.” (The firm eventually withdrew from that case.)

The firm’s media messaging has been a bit muddled:

Asked for comment on this current engagement, a Mayer Brown spokesperson emailed [Chen]: “The University of Hong Kong is a long-standing client of the firm. For many decades, lawyers in our Hong Kong office have represented the University in numerous areas, including real estate matters. In accordance with our policy of not discussing private client matters, we have no additional comment.”

But in an exchange with [Hong Kong Free Press](https://hongkongfp.com/2021/10/13/university-of-hong-kong-told-to-contact-tiananmen-massacre-statue-artist-as-removal-ultimatum-nears-despite-t8-typhoon/), the firm said that its role is to “help our clients understand and comply with current law.” It added, “our legal advice is not intended as commentary on current or historical events.”

But even more confused is the firm’s position on human rights. Sure, they came out and said the right things when [George Floyd was murdered](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/41/), and the firm’s website [states](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/capabilities/practices/litigation--dispute-resolution/white-collar-defense--compliance/business-human-rights?tab=overview): “An effective human rights compliance program is emerging as essential to effective risk management, regardless of sector. Drawing on the best of the policies and procedures that many businesses have already adopted and our experience, knowledge and global reach, Mayer Brown guides clients through this increasingly complex, evolving and international aspect of doing business.” But representations like these, well, they tell a different story.

# Biglaw Firm's Latest Racial Equality Work
## Arent Fox's commitment to change.

In the initial aftermath of the murder of George Floyd, [lots of Biglaw firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/) talked a good game about racial justice in this country. But now that a few months have gone by, we wonder, what have they actually done to work towards those lofty goals?

In the latest episode of The Jabot, I interview Arent Fox partner [Eva J. Pulliam ](https://www.arentfox.com/attorneys/eva-pulliam)about the firm’s newly launched Center For Racial Equality. We chat about the creation of the Center and what motivated the firm to do so, what the firm’s role is in racial equality, and what are the goals of the center and the projects they’re initially focused on.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wears when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

What does a “quintessential Wall Street law firm” do when it has lawyers in offices that “don’t fit with this vision; they don’t fit with the clients we described, and they don’t fit with the kinds of work we do in other areas”? That firm closes the offices in question and performs layoffs.

Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft will be closing two of its offices in China — in Beijing (an office the firm opened in 2005) and Hong Kong (an office the firm opened in 2010) — and laying off the 25 attorneys who work there by year’s end. Here’s more information from [Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/cadwalader-to-close-hong-kong-beijing-offices-lay-off-25-lawyers/):

“It’s a very difficult decision because these are good people,” said [CWT managing partner Pat] Quinn, at a 40th floor conference room table in Cadwalader’s downtown Manhattan office. “…but it’s something we have to do to fit a more focused strategy.”

The decision, being announced to partners today, was made by a special 13-member management team who huddled up over the past three months and discussed a variety of changes the firm could make to ensure its success in the face of partner exits.

Pat Quinn added, “We’ll be as supportive as we can be. Obviously we want to see people land on their feet.”

We wish all of the lawyers and affected individuals at Cadwalader the best of luck while they seek new job opportunities in the legal industry and beyond.

Chalk up another one for smaller firms who understand where they fit into the market, what they’re trying to accomplish, and what their talent expects. We previously wrote about Olshan Frome Wolosky [opting out](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/is-the-second-tier-nyc-salary-market-emerging/) of blindly following the Cravath craze when it just doesn’t fit the niche they want for themselves in the market.

Now Pryor Cashman follows suit with its own raises. The mid-sized firm with a penchant for representing celebrities — they’ve appeared in our pages in the past for their work on behalf of [Kanye West](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/09/quote-of-the-day-kanye-west-keeps-his-love-locked-down-except-for-that-sex-tape/) and [Wendy Williams](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/11/fashion-law-order-hand-over-the-cash-or-risk-kidnapping-over-peep-toes/) — informed associates yesterday that everyone was getting a $20K bump in their salary (less a few exceptions for attorneys not on the same track).

It’s a solid raise and while it’s not placing the firm on par with Cravath, the fact is the firm doesn’t want to be on par with Cravath. It makes its money not charging on par with Cravath and its associates came to the firm because they wanted interesting and challenging work, but at hours not on par with Cravath.

Pryor Cashman even acknowledges this in its memo:

As a mid-sized firm, we have thrived with a different business model than much of BigLaw. We have grown the firm by staking our ground with mid-market clientele and by attracting work from larger firms because of the competence and value we provide in legal services. We do not depend on high leverage, and we offer a highly competitive fee structure.

Once again, a firm decided to take a good look at itself and its business and do what’s right for it.

# Law Firm Leaders Seem Nervous About Cash Heading Into 2024 -- Are Salary Increases To Blame?
## Law firm leaders are no longer looking at things through rose-colored glasses when it comes to their finances. How do these raises and bonuses make them feel?

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

I would probably think it’s more of an issue now. It costs more to borrow money. And all the other expenses are going up faster. I haven’t heard of any costs going down. Whether it’s rent, or electricity, or gas, or employees’ health insurance—everything is more money.

— Bill Sansone, a practice leader for law firm advisory at Withum Smith+Brown, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2023/12/04/not-a-rosy-outlook-law-firm-leaders-are-less-bullish-heading-into-2024/) on how law firm leaders feel heading into 2024 now that salary wars have arrived. Prior to the latest raises being announced, 42% of respondents to a recent Withum study said that increased salary demands posed a moderate to significant risk to their bottom lines.

# Will This Megamerger Become A Biglaw 'Breakthrough' For The Magic Circle?

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

The Magic Circle firms have been trying to break through in the US for years. Provided A&O gets a deal done that works, this is a breakthrough.

— Scott Gibson, a legal recruiter at London’s Edwards Gibson, in comments given to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/allen-overy-shearman-weigh-merger-approval-with-pay-on-minds) on the [planned merger](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/shearman-sterling-allen-overy-merger/) between Magic Circle firm Allen & Overy and Am Law 100 firm Shearman & Sterling. The merged firm will have 3,900 lawyers (with ~800 partners) spread across 49 offices, and a combined total revenue of $3.4 billion. Gibson said A&O partners “may have to do some compromising, including on how much the UK lawyers might have to pay to keep the US lawyers.”
