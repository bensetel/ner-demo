# Biglaw Firm Announces Major Partner Move, Only To Have That Partner Change His Mind

About two weeks ago, Paul Hastings announced a major coup — the firm had hired away leading leveraged finance partner [Nigel Ward](https://www.ashurst.com/people-detail.aspx?id_Content=234) from Ashurst, where he ran the firm’s banking and capital markets practice, bragging that Paul Hastings was now able to bolster its own practice in that area with a “pre-eminent” legal mind. According to Paul Hastings, Ward is one of the “most prominent and respected lawyers” in his field of practice in the UK, so the firm was incredibly happy to add him to its team. Here’s a copy of the Paul Hastings [press release](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:nX88KOBcc8gJ:www.paulhastings.com/news/details/%3Fid%3D2846ea69-2334-6428-811c-ff00004cbded+&cd=5&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us):



It appears, however, that Paul Hastings may have gotten ahead of itself with its braggadocious announcement, because Ashurst just announced that Ward has decided to stay with the firm. The firm tried to quickly remove the press release from its site, but it’s still available on Google cache. Oh, bollocks!

Ashurst is “delighted that Nigel remains committed to the firm,” while Paul Hastings, perhaps too polite to speak its mind despite its embarrassment “wish[es] [Ward] well.”

# Top 25 Am Law Firm Announces Bonuses -- And 43% Of Associates Made More Money Than Market

Attention Biglaw associates: Just because it’s January 2021, it doesn’t mean that firms are done handing out 2020 year-end bonuses. In fact, an elite law firm just announced bonuses this morning, and we’ve heard that another highly ranked firm announced bonuses today as well. For the time being, we’ll be dedicating some coverage to a top-ranked firm that already announced that it would be [handing out special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/top-25-am-law-firm-announces-special-bonuses-but-theres-a-catch/) (with a catch — they’re hours-based), and has finally decided to open its coffers for year-end bonuses.

The firm in question is Goodwin Procter, and they’ll be matching the prevailing Baker McKenzie/Cravath scale. Here’s what that looks like, in case you’ve forgotten:

2019: $15,000

2018: $25,000

2017: $50,000

2016: $65,000

2015: $80,000

2014: $90,000

2013+: $100,000

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Associates at the firm must have met a 1,950 hourly threshold to be considered for a market bonus. Goodwin also uses a rating system when it comes to bonuses, and those who recorded hours “materially higher than 1,950 hours” and received a “distinctive” rating are eligible to receive bonuses that are above their class amounts. According to the firm, “43% of bonus recipients will receive an amount greater than the amount listed for their class, and 57% will receive their class amount.”

All bonuses at the firm will be paid out on January 25. Congrats to everyone at Goodwin!

(Flip to the next page to read the full Goodwin Procter memo.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

After what has been the longest month, it feels like Biglaw is finally coming around. Back in January, [Milbank raised associate salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/), and yet, the [bulk of the market has still not matched](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-raise-tracker-2022/) the new scale. But [earlier today](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/fenwick-raises-22/), another Am Law 100 firm announced raises, and now, Wilson Sonsini has made its own raise announcement.  Folks, this feels like real momentum!

Wilson Sonsini, which made $1,130,000,000 in gross revenue in 2020, making it 36th on the Am Law 100, delighted associates with the following compensation scale:



Raises will be retroactive to February 1. You can read the full memo [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/wsgr-raises-22/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Being Smart About Utilization And Realization: How To Improve Your Contribution To Firm Profitability
## Managing utilization and realization makes you more productive and efficient: you’re a more valuable associate.

Law firm economics can be a little opaque for associates.  Partnerships typically aren’t great at explaining the business of law to non-partner firm members, and associates naturally focus their efforts on learning to be an effective lawyer.  But like it or not, a law firm is ultimately a business, and if you aspire to have a long-term career in private practice, you need to understand the drivers of firm profitability and how you fit into the equation.  In particular, you need to understand how to manage utilization and realization.

Utilization and Realization drive Profitability

Utilization is the proportion of your available time allocated to billable matters.  Specifically, it’s the number of billable hours you work divided by the number of “available hours,” times 100.  Let’s say your firm requires 2000 hours (your “available hours”), your billable hours are 1800 for the year, and you’ve got 300 in non-billables.  Your total hours tracked exceeds the 2000-hour threshold, but non-billables don’t factor into utilization.  Therefore, your utilization rate is 90% (1800/2000).

Realization is the percentage of recorded time that is actually paid by the client.  When your partner cuts your bills or offers the client a discount or write-off, that reduces realization.

Why do these metrics matter?  Simply put, firm profitability depends on them.  Here’s a simplified law firm profitability equation:

Profitability = Margin x Realized Rate (the “true” rate the client is paying) x Utilization x Leverage.

As an associate, you have no control over margin or leverage.  (Even as a partner, your ability to improve these metrics is constrained by market realities: for example, some practice areas are inherently lower margin than others.)  Conversely, although utilization and realization aren’t entirely within your control, it’s absolutely possible for you to influence them.

Track all your time, and resist the urge to cut it

Nobody enjoys billing, but accurate time tracking is a prerequisite to strong utilization.  If you’re not billing daily, you are likely failing to capture time that you would have remembered to bill if you had been more diligent about regular time entry.  Chronic underbilling is a major threat to law firm profitability, so you should do your best to ensure that you aren’t part of this problem.  (Of course, daily billing also guards against the risk of inadvertently overbilling, the consequences of which are even worse than underbilling!)

After you’ve accurately captured your billable time, do not cut it, even if you are uncomfortable with the pace of your work.  Partners need to know how long things are really taking, and the decision to cut a bill is theirs, not yours.  If you’re embarrassed about how long it takes you to complete a task, talk to someone about whether it truly is an issue and, if so, what steps you can take to improve your efficiency.

Knowing the accurate utilization rate within a department also helps partners decide when to request additional attorneys, and it’s a key input for firm management when approving requests to expand a group.  If everyone is underbilling, department leadership may not realize how close their lawyers are to burning out and potentially leaving the firm.

Remember that proper time tracking extends to non-billable hours also.  Your firm needs to know how much time you’re spending on administrative or other non-billable matters.  They may be tracking whether their workflow is efficient, if they’re using the right software, etc.  Useful analysis of those factors depends on you accurately reporting your non-billables.

Be smart about the wording of your bills

Healthy realization depends not just on how much time you spent on a task, but also on how you describe what you did.  Be aware that many different parties may review your bills: partners and clients, certainly, but potentially also courts or other third parties.  Take care to bill with the specificity that the client or firm requires (without including anything privileged or embarrassing, please).  Appropriately specific wording will make it easier to justify the bill for your work, creating the conditions for better realization.

Ensure aligned expectations

If partners are routinely cutting your hours, that is an indicator of misaligned expectations.  You should proactively communicate with partners about their expectations, so that you avoid incurring time that won’t be collected.  Find out how long the partner expects a project to take, and do your best to stay in that ballpark.  In the event the partner has an unrealistic view of what’s possible, have a conversation about it as early as you reasonably can.  You’re managing their expectations so they can manage the client’s expectations.  If you perceive a misalignment, it’s your responsibility to speak up and make an effort to resolve it.

Consider the bigger picture

So why am I sharing this, as a recruiter?  Managing utilization and realization makes you more productive and efficient: you’re a more valuable associate.  But this isn’t just about you.  It’s also about how much work the firm has: underutilization can result from not enough work to go around.  Conversely, understaffing can lead to overutilization.  And your personal utilization rate reflects your quality of life.  If your utilization is very high, then you’re likely overworked!

If this has got you thinking about your role in your firm, or your practice group, then let’s chat.

What prestigious law firm was founded on April Fools’ Day 1948, and was considered an “upstart” compared with more established firms?

Hint: In the 1950s and 60s, the firm rose to prominence by handling proxy fights — work that was considered “ungentlemanly” by other law firms.

# Everything You Need To Know About Fall Recruiting Season (Part II: The Initial Interview)
## This will probably be the only time in your life where you have scores of employers lining up to give you a job.

So you have done your employer research, gotten your interview schedule,[[1]](#_ftn1) and now it is time for you to run the OCI gauntlet.  But whether you came straight through from undergrad or have a decade’s worth of work experience under your belt, OCI can be daunting prospect for a significant number of law students.  For those fortunate students, the daunting nature stems from having to cram dozens of interviews into the span of a week.  But even if you only have one interview, the nature of an OCI interview can be unlike that you will find in any other profession.  While a degree of trepidation is understandable, and indeed, probably justified, recognize that OCI is both conquerable and the gateway to a legal career that could last you for half a century.

Perhaps the most important ingredient to a successful OCI is to understand what you are walking into when it comes to an initial interview.  Unlike most corporate environments, your OCI interviews are not going to be conducted by Carol in Human Resources, or some other midlevel executive whom you would only know in the future as a box on the organizational chart.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Instead, interviewers at OCI are attorneys with that employer.  Be they partners several decades into their practice or junior associates who might have just graduated from your law school, these are people who are first and foremost looking for colleagues.  This means that they not only want someone who can excel as an attorney, but someone who these attorneys will want to work with side by side with for the foreseeable future.  Even if you are at the absolute top of your class, nothing will sink your employment candidacy quicker than turning off the interviewers.

The next thing to recognize is that these OCI interviews are extremely short, typically only 20 minutes — in fact, do not be surprised if you hear a knock at the door after precisely 20 minutes; that is just your classmate who is next on the schedule and eager for their opportunity to impress.  As I often tell students at Vanderbilt, that 20 minutes goes by quicker than you could possibly imagine, so this is not the opportunity to launch into soliloquies or meandering stories that have no real impact on your employment candidacy.  Barring being posed with a Phillip Barbay-esque 27-part question, the answers you give during initial interviews should be no longer than 30-45 seconds.


While it might sound a bit odd, practice your answers until you have them condensed into 30-second sound bites which you can eloquently recite the moment your interviewer finishes the question.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)

That being said, the best initial interviews are often the ones that talk least about the law.  You have to remember that while you might have a long day or even week of interviews, so do the attorneys who are conducting the interviews — not to mention they are trying to calculate how they are going to make up for the lost day billing.  And while they might be interested in your thoughts on Property if you happen to be interviewing first thing in the morning, by the end of the day, the last thing they want to hear is yet another student explaining how they were able to conquer the Rule Against Perpetuities.  Find something else to talk about.  Before you walk into any OCI interview, not only should you have [researched the employer](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-fall-recruiting-season-part-i/?rf=1), but also, ideally, the interviewer(s).  Perhaps you both went to the same undergrad and can talk about shared experiences or the interviewer went to a school with a [prominent athletics program](https://kuathletics.com/index.aspx?path=mbball).  Providing these attorneys with a 20-minute respite from talking the law might, in and of itself, be enough to land you a call back.

However, there are two caveats to the above paragraph.  First, if your school has even a partial lottery system in place for OCI, be wary of interviews that do not even remotely touch on your potential as an attorney.  When I was going through the OCI (or EIW, as it were) process more than a decade ago, I had one interview with an Am Law 10 firm in which the first minute was reviewing my transcript and the following 19 minutes were discussing the weather in New York City.  Not surprisingly, that interview was soon followed up with a succinct rejection letter in the mail.  Second, when discussing non-legal matters, make sure you know your audience.  While you and I might be able to have a wonderful 20-minute conversation about [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez](https://ocasio2018.com) or [Abolishing ICE](https://www.thenation.com/article/its-time-to-abolish-ice/), that does not mean the same is true for the attorney sitting across the table from you.

Also, remember that you are always being evaluated, and not just when you are in the interview room.  Many firms will set up reception tables at OCI [full of swag](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/biglaw-is-handing-out-fidget-spinners-and-were-all-doomed/) and staffed by recruiters and attorneys.  While this might seem like a harmless opportunity to grab a free pen, the key article there is “a.”  Someone who takes a dozen pens, or a plate full of doughnuts, is going to draw attention to themselves, and not in a good way.  This does not mean that you should avoid the reception tables, nor that you have to avoid taking anything from them.  Indeed, the swag is meant to be taken and the tables are staffed with people who can answer most anything you can come up with about the firm.  Just remember that acts outside of the interview room count just as much as those inside.

Regardless of how many interviews you have, but especially for those of you who will be going through a seemingly never-ending cycle of hand shakes and questions, it can be hard to keep track of your thoughts about each firm and interviewer.  This is especially true if you are trying to piece them together at the end of the day or even the week.  A high school friend of mine who was a year ahead of me in law school gave me a piece of advice that I still give to students today.  Even in this digital age, every attorney that you meet at OCI will give you a business card.  Right after your interview is complete, take a moment to jot down some notes about that interview on the back of their business card.  Your perception of the interviewers and the firm will still be fresh in your mind and you then will have a record which you can refer to later on when it comes time to determine which callbacks you want to take.

Yes, the initial interview phase of OCI can be a lot, especially if you have dozens of interviews in a short period of time. But remember that at the end of the day, this is a good thing. As my father explained to me more than a decade ago, this will probably be the only time in your life where you have scores of employers lining up to give you a job.  The subsequent years have showed me that like much of his advice, he was right.

Next week, callbacks.

[[1]](#_ftnref1) Because the OCI bidding process can vary widely from law school to law school, there is no possibility of a universal bidding discussion in this space.  However, the single piece of advice I can give which I think applies to most students, and also sounds terribly obvious, is to bid on the employers with whom you most want to work.  Trying to game the bidding system in an effort to maximize your opportunities can end up harming your candidacy more than helping it.

# 45-Year-Old Biglaw Partner In Critical Condition With Coronavirus

A partner at Baker Donelson has a confirmed case of COVID-19, and is in critical condition. [Mark Frilot](https://www.bakerdonelson.com/Mark-W-Frilot), 45, is a partner in the construction litigation practice at the firm’s New Orleans and Mandeville offices and was diagnosed with the disease on Thursday after initially being misdiagnosed with the flu.

Frilot first noticed symptoms on March 6th. The following day, he went to a critical care center and was told he had the flu and given Tamiflu, prednisone, and cough syrup to treat the disease. However, his symptoms only got worse and included deliriously talking to himself. He went to the emergency room where flu tests came back negative and he was told he was a candidate to be tested for coronavirus. Frilot was then diagnosed with both the coronavirus and double pneumonia. He’s currently sedated and on a ventilator.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Heaven Frilot, the lawyer’s wife, [told Nola.com](https://www.nola.com/news/coronavirus/article_35531ff4-66d9-11ea-95b0-7797f71d169a.html) that her husband is “never, ever sick” and the seriousness of his case of COVID-19 shows, “It could happen to anybody.” It’s a warning she feels compelled to make as folks who perceived themselves as low risk for the disease haven’t always heeded health officials’ urging of social distancing. Heaven Frilot said seeing social media images of a Saint Patrick’s Day party in New Orleans that had to be broken up by police motivated her coming forward:

[Heaven Frilot] pleaded with people who think they are too healthy to be at risk to be aware that they still could be in danger and to listen to city leaders’ requests — if not to protect themselves, then for the sake of those who are vulnerable.

“Be aware,” Frilot said. “Please listen. So what if you have to stay home? This is a temporary thing — or hopefully (it will be), if people listen.”

[According to](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/03/16/baker-donelson-partner-45-in-critical-care-with-covid-19-in-new-orleans/) Law.com, Baker Donelson has not had any other cases of COVID-19. The New Orleans and Mandeville offices of the firm are closed, and all of the firm’s employees are encouraged to work from home. John Hicks, Baker Donelson’s general counsel, said the firm is working with the authorities:

“We have been cooperating with the board of health in New Orleans to notify everyone who may have been in contact with him and assist them in whatever notifications they thought were appropriate,” Hicks said in an interview.

The firm also noted they have a plan in place to prevent any disruption of legal services to their clients:

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# A Foolish Thing That Smart (Young) Lawyers Do

Did you do well in high school? If so, how did you do that? Well, you were pretty smart, and you worked super hard. Then you managed to be at the top of your class. You competed with your high school class and you won!  Now what?

Well, of course that means you went to a good college. And maybe a very good college. Who else is at that college? Well, people just like you, right? The winners of their own high school derbies. So the competition is harder now, isn’t it?

But you buckle down — even harder — and you still manage to be near the top of the class in college. Woohoo! So what now?

Well, you don’t need me to tell you. You go to a top law school. Probably one of the top 10 law schools, right? And you probably see where I am going here don’t you?  The competition is brutal at this point, isn’t it? You are now competing with the smartest and hardest-working high schoolers — who were the smartest and hardest working at their top colleges. Yikes! It’s going to be quite a slog.

But you are incredibly driven, aren’t you? And we already know how smart you are, so once again you manage to scrap and claw your way to the top of the heap.  I am ignoring the attempt by many law schools to hide grades. So you are at the top. You stretch your arms out. Your reward is nigh. And that is of course a job at one of the top 10 or 20 law firms at the biggest and most prestigious law market in the world, namely, New York City. You are in so-called Biglaw!!!!

Finally, the world is your oyster isn’t it?

Ummm, for someone so smart you did something pretty dumb didn’t you?

You just put yourself in competition with the smartest, most talented, hardest-working people on the planet for a limited number of partnership or other career opportunities.

Why on Earth would you do this?

It makes no sense at all, does it?

As an aside, it was exactly what I did.  I worked my ….. off in high school. I got to Tufts University (because I couldn’t get into an Ivy League school). Then I worked even harder to get into Harvard Law School. Then I got several jobs in Biglaw in New York City and eventually was not only passed over for partner at Latham & Watkins, I was ignominiously fired along with close to 200 other associates when they didn’t need me. Boy, was that a comeuppance. I wish I knew then what I know now.

Back to you. This career path does make some sense if you are just going to stay at Biglaw for a few years and add that prestige to your resume plus some sophisticated training. Thereafter, I advocate that you take control of your career.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
And how would you take control of your career?

The answer is that you define where you are going instead of letting Biglaw define it. And the way to do this — in my view — is to create a Power Niche for your career.

If you read my other writings on Power Niches, you will understand that a Power Niche for a lawyer is NOT legal in nature. It is industry specific. And it is not something you find, it is something you create.

There is not enough space here to really go into this, so to learn more you can visit my [website](https://brucestachenfeld.com/power-niche-marketing/) that as further explanation of what a Power Niche is.

Now my articles for ATL are supposed to be about the Law Firms of the Future, and you might wonder what this pontification to young lawyers has to do with that. And the answer is easy. The Law Firm of the Future would have as its mission to be a place where its young lawyers create their own Power Niches. As their Power Niches develop, they either stay at the firm and grow it there, or they leave the firm and become part of the firm’s ecosystem in its industry (possibly even moving to the business side).

If I were a young man or a young woman seeking an incredible career in law, boy would I want to be at a law firm like that. And since the name of the game is all about attracting, training, and retaining talent, I would think a Law Firm of the Future would want to do exactly this.

# A Holiday Bonus That Came In Just Before The Clock Struck For Thanksgiving
## Sometimes bonuses can get lost in the holiday.

As associates wound up their work before Thanksgiving, another firm sent around a bonus announcement that didn’t reach the Above the Law offices until just now. This is a good time to remind everyone that we rely on our army of tipsters to keep us in the loop. Thankfully, one firm tipster noticed that we hadn’t reported on this bonus yet and sent it in. But don’t wait until a few days go by — we’d prefer to hear about the bonus 20 times than miss it for a day.

Stroock & Stroock & Lavan just joined the bonus game and followed suit as one would expect. From a tipster:

Stroock gave thanks to its associates last week by matching the Cravath scale in 2019 for bonuses in NY and DC (Class of 2019 – $15,000 (prorated), Class of 2018 – $15,000, Class of 2017 – $25,000, Class of 2016 – $50,000, Class of 2015 – $65,000, Class of 2014 – $80,000, Class of 2013 – $90,000, Class of 2012 and senior – $100,000), while associates in LA and MI will receive market bonuses. As in prior years, associates with very high billable hours will also be eligible for an additional “super” bonuses that exceed the Cravath scale.

# The Screaming In Law Firms Needs To End

I remember the first time I heard about the concept of “screamers” in Biglaw. I was prepping for on-campus interviews and I was advised to stay away from a particular firm because they had a lot of screamers. I was young with limited work experience at the time, and the notion that a grown-ass adult would turn around scream at a colleague — even a junior one — seemed absurd.

The concept is no less absurd, but now I know it happens all too often, especially in high powered law firms.

The concept of screaming at work has gotten a lot of play since Arrested Development star[ Jeffrey Tambor’s berating of his co-star, Jessica Walters](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/arts/television/arrested-development-netflix-interview-jeffrey-tambor.html) (a goddamned national treasure btw) became public. During an interview Walters teared up recalling the incident, saying “in like almost 60 years of working, I’ve never had anybody yell at me like that on a set.” But that admission had almost no impact on her male co-stars who, to varying levels, defended Tambor’s actions because he’s talented and inappropriate screaming was just par for the course when dealing with a delicate genius.

But the phenomenon of yellers goes way beyond the entertainment industry. For a sample of just how ubiquitous it’s become, check out writer Jessica Wakeman’s Twitter thread asking for stories about screamers at work — and yes, there’s one from a law firm (“A lawyer I worked for when I was 20 cussed me out and spat water at me because I got him water without ice.”):

Out of curiosity, who else has been yelled / shouted at by a man in the workplace?

— Jessica Wakeman (@JessicaWakeman) [May 24, 2018](https://twitter.com/JessicaWakeman/status/999671936648204290?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Usually this kind of unacceptable behavior is justified at a law firm because the screamer is a rainmaker and everyone’s scared that he’ll pack up his ball and go to another firm. (And that’s been a [tried and true strategy for problematic partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/timesup-for-this-biglaw-partner-who-got-a-new-gig-after-being-quietly-pushed-out-of-his-old-firm/) in the past.) The structure of most law firms also compounds the problem — often practice groups or a partner with a discrete book of business are able to act autonomously from the whole of the firm in a little fiefdom of their own creation with little or no oversight from the larger firm structure.

But as the national zeitgeist is finally turning to issues of harassment in the workplace it is time to consider the role that tolerating and defending screamers plays in workplace harassment. [At Salon](https://www.salon.com/2018/05/28/when-you-work-with-a-jeffrey-tambor-screaming-colleagues-your-genius-pass-just-expired/), [Mary Elizabeth Williams](https://www.salon.com/writer/mary_elizabeth_williams) argues that professional humans simply have to do better:

Creating a safe, productive workplace isn’t just about preventing sexual assault. It’s about having enough respect for your fellow human beings — and enough self-control as a goddamn toilet-trained adult — to handle frustration in a way that doesn’t frighten other people. It’s about not making excuses for other people who do.

Williams characterizes this as a form of abuse designed to keep subordinates, well, subordinate:

Physical and verbal abuse, in contrast, depend on the unique shame of public humiliation. The screamer, with defiantly oversized behavior, all but dares you to fight back. After all, what’s the point of delivering an epic beatdown without an audience?

That brand of intimidation is different but very simple and effective — keep your mouths shut, everybody or next time, it’ll be you. (This dynamic also works marvelously in abusive families.) It forces those lower on the totem pole to be complicit out of fear of losing their jobs, and it reinforces to those higher up that scaring the crap out of people is an effective motivational tool, as well as a perk of being valued by the organization.

There are also the practical considerations — Biglaw firms (at least those that tout their culture as a benefit) love saying they don’t have any screamers. But, unfortunately, that can be wishcasting by folks in charge who have no idea what it’s like to work three floors up in a different department. Firms need to have these difficult conversations with the partnership — even if they don’t think it’s a problem they have.

And if an associate or staff member does come to firm management or another member of the partnership with concerns, your first move shouldn’t be reflexively defensive. Try listening. It can do wonders.

While the Fourth of July is a slow day around the United States, for firms with a true global presence, the annual celebration of Britain’s crushing defeat doesn’t register much. So it was the perfect day for our friends at Law360 to release their latest Global 20 ranking, breaking down the firms with the “broadest global reach and the proven ability to handle the most difficult cross-border matters, from multibillion-dollar mergers to heated legal brawls.”

Let’s check out the top 5…

Which just so happens to be the top 6…

On the other hand, Norton Rose’s position on this list highlights the divide between the firm’s international and domestic practices. While the international work lands them a spot on this prestigious list, they’ve been [beset by defections and general malaise stateside](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/norton-roses-problems-run-way-deeper-than-losing-abbe-lowell/).

Digging into the data reveals that the average firm on the Global 20 boasts 45 offices across the globe. Which markets they’ve opted to play in varies, but every single one of the top 20 have offices in New York, London, Beijing, and Hong Kong, showing the most powerful global firms know which way the wind is blowing when it comes to 21st-century business.

Kudos to every firm that made the list. Now get back to billing — you have some raises to pay for.

# Leaving Your In-House Role: You Don’t Need A Portable 'Book' To Be Successful
## With the emergence of remote work, in-house attorneys now have more options and are better positioned to leverage their experience, defining success on their own terms without the need for a portable 'book' of business.

Deputy Managing Partner, Heather Cantua Phillips (center), was former AGC at Unison and corporate counsel at LendingClub prior to building a thriving practice at Scale LLP.

For years, many talented lawyers have opted out of the traditional law firm path and pursued an in-house career. Over the past 40 years, in fact, this trend has accelerated. In 1980, an estimated 10% of American lawyers worked in-house; today, more work in-house than at large law firms. But for those considering a move back to private practice, the time may be now.

For decades, as American businesses have grown in size and complexity — facing more regulation, competition, litigation risk, and other issues — the need for sophisticated in-house capabilities has continued to increase. The attraction of in-house legal jobs has also steadily grown over time. Credit the push-pull effect of the increasing prominence of in-house work, on the one hand, with the declining luster of traditional law firm life on the other.

Professor Eli Wald, of Sturm College of Law at the University of Denver, [reports](https://inview.lawvu.com/blog/a-history-of-in-house-counsel) that over time the rising prestige of in-house roles captured the “professional aspirations of dissatisfied Big Law lawyers,” causing more and more talent to make the move.

In-house legal jobs also historically offered more accommodating schedules along with the opportunity to gain valuable business experience. And many in-house lawyers used that business experience to transition to non-legal executive roles (Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan is just one example). In addition, the potential to achieve significant financial payoffs from venture-backed companies being sold or going public created even more demand for top in-house roles over the past 20 years.

Now though, the calculus may be changing. The demands on in-house legal departments have increased, with departments expected to manage more risk and greater workload with leaner headcount. At the same time, economic uncertainty has placed greater cost pressure on departments and diminished the potential for a financial exit in many cases.

In the wake of the pandemic, in-house lawyers, like other professionals, are reconsidering their career options. In a [recent survey](https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/2022/09/20/in-house-legal-team-churn-could-get-worse/), Wolters Kluwer found that 70% of in-house attorneys are considering leaving their current position, and 86% of those cited the pandemic and the “great resignation” as having a significant effect on legal departments.

But in-house lawyers considering a move may be reluctant to make the jump because of two concerns that have historically factored into this decision: the burdensome hours and facetime requirements at big firms, and the need for a portable “book of business.” Both of these concerns, however, may be outdated.

For one thing, private practice has evolved. A greater variety in law firm offerings–remote work, better economics, and an emphasis on in-house experience–means in-house attorneys now have more options. At [Scale LLP](http://bit.ly/3HUNY6c) and other remote-first firms, attorneys are encouraged to define success on their own terms, work when and where they want, and leverage the invaluable experience they gained as clients in corporate roles to build a [rewarding practice](http://bit.ly/3WpIWng).

The “book of business” myth is also overdue for a reckoning. For years, firms have blindly relied on this concept to screen applicants, but the “portable book” concept has rarely been tested as a means for attracting talent to firms. Indeed, it is inherently problematic. For one thing, the practice of posting portable book requirements tends to attract attorneys willing to say they have the business, while at the same time discouraging attorneys willing to give an honest appraisal of their work. It should come as no surprise that women and underrepresented groups are more likely to fall in the latter category, compounding BigLaw’s already woeful record on diversity.

What’s more, the reality is that business is not portable; talent is. Success in private practice comes from networking, not necessarily from moving a “portable” silo of work from one firm to another. Adding new talent to a firm allows the organization to expand existing client work by leveraging new skills to grow those relationships. And a new attorney’s own clients can be introduced to others at the firm who offer a broader range of capabilities in return. Applied to the in-house lawyer, it’s easy to see how an attorney with client-side and business experience, contacts in an industry, and highly specialized legal skill would succeed in a law firm environment. In-house lawyers can and do grow firms’ existing client work in this way, while also providing access to new opportunities. Building a practice takes time, to be sure, but it is more likely to flow from skill and networking than promised work from new or existing clients.

“The thing most in-house attorneys don’t realize is this: from a skills perspective, and even more importantly from a network perspective, they’re starting well ahead of the pack,” says Scale LLP Founding Partner Adam Forest. “In-house lawyers understand the pressures of business and how to right-size risk better than outside counsel. Full stop. And senior in-house lawyers — unlike most lawyers in private practice — have been able to show their quality in front of business leaders who are capable of hiring them. In other words, they have a ready network of clients who know and trust them the day they start their practice.”

Scientific studies of human networking confirm this idea. [Marissa King](https://www.economist.com/business/2021/01/05/the-science-of-networking), Professor of Organizational Behavior at the Yale School of Management, confirms that innovation and networking are inextricably linked: “Success in the service economy is dependent on the human element: picking the right staff members and motivating them correctly.” Malcolm Gladwell and others have emphasized the importance of networks over hierarchies, too, and these human connections at organizations–including law firms–have only become more important in a remote-work, post-pandemic environment. Author Keith Ferrazzi writes about professional relationships and networking. In “Never Eat Alone,” he says the primary drivers of network-building require both giving and receiving: “connecting” with other professionals is a constant process of “asking for and offering help,” he says.

Remote-work law firms have attracted talent by creating an alternative to the traditional law firm model. And by focusing on talent, rather than solely relying on outdated notions of the “portable book,” new firms are recruiting and retaining lawyers who can seed and grow networks. In-house specialists with powerful industry connections and skills learned in real business environments easily fit this model.

Lawyers with in-house experience have a lot to offer law firms. And firms that emphasize a shared mission and core values — including a collaborative commitment to the success of every attorney in the network rather than antiquated “portable book” requirements — may offer a new alternative for in-house attorneys. For those looking to make a change, now may be the perfect time.

# Federal Judge Ruined The Internet Yesterday
## It's a Copyright Act violation to embed a Tweet now. Ugh.

Judge Katherine B. Forrest has put up with a lot of [ridiculous](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/judge-compares-ice-to-unjust-regime-ice-is-concerned-about-her-tone/) and [horrible](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/dont-threaten-a-federal-judge-yes-that-applies-to-you-anonymous-commenters/) bulls**t in her tenure on the bench. So let’s establish off the bat that she doesn’t deserve most of the guff she takes.

But her decision yesterday in Goldman v. Breitbart, et More Respectable Outlets, is just awful. And it’s not even that it’s necessarily wrong… just awful. Read the [whole thing here](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/federal-judge-ruined-the-internet-yesterday/2/).

In a nutshell, the Goldman case is about a photo of Tom Brady and Danny Ainge. Plaintiff Justin Goldman took the picture and then uploaded it to Snapchat. The picture bounced around social media and ended up on Twitter. The defendants, a number of media organizations, “embedded” the tweets, allowing their readers to see the original tweets posted publicly on Twitter’s servers.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Defendants argued for the “Server Test,” a modestly developed doctrine that basically says it’s only a violation if someone hosts the infringing image on their own server. It’s a sound and entirely necessary doctrine because otherwise Google would be bankrupt for showing previews of search results.

Judge Forrest went in the other direction:

Having carefully considered the embedding issue, this Court concludes, for the reasons discussed below, that when defendants caused the embedded Tweets to appear on their websites, their actions violated plaintiff’s exclusive display right; the fact that the image was hosted on a server owned and operated by an unrelated third party (Twitter) does not shield them from this result.

That’s disturbing. Defendants had warned — without hyperbole — that walking away from the Server Test would “cause a tremendous chilling effect on the core functionality of the web,” and amici argued that it could “radically change linking practices, and thereby transform the Internet as we know it.”

Why in the world would the Server Test not apply, according to Goldman?

He and his amici caution that to adopt the Server Test broadly would have a “devastating” economic impact on photography and visual artwork licensing industries, noting that it would “eliminate” the incentives for websites to pay licensing fees, and thus “deprive content creators of the resources necessary to invest in further creation.”

Then don’t put it on f**king Snapchat.

Look, I don’t know what to tell you, but if you wanted licensing fees for your work, go sign up with Getty or something. But if you’re going to post them on Instagram or Snapchat — the photography equivalent of scribbling “For a good image call…” on a bathroom wall — you shouldn’t get to walk in here and act like social media took food out of your kids’ mouths.

And this sentiment mirrors Judge Forrest’s parting words too:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
In this case, there are genuine questions about whether plaintiff effectively released his image into the public domain when he posted it to his Snapchat account. Indeed, in many cases there are likely to be factual questions as to licensing and authorization. There is also a very serious and strong fair use defense, a defense under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and limitations on damages from innocent infringement.

But this is the whole problem with this opinion that is Judge Forrest’s fault. Maybe she’s right and she’s just the messenger for a copyright regime in need of desperate overhaul in light of modern technology, years of lobbying mischief, and that nonsensical Aereo opinion. Or maybe she’s wrong and created an unnecessary and inefficient hurdle for media by creating a violation without realistic redress sparking frivolous lawsuits against media outlets for years to come.

But regardless of the substance, what really sucks about this opinion is her agreeing to the parties’ stipulation to sever the display-right issues from the defenses and force the court to put out an opinion lacking critical context. Now all we know is that embedding social media posts created by users for the express purpose of free public viewing is a violation. We just have to stay tuned to find out if it’s one that gets an outlet in trouble or not.

That’s all well and good when you’re managing a busy docket, but every media outlet in the country woke up this morning trying to figure out if they can report on the President without violating the Copyright Act.

(The full opinion is unironically embedded on the next page.)

And these are all -- many of 'em are Trump haters.“ [[This Week / ABC](https://t.co/J72Biz1YSs)] * With just two weeks left, tensions are high as the legal community awaits the Supreme Court’s decisions in the 24 cases that remain on this term’s docket. What fresh hell will be unleashed upon society this week? [[The Hill](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/448653-anticipation-builds-for-final-supreme-court-rulings)] * The Justice Department claims that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin didn’t break the law when he refused to turn over President Trump’s tax returns to Congress because he was just protecting their confidentiality. [[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-taxes/mnuchin-on-solid-ground-in-withholding-trump-tax-returns-justice-department-idUSKCN1TF2M8?il=0)] * Trump intends to nominate a Biglaw partner to the board of directors for the Legal Services Corporation, the organization whose budget he keeps trying to cut.

As a tipster noted, “Someone took the office pumpkin decorating contest very literally!”

# No Bonuses For You! Raises Aren't Enough To Make Associates Happy
## Raises, but no bonuses, at this firm.

I thought I was also getting a bonus…

The powers that be at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan have communicated their plans to deal with the new market reality brought on by a trio of Biglaw firms — Milbank, Simpson Thacher and Cravath. The firm has decided to raise base compensation for associates — but there are a ton of caveats.

As you can see from this email sent out by an associate representative (the compensation changes were communicated by the firm during an associate meeting), salaries in New York and D.C. are basically on par with the market. Miami associates get raises, but downgraded to an undisclosed level by the Miami market standard. And in Los Angeles, midlevel associates get kicked off the compensation grid for the murky waters of individualized compensation.

But there are no special summer bonuses for associates.



Client reaction is cited as the primary reason the firm isn’t going to hand out mid-year bonuses, but the firm told associates that the lack of a summer bonus would be a factor in determining year-end bonuses. From a client’s perspective, it probably matters when you give employees a bonus as much as it matters how much they are… and whether billing rates increase to pay for the new expense.

Reaction from tipsters hasn’t been pretty:

Associates are upset. This is a shortsighted move by firm management and speaks volumes about firm liquidity.

I guess the firm figures angry associates are a decent price to pay for happy clients.

UPDATE: Since the story was published, we’ve had other tipsters at the firm reach out and tell us they don’t really care about the money, and they’ve put their trust in the firm to make it right with year end bonuses:

Associates here generally see the bigger picture and aren’t solely motivated by the financial aspects. Also note that they said that end of year bonuses have a discretionary/merit component, so many of us expect that we will still be treated fairly overall, hence the lack of outrage. Whoever submitted the news isn’t in the majority here. The overall mood today has been one of gratitude.

Someone’s not in Biglaw for the money? Wonders never cease.

Seyfarth Shaw wrote one of the worst motions of all time this month, explaining how women’s soccer players shouldn’t be paid men’s salaries [because they get pregnant and stuff](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/u-s-soccer-has-to-pay-men-more-because-playing-for-a-crowd-of-hooligans-is-a-big-responsibility/). It was a motion so bad [it got the client fired](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/when-you-write-a-brief-so-bad-it-gets-the-client-fired/), with U.S. Soccer president Carlos Cordeiro stepping down amid the uproar created by the filing. Given how this is playing out, it seems as though the women have got this covered, but a “private attorney general” is trying to elbow into the proceedings.

When crazy soccer fans file legal motions (and this one, filed last week by a private individual to intervene in the USWNT case, has all sorts of unexpected twists). It's like a cross between legal hooliganism and a train wreck. You can't stop watching. [pic.twitter.com/qVLE1g8czu](https://t.co/qVLE1g8czu)

The gist of the motion is to get Donald Trump to focus on the national emergency Seyfarth Shaw has created with its brief:



This… isn’t a RICO thing, man.

The motion doesn’t make much sense seeing as it asks Trump to do something useful which is like [asking Thailand to stop Alex Morgan](https://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/matches/match/300438226/). At least include a paragraph explaining how taking action makes money for his hotels or hurts Mitt Romney… something to get him interested.

But while it’s easy to pick at the flaws in the filing, at least the guy’s heart is in the right place. Not everyone understands the legal system, but everyone should all be capable of grasping that Seyfarth Shaw’s motion was a clumsy extension of an ongoing effort of “Intimidation [and] Hostility” toward the players. It’s just a gussied-up retread of all the sad misogyny the players hear every time they have to talk about pay. It’s nice to know people out there are hearing the players.

That said, pro se folks have enough troubles getting their own cases handled… maybe steer clear of intervening in someone else’s.

But hey, this private attorney general hasn’t tried to suspend habeas corpus yet so he’s [got one up on the real attorney general](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/bill-barr-will-save-america-by-quarantining-the-constitution/).

In what’s being referred to as one of the largest mass layoffs since the [Great Lathaming of 2009](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/02/nationwide-layoff-watch-latham-cuts-440-190-associates-250-staff/), a global Biglaw firm expects to cut 180 jobs thanks to redundancies in its business operations.

Which firm could it be?

Following the conclusion of a two-year review process, DLA Piper has decided to slash jobs across all of its business support roles in the United Kingdom, in order to shift jobs to its new back-office hub in Warsaw, Poland, a haven for low wages. Andrew Darwin, the chief operating officer of the firm, gave this statement to the [ABA Journal](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/dla_piper_to_lay_off_180_in_uk):

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Our collective consultation has now concluded and we can confirm that we will be going ahead with our proposals to reduce the size of our IT, Finance, HR, Marketing & BD, and Secretarial teams in the U.K. as part of our plans to operate more effectively on a global basis and improve the quality, consistency and efficiency of the way we deliver our services to our clients.

At the beginning of its review process, DLA Piper sought to eliminate 200 jobs, but now it looks like only 175 are being truly cut (with four employees having been reassigned, and one employee having resigned). The firm previously laid off 250 U.K. staff members back in 2013 when its Glasgow office closed. DLA Piper is still reassessing its workforce, and more layoffs could perhaps come before the end of 2016.

Here’s some additional information from [Legal Business](http://www.legalbusiness.co.uk/index.php/lb-blog-view/7445-redundancy-update-dla-to-cut-180-jobs-in-uk-as-consultation-closes):

The move is arguably another sign of a slowdown in the legal market, with [King & Wood Mallesons axing 45 business services staff in London](http://www.legalbusiness.co.uk/index.php/lb-blog-view/6479-kwm-cutbacks-hit-37-support-staff-in-the-city) in March and Reed Smith cutting 45 lawyer roles across the US, UK and Middle East in January.

More recently, Simmons & Simmons [laid off lawyers in London](http://www.legalbusiness.co.uk/index.php/lb-blog-view/7183-real-estate-practice-worst-hit-as-simmons-makes-redundancies-across-its-london-office) following the Brexit vote. While the firm has refused to comment on the number of redundancies, banking and real estate are two practices known to be affected.

Will DLA Piper, the largest law firm in the U.K., be forced to start laying off attorneys? We certainly hope not, but if we hear anything of the sort, we’ll let you know.

We wish all of the legal professionals and affected individuals at DLA Piper the best of luck while they seek new job opportunities in the legal industry and beyond.

If your firm or organization is closing its doors or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive — we’ll never ignore you.

# Suspended Biglaw Associate Accused In Molotov Cocktail Attack Released To Home Confinement
## Hundreds of lawyers oppose the government’s arguments against him and his alleged accomplice, calling the charges politically motivated.

When we last checked in on furloughed (and later suspended) Biglaw associate Colinford Mattis and housing attorney Urooj Rahman, both charged for their [involvement with a Molotov cocktail attack](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/furloughed-biglaw-associate-charged-in-new-york-molotov-cocktail-attack/) on a police vehicle in Brooklyn, New York, they’d been [sent back to jail](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/suspended-biglaw-associate-accused-in-molotov-cocktail-attack-sent-back-to-jail/) after originally being [released to home confinement on $250,000 bond](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/furloughed-biglaw-associate-charged-in-molotov-cocktail-attack-released-on-250k-bond/?rf=1). The pair were indicted on charges of arson and use of explosives, and each pleaded not guilty. Earlier this week, their fortunes changed once again thanks to a decision made by the Second Circuit.

With support from former federal prosecutors, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and more than 850 people currently or formerly affiliated with New York University School of Law, Mattis and Rahman eagerly awaited news from the appellate court. The [New York Law Journal](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2020/06/30/lawyers-accused-of-molotov-cocktail-bombing-can-return-home-2nd-circuit-rules/) has the details on what happened:

Judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on Tuesday affirmed the ruling of a district court judge who found that the attorneys accused of firebombing an empty New York City Police Department vehicle can be released to home confinement, vacating an earlier stay that sent the lawyers to Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center.

Judges Peter Hall and Gerard Lynch wrote that they “would not have necessarily reached the same conclusion” as U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie of the Eastern District of New York, who released Colinford Mattis and Urooj Rahman to home confinement on a $250,000 bond, but they were left without a firm conviction that Brodie committed clear error.

Judge Jon Newman dissented, writing that even if the court did not reverse based on clear error, it should remand so that the district court could make “some explicit indication” as to whether the presumption of detention had been rebutted.

May is just around the corner, but the Biglaw austerity measures inspired by COVID-19 are far from over.

After a 2017 merger that brought together Saul Ewing and Arnstein & Lehr to the obviously named Saul Ewing Arnstein & Lehr, the firm took the 15th spot in the most recent [the Vault ranking](https://www.vault.com/best-companies-to-work-for/law/best-law-firms-in-each-us-region/mid-atlantic) of most prestigious Mid-Atlantic firms. The firm was ranked 131st on the 2019 Am Law 200 after raking in $227,305,000 in gross revenue. But these accolades can’t stop the force that is COVID-19 austerity measures.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
According to sources at the firm, they’re conducting layoffs/furloughs of associates and staff. Tipsters say the number of non-partner attorneys out of work is 25, while expected figures on impacted staff remain unclear. The firm is also cutting salaries, and though the exact percentages are unclear, the cuts only apply to those making more than $50,000 a year.

When asked for comment, Managing Partner Barry F. Levin provided the following:

As businesses across the country are doing in this unprecedented global health and economic crisis, Saul Ewing Arnstein & Lehr has taken steps to ensure that our Firm remains stable through this turbulent period and is well-positioned to continue to provide excellent legal services to our clients. At the outset of the outbreak, we focused on thoughtfully managing our expenses by reducing discretionary spending and postponing large capital projects. Our partners also saw reductions in their draws. However, with longer-term projections from the government and our clients now available, we have taken steps to broaden our austerity measures to ensure our firm is in the best position possible when things begin to normalize.

Our comprehensive approach involves salary reductions for those making more than $50,000 per year, temporary furloughs and layoffs. We opted to make these difficult changes now, with the goal of avoiding the need for further measures down the road. More optimistically, we will also be prepared to roll-back the added precautions when warranted. We believe this shared sacrifice across all constituencies is the most fair solution at this challenging time.

We are confident that implementing these austerity measures at this time will ensure that we continue to have the most strategic team in place to serve our clients throughout this pandemic and beyond.

We sure hope the firm will be able to “roll-back” all of its austerity measures.

# Another Top Biglaw Firm Makes Their Compensation Move
## Another firm matches the Cravath scale, but adds discretionary bonuses on top!

A third top 25 Biglaw firm has announced raises and year-end bonuses that match the scale that [Cravath set yesterday](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/cravath-announces-raises-comes-over-the-top-of-milbank-scale-for-some-associates/). [McDermott](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/first-firm-to-match-cravath-salary-scale-took-less-than-an-hour-to-announce/) and[ Paul Hastings](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/paul-hastings-raise-bonus-2023/) quickly made their move yesterday, Paul, Weiss took the evening but came out strong this morning.

Last year the firm made $1,805,139,000 in gross revenue, making it 22nd on AmLaw 100. And with this compensation move they’re demonstrating they’re still at the top of the heap.

The new salary scale at Paul, Weiss is as follows:

Class of 2023  	$225,000
Class of 2022  	$235,000
Class of 2021  	$260,000
Class of 2020  	$310,000  
Class of 2019  	$365,000 
Class of 2018  	$390,000
Class of 2017  	$420,000
Class of 2016 	$435,000
Additionally, year-end bonuses were also announced, which match the prevailing market rate.

Class of 2023  	$15,000  
Class of 2022  	$20,000  
Class of 2021  	$30,000  
Class of 2020  	$57,500  
Class of 2019  	$75,000  
Class of 2018  	$90,000  
Class of 2017  	$105,000
Class of 2016  	$115,000
But there is EVEN MORE good news. In their announcement the firm indicated there will be a round of additional discretionary bonuses come 2024. (They made similar discretionary bonuses in 2022 and 2021.) Happy new year indeed!

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

America does nothing for decades.

Then it jolts forward a century in the space of a couple of weeks.

It’s wonderful. But I’ve heard from a few people who find it jarring. (I’m writing about people from outside the joint where I work, naturally.  We’re actually doing pretty well with these conversations.)

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“I know we’re in a new world,” my correspondents say. “But I don’t know the rules of that world. What can I say? When people say the wrong thing they’re being fired without severance. I’m not saying a peep. I don’t think they can fire me for silence.”

What’s the problem?

Renaming military bases that bear the names of Confederate generals is easy. I never thought about who Braxton Bragg (of Fort Bragg) was until this week. It turns out he was an [inept Confederate general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braxton_Bragg). We’re thus glorifying him for being a traitor and a racist. We shouldn’t do that. Eliminate his name.

What’s the limit on this rule?

You might think that the rule is this: “No statues or military bases or other accolades for people who are being celebrated solely for things that are plainly wrong.” Put the statues of Confederates in museums. But celebrate people who were simply creatures of their time and are being celebrated for things that are good.

Thus: You would be permitted to celebrate Washington and Jefferson because they did stuff we think was good, like winning the Revolutionary War, writing the Declaration of Independence, and so on. Washington and Jefferson both owned slaves, but we’re not celebrating them for that, and we recognize that they were men of their times.

Similarly, one could celebrate [Ezra Pound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Pound#Arrest_for_treason), a great poet, even though he was an outspoken fascist, saved from life imprisonment or execution after World War II only by other writers who convinced the government to spare him and instead put him in a psychiatric hospital for the rest of his life. Pound was a scumbag — but he did write The Cantos, and T.S. Eliot did dedicate The Wasteland to him. We’re allowed to celebrate the good bits, right?

How about the [Edmund Pettus Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Pettus_Bridge) in Selma? I know that name only for the good — the police unleashed the dogs and fire hoses but that prompted America to pass the Civil Rights Act. I learned only this week that [Edmund Pettus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Pettus_Bridge) was a grand dragon of the KKK.  Should we rename the bridge because Pettus was a scumbag or keep the name because the name is now associated with a good cause?

Washington and Lee University? Lee was a Confederate general. The fact that he was also the president of what was then called [Washington College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee) doesn’t matter. He’s being celebrated for the treason part; rename the school.

I recently got out a crayon and made some changes to my diploma. I graduated from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University. Way back when, I thought: “[Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson)? Princeton student who made good. President of Princeton. Governor of New Jersey. President of the United States. World War I. League of Nations. Led to the United Nations and the system of international institutions that help to preserve the peace today. No problem with the name.”

It turns out [Wilson was a scumbag](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/cafe/woodrow-wilson-was-even-worse-than-you-think). Raised in Georgia during the Civil War, he was a vicious racist, re-segregating the federal civil service, among other things. Thus, the need for a crayon: I’ve now graduated from the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs.

Look at the statues we’re tearing down. [Christopher Columbus](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/07/01/christopher-columbus-statue-removed-columbus-city-hall-ohio/5354761002/)? [Winston Churchill](https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/06/12/875731303/statue-of-winston-churchill-covered-up-in-london)? [Ulysses Grant](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/503685-protesters-tear-down-statues-of-union-general-ulysses-s-grant-national), for heaven’s sake? I was pretty sure he was one of the [good guys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant): He was given one slave and voluntarily freed the man. Won the Civil War. Two-term president who oversaw the good parts of Reconstruction. Prosecuted the KKK. I guess I have to study harder to figure out why we can’t celebrate Grant.

What about the pyramids, erected as tombs for and tributes to [folks who held slaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_ancient_Egypt)? What about the nasty bits in the Bible about [Sodomites](https://www.openbible.info/topics/sodomite)?

The times they are a-changin’. The rules are uncertain. But free speech matters, even in changing times.

I understand why I’m hearing from people who are afraid to speak. But institutions should be flexible during times when we’re both drawing new lines and trying to adjust our bearings.

Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Career Mobility As In-House Counsel
## Don’t forget that if you absolutely hate being in-house, you can always return to law firm life.

When I left law firm life for my current role, I was a senior associate up for shareholder. And one of my concerns about moving in-house was the fear that going in-house would be the end of the road for my career, that saying yes to the corporate counsel life would somehow be the end of my growth. I was afraid that there was nowhere to go after going in-house, especially if I wasn’t sure whether I’d want to become a general counsel one day. At least so far, my fear was unfounded. While I have limited personal experience because I have stayed “managing counsel of employment” since I joined my company almost eight years ago, I have witnessed how corporate counsel experience has actually led to more doors being opened than closed.

Moving Up In Legal

A traditional trajectory for moving up in legal is a corporate counsel who is promoted internally, usually from a role where they do not supervise a team to one that does. As I have written before, in-house counsel titles can be elusive and misleading, but what is consistent about promotion is that you will usually manage more people or more matters or clients or areas of law as you move up. More often than not, there is a move away from being a deep subject matter expert toward becoming more of a generalist. How quickly this can happen depends on the organization. Of course, if there aren’t any opportunities at their current company, I have seen how in-house counsel move to other companies to get the extra title and responsibility.

Growing In Place 

For larger companies that tend to be flatter organizations, there are very limited opportunities for actual promotions in the legal department. But there are many opportunities to grow — either by changing clients so you get to know other areas of the company or by learning other areas of law. While expanding your practice areas may be challenging as a private practitioner because clients often want someone who is a deep specialist and not a generalist, in-house counsel can have an easier time picking up different areas of law because they get the benefit of learning from those very experts that they hire.

Moving To The Business

Another way I’ve seen in-house counsel develop is when they move into the business and out of the legal department. For example, I’ve seen employment lawyers become chief diversity officers and chief human resource officers. An easy shift is also from legal into compliance and procurement. I also know many a lawyer in government affairs and lobbying.

Don’t forget that if you absolutely hate being in-house, you can always return to law firm life. That proverbial “fork in the road” or false binary construct that we all make up when we are faced with a career decision isn’t actually a fork in the road. As lawyers, we have a lot of flexibility with the trajectory of our careers. I personally know of in-house counsel who have returned to private practices and who credit their in-house experience for making them better outside counsel. To me, having an in-house opportunity is less of a fork in the road and more of a multiplier of opportunities.

Mercedes Colwin via Fox News

Check out the update to the story [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/biglaw-partner-gets-thrown-under-the-bus-by-her-firm/).

As the sexual harassment and assault allegations are piling up against powerful men in [entertainment](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/l-a-district-attorney-preparing-a-sexual-harassment-task-force/), [politics](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/alabama-republican-thinks-roy-moores-victims-should-be-prosecuted/), [Silicon Valley](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/silicon-valleys-sexual-harassment-crisis-keeps-getting-worse)… and well everywhere in between, there has been increased visibility of #metoo stories and corresponding calls to believe the women and men who are brave enough to speak out. Gordon & Rees partner Mercedes Colwin has taken a… decidedly different tack.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Colwin is the managing partner of the Biglaw firm’s New York office whose litigation practice focuses on employment law, commercial litigation, class actions, products liability, professional liability, wage and hour class actions, civil rights violations, and criminal law. Also included in [her firm bio](https://www.gordonrees.com/lawyers/m/mercedes-colwin) is this little gem, “Ms. Colwin regularly defends corporate executives from Fortune 500 companies accused of wrongdoing including claims of sexual misconduct.”

Yeah… you just know when Colwin appeared on Hannity Thursday night to discuss the allegations that Alabama Senatorial candidate Roy Moore [dated underage girls](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/woman-says-roy-moore-initiated-sexual-encounter-when-she-was-14-he-was-32/2017/11/09/1f495878-c293-11e7-afe9-4f60b5a6c4a0_story.html?utm_term=.ae6e3611df79) it was going to be a doozy.

If you’re looking to be outraged, Colwin does not disappoint:

Hannity: Do people do it for money? Do they do it for political reasons? Is that more common than people think?

Colwin: Oh definitely.

Hannity: They will lie to make money?

Colwin: Undoubtedly. I mean, there are individuals who will come forward with these outrageous allegations, and they fall…

Hannity: And that hurts women who are victims.

Colwin: Yes. I used to work in sex crimes in the DA’s office. It was very pitiful to see that. Because some jurors don’t believe it because they have, in their own lives, there are people who have made these accusations for money. You see this time and time and time again. And sexual harassment, that term is coined everywhere, frankly, the laws are very clear about what it takes to have some sort of violation of the law. You have to have some sort of damage. And these individuals, a lot of these women, it’s all about money, and they bank on the fact that these corporations have the reputation that they want to save.

Hannity: And the hard—this is where you thread the needle, because there are women who are victims of predators.

Colwin: Yes, there are. There are. But very few and far between.

Way to trot out the trope that women are gold digging liars there. And I suppose the deluge of #metoo narratives have done nothing to change her default that men should be believed — even when a pattern has been established.

Jordan Weissmann, [writing for Slate](https://slate.com/business/2017/11/mercedes-colwin-tells-hannity-women-lie-about-harassment-for-money.html), shares the disgust over the Colwin’s awful victim blaming. He reached out and asked her to clarify her statements:

She didn’t walk back the “few and far between” quip. Instead, Colwin wrote that she was “profoundly sympathetic” to harassment victims “as one who has personally experienced such treatment and also had a deceased sister who was a victim of domestic violence.” But she also said that “in some cases, incidents of alleged sexual harassment can be misrepresented or even fabricated” and the accused deserved the “presumption of innocence.”

“I did not in any way mean to trivialize or minimize the impact of sexual harassment on any victims of such practices or to condone such behaviors in any setting, whether business or personal,” she added. Which, fair enough. She merely suggested most victims aren’t real.

Don’t believe Colwin’s attempt to deflect away from the harmful impact of her words. She tries to create a false dichotomy between “real” victims of sexual harassment and abuse, and women, like those speaking out about Roy Moore’s alleged behavior, who are coming forward. Under Colwin’s worldview their stories will always get caught in the crossfire and implicit biases about who gets to count as believable will rule the day.

Instead, may I suggest something radical and believe women.

Gordon & Rees, never known to handle[ PR blunders](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/biglaw-partners-social-media-fail/) [particularly well](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/what-to-do-after-youve-been-shamed-on-atl/), has yet to issue a comment about the incident.

Colwin’s full response to Weissmann is below:

I would like to take this opportunity to clarify certain of my remarks from the November 9 broadcast of the Sean Hannity Show. First and foremost, I am profoundly sympathetic of anyone who has been the victim of sexual harassment and believe they deserve full and complete protection under the law. As one who has personally experienced such treatment and also had a deceased sister who was a victim of domestic violence, it is entirely apparent to me that sexual predators do indeed exist in our society who deserve to be called out, civilly pursued and criminally prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

On the other hand, my comments made during the broadcast were intended to address a different set of circumstances which I have observed both as an administrative law judge and an attorney over a number of decades—namely that in some cases, incidents of alleged sexual harassment can be misrepresented or even fabricated as a means of leveraging an advantage in court or otherwise. And given the incredibly serious nature of such accusations, it is important to bear in mind that the accused also have rights and are deserving of the presumption of innocence embedded in our legal system.

In any event, I did not in any way mean to trivialize or minimize the impact of sexual harassment on any victims of such practices or to condone such behaviors in any setting, whether business or personal.

# The Unspoken Reason Why Postpandemic Business Travel Will Remain Depressed
## It isn't just that Zoom conferences are cheaper than traveling for a meeting.

Everyone knows the first reason why business travel will not immediately boom as the pandemic ends: It turns out that we didn’t need all those in-person business meetings after all!

Lawyers can look into prospects’ eyes and glean the essence of their souls by Zoom as well as the lawyers can at in-person meetings. (That may actually mean “not at all” in both situations, but that’s beside the point.) So long as in-person and Zoom meetings are more or less equal, there’s no reason to waste time and money on an unnecessary flight.

People have also realized a related reason why Zoom meetings are efficient:  You can invite more people, from more locations, to attend. For law firms, that means that the head of the Chicago office, and the head of the securities litigation practice, and the head of litigation might all attend a one-hour Zoom meeting, even though all those people would never have flown to St. Louis for the same event.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)

Zoom meetings are perfectly good and much cheaper. Why should we go back to the way things were before?

But there’s a second, less obvious, reason why business travel will remain restricted as the world emerges from the pandemic: Quarterly reporting of financial results.

Many companies compare this year’s second quarter to last year’s second quarter, and the analysts look for improvement in year-over-year results.

During the pandemic, companies spent essentially nothing on business travel and entertainment. The comparison between this year’s Q2 and last year’s Q2 is going to look abysmal if the costs for travel and business entertainment jump from $0 in 2020 to $100 million in 2021. If companies want to look good during quarterly financial reporting, companies will have to minimize business travel to maintain favorable year-over-year results.

This doesn’t mean that business travel won’t ramp up over time. On the contrary: It means that travel will only ramp up over time. Travel will increase incrementally over several quarters, so there’s no noticeable blip in earnings.

That’s actually pretty funny. We’ll limit travel only in part because travel is tiring, time-consuming, expensive, and generally achieves little. All of those things are actual experiences that we live in the real world.

We’ll also restrict travel in part to ensure that year-over-year comparisons of financial results continue to look strong. That has little to do with what we experience in the real world, but a lot to do with how the world acts.

# Dechert Layoffs -- They Laid Off First-Years (And This May Be The Way Of The Future)

When we reported yesterday that Dechert had [laid off several associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/dechert-lets-multiple-associates-go-after-performance-reviews/) after a round of performance reviews (sources peg the number at 11 or 12), we warned that even a modest layoff — as opposed to letting people go in a slow trickle — suggests a boldness and lack of concern for public criticism that could spell trouble across the industry. Now we can add the willingness to fire first-years to the worrisome trends coming out of Dechert’s latest layoffs.

Firing first-years… that’s a firewall firms tend not to breach.

We always look askance at the phrase “performance” in the context of layoffs. It’s often a convenient cover that firms use to deflect layoff news. “It’s not a layoff, these are performance firings,” a firm might say. And sometimes they are. Firing 10-15 people over performance is totally plausible. Firing 40 and claiming it’s all about billing is… not. Dechert, by all accounts, fell into the former camp.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
That said, “performance” means a lot of things. There are lawyers who turn in laughably atrocious work product. Those are bad performers. Then there are people who are billing, say, less than 2000 hours a year. Are they bad performers? Maybe. Or they might be victims of a bad business cycle. Or a bad business model. When low billing is automatically lumped into “performance,” every performance firing should be viewed with a healthy dosage of sodium.

Dechert tipsters are writing in to suggest that at least some of Dechert’s “performance” firings were more about hours than competence. That’s a matter of opinion. But if first-years were really hit by these layoffs, that’s a good sign this is about hours. Because how can you fire a first-year for being incompetent? You wouldn’t have any first-years left!

Here are a few of the emails and texts we’ve received:

* Dechert is laying people off in NYC, LA, and Philadelphia, including first years.

* One of the associates who was laid off told me that the firm laid off first years (it sounded like “performance-related” in the sense that their billable hours were low, because there was no work for them to do).

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Firms rarely if ever target first-years for dismissal. It’s not just that they can’t fairly assess an associate’s competence at that level, but it’s also hard to blame a first-year for low numbers. They’re at the mercy of the system until they get some experience under their belt and build working relationships around the firm. In fact, depending on how firms assign work to young associates, this can be doubly troubling because — for a variety of reasons — women and minorities can find themselves unfairly left in the cold when partners hand out work to the people they “get along with” based on first impressions. Time can (hopefully) sort out these unconscious slights, but that doesn’t help first-years.

Unfortunately, this may be another emerging trend. Consider the work that Biglaw historically dumped on first-years and how that work now gets shipped to any number of discovery vendors or in-house staff attorneys or high-end technological products (or “solutions,” as the developers might prefer we call them) — none of which cost $180K/year. How are first years going to fill their days when the grunt work is off the table?

If firms are still hiring associates based on the needs of a bygone era, then they either need to suck up low hours or have an honest discussion about the firm’s real needs going forward. But we just might see more firms showing first-years the door until they come to grips with this. One Dechert tipster warns that the firm may be courting trouble again:

So, sure, those decisions were based on performance and potential, but this was absolutely a layoff due to lack of work, not due to underperformance. There are a few more axes set to fall later this summer on the corporate side. Not sure if litigation is in the same boat.

Don’t let the headcount fool you. Those increases are due in large part to the firm hiring way too many first years. We have another huge crop of fall associates this year who will have nothing to do.

We can report that Dechert is trying to ease the transition of these associates:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
It will be a challenge to find another Biglaw position (and the salary that comes with that) as the word is out that the “under billers” are on the market. What Dechert has done (for most) is given them a generous number of paid weeks to find another job and the use of all firm resources.

Hopefully, the rest of Biglaw views the idea of first-year “under billers” as skeptically as we do here.

# Is The Cravath Salary Scale To Blame For Biglaw’s Layoffs?

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

You’ve got a lot of firms out there that from an image perspective believe they have to match the Cravath scale or at least get very close but they don’t generate the profit margins that those firms do.

By overpaying their associates, they have to literally just lay those associates off.

— Michael Heller, CEO of Cozen O’Connor, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2023/06/20/layoffs-are-spreading-after-all-theres-only-so-much-work-to-go-around/), on what may be causing at least some of the layoffs among Biglaw firms.

It is not an unfair criticism of Biglaw to say they are disconnected from the society they ostensibly serve. They frequently operate in a world of high finance and bet the company litigation that feels removed from the everyday lives of so many. But that’s the thing about 2020, it has a knack for bringing the problems of the world right to your front door.

So in the wake of protests against racism sparked by the death of George Floyd under the knee of police officer Derek Chauvin, how is Biglaw responding? Every firm will have it owns response from the concrete (donating resources and pro bono hours) to the symbolic (expressing outrage) to the silent (the work never stops in Biglaw). Above the Law is committed to documenting the reactions of all the Biglaw firms.

The first Biglaw firm that Above the Law heard had made a statement about the protests is also one of the most prestigious. Skadden’s managing partner, [Eric Friedman](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/f/friedman-eric-j), sent an all-firm email condemning racism and specifically calling out the recent violent deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery.

Friedman also reaffirmed the firm’s commitment to using pro bono efforts to combat racism saying the firm was looking at even more ways to use that platform. He also announced the firm made a $100,000 donation to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.

The email that Davis Polk’s managing partner, [Neil Barr](https://www.davispolk.com/professionals/neil-barr), sent out is a short but heartfelt statement of grief and anger over recent events. He also affirmed the firm’s rejection of bigotry and dedication to diversity and inclusion.

Barr followed up his initial note with some of the more concrete steps the firm is taking, including a $100,000 donation to the Thurgood Marshall Institute.

The email from [Kim Koopersmith](https://www.akingump.com/en/lawyers-advisors/kim-koopersmith.html), managing partner at Akin Gump, connected all the dots from recent events (George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Christian Cooper, and the violence against Asian Americans in the wake of COVID-19) and concluded, “It is hard not to feel the gulf that exists between the promise of our countries and the reality that continues to exist for people of color. I have no answers, but I do think that it is crucial that we  take the time to digest events and reflect on what this says about us and how much more there is to be done to achieve the level of dignity, respect and equality that everyone deserves.”

Lowenstein Sandler’s [Gary Wingens](https://www.lowenstein.com/people/attorneys/gary-wingens) had one of the most thorough responses to recent events from a Biglaw firm. The firm encouraged all employees to speak up if they hear something racist, they acknowledged the emotional toll events are taking on employees and provided links to firm mental health resources, they mentioned social justice organizations that need support, and reaffirmed the firm’s pledge to support anti-bias efforts with their pro bono work.

Finally, the firm committed to keep the conversation about race and bias going, with a discussion series:

In the coming weeks, we will host multiple in-depth discussions exploring the impact of bias and racism on people of color and it’s corrosive impact on our society more generally, as well as what we can do to support one another.

[Lowenstein Sandler’s full statement is available here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/2/)

Another firm that made a statement about recent events is Littler. The statement acknowledged the systemic injustices in this country and condemned any form of intolerance. They also offered this to their employees and colleagues of color:

We’re here for you; we’re listening; and we stand in solidarity with you and all those who face ongoing systemic marginalization, racism and oppression.

[Littler’s statement is available here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/3/)

Squire Patton Boggs’s [Mark Ruehlmann](https://www.squirepattonboggs.com/en/professionals/r/ruehlmann-mark-john) authored a blog post noting it was time for the the firm to stand up for its values and touting the firm’s record on diversity:

While neither we nor anyone else in our industry is perfect, our firm has long been recognized as a leader in providing equal opportunity where it did not always exist. Indeed, the fact that our firm has several dozen women and minorities in either elected or appointed leadership positions distinguishes us among our peers. While we still of course have work to do, we are proud of that track record in an industry that struggles with these issues. Our firm commitment to sustaining a truly diverse and inclusive organization also necessitates our standing up to speak out against the type of gross societal injustices highlighted by recent events.

[Squire’s full statement is available here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/7/)

Morrison & Foerster’s Chair, Larren M. Nashelsky, penned a message noting the historical underpinnings of the current unrest and affirming the firm’s stance against it.

As a firm, Morrison & Foerster stands against this injustice. We stand not only against police brutality, but also against the racism that we see poison and destroy so much around us.

The firm also noted they will taking action in four areas: education, legal services to support racial justice, charitable donations, and community action, with the details of these programs to come.

[Read Morrison & Foerster’s statement here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/8/)

Ogletree’s statement focuses on how systems of oppression are allowed to flourish and urges colleagues to take action:

We implore our colleagues to ponder how to disrupt deeply entrenched, institutionalized systems of oppression. We ask you to consider any of the following things you can do to show up for impacted communities including unearthing your own unconscious biases, reflecting how they show up in your daily life, and listening to your friends and colleagues of color. The burden is on all of us, not just those impacted, to educate ourselves. Seek out knowledge. Validate experiences.

As exceptional attorneys across the country, we are in a position of power to effectuate change.Now more than ever, we recognize that this is not the time to be silent. We must stand firm as allies in support against racial injustice. Tackle legislative changes in your jurisdiction, use pro bono hours to stand against injustice, utilize advocacy skills to speak for those without an advocate.

[Ogletree’s statement is available here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/9/)

Fox Rothschild’s firmwide email begins with managing partner Mark Morris noting that he’d prefer to not talk about “political and social events that transpire in the world outside Fox Rothschild.” He then proceeds to absolutely talk about political and social events that transpire outside of Fox Rothschild, characterizing the protests as turning into “unjustifiable mayhem, threatening the safety of law enforcement officers simply trying to do their jobs, and destroying the property of innocent citizens.” Not that there isn’t property damage out there, but talk about missing the big picture here.

The firm also clarifies that the mandatory webinar on implicit bias is coincidental timing, but says “we all need help to become more sensitive to our biases.” Perhaps Morris should clear his calendar and run through the training twice.

[Fox Rothschild’s email can be read here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/10/)

Clifford Chance’s statement notes that the firm will double its financial support for the Equal Justice Initiative to “support the important work that they do in furtherance of inclusion and racial justice.” And goes on to note:

We do not regard this as a comprehensive solution – it is an initial but tangible step. There remains a daily need to further inclusion across our organisation through the work of our affinity groups, policies, programmes and reporting and – perhaps most importantly – how we treat and respect each other every day. We are also exploring what options are available to us to support affected communities through our pro bono work.

[Read Clifford Chance’s statement here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/11/)

Schulte’s statement condemned the recent attacks on black lives saying, “The videos we all have watched show the impunity with which people threaten, attack and kill black people, often times in broad daylight and without provocation — and ofter without fear of any consequence. These attacks must end and we must commit ourselves to this cause.”

They also note the firm is working on initiatives to address these issue and with will be discussed at a firm town hall this Friday.

[Schulte’s statement can be read here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/12/)

Paul Weiss’s chair, Brad Karp, has been regularly communicating with folks at the firm since last week, expressing outrage and concern over the death of George Floyd and reaffirming a steadfast belief that black lives matter. But more than just empty words, the firm is putting its money where its mouth is. Karp announced to the firm that it was making “very significant contributions to organizations dedicated to fighting for racial justice, including the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, the ACLU, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Center for Constitutional Rights, and the Equal Justice Initiative.”

And they’re upping their matching donations:

We have also decided, in an effort to provide even greater support to vital nonprofits, to increase the firm’s matching employee donations for 2020 from a maximum of $1,000 to $1,500 for eligible organizations.

The firm is also having a town hall meeting later this week to discuss the issue and further action items.

Karp’s most recent missive to Paul Weiss calls attention to the life of [Pauli Murray](https://paulimurrayproject.org/) — a lawyer, civil rights leader, Yale Law School graduate, and former Paul Weiss associate.

Sandy Thomas, Global Managing Partner of Reed Smith, sent an email to all personnel calling out “generations of systematic, institutionalized racism and racial injustice.” In response, the firm is organizing a series of conversation about race and discrimination, and acknowledged, “We expect these conversations to be uncomfortable, and welcome it. We do this with the intention of gaining trust, building bonds, and lifting each other up. We also do this with the intention that those who are uncertain as to how they can contribute to change can listen and learn.”

The firm is also redirecting their pro bono efforts to prioritize racial justice. And their wellness program will “support those among us who have suffered and are suffering from the trauma of discrimination, injustice, and violence.”

[Read the statement from Reed Smith here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/14/)

Gunderson Dettmer’s managing partner, David T. Young, announced that the firm is making mental health resources available to those who need it during this challenging time. They are also making donations to Black Lives Matter and the Equal Justice Initiative.

But more importantly, we remain committed to advancing employee resources and programs to enhance the diversity and inclusiveness of our workplace and help us all identify and address our biases. We understand that these times can feel overwhelming and so we encourage you to check in with one another, offer compassion and communicate openly about the needs that our colleagues may have in taking care of themselves to cope with these recent tragedies.

The firm is also matching employee contributions to the following organizations, up to $250:

[Black Lives Matter](https://blacklivesmatter.com/)

[Equal Justice Initiative](https://eji.org/)

[Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/)

[Gunderson Dettmer’s statement is available here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/15/)

Crowell & Moring’s managing partner Phillip Inglima’s message called for a moment of silence in George Floyd’s memory. He also noted:

We must shine a light on these horrific acts of bigotry and injustice that relentlessly plague especially the black members of our communities, and we all can and must play a role in seeking a cure. We can begin locally, with being sensitive towards the many members of our Crowell family who are hurting right now, who feel these threats and injustices personally and deeply, and who need and deserve our support. And we will continue our ongoing efforts to create opportunities in our own community for conversation about race and racial justice, through our dialogues, our speaker events, and further programs to raise awareness and provide training about the destructive impact of bias, both explicit and implicit.

[Read the statement from Crowell & Moring.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/16/)

Faiza Saeed sent an email to the Cravath Community expressing outrage over the death of George Floyd and the “too long list of Black people who have lost their lives to injustice borne of racism.” The firm also reaffirmed its commitment to channeling pro bono and philanthropy “toward ensuring the protection and promotion of those fundamental civil rights and civil liberties that create a fairer and more just society.” They also announced an expansion of their partnership with the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights and a special contribution of $100,000 to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.

[Cravath’s statement is here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/17/)

Jackson Lewis’s co-chairs, William J. Anthony and Kevin G. Lauri, sent a message that affirmed that the firm “has always been an organization that embraces and supports every identity that makes up our firm. We are proud to have a workforce that includes different races, ethnicities, backgrounds and perspectives. Today and every day, we stand with our Black colleagues. We reject racism and intolerance, and pledge to promote more education, listening and reflection within our firm to ensure we are actively supporting every member of the Jackson Lewis family.”

The firm is also exploring options “to combat racism and intolerance and treat each other with fairness and compassion.”

[Statement from Jackson Lewis is available here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/18/)

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett sent out a firmwide email earlier this week expressing anger and despair over the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery. The firm also shared its plans to facilitate conversations on race and support of projects to combat racism:

I promise you that racism and hate will never be tolerated at our Firm. I assure you that we will focus yet more on diversity and inclusion at our Firm. Over the coming weeks, our colleagues on the Diversity Committee and members of the D&I team will explore ideas, resources and programs that will help us build a platform to facilitate a conversation on empathy and allyship. The Firm is also collaborating with the Association of Law Firm Diversity Professionals in a collective response from law firms across the U.S. We will continue to update you on these efforts. Of course, we will also continue to support pro bono projects that combat racism and racial injustices. Please reach out to me, the diversity co-chairs (Karen Kelley, Sandy Qusba and Bill Russell) or the D&I team if you have ideas.

[Simpson Thacher’s statement is available here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/19/)

Pillsbury Chair David Dekker and Managing Partner Ed Perron issued a joint statement expressing outrage over the death of George Floyd. They also called attention to the unique role of lawyers in fighting injustice:

Working with clients and community organizations, we are developing opportunities for all members of our Firm to be part of the solution through additional pro bono and other volunteer service focused on racial injustice and improving the criminal justice system. We remain committed to diversity and inclusion at all levels, combatting racism and discrimination wherever it exists.

[Pillsbury’s statement is available here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/20/)

Nelson Mullins chair, Jim Lehman, condemned the recent “racial incidents in Minnesota and New York.” The message ended with a challenge to the firm, “to be an agent of change with leadership in our communities and pro bono cases that work for meaningful change.”

[Statement from Nelson Mullins available here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/21/)

Leadership at Katten Muchin Rosenman sent a pair of emails noting the racism in the country not only as it manifests in police brutality, “but also in the halls of respected companies and successful law firms. The institutional barriers to success and prosperity entrenched by systemic racism are not to be forgotten as we address the realities of physical threats to African-Americans and other communities of color.”

The firm’s second email played into the trope that everyone is a special snowflake and everyone is diverse in their own way and attached a graphic explaining the concept:

“[D]iversity comes in many forms.” If you can figure out how to create an environment in which everyone is willing to share genuinely who they are and appreciate who other people are, we would probably realize how much we all have in common, regardless of race, gender, or gender or sexual identification, and our world, our firm and every person would benefit greatly.”



[Katten’s statements are available here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/22/)

White & Case Chair Hugh Verrier’s message to the firm includes a call for everyone to educate themselves about systemic racism and to work to create a more just world. In addition to information sessions produced by the firm’s diversity committee, the firm also encourages everyone to get involved in the firm’s pro bono efforts:

We can also take action in the fight against racial injustice, and work to heal our communities, through pro bono and other volunteer activity. If you would like to work with your colleagues to make a difference, please contact our head of global citizenship, Jo Weiss, for more information about the Firm’s efforts in this area.

[Read White & Case’s statement here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/23/)

Fenwick & West’s Chair Richard Dickson sent out a message expressing horror at the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery. He also affirmed Fenwick’s belief in diversity and called on people at the firm to be part of a new path prioritizing equality and justice.

[Read Fenwick & West’s statement.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/24/)

Dentons’s Global Chief Executive Officer, Elliott I. Portnoy, sent a message to those at the firm about the injustice and daily threats from racism. He also encouraged employees to use the resources of the firm to take a stand for a better world.

But I know we cannot remain silent and, along with my colleagues in the US and around the world, we must continue our shared fight against racism and discrimination in all its forms. We need inclusive societies and organizations that celebrate the individual perspectives, experience, insight and ideas all of us bring.

[Read the statement from Dentons here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/25/)

Orrick’s chair Mitch Zulkie took this moment to double down on the firm’s racial justice efforts and launch a new program to the fight for civil rights and social justice:

Change starts at home, and we have work to do. As lawyers and legal professionals, we have a heightened duty. We took an oath – and with it comes professional responsibility to stand up and fight for racial and social justice. Orrick will be devoting greater resources to pro bono civil rights and social justice matters, including opportunities for our staff to participate through Orrick Cares. To start, we will launch the Orrick Racial Justice Fellowship Program to enable at least five Orrick lawyers to devote a year each to working on civil rights and social justice issues.

[Orrick’s statement is here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/26/)

Leaders at Cozen O’Connor committed to increasing their support of pro bono efforts and financial support for social justice organizations:

Cozen O’Connor and our employees have a long history of unwavering personal and financial commitment to the protection of civil and human rights. But we can and will do better. We commit to do all we can to promote a just society for which we can all be proud. In the next several weeks, we will be rallying behind our colleagues of color and our communities by providing internal and external support, training, and education. Our firm will continue to offer pro bono legal services for matters that derive from civil rights’ violations. Lastly, we will financially support social justice organizations committed to these ideals.

[The statement from Cozen O’Connor is available here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/27/)

The Executive Committee at Cahill sent a brief note expressing outrage over the death of George Floyd and standing with the “peaceful protesters.” The firm also indicated they’d provide financial support for “worthy” organizations.

[Cahill’s statement is here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/28/)

Winston & Strawn’s Tom Fitzgerald and Michael Elkin shared the message that in light of recent events they “can no longer quietly return to life as it was and look the other way. Doing so is an abdication of the imperative to connect events that reoccur with morbid consistency, and it goes against our humanity and identity as a firm.”

As a result they are pledging firm resources to support efforts to dismantle racism:

Through training and education, internal programs and courageous discussions, we will continue to raise awareness of overt and implicit bias and ways in which we can disrupt its impact. Equally important, through our pro bono work, community involvement and charitable giving, we will continue to work to dismantle racism, inequality and racial injustice in our society. Today, we are asking key stakeholders, including our Black Lawyers Network, for immediate recommendations on how the firm can be on the leading edge of the national movement to address and rectify the ongoing harm caused by racism and racial inequality in our society. We are committing the firm’s resources to support those recommendations once they are solidified and rectified.

Dickinson Wright’s CEO Michael Hammer sent an email expressing grief over recent events.

We cannot pretend to have answers right now for our collective grief, but we can promise our continued efforts to find light, to find solace, and to find justice; in short, to find ways to ensure that all individuals are heard and treated with the respect, dignity, and humanity that so many, like George Floyd, have been denied.

He also said the firm was working on a larger joint statement with other Metro Detroit firms and supported a city counsel resolution declaring racism a public health crisis.

Baker Botts’s John Martin sent a message to the firm saying he was “deeply troubled” by recent events, and, “These are but a few examples illustrating the inequality and unfair treatment impacting many in our communities, including our colleagues and clients.”

He also affirmed the firm’s commitment to diversity and dialogue:

As a Firm committed to promoting a diverse and inclusive environment, the continued unfair treatment of certain racial groups is disturbing and cannot be tolerated. We must come together and find ways – through actions and not just words – to be part of the solution. This includes facilitating difficult but necessary discussions surrounding issues such as institutional racism and bias.

The firm has scheduled a diversity dialogue for June 19th.

Davis Wright Tremaine’s managing partner, Jeff Gray, sent an email to the firm expressing anger over the death of George Floyd. He also indicated how the firm will be supporting the Black Lives Matter movement:

As mass demonstrations continue across the country, many of our lawyers and staff have asked how we can help fight systemic racism and injustice, combat unjust policies and practices that disproportionately affect communities of color, and how we can generally support the broader Black Lives Matter movement. Our Pro Bono and Social Impact team is collaborating with leading national civil rights organizations and community-based nonprofits to identify opportunities for attorneys and staff to advocate for reform, and advance equity and justice for impacted communities. Those opportunities are being posted on the Race Equity + Justice and Protestor Rights section of our Pro Bono Portal. We’ll provide more information about how both attorneys and staff can get involved in our efforts to take action for change at our June firm-wide Town Hall.

[Davis Wright Tremaine’s statement is here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/33/)

David Djaha, Managing Partner, and Julie Jones, Chair, at Ropes & Gray sent a message to the firm expressing shock and outrage at the death of George Floyd:

What happened to Mr. Floyd, and in the other shocking incidents across the country, should never be tolerated. These incidents have again brought into focus the dark reality for many—racism continues to run rampant through this country. They also serve as yet another reminder of the persistence of injustice in America, and why many of us feel an imperative to give voice to our shared frustration and reaffirm our guiding principles. Acts of racism, violence and hatred have no place in our society—and we condemn them.

The statement also affirmed Ropes’s commitment to diversity and provided links to the firm’s wellness resources should anyone need them during this time.

[The Ropes & Gray statement is available here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/35/)

She also reminded everyone at the firm that their black colleagues are not okay right now and called on people to be anti-racist.

Carew also included a list on concrete steps the firm is taking:

• In the next few days and weeks, you will hear more from me. You will also hear from the Diversity and Inclusion Action Team, Affinity Group Chairs, Pete Miller, and Seyfarth leaders. Our forward movement through these times will be collaborative.

• In the next week we will have a Firm Town Hall to process the recent events, the underlying racial inequity, the resulting trauma, our roles as change agents and allies, and how we protect the inclusion and diversity we value. We will keep you posted as details firm up.

• Our leaders will receive toolkits on leading inclusively during  this time. Information on being allies and understanding race in America will also be available to every employee on InSeyt soon. We will also make ourselves available to leadership to answer questions and discuss inclusive leadership competencies.

• On Tuesday, we had a check-In webinar with our Black professionals at Seyfarth. It was a time of community, healing and processing. I invited Dr. Angela Neal-Barnett from Kent University who is a professor, psychologist, and author. We will continue to dialogue with these colleagues. The graphic at the bottom  of this email was created by a partner on the call who took the words we typed when asked how we felt and placed it into a word cloud. I hope you find it impactful. Our colleagues were grateful for this chance to commune in a safe space together.

• Pro Bono and Inclusion and Diversity are exploring opportunities for pro bono and community service. These discussions are still underway as we explore and research what is available and what is a good fit for the firm.

• As we pivoted our action plan for Inclusion & Diversity in March and April, we will again examine our I&D strategy and action plan to ensure we are addressing issues and concerns that have arisen in the last two weeks.

Seyfarth’s chair and managing partner, Pete Miller also sent out a statement amplifying Carew’s message. [Available in full here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/59/)

Mintz managing member Bob Bodian sent the firm a message of mourning over George Floyd’s death. He noted:

The culture of hate, of racism, of prejudice, of violence, of disrespect, and of tolerance of those whose language and actions encourage and normalize such behavior, needs to be recognized and changed.

[The Mintz statement is available here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/37/)

Neil Wasser, chair of Constangy’s executive  committee, sent a message to the firm expressing outrage over both the death of George Floyd and the systemic racism that allows it to happen. He called on the firm to effect change:

While peaceful protests have been marred by people seeking to take advantage of this sad time in our country, let’s remain focused on the tragedy of Mr. Floyd’s death and the lessons that can be learned from his murder, and the similar murders of people targeted specifically because of their race. Let’s put our grief and outrage to good use and have conversations about what has happened, about the corrosive role that racism – overt or subtle – plays in our society, and what we can do to effect change.

[The statement from Constangy is available here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/38/)

He also focused on the pro bono opportunities at the firm that are focused on equal justice:

As members of the legal profession, we have a heightened responsibility and opportunity to work towards ensuring equal justice for all. While the firm has long led and supported initiatives focused on social justice, following the recent tragedies, a number of individuals at the firm have redoubled our efforts with some of our long-standing partners to offer our support and engagement and work to find new and more effective ways we can contribute. One example of an organization where more investments are being made is the Atlanta Bar Association’s Equal Justice in Law Enforcement Initiative, which our partner Harold Franklin launched as the Bar president in 2016 and which brings together the legal community, law enforcement and community members to strengthen relations and educate citizens about their rights. Another is the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law, a national organization that has engaged the private bar in pro bono work since its founding in 1963.

[The statement from King & Spalding is available here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/39/)

Cooley announced a $450,000 donation to the Equal Justice Initiative, to “works to end mass incarceration and excessive punishment, to challenge racial and economic injustice and to protect basic human rights for the most vulnerable people in America.”

Joe Conroy, Cooley’s chairman and chief executive officer, had this to say about the donation:

“It is time to seek out education; learn about ourselves and each other; converse and collaborate; and stand together as one, united against the racism, bias and hatred that seek to divide us – it is time for action.”

[Cooley’s statement is available here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/40/)

I invite each of you to join me in:

– listening to and learning from colleagues and friends who have experienced or witnessed discrimination;

– educating ourselves about the unique and complex relationship that Black people and other people of color have with their communities and their institutions, including their workplaces;

– examining the bias in our own thoughts and behaviors;

– engaging our friends and family in uncomfortable conversations about the problem of racism and bigotry of all kinds; and

– understanding that many members of the Mayer Brown family have been psychologically and emotionally affected by these ongoing injustices and showing them that they have our unwavering support.

[The statement from Mayer Brown is here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/41/)

Boutique Edelson P.C. make an unequivocal statement in support of Black Lives Matter:

Our firm stands firmly with the protestors, the Black Lives Matter movement, and for justice for the Floyd family and every family that has lost loved ones to police brutality. The rhetoric coming from the President and the violence he, other governmental officials, and some members of law enforcement are directing towards the peaceful protesters is inconsistent with our values as Americans.

Our firm has begun talks with some of the community leaders and groups who have been leading the efforts to secure institutional changes around the criminal justice system that the country sorely needs. We hope to follow their leadership and offer our resources to help ensure that this nationwide tragedy forces these changes that are long, long overdue.

It also promised to keep the dialogue going and to support the movements for reform.

[The statement from Edelson is here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/42/)

Dinsmore leadership circulated a statement taking a stand against racism and police brutality.

We will not stand silently as others dismiss the impact of inequality on members of our community.

In the coming weeks and months, our firm leadership will develop an action plan that puts into practice these fundamental beliefs.

[The statement from Dinsmore is here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/43/)

Leadership at Hogan Lovells stated unequivocally there can be no justification for the death of George Floyd. They went on:

As a firm we have a long track record in opposing racism and injustice in the workplace and in society at large, standing side-by-side with our African American and other colleagues of color. In response to the tragic events in Minneapolis and around the country, we are actively working to provide tangible support to those who work at our firm and in our society at large. We will be sharing our specific actions in the days and weeks to come.

[The statement from Hogan Lovells is here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/44/)

The firm is taking steps today to donate $100,000 to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights, and the Equal Justice Initiative, collectively, to further those efforts. We will continue to seek additional opportunities to shift current paradigms. As lawyers, we can do more than protest peacefully. We can use the law to make a difference.

Edelman also had an all attorneys call to further the conversation and provide more details on the firm’s actions.

[Milbank’s statement is here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/45/)

He also said the firm would be stepping up its pro bono commitment, and that these steps would only be the beginning of the firm’s social justice work.

[O’Melveny’s statement is here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/46/)

Now more than ever we need to look to our core Diversity & Inclusion principles and values as we attempt to understand, cope with, and combat these deep-rooted societal inequities. Here among colleagues and friends, it is important to remember our common values and concerns, and to stand in opposition to bigotry, hatred, and violence. As a firm that has long prided itself on speaking out and taking action against injustice, we will continue to work with our community and legal partners to promote positive change not only in the cities in which we live and work, but also in society at large.

[The statement from Foley Hoag is here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/47/)

It called out the firm’s response as lackluster rhetoric that failed to provide concrete steps to directly support black associates at the firm. The email recommended the following: acknowledge the pain of black associates, actively check-in and adjust, give grace, provide targeted mental health support, targeted pro bono efforts, effective mechanisms for addressing anti-blackness, educate, listen and take action.

Again you should read their [response](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/49/).

Goodwin leadership expressed horror at the violence being directed at black people. Adding:

At this moment, we want to be clear about where we stand and in what we believe, about our desire for our children to live in more harmony than we do, about our commitment and effort to create an inclusive environment where everyone feels a sense of belonging, about the need for everyone to speak up and denounce injustice.

We appreciate so many other law firms and business leaders speaking out on this topic, and we humbly add our voice to the chorus. It may sound like a cacophony at times, but if you listen closely you will hear the symphony of hope.

[The statement from Goodwin is here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/50/)

Fragomen sent a message calling out the “horrific acts of racism and inhumanity.” They also reaffirmed their “commitment to justice, human rights and diversity.”

But according to tipsters at the firm, the statement struck many at the firm as shallow. As an insider tells Above the Law:

The Executive Committee called a townhall to discuss their statement, because a number of employees questioned why the firm didn’t once mention black lives matter or the names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Armaud Arbery, among others in their statement. The answer they provided was that they made a conscious decision to not include their names or mention black lives matter because they didn’t want to “diminish prior incidents”. They then reiterated that the firm is committed to diversity, but did not respond when asked which organizations they are supporting in light of the recent shootings and murders.

[The statement from Fragomen is here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/51/)

Jonathan Harmon, chair on McGuireWoods, said that the death of George Floyd was “vicious, senseless and inhumane” and that, along with other recent events compelled him to make a statement.

He said the firm is forming an action plan to bring lasting change:

At McGuireWoods we are targeting and focusing on justice, peace and positive long-lasting change, because all of us here want everyone to be treated equally and to be free from fear. As a result, we have put together a very diverse group of our lawyers – young and not so young – to strategize and to develop a plan for the communities in which we work and where we can make a difference on how to make racial equality with the police a reality.

[McGuireWoods’s statement.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/52/)

Stroock leadership expressed anger and sadness at recent events. They also affirmed their commitment to diversity:

We want to assure you that we are wholeheartedly committed to Stroock’s core values of diversity and inclusion. We recognize the moral imperative to stand up, speak out and unequivocally condemn racism wherever we find it, in any shape or form, tacit or explicit. As a firm and as individuals, we will strive to advance the value of equality for all.

They also sent a follow up message in recognition of the National Day of Mourning. That email acknowledged the trauma many black and brown colleagues were going through:

For those who don’t have friends, family or close members of your networks who are black, you may not know how difficult this time is for the community. The anguish associated with racism, we understand is real, and seeing pictures and video of black people being killed is even more traumatic and cumulative. For many, the current events in the United States are experienced as clinical-level trauma. Research shows that when people of color see these images, they internalize them – they see themselves, their friends, their family.

It also encouraged everyone to keep the conversation going and to take care of their mental health.

[Read the statement from Stroock.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/53/)

Cadwalader’s statement offered support to black associates at the firm.

Proskauer chair Steve Ellis sent an email expressing disgust, anger and sadness over the death of George Floyd. He went on to say:

I cannot suggest I understand fully what fearing being a victim of racial discrimination must feel like (or worrying that my sons or daughter will become victims), but I know that it is a reality for our Black colleagues. And I know we are obligated to come together to work to eradicate that fear and the possibility of continued violent hate crimes. We can help, and must help. As a community and a Firm it is incumbent on us to not stay quiet. We need to say – loudly, and often, that violence against our own is not consistent with who we are and who we want to be. We need to stand together as families, friends, in our towns and across the Firm to ensure that those in our Black communities (and our Black colleagues at Proskauer) feel included and safe (at the Firm and otherwise).

He also said the firm was working with the black affinity group to find ways the firm can be part of the solution.

[Read the statement from Proskauer.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/56/)

Mark Katz, chair of Arent Fox, pledged that the firm would not stand on the sideline during the fight against racial injustice:

Part of the answer as a law firm needs to be that we seized on our obligation and opportunity to do more. In the coming days we will be establishing a Firm task force to determine the actions that we can take to address issues of racial injustice, violence, and police-community relations. As lawyers and policy experts we have a unique skillset to help bring about meaningful change. We can do that in the form of workshops, targeted community engagements, and engaging in legal actions through partnerships with civic organizations. We will not stand on the sidelines.

[The full statement from Arent Fox is here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/57/)

Stinson released a statement in which the firm pledged to listen and keep the conversation going:

As we have listened to the stories and experiences of our own constituents of color and others, it has become apparent that racism is an insidious plague that persons of color have to constantly account for, teach their children about and have learned to expect in contexts and circumstances that others never have to think about. As a law firm built around core principles of fairness and the rule of law, and with stated goals and principles based on diversity, inclusion, equity and opportunity, we reject these conditions. We condemn racism and violence.

[The full statement from Stinson is here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/58/)

Kaufman Dolowich & Voluck’s message was that they’d redouble their commitment to diversity, equity, justice and equality for all.

We will pursue these objectives at all times, as we know that the change that is needed will happen in the weeks, months and years to come, long after the world’s attention turns to something else.

[The full statement from Lathrop GPM is here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/61/)

We can all stand together in demanding justice and an end to institutional and individual racism. We can work to be better as a firm in our diversity and inclusion efforts and our commitment to leveling the playing field for those who can advance to be a stronger firm. I encourage each of you to call your colleagues, mentees and clients to ask how they are doing and offer your support and encouragement. And those of us with a passion to press for change can participate through peaceful, insistent protest and by using our skills as advocates, mentors and sponsors to increase opportunity, level the playing field and defend the unrepresented.

Global leadership also sent a message to all employees, encouraging dialogue on issues of race.

Talking about race and racism can be uncomfortable. If you are uncertain how to approach such issues we encourage you to focus on four behaviours:

-
Be aware: if you are not familiar with the challenges facing black communities in your country, then educate yourself. Talk to colleagues and read the news and literature available to you ([Penguin Books: Nine books to help you understand and dismantle racism](https://www.penguin.co.uk/articles/2020/june/racism-black-lives-matter-antiracist-reading-list-books/))

-
Be open: position yourself to gain a broader perspective of the world by connecting with others that can offer a different perspective and don’t be afraid to have conversations about racial inclusion in the workplace and beyond

-
Be supportive: always be willing to listen to your black colleagues and understand that their experience may be different from those of a non-black person

-
Be outspoken: act if you see or hear something disrespectful or inappropriate.

[The statement from Allen & Overy.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/66/)
Susman Godfrey made a statement condemning the “recent unjustified killings of Black and Brown people.” They also said:

Specifically, the partners have committed to the following:

-
Each December, our firm makes significant charitable donations to honor our clients and professional colleagues. This year, 100% of our donations will be made to organizations that work for racial justice, and they will be made in memory of George Floyd.

-
Susman Godfrey will “double match” every dollar donated by a Susman Godfrey employee to a 501(c)(3) organization working for racial justice. If you donate $1 to any such organization, we will give $2 more. If you give $500, we’ll give $1,000 more.

-
We will encourage our lawyers to substantially increase their commitment to pro bono representation and urge them to do so on cases that implicate racial justice.

-
We will take a hard look at our hiring and retention practices. Though we have a longstanding commitment to diversity, we know that we can and must do better at recruiting and retaining minority attorneys, paralegals, secretaries, and staff.  As a start, we will expand by 100% our current Diversity Fellowship program for 1st year law students.

-
We know that there is a lot we don’t know. We are committed to better educating ourselves about systemic racism and how it affects our society and our profession.  We will continue to make available and encourage all our partners and employees to attend workshops and seminars on systemic racism, conducted by organizations with genuine expertise.

[The statement from Susman Godfrey.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/67/)

Beyond these efforts, we are committed to examining our own practices and Firm culture to ensure that we are part of the solution and not part of the problem. I am proud to lead Brown Rudnick in these efforts and pledge that we will do our part.

We are committed to listening with an open mind and open heart while we work to do our part as friends and allies to ensure you are not left alone carrying the weight of a problem you did not create, but the consequences of which you live with every day.

The also said they’d be in touch with more specific opportunities for allyship.

Leadership at Baker Hostetler sent an email detailing the firm’s actions in light of recent events. They announced they’re hiring a Director of Inclusion and Diversity, making a donation to the Equal Justice Initiative, and increasing nonprofit engagement. Additionally they noted:

• Support our African American colleagues with compassion and empathy.
• Educate yourself about racism and injustice. There are lots of great lists circulating, including books (fiction and non-fiction, historical and current, adult and children’s), as well as movies, podcasts and social media. We will also be adding training on these topics to our professional development curriculum. If you need help finding a resource, please reach out to us.
• Be open to conversation with a colleague or friend who doesn’t look like you. We all have blind spots and talking with someone with different life experience or background may help you learn more about yourself.
• Get Involved. Connect with your office inclusion and diversity committee about the positive steps you and your colleagues in your office can take during this challenging time. Additionally, as lawyers, we have a unique opportunity to use the law to make a difference. Participate in seminars and other opportunities to support civic and human rights organizations engaged in the fight for justice.
• Use your voice and speak up if you witness instances of racism by others.

# Biglaw Firm Didn't Take Summer Associates To A Strip Club, Yet Somehow The Story Is... Worse?
## This wasn't some senior associates going rogue with an after party... the firm put this on the schedule!

Gunderson Dettmer got a lot of online flack last week amid reports — backed by video! — that [summer associates went on an outing to a strip club](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/strip-club-summer-associate-outing/). The commentariat concluded that the images didn’t reflect a genuine strip club, but rather a nightclub that still employs scantily clad go-go dancers for “atmosphere.” Not that this makes much difference when we’re talking about professionalism and sexual harassment in the workplace.

But we thought this probably stemmed from some full-time attorneys taking the misguided initiative to drag summers to the club on the firm’s dime. Sources now tell us that not only was this an officially sanctioned trip — included on the firm’s calendar of summer events — but the firm knew all about the club’s vibe.

The location is the [Peek Nightclub at Harrah’s in the Lake Tahoe area](https://www.caesars.com/harrahs-tahoe/things-to-do/nightlife/peek-nightclub). But if you’re thinking the firm stumbled into booking the hotel bar without knowing what to expect, think again… the firm has hosted summers at this club dating back a few years now.

And while go-go dancers don’t necessarily convey a strip club aura, a tipster notes “The club has scantily clad go-go dancers, but attendees are encouraged to ‘throw them money.'” OK, see, that’s the problem right there. It’s not how naked the dancers are, it’s that the venue is encouraging rich people to throw scraps at women for breaching the business casual dress code. The tipster added that in prior years “senior attorneys in charge of the event went around and handed out $1 bills for this purpose to all of the summer associates and GD attendees.”

Does Gunderson even have an HR department?

Another unconfirmed tip alleges that the firm didn’t use its real name in booking the table, choosing instead to make the reservation in the name of a “School of the Deaf.”

Again, paging anyone in HR. Anyone at all.

As noted in our original post, the firm no-offered the summer who lodged a complaint about this event. Which looks bad but probably wasn’t retaliatory because Gunderson is in the midst of [delaying start dates](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/gunderson-deferred-associates-start-work/), [laying off folks](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/biglaw-firm-lays-off-10-of-its-workforce-may-defer-incoming-associates/), and indeed no-offered a number of summers.

When we reached out to the firm for comment on the original story — they never responded — we asked for confirmation on the no offers. We’ve since gotten numbers from tipsters. It seems six of the 13 Northern California summers did not get an offer, LA saw one of three no-offered, and we don’t have precise numbers for NYC but are told it’s “nearly 50 percent.”

Which adds a whole other dimension of impropriety to this story. As disturbing as it is to make an official outing of blowing summer pay throwing dollar bills at women and treating deaf folks as a punchline, it’s also unprofessional to be ordering club bottle service all night when the firm plans on laying people off and kicking half the attendees to the curb. A firm can’t sacrifice the task of wooing the next generation of attorneys because of a down year, but it can endeavor to curtail its most ostentatious consumption when it knows it’s not going to hire everybody.

Because these summers all gave up other opportunities to summer at Gunderson based on the perception that the firm could afford to make good on those gigs.

And if it doesn’t, then maybe the partners should spend more time looking for their own $1 tips instead of fronting like they can afford VIP treatment at the clubs.

Matterly is the first legal software designed entirely by lawyers. Lawyers who were frustrated with every CRM, and every roadblock they encountered.

So with the help of developers, they made their own.

Now Matterly is available to the public, and after a free trial of Matterly, you will see how quickly your law firm can adapt to it.

Three reasons why Matterly’s CRM is different from others:

- Automated Email Parsing
- Matter Entry Wizard
- Advanced Time Tracking

# Biglaw Partner Convicted Of Insider Trading After Jury Trial

This news comes too late for him to make our March Madness bracket of [naughty Biglaw lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/who-is-the-worst-behaved-former-biglaw-attorney/), but ex-Hunton & Williams partner Robert Schulman just got convicted of insider trading. From [Law360](https://www.law360.com/lifesciences/articles/902137/breaking-ex-hunton-patent-atty-convicted-of-insider-trading?nl_pk=e7faf62e-b7f1-41ad-9246-51333f0810ef&utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=lifesciences):

A former Hunton & Williams LLP patent attorney on Wednesday was convicted by a Brooklyn federal jury on insider trading charges for tipping off his friend and investment adviser about Pfizer Inc.’s plans to acquire his client.

The jury of six men and six women found Robert Schulman guilty of conspiracy and securities fraud following a less-than-two-week-long trial before U.S. District Judge Joan M. Azrack. Schulman is currently a partner at Arent Fox LLP but is on leave from the firm.

One of his lawyers, Christopher Mead of London & Mead, told the jury during trial, “I represent an innocent man.” It seems that the jury disagreed.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The facts of the case, which we’ve mentioned before in these pages, were colorful. Schulman allegedly [got drunk](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/09/tipsy-partner-tipped-insider-trading-defendant-sec-alleges/) before sharing inside information about a planned M&A deal with a pal. Specifically, he told his friend and investment adviser Tibor Klein that his client King Pharmaceuticals was going to merge with Pfizer, using this hint: “It would be nice to be King for a day.”

Alas, Schulman now finds himself in some royal trouble.

# Former Davis Polk Employee Testifies In Racial Discrimination Trial That Fired Associate Was Too Relaxed
## One of the few times it makes sense to be angry over being left out of an email chain.

There isn’t nearly enough tension on your shoulders! (Image via Getty)

Retaliation claims can get messy. After being fired from Davis Polk in 2019, Kaloma Cardwell claimed that the firing was in response to his complaints about racial discrimination at the firm. I feel like most people will complain [after allegedly being excluded from the team emails involving the cases they were assigned to and having a harder time getting eye contact reciprocated from higher-ups](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/davis-polk-hit-with-racial-discrimination-lawsuit/) than having a staring context in [the Birdbox universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqRU07D4cqo). Cases like these usually get settled before they see the light of the courtroom. This is not one of those times. The trial is already under way, and some of the complaints about his work are already extremely nit-picky. From the [ABA Journal](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/witness-for-fired-associate-describes-cavalier-body-language-refusal-to-help-in-a-pinch):

[Rocio] Clausen[, a lawyer who was a professional development manager for the law firm,] said Cardwell thought that the assignment would take away from his work with the mergers and acquisitions group, in which he was involved. Cardwell said “African American men were generally disadvantaged” in the legal field, and he didn’t want to hurt his M&A prospects, Clausen testified.

Clausen said Cardwell was working fewer hours than other M&A lawyers, and his refusal to help “was very upsetting to me.”

Clausen said Cardwell’s relaxed body language during the meeting was “cavalier.” She demonstrated by leaning back in her chair, according to Law.com.

Truly a missed career path — why is she a lawyer when she could have been an actor! The only other way Cardwell’s alleged demeanor could have been accurately described is this timeless Simpsons clip:


The concrete issue of if Cardwell was working less than his peers is one thing, but taking someone to task for not being visibly stressed out isn’t the own you think it is. Reminder: [you cannot tell how busy or stressed someone is just by looking at them](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/managing-high-functioning-anxiety).

# Sedgwick: Death By Billable Hours
## Am Law 200 firm Sedgwick LLP had great clients and plenty of work: how did it go bust?

There’s a phenomenon called “[rabbit starvation](https://www.raising-rabbits.com/rabbit-starvation.html)” that gets taught in survival training courses.  If you’re trying to get by in the wild, and your choice is to eat rabbit or eat nothing, your best bet is to eat nothing.  Rabbit meat is so lean that no matter how much you eat, your body will end up burning more calories digesting it than you can take in by eating it. A rabbit-only diet is a recipe for malnutrition, starvation, and ultimately death.

Am Law 200 firm Sedgwick LLP’s [shock announcement](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/what-is-going-to-happen-to-sedgwick/?rf=1) on Tuesday that it would close shop after 80-plus years of operation suggests that rabbit starvation applies to law firms too.

Sedgwick’s implosion was widely reported as the story of a merger gone awry. For much of 2017, Sedgwick was in public merger discussions with the British firm [Clyde & Co](https://www.clydeco.com/). The acrimony of the merger discussions evidently triggered an exodus of over a quarter of the firm’s partnership over that time. Although losing that many partners in less than a year is never peachy, it was particularly bad at Sedgwick, where the firm had to repay the partners’ [large capital contributions](https://www.law.com/international/sites/international/2017/11/23/clydes-and-dacb-eye-up-sedgwick-london-office-ahead-of-us-firms-dissolution/). With so many partners departing at once, it appears the firm’s capital payout obligations became more than the balance sheet could support and the firm collapsed on itself.

But this is too easy of an explanation. Merger talks — even contentious ones — don’t have to end with an apocalypse. Read the legal periodicals on any given day and you’ll see reports of countless firms in public merger discussions — most of which never work out. To get a full understanding of what actually happened with Sedgwick, you have to look at the firm’s foundation against the backdrop of what’s happening in the broader legal market. And when you do, you see a firm that had all the outward indicators of success, but that was in reality a slow-motion disaster waiting to happen.

The Rolls Royce of Insurance Firms

Sedgwick was a go-to firm for insurance companies. Even a cursory scan of the [firm’s website](http://www.sedgwicklaw.com/services) (which remains active as of the day of this article) shows that its insurance roots run deep. For much of its lifespan, a venerated specialty firm like Sedgwick would have been the insurance industry’s Rolls Royce — high cost, high performance, and a brand synonymous with trust, competence, and old-school cred. The firm could use its cache to bring in seemingly endless billable hours from clients that reliably pay their bills, and do so at a rate that eclipsed the typical small-firm insurance shop.

But after the bottom fell out in 2008, it became hard for insurance companies to justify a Rolls where a Kia would do. The years following the Great Recession saw a major shift in the [power structure](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2017/11/14/no-pain-no-gain-for-law-firms-as-client-demands-get-more-extreme/) of Biglaw pricing. The supply of high-level attorneys swelled as law schools continued to pump out graduates, but demand for external counsel shrank as clients took their work in-house. That demand continues to shrink today, as more companies find ways to get what they need internally or from non-traditional sources. Law firms in the Am Law 101-200 and below have increasingly had to compete with one another through pricing, steadily shifting leverage to the clients that want to hire them.

It’s hard to think of an industry better suited to squeeze the billable hour than insurance. Think about it: insurance companies typically work with dozens, if not hundreds of law firms. Keeping meticulous records of the cost of transactions in order to predict those costs into the future is their bread and butter. Insurance companies with access to vast amounts of data, and the analytic skill to use it, are going to know exactly what it costs to handle their cases. They know that side of the legal market better than the firms they hire. So, any firm that wants to earn or keep an insurance company’s business has to be prepared to slash its margins to the bone. An equity partner’s negotiated hourly rate on insurance matters can easily be less than the rack rate for a first-year associate at the same firm.

Sedgwick was #137 on Am Law’s last rankings, smack dab in the “[hollow middle](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/almID/1202786574623/)” of American law, and was undoubtedly feeling pressure both from the top-tier firms above and the agile, low-overhead boutiques below. Its focus on plentiful-but-cheap insurance work meant it probably had plenty of work to keep its attorneys busy, but wasn’t likely pulling in the margins of the Am Law 100 firms in the skyscrapers next door.

Making It Up on Volume

Thin margins don’t provide much wiggle room, and leave a firm vulnerable to interruptions in its revenue flow. As each equity partner left over the course of 2017, they took revenue out of Sedgwick’s budget while requiring payouts from the capital fund. Every one of those moves made the firm less appealing both as a merger target and as a home for its existing rainmakers, meaning more partners left and the possibility of being saved by a merger got more remote with each defection.

Hindsight being 20/20, it’s possible Sedgwick wouldn’t be closing if it had spent the last 10 years getting leaner and meaner, perfecting the art of case management, and aggressively adjusting overhead. It’s the model that many employment boutiques [and plaintiffs’ practices](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/saving-biglaw/) have employed with great success as the legal economy continues to shift away from the old Biglaw models.

But getting lean and mean isn’t as sexy as being a big, bad powerhouse with a massive geographical footprint, and Sedgwick evidently got caught in the trap of too much expansion without the sound finances and high billing rates to back it up. In the years following the 2008 financial collapse, when many other firms were tightening their belts, Sedgwick made a play to become the new Dentons or DLA Piper by opening offices in [Kansas City](https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/print-edition/2015/01/09/sedgwick-in-kc-law-firm-dives-into-kc-s-talent.html), [Seattle](http://www.sedgwicklaw.com/offices/seattle), [Washington, D.C.](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/sedgwick_opens_new_dc_office_with_14-attorney_team_from_wallace_partners/), and [Miami](http://www.sedgwicklaw.com/offices/seattle).

Sedgwick just kept eating more rabbit and wondering why it was still feeling hungry.

Having new offices and new sources of revenue is often a boon for everyone involved, but on thin profit margins, those new offices may have just increased the firm’s vulnerability to slight downturns in revenue. A house of cards doesn’t get more stable when you add a second floor. If the basic structure of a firm is susceptible to collapse because of industry changes and low billing rates, expanding rapidly and giving off the appearance of success can only last for so long.

The thing about rabbits is, even if you can’t survive off them, they make great magician’s assistants. Maybe that’s how these rabbits ended up making Sedgwick disappear.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs.

# Where's The Money? These Am Law Top 50 Firms Haven't Announced Bonuses Yet

It’s bonus time, but where’s the money?

It’s the end of the second week of spring bonus season, and bonus news seems to be significantly slowing down. Dozens upon dozens of firms have remained completely silent. Why? The market (i.e., all of the firms that have matched the [generous Davis Polk scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/), including Cravath) has already spoken — very loudly, in fact. There aren’t any decisions left to be made… except, of course, whether or not your firm is planning to stiff associates.

Which firms in the Am Law 50 haven’t uttered a word (that we know of) to their associates about bonuses yet? Here’s a list of the firms that have yet to match (along with their most recent gross revenue, as of 2019). Do with it what you will, and please feel free to correct us if we’re wrong.

# Law Professor Drops Racial Slur In Class Because Otherwise How Will Black Students Ever Learn About Racism?
## There's no excuse for employing racial epithets in the classroom, but this law professor's going to try and come up with some.

As a white guy, I’ve got to be honest, I’ve never felt that my life is in any way diminished because I can’t deploy racial epithets with reckless abandon. There’s never been an event where I’ve thought, “oh, wow, if only I could drop a slur or two right now!”

But at the DePaul University College of Law, Professor [Donald Hermann](https://law.depaul.edu/faculty-and-staff/faculty-a-z/Pages/donald-hermann.aspx) feels he really needs to toss out a few to give his lessons the proper punch. In a lesson on provocation, Hermann laid out a hypothetical about a white supremacist harassing a civil rights leader’s funeral with racial slurs. That hypothetical is easy enough to grasp, but Professor Hermann felt it necessary to go right ahead and spell out what this hypothetical Nazi would say.

SPOILER ALERT: The hypothetical Nazi said exactly what you already assumed he would because it’s obvious and requires absolutely zero imagination.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
A number of students reported the incident to the administration. When reached for comment, DePaul University spokeswoman responded:

On Feb. 22, the dean of DePaul’s College of Law heard from students who alleged that a Law professor used a racial slur during a class discussion about criminal law and speech. DePaul’s Office of Institutional Diversity and Equity, which oversees discrimination and harassment complaints, was notified immediately and set up meetings to interview the students and professor.

The OIDE staff will complete their inquiries in accordance with established university procedures.

Fair enough… except [Crain’s Chicago Business notes](http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20180228/NEWS04/180229894/depaul-investigating-law-professors-racial-slur) that three students had already informed an assistant dean earlier in the semester about other offensive terms Professor Hermann used so the school can’t claim to be blindsided here.

For his part, Professor Hermann is doubling down on this in a troubling way. Reportedly, Hermann used his next class to address the issue by reading aloud to the class from a student letter sent to him about the incident. Except instead of using the euphemism written in the letter, Hermann went ahead and replaced it with the whole word 13 times. If that’s an accurate report, that’s just taunting and bullying and unbecoming a lawyer or an academic. UPDATE: We’ve heard from the author of the letter, and she is not a student, but an attorney in Chicago and co-founder of a pipeline program for 1L women of color law students.

And then came the nauseating but predictable claptrap about how this is all the fault of coddled Millennials, appearing in a sterling bit of public relations copy masquerading as a [Chicago Sun-Times article](https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-politics/depaul-law-professor-subject-of-complaints-over-use-of-n-word-in-class-lecture/). Quoting Professor Hermann:

“Some of these students will be public defenders, prosecutors, defense attorneys. Words like this will be a common part of their practice. I can understand their sensitivity about it. But in preparing people to go out into the real world, if during their education we have to be so sensitive to provide a safe space to harbor them from words that could be emotionally upsetting, I don’t think we’re doing our job of educating these students to be lawyers.”

So here’s the deal. Those students… they’ve already heard that word. They’ve probably had it hurled at them in hate many times over their relatively young lives. So where do you get off acting like you’re the one “exposing” them to the real world? It takes a special kind of narcissism for a random white law professor to think he’s the one “educating” a group of black students about racial slurs.

That’s the whole misconception about the “safe space” thing. It isn’t about sheltering students from learning that the real world is an unpleasant place. It’s about not gratuitously dragging them through the unpleasantness they already understand all too well so some academic can sound “edgy” in class.

To inject a little hyperbole to underscore this point, why not just savagely murder some student to really give the class a good sense of the crime in the casebook? Sure there’s the option of describing a crime and trusting a bunch of adults with college degrees to grasp a basic narrative, but that really underplays the impact of that crime. After all, some of these students will be prosecutors and violence like this will be a common part of their practice. If we don’t expose them to brutal decapitations here in class, we’re not doing our job of educating these students to be lawyers.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
That’s [Annalise Keating’s](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/making-the-case-for-annalise-keating-as-an-important-fictional-lawyer/) philosophy anyway.

The point is, there’s such a thing as context. When a lawyer, working on a matter, confronts unpleasantness and has some degree of agency to confront that, they’ll deal with it. But for now, they really don’t need to be subjected to explicit racial slurs to understand “fighting words” any more than they need to see a real killing to grasp that murder is bad.

The Sun-Times also spoke with African-American law professor [Terry Smith](https://law.depaul.edu/faculty-and-staff/faculty-a-z/Pages/terry-smith.aspx), who supports Hermann and blames the students for having “[a] sense of entitlement that they should not be offended or provoked in the classroom.” This comes up a lot in these discussions, and I’m wondering just when did offending people become so core to the 1L curriculum? You’re teaching the Rule Against Perpetuities for heaven’s sake. In fact, the only sense of entitlement I see here are some professors obsessed with the “freedom” to use straightforward lessons to live out their inner shock jock. [UPDATE: There’s some additional news about Professor Smith — [he’s also suing the school for discrimination.](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/you-actually-wont-believe-who-is-suing-depaul-law-school-for-discrimination/)]

Professor Smith also notes:

“Frankly, relative to my other white colleagues, he would rank as perhaps the most progressive white colleague I have,” he said.

OBVIOUSLY. Of course he’s a white liberal because only a white liberal would ever do anything this. Pulling something like this requires that special sense of entitlement that only comes with being able to say, “no, it’s okay, because I voted for Jesse in ’84.” There was literally no moment in this story that I didn’t expect this professor to be a self-professed liberal.

Hermann, who’s been teaching since 1972, said he was sorry that the students had been offended or hurt and said he planned to skip the “fighting words” discussion in future classes.

No, no, no, no, no! That’s exactly the horrid outcome people unfairly accuse students of creating when they talk about safe spaces. Students still have to learn the law. But they can learn it without being subjected to racial epithets. Why is this so goddamned hard to understand?

Hermann told Crain’s he used to term to show his students how they need to be prepared to be provoked when they are working in a courtroom. “If this word interferes with their functioning, being a lawyer is probably not a thing they should be doing”, Hermann said.

If this word is gratuitously coming up in class, being a law professor is probably not a thing you should be doing.

UPDATE: DePaul students protested the all-around troubling response to this incident today. As is de rigueur, another student complained to Above the Law about being mildly inconvenienced by the protest. Because proportionality is hard for some people. I get it — law school is expensive and it’s frustrating to have class time disrupted. On the other hand, there’s a limited number of tools to hit an administration where it matters and that might be the easiest one. In the grand scheme of things, just take the temporary inconvenience and enjoy some independent study.

# Book Of Business: Kirkland Is Killing It
## What does K&E's success in the lateral market mean for the rest of Biglaw -- and can it continue?

[](http://atlbookofbusiness.libsyn.com/the-rapid-expansion-of-kirkland-ellis-episode-3)Last week, I spoke with James Stewart of the New York Times for his article about lateral moves in Biglaw, [$11 Million a Year for a Law Partner? Bidding War Grows at Top-Tier Firms](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/business/cravath-kirkland-ellis-partner-poaching.html). The focus of his piece was the incredible success of Kirkland & Ellis in wooing big-ticket partners from rival firms like Simpson Thacher, Skadden Arps, Latham & Watkins, and Cravath — yes, Cravath, regarded by many as the pinnacle of the law firm world, and as such a firm that rarely witnesses defections to other firms.

Interested in hearing more about K&Es moves in the lateral market? Check out the latest episode of [Book of Business](http://atlbookofbusiness.libsyn.com/), the Biglaw-centric podcast that I’m doing with veteran legal recruiter Robert Kinney, Founder and President of [Kinney Recruiting](http://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/).

In each episode, Robert and I do three things. First, we analyze a recent notable lateral move or collection of moves. Second, we take an in-depth look at a specific legal market. Finally, we offer career advice for the audience of Book of Business — current and aspiring partners at leading law firms.

In our [latest installment](http://atlbookofbusiness.libsyn.com/the-rapid-expansion-of-kirkland-ellis-episode-3), our third, we analyze Kirkland’s recent raids on Cravath; conduct a market snapshot for London, which is no longer just a finance center; and offer advice about how to leave your law firm gracefully (inspired by the whole [John Quinn](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/john-quinn-is-not-happy-about-selendy-gay-and-he-sent-the-angry-reply-all-to-prove-it/)/[Faith Gay](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/faith-gay-has-a-totally-zen-perspective-on-the-john-quinn-email/) tiff).

# Skadden Is Representing James Comey. Umm... Did They Do A Conflicts Check?
## Did Skadden feel like they needed attention from ""both sides"" of the Russia thing?

James Comey (Photo by Eric Thayer/Getty Images)

A Skadden lawyer has actually been indicted by Robert Mueller because of his connections to Paul Manafort and his shady dealings. Skadden associate [Alex van der Zwaan pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I.](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/ex-skadden-associate-indicted-in-mueller-probe-pleads-guilty/) Greg Craig, a Skadden partner, [abruptly retired likely because of his involvement with the same Manafort-related scheme. ](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/amid-mueller-probe-prominent-skadden-counsel-disappears-from-website/)

Skadden has been in the barrel… so it seems odd that the firm would take on former F.B.I. Director James Comey as a client. I mean, Comey isn’t really involved in any of the issues that have gotten other Skadden lawyers in trouble. But, man, it’s weird to see a firm that has been burned by the Russia investigation represent the man who started it all.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Maybe that’s why the story being pushed out isn’t “Skadden represents Comey,” it’s “Pat Fitzgerald happens to have an office at Skadden and represents his total bestie, James Comey.” [From AmLaw](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/04/25/skaddens-pat-fitzgerald-representing-best-friend-jim-comey/):

Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom partner Patrick Fitzgerald has been representing one of his best friends, James Comey, since he was ousted as FBI director last year by President Donald Trump, according to news reports.

The representation, first reported by Talking Points Memo, pairs Fitzgerald with a client whom he described as “one of my best friends” in an interview with The American Lawyer published just six days before Comey’s firing. Since that time, Fitzgerald has declined to comment about Comey’s time in the political spotlight. He did not immediately return a request for comment for this story.

The story says Fitzgerald has been part of the team representing Comey since Comey was fired in May of 2017. Comey just let that representation slip during one of his signings on his book tour that I assume is titled “If I Did Kill Hillary Clinton, Here’s How.”

Look, Fitzgerald is a big-time former prosecutor, the men are friends, there’s nothing the slightest bit wrong about the representation.

It’s just… noteworthy. The firm already has lawyers in the muck with Manafort. Going for “both sides” was a little bit surprising.

# Oh, That's Right! Bunches Of Biglaw Firms Still Haven't Announced Bonuses.
## Like clockwork, this firm announced its bonuses at the end of January.

There was a day when the annual holiday bonus meant an “annual holiday bonus.” Firms would announce associate bonuses well in advance of the holidays and pay them out with ample time to help everyone have a festive holiday season. These announcements would often come out right before the firm holiday party so everyone could walk up and thank the partners for sharing the wealth during the happiest season of all.

This year, after [Milbank got the bonuses rolling way earlier than usual](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/breaking-biglaw-bonuses-are-here/), the Biglaw community mostly sat on their hands. Many firms followed suit in the following weeks, but some big players just never made any announcement at all.

We’re still waiting on some of those delinquent firms, but Goodwin Procter has lived up to its consistency. While it’s not a holiday bonus, the firm traditionally announces bonuses at the end of January and it’s done so again.

Class of 2016 – $255,000
Class of 2015 – $280,000
Class of 2014 – $305,000
Class of 2013 – $325,000

The firm doesn’t go that extra year to $340K that some firms do, but that’s most likely because it starts to make off grid arrangements with those more senior.

Congratulations to Goodwin’s team! Meanwhile, we’re still waiting on some of you holdout firms.

# Will The Real Jones Day Please Stand Up?
## Many conservative lawyers have left the firm, but the tension will persist for some time.

Methinks Jones Day doth protest too much?

Law students going through on-campus interviewing often say, after the umpteenth interview, “All these firms look alike!” But that’s not true; real differences exist between Biglaw shops (and you can learn about them by reading Above the Law regularly).

One of our favorite firms to write about is [Jones Day](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/jones-day/). What makes JD so attractive? The firm’s [penchant for secrecy](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/09/jones-day-secrecy-breeds-strength/) certainly contributes to its mystique; journalists love the challenge of [opening up black boxes](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/jones-day-finally-raises-help-us-open-up-its-black-box-of-compensation/).

Another interesting thing about Jones Day is that [it is large, it contains multitudes](http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/s_z/whitman/song.htm). It’s a firm with multiple identities, and it hasn’t yet figured out which one will control.

I can count at least two Jones Days. First, there’s the “old” Jones Day — a [125-year-old, Cleveland-founded firm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jones_Day), with right-of-center politics — at least by Biglaw standards — and a client roster of large but shrinking Rust Belt enterprises. Second, there’s the “new” Jones Day — an increasingly global law firm, with 44 offices around the world, and the more left-leaning politics typical of large firms.


Donald F. McGahn II (via YouTube)

The sense I had was that the old Jones Day was losing ground to the new, at least in recent years — but all that changed in 2016. Donald Trump showed up on the scene, rallying the Rust Belt, and Jones Day [played a major role in his rise](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/jones-day-helping-donald-trump-to-make-america-great-again/) (admittedly over [some objections](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/will-jones-day-drop-donald-trump-as-a-client/) from voices of the new Jones Day). Jones Day lawyers [spearheaded the Trump transition](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/the-biglaw-attorneys-on-trumps-doj-transition-team/) and went on to grab [coveted posts in his administration](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/jones-day-in-the-white-house-the-biglaw-firm-fills-top-jobs-in-the-trump-administration/) (most notably, JD partner turned White House counsel Don McGahn). In the media and in the public imagination, the old Jones Day was resurgent.

With so many talented and conservative JD lawyers leaving to serve in the Trump Administration, however, one might expect the new Jones Day to take over. But I think it’s too early to say. Instead, expect a struggle for the soul of the firm — one that flared up yesterday, in the epic litigation challenging President Trump’s Muslim ban travel ban executive order limiting entry to the U.S. for certain foreign nationals. As reported by Ross Todd of [The Recorder](http://www.therecorder.com/id=1202778575308/At-Ninth-Circuit-Big-Law-Makes-Its-Stand-Against-Trump-Travel-Ban?mcode=1202617072607&curindex=3&curpage=ALL):

In an [amicus brief](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3454857/9th-Constitutional-Scholars.pdf) filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on behalf of four constitutional scholars, Jones Day lawyers challenged the administration’s position that the executive branch has “unreviewable authority to suspend the admission of any class of aliens.”

The move spurred acting Solicitor General Noel Francisco and acting assistant attorney general Chad Readler, both former Jones Day lawyers, to hold back from signing the Justice Department’s [latest brief](https://app.box.com/s/dyqvcyycg457vp7bhpvzbnccqu6bje16) Monday afternoon.

“The acting solicitor general and acting assistant attorney general have refrained from signing this brief, out of an abundance of caution, in light of a last-minute filing of an amicus brief by their former law firm,” the brief stated.

So, in a nutshell, an eleventh-hour filing by progressive Jones Day lawyers forced two of the firm’s leading conservative alums to sideline themselves, in the highest-profile litigation faced by the Trump Administration so far. AWK-ward.

That might seem surprising, but it shouldn’t come as a total shock to folks familiar with the firm. In March of last year, when writing about Jones Day’s decision to represent the Trump campaign, I noted the [extensive pro bono work](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/jones-day-helping-donald-trump-to-make-america-great-again/) performed by JD lawyers on behalf of immigrants. Indeed, the firm’s years of work on behalf of refugees are [highlighted on its pro bono site](http://www.jonesdayprobono.com/).

How will Jones Day’s close association with the Trump Administration affect the firm? I predicted it [could be a good thing](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/jones-day-in-the-white-house-the-biglaw-firm-fills-top-jobs-in-the-trump-administration/) — “It’s great for the firm’s prestige, and it also means that JD lawyers will be eagerly sought after by clients with issues pending before their former colleagues.” — but reasonable minds can disagree. It might have negative reputational consequences for the firm, especially if the JD lawyers are viewed as [not serving President Trump effectively](https://lawfareblog.com/does-trump-want-lose-eo-battle-court-or-donald-mcgahn-simply-ineffectual-or-worse), and it could hurt recruiting, especially at elite law schools with overwhelmingly liberal student bodies.

Some of JD’s top conservative and libertarian lawyers might have left the building, but the tension between new and old Jones Day will linger for quite some time.

# It's Not Your Imagination -- Women Are Leaving Biglaw In Droves
## A new study attempts to find out why.

A [new report](https://www.alm.com/intelligence/solutions-we-provide/business-of-law-solutions/analyst-reports/walking-out-the-door/) by the American Bar Association and ALM Intelligence, called “Walking Out the Door: The Facts, Figures and Future of Experienced Women Lawyers in Private Practice,” surveyed more than 1,200 Biglaw attorneys to find out why women are leaving the Biglaw life. Because while law schools are pretty regularly hitting between 45 and 52 percent women enrolled, it drops off in practice — only 20 percent of law firm equity partners are women in 2018. What they found was wildly differences in perceptions about what firms are doing to promote gender diversity.

For example, they asked managing partners if their firms were “active advocates of gender diversity,” and 82 percent said yes. Ninety-one percent of men surveyed agreed as well, but only 62 percent of women were on board. Similarly, 84 percent of managing partners agreed that their firms promote women into leadership. And while 75 percent of men also thought so, a dismal 55 percent of women agreed. When asked if their firms have success retaining experienced women, 74 percent of managing partners said yes, compared with 64 percent of men, and a mere 47 percent of women who agreed.

And as study co-author Stephanie Scharf[ told Law.com](https://www.law.com/2019/11/14/death-by-a-thousand-cuts-why-are-women-leaving-big-law-405-48434/), this is a problem:

“The data suggests that firms may not understand how their own people are viewing the policy and practices that they are implementing with respect to advancing women,” said study co-author Stephanie Scharf, a partner with the women-owned firm Scharf Banks Marmor and chair of the ABA’s commission on women in the profession.

The other co-author, Roberta Liebenberg, senior partner at Fine Kaplan and Black, pointed to an overall culture of bias in Biglaw, calling it “death by a thousand cuts. It’s not one thing, but an accumulation of experiences they believe are different because of their gender.” For example, 50 percent of women surveyed said they’re satisfied with the recognition of their work compared with 70 percent of men. Only 45 percent of women reported satisfaction with their opportunities for advancement, yet 69 percent of men said they were satisfied with their opportunities. Plus a whopping 82 percent of women surveyed said they’ve been mistaken for a low-level employee. Ugh.

It’s pretty clear that firms have to do more than want a gender diverse work environment — they have to take real steps to make it happen.

COVID disrupted everybody, including the legal profession. We are all in uncharted waters here.

— Diana Schulz, president of Martindale-Avvo, [commenting](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/law-firm-revenue-takes-nosedive-during-covid-19-data-shows) on the results of a [new survey by Martindale-Avvo](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/martindale-avvo-covid-19-legal-report-reveals-how-pandemic-has-affected-legal-consumers-and-attorneys-301058269.html), tracking how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the legal system as a whole. According to the results, about 81 percent of surveyed firms have seen their revenues drop, while 27 of those firms said their revenue had decreased by more than half since the crisis began. Because of their decreased revenues, more than 18 percent of surveyed firms had to shrink their workforce through furloughs or layoffs.

First, it should be noted that all of these responses reflect executive compensation practice at a large law firm in New York. Practices in other areas of the country may vary.

Executive compensation lawyers work on a wide variety of matters, which means there really is no such thing as a typical day. For example, a mid-level associate in this practice area typically is working on several M&A deals, an IPO or two, and some standalone work such as drafting an employment agreement or advising a client on Section 409A or Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.

Executive compensation practices also involve a good deal of unpredictability. Many days see associates in this practice area working diligently on one matter only to have something more urgent come up – for example, SEC comments on a filing or comments from the other side on a purchase agreement in an M&A deal.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Matters in this practice area tend to be very leanly staffed, so even junior associates often work directly with partners and clients. On M&A deals and IPOs, the executive compensation team typically consists either of one associate and one partner, or of one junior associate, one mid-level or senior associate and one partner. Standalone work is almost always one associate working with one partner. Very junior executive compensation lawyers can have clients calling them directly on a matter. Those clients can either be a member of the in-house legal team or a senior person on the client’s human resources team.

In addition to clients and other executive compensation lawyers, associates in this practice area frequently work with M&A lawyers or capital markets lawyers when working on transactions, with labor & employment lawyers when working on employment agreements (particularly restrictive covenants) and severance agreements, and with tax lawyers when analyzing the tax implications of various compensation arrangements.

- What does a common career path look like?
Most executive compensation lawyers start their careers at large firms where they can get great training and experience. From there, some lawyers choose to move to smaller practices where they may have a more predictable schedule with fewer large transactions. Other associates make the transition to an in-house legal department, often of a client. Some may take a less traditional route, for example, by becoming an attorney editor. Of course some executive compensation lawyers remain at large law firms for their entire careers after becoming counsel or partner.

- If variety is the spice of life, how spicy is this practice area?

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Executive compensation is a practice area with a ton of variety. Lawyers in this practice area frequently work on:

- M&A deals (both public and private companies), including due diligence, drafting and reviewing employee-related sections of purchase agreements, advising clients on potential issues in the deal, and negotiating with executive compensation lawyers on the other side.
- IPOs, including assisting in the drafting of the executive compensation section of securities filings, drafting new equity compensation plans and annual bonus plans, and advising clients on public company compensation matters like Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, Section 16 of the Exchange Act, and corporate governance as it relates to the client’s compensation committee.
- Providing ongoing counsel to public companies following an IPO.
- Negotiating and drafting employment agreements, separation agreements, offer letters and compensation plans.
- Designing and drafting deferred compensation, change in control and equity compensation arrangements.
- Analyzing and advising on various Internal Revenue Code sections, including 409A, 457A 280G, 162(m) and 83.

- How much wear and tear?
The pace and intensity of the work in this practice area can be demanding. While executive compensation associates tend to have more even workloads and fewer all-nighters than M&A associates, attorneys in this practice area typically are working on multiple deals and multiple standalone matters. This means that an executive compensation lawyer may have an intense period leading up to signing a big deal, but immediately after signing moves on to other urgent matters rather than having a slower period. However, because a significant portion of work in this practice area relates to M&A deals and IPOs, things tend to slow down considerably when the M&A and IPO markets are slow.

- Of the people in this practice group who hate it, what exactly do they hate about it?
People may dislike this practice area for a couple of reasons. Some associates dislike the unpredictability of transactions. Others dislike the fact that executive compensation lawyers aren’t running deals or the fact that executive compensation issues are not always the issues clients care most about. On a deal, lawyers in this practice area have two clients in a sense – the internal client, which is the M&A or capital markets team, and then the external client. On the other hand, some associates may enjoy deals and their role in them, but dislike the standalone work and the complex tax analysis that can be present in this practice area.

- Of the people in this practice group who love it, what exactly do they love about it?
Most lawyers who love this practice area enjoy the variety of the work and the intellectual challenge of coming up with creative solutions to clients’ problems. Many enjoy the excitement of deals as well as the more academic aspect of analyzing tax issues. Lawyers in this practice area also love being long-term advisors to clients.

- Are there common avenues out of this practice area?
There are not many avenues out of the executive compensation practice area. If a junior associate dislikes practicing in the area, the best way out is probably to try to switch to a different practice area very early on, either in the same firm or in a different firm. Some executive compensation lawyers have success leaving the practice area by going in-house and transitioning to more of a corporate governance legal role or, less commonly, transitioning to the “business side,” which for an executive compensation lawyer is typically in the human resources department.

- What are some market trends that impact this practice area?
At large law firms, executive compensation practices tend to be very transaction-focused, so the general level of mergers and acquisitions and IPOs most significantly affects the practice area.

General economic trends can also affect the practice area. In a recession, companies often aim to do more legal work in-house, which can reduce the standalone executive compensation work done by law firms.

In addition, the tax and securities laws governing executive compensation and related proxy disclosure, and the views of large institutional shareholders, often change in response to public opinion and shareholder advisory firms disfavoring big paydays for executives. Changes in these laws typically increase an executive compensation lawyer’s workload by providing more opportunities to counsel clients on their compensation plans and programs and, for public company clients, on the requirements of their proxy disclosure.

- If you had to recommend one candidate from a room crowded with recent bar exam graduates, what specific qualities would he or she have that would ensure success in this practice area?
A sincere interest in the practice area is a great start – many executive compensation lawyers fall into the practice area by chance. It would also be useful for a candidate to have taken some tax law classes. The other qualities that a good candidate should possess are likely similar to the qualities a person needs to succeed as a lawyer in just about any practice area:

- The skill to explain complex issues clearly and concisely to a client.
- Willingness to ask questions of and learn from more senior lawyers.
- Good business sense – an understanding of what’s important to the client and what is not.
- Ability to juggle multiple matters, supervisors and clients.
- Ability to advise and counsel clients on the best actions to take in a given situation.
- General responsiveness when the client seeks counsel.

I think that people are so intrigued by this because they’re so crunchy. They look so appetizing. Whenever I eat them, I always try to get good crunch noises in there; people like that ASMR aspect of the video. But it was kind of random the way it just blew up.

— Gabby Eniclerico, a legal assistant in Washington, D.C. (who is better known as [@slothgirl420](https://www.tiktok.com/@slothgirl420) on TikTok), offering up some ideas as to why her [crab rangoon muckbanging video](https://www.tiktok.com/@slothgirl420/video/7037107092116884742) went viral this winter, causing a [sudden crab rangoon craze](https://www.today.com/food/crab-rangoon-tiktok-t246437) on the video sharing social networking service. Eniclerico has 1.6 million followers on TikTok. She says her “all-time favorite place to get crab Rangoons” is [Full Kee](http://www.fullkeerestaurant.com/) in D.C.’s Chinatown.

Last week, the Department of Justice filed a civil complaint against Williams & Connolly partner [Robert Shaughnessy](https://www.wc.com/Attorneys/Robert-J-Shaughnessy), and family member Susan Shaughnessy.

The case was filed in the federal district court for the District of Columbia on Thursday. All told, the government is seeking $6.98 million in taxes, which they alleged includes unpaid taxes dating back to 2001.

As detailed [in the complaint](https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/klvykalxgvg/DOJ-v-Shaughnessy-2022-09-15.pdf):

According to the complaint, “Despite notice and demand for payment of the assessments … [the defendants] have neglected or refused to make full payment of those assessments to the United States.”

Robert Shaughnessy has worked at the litigation powerhouse since 1988, and made partner in 1996. According to his firm biography, he specializes in commercial torts, false advertising, contract disputes, class actions, trademarks, copyrights, product liability, and environmental matters. According to [reporting by Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/us-justice-dept-sues-williams-connolly-partner-7-mln-tax-case-2022-09-16/), Shaughnessy’s clients include chemicals companies Daikin America Inc and Chemguard Inc, and agriculture and pharmaceuticals company Bayer AG.

Neither the Shaughnessys nor Williams & Connolly (the firm is not party to the lawsuit) have commented on the litigation.

I understand why firms do it, but I really wish firms would [stop announcing bonuses on Fridays](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/dont-announce-your-bonuses-on-a-friday/). It’s nice to end the week on a high note, but we’re trying to help firms communicate to the market that they’re paying top dollar for talent and that’s a lot easier when the news hits before folks start checking out for the weekend. Hopefully this one hits folks early enough in the day that they’ll see it.

Anyway, Fenwick & West announced its bonuses today, bringing the number 72 Am Law-ranked firm in line with the DPW consensus on bonuses. Full bonus memo on the next page, but the details are here. Minimum billable target is 1950.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

But the firm is also giving some extra cash to folks who’ve really put in tough hours, with the instruction that lawyers try to use the money on some R&R. Or, as they put it “Triple-R” — Rest, Recreation, and Relaxation. Back in the Spring, [the firm gave $5,000 to $15,000 for high billers](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/fenwick-spring-bonus-2021/2/). In addition to those bonuses, the firm’s got another dose for folks who racked up more big hours with $10,000 to $30,000 for those who billed over 2300 hours.

Congrats, Fenwick folks. Enjoy your vacations.

# Bonuses Bring Holiday Cheer Courtesy Of Reindeer
## A match with more available for higher billers.

Maybe not reindeer, but certainly courtesy of Vinson & ELKins.

Look, giving each of these announcements some kind of punny angle gets difficult, folks. There’s only so many ways to say a firm stepped up and matched the market-defining bonuses set out by Davis Polk, including a round of special bonuses on top of the base. Sure, you could pad out the article a little bit by noting that Vinson & Elkins ranks 59th in the most recent Am Law 100 and that it secured $782,352,000 in total revenue last year, but that won’t really get you more than a sentence.

It helps that the firm acknowledges that its past practice of awarding supplemental bonuses to particularly high earners will continue on top of the market-matching bonuses. A nice paragraph capped is available if a tipster generously offers some analysis, pointing out these supplemental bonuses historically work out to around 1.10x market for 2150 hours, 1.25x for 2300 hours and 1.35x for 2500+ hours.

Well, look at that! A fully formed bonus post. You’ve probably already forgiven the Elk joke.

Or not. Fine, be that way. Full memo reproduced on the next page.

# 5 Biglaw Attorneys Riding The Blue Wave To Congress

The day after the midterm elections and the results are enough of a mishmash for both Democrats and Republicans to claim victory (and defeat). But one unambiguous result of the election was Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives by an impressive margin that included [taking 24 seats from GOP incumbents. ](https://www.axios.com/full-list-2018-midterm-election-seats-flipped-34d99826-0929-41c6-a1f0-e4d02861c835.html)On that list of Democratic upstarts that rode a blue wave to new jobs in the House are 5 Biglaw attorneys that have impressive legal credential that may just ease their transition into public service.

His legal bona fides are impressive — he graduated from UC Berkeley School of Law, and was a research assistant for professor and author Ian Haney Lopez, worked in the Office of White House Counsel under Kathy Ruemmler, was an Obama appointee in the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and an associate at Perkins Coie. Oh, and he was an NFL linebacker for five years before an injury put him on the path to law school.  He believes the government is in need of changes, and that’s what motivated him to run for Congress saying, “We need a new generation of leadership to come forward that seeks public office as a form of public service. I am running for Congress now to return this seat to the people I grew up with and who have for too long been forgotten by its Representative and a Congress that has lost its way.”

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

Jason Crow

[Jason Crow](https://www.hollandhart.com/jacrow#overview) Holland & Hart partner Jason Crow won one of the most expensive elections of the midterms, taking out Representative Mike Coffman in Colorado’s Sixth congressional district. A graduate of the University of Denver’s Sturm College of Law, being a lawyer wasn’t Crow’s first career. He was a Ranger and Infantry officer in the Army and led combat units during three tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. In his [victory speech](https://www.denverpost.com/2018/11/06/colorado-6th-congressional-district-race-results/), Crow noted, “We set out with a goal to bring new leadership to the country and move us forward again. It was a bold idea for someone who had never run for office before. Today, we achieved it.”

Sharice Davids

[Sharice Davids](https://www.shariceforcongress.com/) This is a name liberals looking for feel-good news amongst the election results have likely come across already. Davids is the first openly LGBTQ person elected to Congress from Kansas, as well as one of the first two Native American women (along with Deb Haaland of New Mexico) elected last night to the House. But before her history-making political run, Davids graduated from Cornell Law School and began her legal career at Biglaw megafirm Dentons. Former Houston Mayor and current president and CEO of the LGBTQ Victory Fund, Annise Parker,[ said in a statement](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/sharice-davids-lesbian-native-american-makes-political-history-kansas-n933211), “Sharice won the hearts of voters by putting forward a positive and solutions-oriented agenda while explaining how her experiences as a Native American LGBTQ woman influenced her policy positions and beliefs. Sharice’s victory tonight will become a model for other LGBTQ leaders considering a run for office in red states or districts.”

Antonio Delgado

[Antonio Delgado ](https://delgadoforcongress.com/)This Harvard Law alum and Rhodes scholar was working at Akin Gump when the shocking result of the 2016 election [forced him to reconsider his career,](http://www.vault.com/blog/vaults-law-blog-legal-careers-and-industry-news/meet-the-rhodes-scholar-harvard-law-grad-rapper-running-for-congress) “When Trump happened, I’m 40, partnership was coming up next year, there’s a lot on my mind and obviously felt extremely unsettled by what happened with his election. I felt very disturbed by the outcome and I just felt at that point, the first thought was…. figure out what more I could do, whether it was politics or some other endeavor… And it became clear to me that there was an opportunity for me to to be a part of some real significant change both here locally, right at home, by unseating a very vulnerable, freshman Republican congressman.” He’s also a former rapper, which became something his opponent made an issue in a series of [racially charged](https://www.theroot.com/republicans-lose-ny-house-seat-to-democrat-they-called-1830284648) campaign ads, but that wasn’t enough for John Faso to keep his seat as Representative for New York’s 19th Congressional District.


Mary Gay Scanlon

[Mary Gay Scanlon](https://www.ballardspahr.com/people/professionals/scanlon_mary_gay.aspx) This pro bono counsel at Ballard Spahr is actually a bit of an overachiever — winning two congressional races yesterday — she will be the Congressperson for Pennsylvania’s newly redrawn Fifth District and she won the special election to complete the term of former Representative Patrick Meehan in the Seventh District. Scanlon has her J.D. from the University of Pennsylvania and worked for the Education Law Center of Philadelphia before joining the Biglaw firm. According to her co-worker, Ballard Spahr Special Counsel and former Pennsylvania Governor Edward G. Rendell, Scanlon’s unique skills will be put to good use in Congress, “When Mary Gay sees a problem, she investigates the facts and finds a solution. She understands how to collaborate but also how to fight—fearlessly and hard—for what is right. We’ll miss her terribly at the firm, but she the right person to send to Washington and we’re incredibly proud of what she has achieved.”

## * ""I'd hope they'd see reason but I wouldn't bet the family farm on it."" Senate Republicans may be stomping their feet about confirming one of President Obama's Supreme Court nominees, but it may behoove them to do it now before Hillary Clinton takes office with a Democrat-controlled Senate. [[Common Sense / New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/04/business/a-way-to-a-deal-on-a-supreme-court-nomination.html)] * Sincere congratulations to Damaris Hernández, who recently achieved a seemingly impossible feat at her Bigfirm. The 36-year-old attorney is the first Latina to become a partner at Cravath Swaine & Moore. She joins the 46 other Hispanic women who are partners at just a few of America's largest law firms. [[DealBook / New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/04/business/dealbook/law-firms-first-latina-partner-with-boost-from-nyu-program.html)] * Lawmakers from the Garden State have demanded that Gibson Dunn and digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg repay $2.8 million in legal fees in the Bridgegate case, the bulk of which were e-discovery charges to the tune of $2.3 million. Welcome to the absurdity that is document review, New Jersey! [[Big Law Business / Bloomberg BNA](https://bol.bna.com/nj-lawmakers-want-bridgegate-legal-fees-cut-by-one-fourth/)] * It looks like Apple isn't the only tech company that's dueling with the DOJ right now. Since ""[t]he interest in secrecy does not last forever,"" Twitter is mounting a First Amendment case against the Feds over its ability to publicly release data that allegedly contains details related to the government's terrorism investigations. [[WSJ Law Blog](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/03/03/department-of-justice-and-twitter-clash-over-disclosure-of-surveillance-orders/)] * The 10 customers who filed a class-action lawsuit against Subway over the sub shop's less-than foot-long footlong sandwiches will only be able to afford 100 $5 footlongs each, because the lawyers on the case are walking away with $520,000 out of $525,000 settlement dollars -- that's 99 percent of the settlement.

* Lawmakers from the Garden State have demanded that Gibson Dunn and digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg repay $2.8 million in legal fees in the Bridgegate case, the bulk of which were e-discovery charges to the tune of $2.3 million. Welcome to the absurdity that is document review, New Jersey! [[Big Law Business / Bloomberg BNA](https://bol.bna.com/nj-lawmakers-want-bridgegate-legal-fees-cut-by-one-fourth/)]

* It looks like Apple isn’t the only tech company that’s dueling with the DOJ right now. Since “[t]he interest in secrecy does not last forever,” Twitter is mounting a First Amendment case against the Feds over its ability to publicly release data that allegedly contains details related to the government’s terrorism investigations. [[WSJ Law Blog](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/03/03/department-of-justice-and-twitter-clash-over-disclosure-of-surveillance-orders/)]

* The 10 customers who filed a class-action lawsuit against Subway over the sub shop’s less-than foot-long footlong sandwiches will only be able to afford 100 $5 footlongs each, because the lawyers on the case are walking away with $520,000 out of $525,000 settlement dollars — that’s 99 percent of the settlement. Fair? [[Dayton Daily News](http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/lawyers-nab-99-percent-of-subway-foot-long-lawsuit/nqckr/)]

There is a lot of luck involved. No one can be an expert in every subject.

— [Zachary Newkirk](https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/professionals/zachary-j-newkirk.html), a Perkins Coie associate, commenting on his [record winning streak on “Jeopardy!”](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/perkins-coie-lawyer-becomes-jeopardy-champ-in-record-run?context=search&index=20) In early 2020, he won four games in a row, and then the show stopped filming thanks to COVID-19. The show resumed taping sometime in August, but thanks to travel restrictions, Newkirk was unable to appear. When he returned to play in December 2020, Newkirk clinched the title of the show’s longest reigning champion, all thanks to the coronavirus crisis. In all, Newkirk won six games, collecting a total of $124,871.

Martin Lipton (via YouTube/The Deal)

Lipton is royalty in the M&A bar. There is no immediate successor to the status that he has achieved. The fact that clients still ask for him at the age of 85 shows you that the most important assets of a lawyer are his experience and judgment.

— Professor [Stephen Gillers](https://its.law.nyu.edu/facultyprofiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=profile.biography&personid=19943) of NYU Law School, commenting to [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-lawyers-m-a-idUSKBN18Z0HJ) about Marty Lipton of [Wachtell Lipton](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/wachtell-lipton-rosen-katz/), one of NYU Law’s most well-known and successful alumni (and a [major contributor](https://www.nyunews.com/2016/03/21/hayden-hall-to-be-renamed-to-lipton-hall/) to NYU Law over the years). Lipton will celebrate his 86th birthday on [June 22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Lipton).

Moving firms is a laborious and time-consuming task. Without assistance, your search may sputter and stall. Legal recruiters were instrumental in my two lateral moves, each significantly boosting my compensation and firm prestige. Trying to make these moves independently proved fruitless, underlining the importance of a skilled recruiter.

Choosing the Right Legal Recruiter

As a practicing attorney, I responded to recruiter emails based primarily on the opportunities they presented, often lured by promises of higher compensation, better hours, or work in fields like entertainment, sports, or cyber law. My criteria were simple: (a) an appealing opportunity, and (b) the recruiter graduated law school. Beyond that, I did minimal research.

This approach was too simplistic. A good recruiter acts as your agent, providing practical advice and actively advancing your career goals, rather than merely seeking a quick placement. Essentially, recruiters are brokers, introducing you to firms potentially interested in hiring you. This is a crucial perspective to maintain.

Recruiters sometimes need to temper your unrealistic goals, while other times, they make your dreams a reality, depending on the situation.

Dos and Don’ts from My Experiences

From my journey as an associate using recruiters and now being one, here are some key dos and don’ts:

- Do review your recruiter’s LinkedIn, website, and articles. A quick check can reveal much about their resources and approach.
- Don’t choose a recruiter solely for their pedigree. While pedigree can indicate industry knowledge and competence, some of the best recruiters at Lateral Link, for example, don’t have a law school background.
- Do collaborate with recruiters who align with your career aspirations yet remain realistic about your goals. They should be knowledgeable about the market and provide insightful guidance. That means knowing when to go for it and when to ground expectations in reality.
- Don’t work with recruiters who are not solution-focused or try to push you into roles they’re trying to fill. Your lateral search should be a collaborative effort with a recruiter who supports your journey and guides you through the process.
- Do be judicious about sharing your application materials. A reliable recruiter only submits your application to firms you’ve approved, avoiding potential issues and application conflicts.
- Don’t engage with too many recruiters simultaneously. This can lead to confusion and difficulties in managing submissions, as well as weakening your position in offer negotiations.
- Do choose a responsive recruiter who keeps you regularly updated. Navigating job changes is challenging, and a good recruiter will ensure you’re well informed throughout the process.
- Do work with recruiters who take the time to understand your practice area, history, and preferences, and who prepare you effectively for interviews.
- Do ask recruiters about their motivations. Some are genuinely passionate about their work, while others may be primarily driven by financial gain. Make your choice accordingly.
Having been both a lateral associate and a recruiter, I’ve gained valuable insights into the process. Moving firms is challenging and stressful, but with the right recruiter, it can be as seamless and stress-free as possible.

# Biglaw Firm To Pay Over $3 Million To Settle Pay Discrimination Case
## The case has gone through many twists and turns, but is resolved at last.

Kerrie Campbell

The legal battle that pitted the Biglaw firm formerly known as Chadbourne & Parke against former partners [Kerrie Campbell](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/biglaw-firm-hit-with-100-million-class-action-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/), [Mary Yelenick](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/3rd-former-partner-files-suit-against-chadbourne-over-unequal-pay/), and [Jaroslawa Johnson](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/biglaw-pay-discrimination-case-adds-a-new-plaintiff/) has come to an end. Chadbourne, along with [its successor firm,](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/chadbourne-parke-is-dead/) Norton Rose Fulbright, filed court papers today [detailing a settlement](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2018/03/14/chadbourne-settles-sex-bias-case-that-shined-light-on-big-law-pay-gap/) ending the plaintiffs’ claims of unequal pay and sex discrimination.

Though full details of the settlement are not known (the filing indicates there are “separate agreements that resolve all of plaintiffs’ remaining claims against defendants”), we do know that Campbell will receive $1 million, Yelenick will get $750,000, and $250,000 will go to Johnson. Chadbourne will also pay more than $1 million in attorney fees.

Plaintiffs attorney Alexandra Harwin of Sanford Heisler Sharp seems happy with the settlement, saying in a statement:

“We’re are pleased that the parties have resolved the plaintiffs’ claims under the Equal Pay Act and are hopeful the court will approve the settlements.”

Hopefully the eye-catching dollar amount will make other firms very careful when making their own compensation decisions.

# Leaving Biglaw To Try To Be Happy
## Exploring the courage needed to leave the legal profession.

Are you a Biglaw attorney? Are you miserable? (Yes, obviously the global pandemic makes everything worse, but even before that there was a deep thread of unhappiness in far too many lawyers.) Well, you aren’t alone. And on the latest episode of The Jabot podcast, we talk about making changes to be happier.

I’m joined by one of my closest friends, Stephanie Wilkins, on the podcast. Steph was on track for Biglaw partnership when she decided to hang it all up to travel the world and be a freelancer. We discuss the highs and lows of giving up your legal career, the price of happiness, freelance work in the time of COVID-19, and more.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wears when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

# First Magic Circle Firm Matches Associate Bonuses
## Expect the rest of the Circle to quickly follow suit.

American associates at Clifford Chance got word today that the Magic Circle firm will be adopting the Cravath bonus scale.

It’s hardly surprising to see Clifford Chance as the first mover of the UK elite. The firm was also the first to join [this summer’s raise party](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/magic-circle-joins-the-raise-party/). I guess when they see an unsettled market, they’re the ones willing to take a… chance. Ugh.

Anyway, the bonus levels — for those who forget the scale — are as follows:

2010 and senior $100,000
2011 $100,000
2012 $90,000
2013 $80,000
2014 $65,000
2015 $50,000
2016 $25,000
2017 $15,000
2018 $15,000 (pro-rated)

Bonuses will be paid on January 15.

As happy as Clifford Chance associates are today, one imagines that associates at the rest of the Magic Circle firms are even more psyched to see their peer group compensation leader set the tone. It won’t be long now for those eager associates.

I interviewed Melinda Wallman, a partner at Macrae, who focuses on the recruitment of partners into elite international firms in the UK and Europe. In the course of her 25-year career, she has placed hundreds of partners and partner-teams into Am Law 100 and UK 20 firms and has launched numerous offices for law firm clients. She successfully represents candidates across a wide range of practice areas and has particularly deep expertise in private equity and related areas.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry.

It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

# Not Satisfied With 'Unpaid Leave,' Am Law 100 Firm Slashes Salaries For All
## Even more bad news from this Biglaw firm.

Biglaw firms continue to roll out austerity measures in attempts to stave off the financial pains the COVID-19 crisis may bring in the future. Some firms now find themselves taking more cost-cutting measures than they initially hoped would be necessary to shore up the cash needed to weather this storm. One of those firms is Ogletree Deakins.

The Am Law 100 firm [previously](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-cuts-salaries-offers-unpaid-leave-cancels-summer-program-with-no-pay-no-guarantee-of-employment/) canceled its summer associate program without guaranteeing future employment for law students. The firm also approved special COVID-19 pay for some staff, and when those monies ran out, placed them on unpaid leave (with paid benefits through May 31). At the time, we mused that this “unpaid leave” sounded like a polite way of saying those employees had been furloughed. Now sources report to Above the Law that there are pay cuts for all remaining employees.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Specifically, Ogletree will be reducing pay for equity partners (by 20 percent), associates (by 15 percent), and highly compensated staff (by 10 percent) for the remainder of 2020. A memo detailing the firm’s plans can be found on the next page.

We reached out to Ogletree for comment on these salary cuts, and received this statement from a spokesperson (with an update on the unpaid leave health benefits):

In order to preserve jobs and maintain the stability of the firm for the long run, our firm announced on Monday, April 20, 2020, that it has made the difficult decision to implement pay reductions for attorneys and highly compensated staff through the end of the year. The firm will not reduce compensation for staff who earn less than $100,000 per year. For staff who earn $100,000 per year or more, the firm will reduce compensation by 10 percent. We will reduce attorney salaries by 15 percent, and we expect equity shareholders to receive a 20 percent reduction in compensation.

In addition, as we shared last week, a number of employees have exhausted their firm-provided COVID-19 pay and have recently begun or will begin a period of temporary unpaid leave. For these employees, the firm has extended the period it will pay the full health, vision, dental, short-term disability, and life insurance premiums for an additional month, through June 30, 2020. We plan to reinstate staff once the economy recovers.

Hopefully this will be enough to “preserve jobs” at Ogletree amid a pandemic.

“You’re paying new associates [$180K?](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) But I could have a lawyer with 15 years’ experience for the same price!”

So what?

The big firms wouldn’t want your lawyer with 15 years’ experience.

They want someone who’s good. Or who at least has potential.

Experience and raw firepower aren’t the same thing.

With 15 years’ experience, you know how to ask the same old interrogatories, and draft the same old contracts, and provide the same old answers to the same old questions. And that’s valuable — up to a point. That’s what’s required to process all the routine stuff, and there’s plenty of routine stuff going around.

But a few places aren’t looking for people who can handle the routine stuff.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Routine stuff is “commodity work,” and commodity work pays only commodity prices, and commodity prices don’t pay the freight at a big firm.

Big firms create unique solutions to unique problems, and they require unique lawyers to do that.

I grant you some of this is oversold: Most big firms do more commodity work than they would like to admit. Most big firm lawyers aren’t distinguishable from lawyers who don’t breathe big firm air. In fact, many big firm lawyers are today seeking refuge from the big firm lifestyle and are themselves creating boutiques with big firm quality and less-than-big-firm overhead.

But the difference between “good” and “bad” isn’t just the difference between “new” and “old.” Some people really do have insights, and perspectives, and ways of thinking about things that are just better than the pack. And those are the people that big firms are trying to hire. They wouldn’t want a run-of-the-mill lawyer with 15 years’ experience; experience doesn’t substitute for raw intelligence.

(I hear already, as I type, the guys with 15 years’ experience and little to show for it ranting: “I’m just as good as the smart guys! They just don’t understand! Life’s not fair!” Maybe. Or maybe you just don’t see the difference between what experience teaches and what raw intelligence offers. That’s why you’ll never achieve what you haven’t attained.

Or maybe life’s just not fair. Heck if I know.)

This is also the tricky part of working in-house. People seem to believe that everything is a matter of training: “If Smith can’t distinguish a good brief from a bad one, just train him. If Jones can’t generate unique ideas that win cases, just show him.”

It doesn’t work that way.

I can teach until I’m blue in the face, and the person who just doesn’t get it is still not going to get it.

I can show the person what a clever idea looks like, and the person will still never have one of his own.

Some people have it, and some people don’t. If you’ve ever worked with someone who has it (not someone who says he has it, but someone who actually does), then you’ve seen the difference. Those people are regularly leading the pack, thinking better thoughts and offering more insights than everyone else in the room.

Those people are rare — but they just may be worth $180K in their first year out of law school. Or worth $180K now because, ten years from now, those people will be exceptional lawyers. Or maybe it’s worth hiring ten people at $180K on the chance that you’ll find one smart person in that collection; that might be a small price to pay.

Experience and raw intelligence are not the same thing.

And it’s entirely proper for the market to distinguish between them.

# Twilight Of The Law Firms: The Big 4 Are Poised To Conquer The Legal Landscape
## The existential threat to law firms may not be technology after all.

Is the sun beginning to set on the Am Law 100 empire?

While everyone freaks out about artificial intelligence stealing their jobs, perhaps they should be a lot more worried about the global megafirms staffing up in their midst. Creatures of habit that they are, lawyers cling to their tried-and-true business model like a redneck to a J.E.B. Stuart statute, but the Big 4 haven’t been sleeping on the opportunities in the legal market and have steadily built themselves armies of lawyers, with one accounting firm boasting around 2,000 attorneys around the world. Those aren’t lawyers in their legal department — they have a lot of those too — those are just the lawyers ready to perform work for clients.

Work that used to go to law firms.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In a world where demand for legal services continues to decline for most law firms, genuinely consider a future where four of the most powerful, deeply resourced companies in the world are waiting in the lobby before your pitch.

Does that seem far-fetched? Well, ALM Senior Analyst Nicholas Bruch, who helped put together [a comprehensive report](https://www.law.com/sites/ali/2017/09/13/elephants-in-the-room-part-i-the-big-fours-expansion-in-the-legal-services-market/) on the Big 4’s place in the legal landscape, notes the uncanny similarities between the Big 4’s legal buildup and the gameplan they used to conquer the consulting business years ago. He notes that firms like PwC and Deloitte are on a buying spree, snapping up lawyers in key practice areas that dovetail perfectly with existing consulting and accounting work. Bruch doesn’t see any of the Big 4 transitioning into a full-service law firm — at least not in the foreseeable future — but that doesn’t mean they can’t take big swigs out of Biglaw’s milkshake.

In fact, the Big 4’s shadow loomed over Legalweek far more than AI or blockchain. According to American Lawyer Editor-in-Chief Gina Passarella, in the Business of Law Forum for law firm leaders held during last week’s show, one person noted, “if the Big 4 really wanted to they could obliterate this conference.” That day may be coming sooner rather than later.

PwC is already arguably the premier labor and employment firm, and tax and M&A work are low-hanging fruit for megafirms that have pre-existing relationships with nearly every member of the Fortune 500. They’re already [poking into Europe](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/03/stats-of-the-week-accountants-at-the-gates-of-biglaw/) and possess among the strongest brands in Asia, giving them an in with the big players coming out of overseas markets. When it comes to a pitch, will an up-and-coming Asian company moving into a new market select a white-shoe law firm or the company that’s been at their side for a decade?

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It’s not just proximity either. Bruch highlighted one small, but potentially critical distinction between Biglaw and the Big 4 — law firms tend to approach entrepreneurs and startups with the language of “advice” while the Big 4 approach with the language of “solutions.” This may sound like a stretch, but a relationship of trust is often founded on speaking the same language.

Biglaw will fire back that they provide bespoke legal services that the Big 4 can never match because Biglaw has a penchant for imagining themselves as special snowflakes. Maybe they’re right. E&Y is probably not going to be conquering litigation any time soon, but how well will the Biglaw business model hold up if firms start seeing significant bleeding in the run-of-the-mill tax and corporate work that pays the bills?

Whenever the subject of Big 4 infiltration has come up before, law firms tend to cluck their tongues and cite America’s regulatory firewall. The Big 4 can’t advise their audit clients! Sure, but what about their purely consulting clients? Partnerships including non-lawyers can’t practice law! Yet the scope of what constitutes legal practice is very much in flux. Just how much tax advice — even coming from a lawyer — is legal as opposed to consulting? There’s a lot of slack in there for the Big 4 to siphon off business. And at a certain point, regulations change when reality forces the matter.

All that’s left to consider is how the invasion comes to pass. James Goodnow points out that PwC has already [planted a small flag in the U.S.](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/king-kong-is-coming-to-crush-your-practice-with-a-calculator/) and is adamant that its focus on international law isn’t a barrier to future expansions into other practices. On the other hand, the Big 4 might not try to set up their own shops at all as much as swallow up regional firms in a Verein model. After all, the Verein structure is old hat to the Big 4. The losers, as usual, will likely be the Am Law 51-200. Boutiques will continue providing narrowly tailored bespoke services and the elite global firms have reputations that approach if not match the Big 4. But that juicy middle of the Biglaw market is exposed.

No matter how this all plays out, the Big 4 represent an existential threat to the American legal landscape. Who ends up winning and losing in this new world remains to be seen, but it’s safe to say the market will look very different in five years than it does today.

# STEM Majors Who Excel On The LSAT Have No Interest In Law School
## Is it any wonder that law schools are gunning to accept GRE scores for admissions purposes?

A future law school applicant?

Take a look around the average entering law school class, and you’ll find that the vast majority of the students who are about to begin their very expensive, three-year journeys have not only graduated with degrees in social sciences, but they’ve also scored lower on the LSAT than their peers with degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). On average, those who have majored in math, physics, and biomedical engineering have scored 160 or higher on the exam, while those with degrees in political science, a stereotypical pre-law major, have scored below 155.

Professor Robert Anderson of Pepperdine University School of Law recently compiled data on undergraduate majors, GPAs, and LSAT scores, and found that the only other majors — aside from the STEM majors mentioned above — that broke the 160 average on the LSAT were classics and linguistics. Check out the rest of Professor Anderson’s [findings](http://witnesseth.typepad.com/blog/2017/07/law-school-admissions-and-college-majors.html) below (click to enlarge):

In an interview with Karen Sloan of Law.com, Professor Anderson noted the following: “We are sorely underrepresented in people with quantitative and science backgrounds. It’s harming our law schools and draining us of the intellectual rigor that could otherwise be there, and it’s reducing our students’ employment prospects.”

Is it any wonder that law schools are gunning to accept GRE scores for admissions purposes?

Unfortunately, it seems that STEM majors have little to no interest in attending law school. According to a recent study performed by the AccessLex Institute, STEM majors accounted for only 5.7 percent of all 2014 law school applicants. Here are some additional details from [Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/07/19/types-of-college-grads-nailing-the-lsat-arent-keen-on-law-school/):

Aspiring lawyers with degrees in the social sciences and helping professions, which includes social work and psychology, made up nearly 48 percent of 2014 applicants, AccessLex found. The arts and humanities majors had nearly 24 percent of all law school applicants, and business and management majors accounted for almost 16 percent. Political science majors alone made up almost 19 percent of applicant pool. Business, criminal justice, psychology and English rounded out the top five.

Compared to the 160 average score of STEM majors on the LSAT, the average score among the 12,693 political science majors who applied in 2015 was 153. Business majors scored an average 149, while criminal justice majors a particularly low average of 146, according to the Law School Admission Council, which administers the LSAT.

The good news is that more and more STEM majors have been graduating from college over the course of the past decade, and some of them may be convinced to attend law school in the future — if the money’s right, of course. Who knows, perhaps STEM majors could be the key to ending the dumbing down of the legal profession once and for all. Good luck with your law school applications, everyone.

I guess [Davis Polk] didn’t get the memo about America being the land of the free and home of the brave.

— an unnamed partner at a Magic Circle firm in London, commenting on [Davis Polk’s “no vaccine, no office entry” policy](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/davis-polk-to-deactivate-building-id-cards-of-unvaccinated-lawyers-and-staff/), in response to a [Law.com International survey](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/08/04/lawyers-welcome-davis-polk-vaccine-stance-but-some-slam-mandatory-policy-405-88901/) on the firm’s new safety measures. Seventy-five percent of survey respondents were in favor of Davis Polk’s vaccine mandate. “COVID-19 is the greatest public health challenge in our life times and radical action is required if society is ever to return to normal,” said a U.S.-based partner at a Magic Circle firm. “Only with near universal vaccination can we reach herd immunity and limit the development of variants.”

# Want To Leave Biglaw And Open Your Own Shop? Be Prepared To Accept A New Arrangement With Your Clients
## For in-house counsel, having a hired Biglaw gun and hundreds of other attorneys on demand certainly has its perks.

For almost a decade, our hospital has had a large Biglaw firm on retainer as a sort of “Break Glass In Case Of Emergency” option.

We handle most of our legal work in-house. Those times which we find ourselves under-resourced or engaged in a protracted legal dispute, we may hire outside, but usually local counsel. But for those instances when the federal government issues a business-changing rule or we find ourselves in a multistate, multimillion-dollar dispute, we haul out our Biglaw team and let them get to work.

Throughout the life of the engagement, our account has been handled by the same partner. I could go on for pages detailing how great and brilliant she is. From her legal pedigree to her acumen, she is everything you would expect from Biglaw.

But while I was more than happy to pay to have such a tremendous resource on retainer, for me, that was only a part of her value.

The rest came from the letterhead on which her advice came and the assurance of knowing she was backed by hundreds of talented colleagues. Even though I have given Biglaw a hard time before in some of my previous columns, I will be the first to admit there is a real value in the reputation that comes along with their representation.

Which is why when the partner recently informed me she was leaving Biglaw to set up her own shop, I was torn.

On one hand, I was happy to keep our business with her at her new practice. In fact, she was opening it with another one of her partners whom I had worked with on several occasions over the years and also thought quite highly of him as well.

But on the other, I was a bit reluctant to follow knowing in doing so, I would be foregoing my proverbial safety net of having a large Biglaw firm, and its reputation, on retainer.

Sure, if any of my future opposing counsels took a moment to research her and her background, they may appreciate the level of representation we have, but that takes time and does not bring with it the immediate attention a Biglaw firm’s letterhead demands.

Reputation aside, I was also afraid to lose the backing of what seemed like a near infinite supply of other attorneys in her firm. Although I had never met the vast majority of them, it was nice to know that if a large issue were to arise, she could summon 10 attorneys at a moment’s notice. But in her new firm, in such a moment of need, I was capped at her and her partner lest she seek outside help as well.

At the end of the day, I kept some of our business with her new firm, but now utilize her more as a legal consultant than my outside Biglaw gun. As I previously mentioned, I could not bear the thought of severing all ties with her given how big of an asset she has been for us over the past decade, but I also could not justify the potential risk associated with not having a Biglaw firm on retainer.

Thus far the new relationship has worked well, and by all outside measures, her new firm has hit its stride out of the gate.

However, as I authorize payment on her substantially smaller monthly invoices than when she was with her Biglaw firm, I sincerely hope these new arrangements with her old clients is something she had planned for in her business plan.

# Another Link In The Associate Raise Chain
## An afternoon raise to leave Tuesday on a high note.

Is that a better headline than “Associate Raises Come Sooner Rather Than Later”? I thought playing off the “link” would be easier than off the “laters.” I suppose there could be an “Adventures of Link…laters” play for the Nintendo heads out there. Maybe jokes about the Ocarina of Timekeeping?

Look, clearly I was just stalling so there’s enough column space that the picture didn’t interfere with the chart. We should be there now so we don’t need to keep wasting time riffing on lawyers Zeldalously representing their clients anymore.

Linklaters added its name to the 2021 salary match scrolls with a memo sent around to US associates this afternoon.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Comp Year	Annual Base Pay
2021	$202,500
2020	$205,000
2019	$215,000
2018	$240,000
2017	$275,000
2016	$305,000
2015	$330,000
2014	$350,000
2013	$365,000
It’s a fairly spartan memo — just two sentences and the chart. These people know what the associates want to see.

And apparently it’s not a lot of unnecessary framing before getting to the numbers.

Hm… I feel attacked there.

This is a fun survey, primarily for our West Coast readers. White-shoe law firms are prestigious and traditional and, well, old. The term “white shoe” itself comes from the shriveled upper lips of old white men that are so wrinkled they look like shoe laces. Just kidding. [People actually used to wear white shoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_shoe_firm).

White-shoe firms are known for their association with banks and brokerage houses. They work hand-in-glove with the centers of East Coast finance. But enough about the past. We’re interested in who is working with our new financial titans of Silicon Valley. Which firms are servicing the tech startups, unicorns, and venture capitalists of the new economy? Who are our “white-sandal” law firms?

[Take our survey](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6mVowl7qMmez4hL). Help us describe the world that is West of the Hudson.

# The Reverse Golden Rule
## To err in Biglaw is human. To forgive is divine, and potentially profitable.

There aren’t many universal rules to the human experience, but a precious few have earned a spot in the rule book. We all know the Golden Rule: treat others as you want to be treated. I’m also a fan of the [Platinum Rule](https://www.inc.com/peter-economy/how-the-platinum-rule-trumps-the-golden-rule-every-time.html): treat others as they want to be treated. I’d like to humbly submit a new rule for your consideration. The Reverse Golden Rule: treat yourself how you would treat someone else in your position.

The inspiration for this piece came from a recent article from the [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2018/09/give-yourself-a-break-the-power-of-self-compassion) on a skill set called self-compassion that remains vastly underutilized in the legal world. Self-compassion is the ability to handle our own failures in a mature and productive way, by honestly recognizing the faults that led us to failure, but forgiving ourselves for those faults combined with taking action to do better in the future. People who demonstrate high levels of self-compassion tend to be happier, healthier, more professionally fulfilled, and tend to feel more authentically in touch with their true selves.

Self-compassion is defined better by action more than words. It is being kind to yourself, rather than judgmental. It’s recognizing your failures with the knowledge that all humans make errors. We demonstrate it when we properly harness the negative emotions associated with failure to teach and inspire us, while balancing them with positive emotions that keep us from being overwhelmed or giving up all hope of improvement. In short, it’s approaching failure with a healthy and honest attitude. Maybe most importantly, it’s about being open about the fact that we make mistakes and seeing them as opportunities for growth, rather than evidence of defects in our fundamental being.

Why We Suck

Given that self-compassion is the sign of a functional, mentally and emotionally mature person, it’s perhaps unsurprising that lawyers are typically terrible at it. We are not by our nature happy, emotionally balanced people. We have some of the highest [depression](http://www.abajournal.com/voice/article/lawyers_weigh_in_why_is_there_a_depression_epidemic_in_the_profession), [substance abuse](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sure-recovery/201707/drug-and-alcohol-abuse-in-the-legal-profession), and [self-harm](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/lets-talk-about-self-harm/) statistics of any profession. We’re a self-selecting group of professionals who tend to be highly organized, highly disciplined, and to have incredibly low tolerances for failure and risk. We choose to engage in a job where any error we make could cost massive amounts of money, or permanently impact the rights of the people who’ve entrusted us with their families, freedom, or lives. The demands of our profession mean failure is typically not an option, and so we’re a profession made up of people who can’t stand to fail.

It’s more than just who we’re composed of, though. It’s also who we choose to be our peers. Consider the qualities that a Biglaw firm typically looks for in its partnership. Firms look for perfectionism, total dedication, and exacting standards. Succeeding within a firm means projecting at all times an aura of hard-driving success, and of demanding — and obtaining — top-notch work out of the people below you. There’s no room for error in a Biglaw partnership, and the people who tend to succeed are the people who don’t allow for error in themselves or others. Self-compassion isn’t a skillset that Biglaw inherently cultivates or rewards.

Our clients push us toward perfectionism, as well. Most clients pay handsomely for their attorneys, and they expect to receive the value that they’re putting in. Clients justifiably don’t like paying for work that gets messed up. Attorneys that make errors don’t keep their clients for long.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Everywhere an attorney turns, they find more and more reinforcement for the notion that errors are unforgiveable. Lawyers need self-compassion as much as any human being, but they’re in a job that teaches them at every turn that self-compassion isn’t to be tolerated.

Acting The Part

Surviving in Biglaw, like in many industries, requires a degree of public relations acumen. I talked last month in this column about the [George Costanza](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/biglaw-is-turning-associates-into-george-costanzas/) effect, how we pressure ourselves and our associates into always being busy, or at least seeming busy. In the same way our industry pressures attorneys to perform the part of the crazy-busy workhorse, we ask each other to perform the part of perfect, error-free automaton. We minimize our failures as much as possible and amplify our successes because the image of success cultivates actual success — or at least that’s what we tell ourselves.

Law is the art of selling advice. To sell our expertise we have to inspire confidence in our clients, and in our partners and colleagues. We have to play the part of all-knowing sage and crafty gambler, keeper of secret wisdoms, exploiter of errors made by the other side, minimizer of the errors made by our clients. We spend so much time projecting this aura of absolute competence that we end up without the tools we need to handle failure when it happens. And sooner or later, it always happens. If we don’t have the tools to reconcile our inner knowledge of failure with our public personas of competence, we court disaster.

Without self-compassion, our options for addressing failure are few. We can gloss over and ignore our failures, which saves us the mental grief of acknowledging them, but also deprives us of opportunities to learn from them. Alternately, we can wallow in our errors, flagellating ourselves for falling below the impossible bar we’ve set, which leads to unhealthy outcomes and toxic working environments. Those coping strategies contribute hugely to the crises our industry is facing in attorneys’ stress, burnout, and mental and physical health failures.

Fixing The Problem

Self-compassion offers the tools we need to reconcile these conflicts, but it requires us to reconfigure some of our basic assumptions about ourselves. We have to start with the knowledge that we’re all human, and each and every one of us is bound to screw up eventually. When we do, we need to address our errors honestly, account for why they happened, make amends where we can, and ultimately forgive ourselves and move on. Acknowledging our faults, taking lessons from them, and letting them go are at the heart of the concept.

So how do we start cultivating self-compassion in a profession that’s notoriously bad at it? I can think of two solid starting points. First, to treat ourselves better, we need to start treating each other better. We need to cultivate environments where people feel free and safe to talk about their errors. When we identify or learn of mistakes our colleagues make, we need to address them swiftly in ways that help avoid the errors going forward, but not in merciless ways where we gun for their jobs or refuse to work with them ever again because of isolated errors. Addressing mistakes in an honest, direct and fair way helps create the kind of safe working environments that [cause teams to excel](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/biglaw-is-turning-associates-into-george-costanzas/).

And once we’ve done that, that’s when it’s time for the Reverse Golden Rule. We need to treat ourselves the same way we’ve treated those around us. When we screw up, we need to ask ourselves how we would treat a colleague who came and told us they’d made the same error. Most of us wouldn’t give up on our colleagues after a single mistake, or two, or three, and we shouldn’t give up on ourselves either. When we offer ourselves the same understanding and fair-minded approach we offer others, we take one more step toward making our firms, and Biglaw itself, a healthier and more productive place.

# The First Biglaw Firm To Willingly Do Away With Its Mandatory Arbitration Policy
## Is this the beginning of a new era of transparency in Biglaw for sexual harassment claims?

Less than 24 hours after one Biglaw firm was forced to [scrap its mandatory arbitration policy](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/biglaw-firm-tries-to-force-summer-associates-to-arbitrate-sexual-harassment-claims/) due to social media outrage, another firm has stepped forward to voluntarily do so, as a leader of change for women in the workplace.

Yesterday afternoon, Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe [announced](https://twitter.com/Orrick/status/978344236725735425) that it would no longer require any of its employees, including associates, to sign mandatory arbitration agreements. “Orrick has decided that it’s time for us to make a change,” the firm said in a statement given to Above the Law. [Mitchell Zuklie](https://www.orrick.com/People/8/5/E/Mitchell-Zuklie?lang=en), Orrick’s chairman, said, “We listened to the conversation on this issue and realized it was time for us to make a change. We’re very focused on being a best place to work for the best talent, and that means taking a fresh, forward-thinking look at everything we do.” Orrick, a firm that already offers [unprecedented benefits](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/leader-in-biglaw-parental-leave-further-expands-its-already-unprecedented-benefits/) to its attorneys, has just cemented its role as a pacesetter for all other Biglaw firms in the country now that it’s offering one of the biggest benefits of all: freedom from mandatory arbitration.

All too often, arbitration is used to control and silence victims of sexual harassment, and it’s high time that a Biglaw firm acknowledges that. However, if an employee does bring a claim, only then will Orrick offer the option of opting in to arbitration, because the firm believes that it may be “advantageous to the employee.” Here’s more from the firm’s statement on the retraction of its mandatory arbitration policy:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
We have been reviewing our sexual harassment policies generally in response to the #metoo conversation and as part of our commitment to being a best place to work and attracting the best talent. Munger Tolles’ announcement over the weekend, and the conversation around it, prompted us to accelerate our review of our use of mandatory arbitration (we did not have a non-disclosure clause).

Orrick’s new policy will be applied retroactively to everyone at the firm, save partners (which is admittedly disappointing, given the number of gender bias claims that have been brought forward by female partners and scuttled into arbitration). If an employee signed a mandatory arbitration agreement in the past, they will no longer be bound by it in light of the firm’s new policy.

Congratulations to Orrick on being the first Biglaw firm to allow its employees to have their day in court when it comes to sexual harassment in the #MeToo era. Time is up, and this firm has turned over the hourglass to give women another chance. We’ll have to wait and see if any additional firms are willing to follow in Orrick’s footsteps.

How many Biglaw firms are forcing employees to sign mandatory arbitration agreements, sending disputes into private tribunals beyond the prying eyes of the media or courts? We’ve already heard from several people whose firms required them to sign such documents, but they can’t speak out alone for fear of losing their jobs. There is power in numbers, and here at Above the Law, we’re more than happy to serve as your voice in a force for good. If you know of any other law firms that require their employees to submit to mandatory arbitration, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com) at or text us at (646) 820-8477. With your help, we’ll soon be able to compile a list of all the firms that still require mandatory arbitration, along with all the firms that have welcomed a new day of transparency and ditched these antiquated agreements.

# Top Biglaw Firm Offers New Parental Leave Program With Up To 22 Weeks Paid Leave
## Great news!

Bonuses come and go, but a solid parental leave policy? Now that’s a perk associates will benefit from for years. Yesterday, King & Spalding — a firm that made $1,828,123,000 in gross revenue last year, making it 22nd on the Am Law 100 — announced an exciting update to their parental leave policy. As one tipster reflected, “Still waiting on bonus news, though everyone expects a match, eventually. But this news is much more important, and is long awaited as something the associates committee fought for years on.”

It’s part of a growing trend to be sure, with Biglaw firms launching expanded programs. This is good news we should — and are! — celebrating. But we also hope to build the pressure and shame on the firms whose policies and entrenched in the past.

So what are the deets on K&S’s new policy? Birthing mothers are eligible for 10 weeks of medical maternal leave under the firm’s short-term disability program. Additionally, all new parents — whether by birth, adoption, surrogacy, or foster care — get 12 weeks paid leave. Plus for 20 business days following leave, new parents will be in a “ramp up” phase where they’re only expected to work at 70% capacity but still are paid at 100%. We love seeing policies that are gender neutral and without a primary caregiver stipulation!

Kudos to the firm!

With more and more firms stepping up, expanded gender-neutral leave may start to feel de rigueur, and that’s a good thing by itself. But we should also remember it’s an important step, one [experts say will help ameliorate the gender pay gap. ](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/everything-you-need-to-know-about-biglaw-parental-leave/)And that’s good news we can all get behind.

Check out the firm’s complete policy below.

# The Biglaw Firms That Offered The Best Remote Work Experiences During The Pandemic
## Did your firm make the cut on this important ranking?

Lawyers at the largest of law firms have been working from home for the better part of the past year-and-a-half due to the coronavirus crisis. Thanks to some quick thinking and an even quicker turnaround time on either providing or funding the tech needed for all personnel to work remotely, Biglaw firms are now looking at booming revenue and profit gains. But which firms did it best when it came to supplying attorneys with what was needed?

According to the American Lawyer’s 2021 Midlevel Associates Survey, third-years through fifth-years gave their firms an average score of 4.23 out of 5 for their ability to support remote work. In 2020, the average score was 3.85, so it looks like Biglaw has gotten the hang of the big tech needed to succeed during unprecedented times.

Firms have doled out laptops and cellphones and, in some cases, provided generous stipends for work-from-home setups.

“We were able to easily pivot to remote work due to increased firm emphasis on technology investment over the previous two years,” said one fifth-year associate in the Washington, D.C., office of an Am Law 200 firm.

Throughout the pandemic, Biglaw firms have made sure that attorneys and staff have had what was necessary to perform, from supplying full tech home kits to offering stipends ranging from $250 to thousands of dollars on top of that.

# Some Law Firms Spend Money On Weird Things
## Do law firms have a fetish about coffee table books?

When I was an associate at a Biglaw firm, I was perplexed by some of the expensive things on which the firm spent money. The firm had teams of people on the payroll that fulfilled somewhat unnecessary administrative functions, and the shop blew money that probably could have been spent in better ways on expensive travel. Moreover, there were a few other things in my experience that Biglaw firms and other shops spent money on that seemed to make little sense and deprived the shop of funds that could have gone to other, more important purposes.

Art

About a decade ago, I worked at a Biglaw firm that had a sizeable art collection. My memory is a little fuzzy about this collection, and I only picked up information about it secondhand since partners did not talk about it much to associates. However, the law firm apparently started collecting art as a way to adorn the halls of the main office (years before I arrived). I believe this effort was spearheaded by the spouse of one of the founding partners. Over time, the law firm collected quite a large amount of art, and I believe that offices firmwide could request that art be hung on their walls so that their spaces would be less bland.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The law firm was so proud of its art collection that it created a pretty nice coffee table book that included a narrative about each piece of art. The shop produced numerous copies of this book, and it could be found all around our satellite office of the firm. I still have a copy on my coffee table at home! The coffee table book was an additional expense that did not seem related to the legal services mission of the firm, and it is still unclear to me what utility the firm really got out of its expensive art collection and coffee table books.

History Projects

Some law firms have storied historical pasts, and they can rightly claim a place in the annals of the legal profession. Those shops might want to invest in histories about their law firm since such efforts can increase a firm’s prestige and help promote its culture. However, not all large law firms have a storied-enough past for it to make sense to commission a history.

I once worked at a large law firm that no one would call particularly prestigious or historical. However, the law firm spent resources commissioning a history of the shop and — you guessed it — turned this history into a coffee table book. Do law firms have a fetish about coffee table books? The only two large firms I ever worked at published their own coffee table books … but I digress.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
This coffee table book including the history of that shop was well-researched and had vivid images. I remember the book reproduced the oldest document that bore the law firms stationary, which was interesting. However, the history of the law firm was rarely connected to larger historical events, and the history of that shop would likely only interest a handful of old timers who devoted their careers to that shop. I am not sure why a firm like that, which did not have a historical past like some of the more prestigious law firms, would blow money on a project like a law firm history.

Some Swag

I already wrote an [article about law firm swag](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/instead-of-job-perks-and-swag-firms-should-just-offer-associates-more-money/) — I haven’t done a coffee table book about it … yet — and sometimes, swag can help advertise the firm and build its culture. However, law firms often produce swag that is a waste of money. For instance, one person’s response to my initial swag article that of how he once worked at a law firm that handed out atlases emblazoned with the law firm’s logo. Atlases aren’t really useful, and the law firm logo on an atlas is likely not going to be seen by too many people. One time, I receive wireless headphones as law firm swag, which I loved initially. However, the headphones were not the best quality, and the logo on each of the earbuds was really small and was likely not seen by too many people.

All told, larger law firms may generate tons of money, and partners might want to spend this money on nonlegal expenses in order to flex and market the name of the shop. However, law firm managers should be deliberate when spending money so that they are not frivolous with costs that are incurred by a firm.

Crikey, mates! It seems that a prominent patent partner from Down Under has been accused of grabbing a jogger down under.

Please note the UPDATE below.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
[Carl Harrap](http://www.fpapatents.com/staff-profile?id=4), a former associate at Herbert Smith Freehills who recently became a partner at [FPA Patent Attorneys](http://www.fpapatents.com/home) — an intellectual property spinoff of Freehills that opened its doors just prior to the firm’s merger with Herbert Smith in 2012 — has been charged with indecent assault. According to [local sources](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/sydney-lawyer-carl-harrap-face-court-after-allegedly-groping-jogger/news-story/7e19855b631665706bfa1a9e2425a1fd), on December 28, Harrap allegedly jumped out of some bushes on a jogging track near Sydney’s north shore and grabbed a young woman’s crotch. Onlookers are said to have restrained Harrap until police arrived on scene to arrest him.

Per the [The Daily Telegraph](http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/top-sydney-silk-carl-harrap-charged-with-indecent-assault-after-allegedly-grabbing-female-jogger-on-the-crotch/news-story/9e2e11ac1002a5f039073d6fbe9ea81e), Harrap is being represented by Joseph Nashed, a Sydney-based defense lawyer. Nashed has refused to comment on his client’s case.

Harrap was released from custody on conditional bail, but will appear for a hearing two weeks from today. The [Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202775973642/-Former-Herbert-Smith-Freehills-Lawyer-Charged-With-Assault-in-Sydney) has more on Harrap’s future with FPA:

When asked whether Harrap will continue practicing with the firm, FPA said it respects the legal process and privacy of the individuals involved, and will not comment until this case has been resolved. Harrap is still listed on the firm’s website.

Best of luck to Carl Harrap as he defends himself against these charges.

UPDATE (07/21/17): Carl Harrap has been [cleared of all charges](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4476830/Top-Sydney-lawyer-cleared-grabbing-student-s-groin.html), after testifying that he “collided” with the woman by accident in an attempt to pass her on a narrow stairway.

# Biglaw Firm Desperately Hopes They Can Turn Around Their Downward Spiral
## What's going on at Hughes Hubbard?

According [to a report](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/09/30/hughes-hubbard-amid-mounting-challenges-undergoes-rebuilding/) by Christine Simmons at Law.com, the Biglaw firm of Hughes Hubbard & Reed has been on a “downward trajectory” over the last five years or so, and the numbers back that up. Over that time period, gross revenue is down 27 percent (from $394 million in 2014 to $288.1 million in 2019), attorney head count is also down by more than 80 lawyers, profits per equity partner is down to $1.41 million 2019 (from a high water mark of $2.145 million in 2014), and the firm’s profit margin is now ~18 percent, falling from a high of 42 percent. And as a result, its Am Law 200 ranking plummeted from 72 to 116.

And all that was before COVID-19 hit.

With the additional hardships caused by the pandemic, the firm dealt with more bad news. Hughes Hubbard took a multimillion-dollar Paycheck Protection Program loan, and then[ laid off more](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/am-law-200-firm-conducts-associate-layoffs-due-to-covid-19/) than 30 people in July (insiders say they were “blindsided” by the cuts). Later that month, 11 international trade lawyers left the firm, taking with them a reported book of business of more than $12 million.

Law firm management consultant Kent Zimmermann told Law.com:

“But if a firm’s head count and revenue and profitability are dropping precipitously, particularly if that was all happening in a good economy,” Zimmermann said, “it could cause people to wonder what would happen in an uncertain economy.”

That was about the industry generally, not the specifics of what’s going on at Hughes Hubbard, but the concern remains.

So what is going on? Simmons reports that Hughes Hubbard has long survived on big, like really big, cases:

More than a decade ago, Hughes Hubbard was engaged in multifaceted products liability litigation defending the drug giant Merck over its controversial painkiller, Vioxx, before Merck in 2007 agreed to pay $4.85 billion in a settlement.

Hughes Hubbard also watched its [tobacco-related products liability work decline](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/almID/1202738262803/Up-in-Smoke-Tobacco-Merger-Takes-Toll-at-Hughes-Hubbard/) after former client Lorillard was acquired in 2014 by Reynolds American. Reynolds moved much of the Lorillard litigation work to Reynolds’ regular tobacco counsel at Jones Day, The American Lawyer reported in 2015, and Hughes Hubbard cut some of its Kansas City staff as a result.

In the last few years, senior counsel James Giddens’ work as trustee overseeing the liquidation of Lehman Brothers Holdings’ broker-dealer unit has [wound down,](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/09/18/hughes-hubbards-long-lehman-brokerage-wind-down-could-end-in-2019/) marking an end to a decade-long odyssey that has generated more than $400 million for the firm. During the case’s heyday, some partners were making several million dollars a year, sources said. Giddens was also trustee in the liquidation of securities broker-dealer MF Global.

More recently, Hughes Hubbard’s work for Airbus has significantly slowed down, sources said.

And as an insider says, “The issue happens when you don’t get another large case. There’s a lot of mouths to feed.”

The firm’s chair is aware of the recent ending of these big matters, but is still optimistic about the firm’s bottom line:

Acknowledging some major matters have ended, chairman Ted Mayer said in an interview the firm “went through a rebuilding” where partners began boosting up their own practices. Now the firm is seeing success, he said, as the number of partners with at least $3 million in business is the highest the firm has had.

Firm leaders also say Hughes Hubbard is seeing an uptick in international legal business, and they hint at expansion to come outside the firm’s usual boundaries.

“We feel very good about meeting our budget and ending the year strong,” Mayer said.

Mayer said he expects revenue to be flat in 2020, but that the firm continues to work on “major new litigation.” He said the process of rebuilding “takes time, and we’re seeing tremendous success.”

And the firm’s culture, along with its commitment [to pro bono matters and diversity](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/08/05/the-2020-a-list-amid-upheaval-firms-focus-on-finding-balance/), continue to make it a robust firm:

“While some of the published metrics don’t appear as robust or positive as people would like,” said New York recruiter Alisa Levin, “the firm still has a strong culture, and many respected practices.” Not everybody has to make $5 million a year, she added.

# Is Biglaw Really Depraved?
## Or is it just a victim of its own mythology.

Aiding and abetting child slavery is bad. One would hope that’s a fairly uncontroversial statement. Last week, the Supreme Court heard argument on a case about possible liability for Nestle and Cargill for human rights violations that occurred in Africa as part of the food giants’ supply chains. The case generated harsh criticism as a defense of child slavery — which it wasn’t technically. It also inspired some high-minded defenses about separating attorneys from the stances they take on behalf of clients — which is dumb.

But this chasm between scorched earth criticism and uncritical dismissiveness, highlights some festering issues with the profession, all based upon the fictions upon fictions we’re asked to swallow when we champion this messy system.

The New Republic has an article from Alex Pareene titled [Neal Katyal and the Depravity of Big Law](https://newrepublic.com/article/160481/neal-katyal-depravity-big-law) charting the historical development of the status quo “right to counsel” mythology. What was once understood specifically as the constitutional bulwark against the awesome power of the state in criminal cases slowly morphed over the course of the 20th century into a catch-all defense of lawyers taking on unpopular corporate clients. And while I’d argue that the evolution of the right to counsel to cover civil litigation — which can devastate people these days as surely as a prosecution — is a positive development that should be pushed even further, that’s properly a reason to provide civil legal services to the downtrodden, not a teflon shield for attorneys taking money from deep-pocketed pariahs to perform work exacerbating their advantages over the rest of us.

That’s a shield that we’re always quick to puncture at Above the Law. When Jones Day goes out and tries to disenfranchise the American electorate and then weasels around that it doesn’t represent “Trump,” [just the sock puppet organizations that Trump controls](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/yesterday-was-the-day-america-learned-what-weve-known-about-jones-day-all-along/), and pleads with everyone to respect their efforts because everyone deserves a lawyer, they get rightly scorched. As [we’ve said before](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/09/when-are-lawyers-to-blame-for-their-clients/), lawyers shouldn’t be punished “as lawyers” for their clients, but they can be punished as businesspeople for their clients. If you want to defend Nazis based on general First Amendment grounds, go ahead. Some folks will accept that high-minded justification, but if other clients or potential co-workers judge you negatively for it, that’s the natural and logical consequence of this decision. Don’t whine about these things and certainly don’t pretend some superficial Schoolhouse Rock vision of the judicial system shields Jones Day as if they have some divine right for mainstream clients to overlook the firm’s wingnut advocacy.

As for the recent Supreme Court argument, the facts of the case are certainly horrific, but the position that the Alien Tort Statute doesn’t cover Nestle or Cargill here isn’t outlandish on its face. Katyal even notes that other avenues exist for bringing claims against the companies on this set of allegations. If the statute is wrong, it’s not up to the courts to rewrite it to fit the case. That’s the lawyerly answer anyway.

Except even if it’s true — and Justice Kagan seemed very convinced that it isn’t — that the ATS doesn’t go this far, this argument requires believing that America is still a functional Republic at this point. Congress is struggling to pass a bipartisan bill about a raging pandemic, they aren’t about to have a serious conversation about the scope of a 1789 law. And the childish yet prevailing worldview that courts need to play linguistic games to hew to the narrowest read possible isn’t sparking new and more detail-oriented lawmaking, it just locks in the status quo, usually to the detriment of the marginalized. On the other hand, are we better off asking the courts to usurp the role of the legislature out of necessity? That’s… ominous. But if that is where we are, doesn’t that redouble the need for lawyers to be more than mere advocates and function with the accountability of true policymakers?

The push and pull of these forces are how we end up in this hellscape because the cabined role of every actor — lawyer, judge, lawmaker, executive, international body — just results in no one being in a position to take responsibility.

Ultimately, the profession is as messy as it is important. The only solution is to keep clear-eyed about it and reject the nonsensical “[Love Your Lawyer Day](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/today-is-love-your-lawyer-day-and-its-completely-stupid/)” platitudes. No, Biglaw isn’t depraved, at least not any more than any other node in this headless structure, but Pareene is right that it’s not helping anyone to assume law firms can hermetically seal themselves off from the practical impact of their arguments. It’s important to engage, question, and push lawyers, but also to contextualize the arguments and spread the responsibility accordingly.

Or to put it more simply, when aiding and abetting child slavery amounts to a colorable question of law, the problem runs way deeper than the moment any law firm got involved.

# A How-To Guide For Summer Associates
## Tips and tricks to maximize your summer associate experience.

It’s June, which means summer associate classes are firing up at law firms across the nation. Eager young law students will be getting their first tastes of the actual practice of law.

It’s been 18 years since I was a summer associate, and I can still picture the room my group sat in for our first orientation session. That first taste of the legal practice is so exciting, surreal, nerve-wracking, and elating that it sticks with a person long after the memories of their first years of actual practice have blurred together.

The legal world looks drastically different today than it did when I started out nearly two decades ago, but some parts of the summer associate experience will probably always remain the same. In that spirit, please allow me to offer some advice to all those future attorneys out there taking their first steps into the practice.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Relationships are the point. Nothing is more important this summer than the relationships you’ll build. That comes from the very heart of the nature of our business. At its highest level, the practice of law isn’t about manufacturing widgets or moving materials around. It’s about listening, understanding, and communicating. Building relationships is the foundation of every legal practice, and that starts now. You’ll need a network of peers who trust one another, seek advice and perspective from one another, and maybe one day send business to one another. You’ll need to cultivate relationships with senior associates and partners who can provide you with work, legal insight, institutional guidance, and mentorship. You’ll need to develop rapport with staff, the ones who keep the ship afloat and know where the bodies are buried. If you want this firm to become your home once you’ve got that JD in hand, make its current members excited to bring you back.

It’s a marathon, not a sprint. Summer program days tend to be filled to the brim with coffee runs, training sessions, networking lunches, group excursions, happy hours, dinners, and so many other activities. It can be a lot of “on” time. Summer programs pack a lot in because they want to give you opportunities to succeed. Try to give the program everything you can. These next couple of months are a time to invest in your career, and hopefully plant the roots you need for a more balanced experience once you’re back as a full-fledged associate.

Take it slow, prove you can grow. Don’t take this the wrong way, but you don’t know much of anything yet, legally speaking. No one is expecting you to walk in ready to counsel clients or wow a courtroom. Your initial assignments are about answering three questions: Can you research effectively? Can you write effectively? Can you work with others? There will rarely be pressing deadlines on the projects you’ll be handed, so take your time and do it right. Double-check the law, triple-check your cites, and make sure everyone you work with comes away trusting that you’ll eventually give them the right answer. And when you get feedback, listen hard and take it seriously. If we can trust you to listen and follow advice, we know we’ve got someone who can grow into an amazing colleague.

Keep an eye out for real life. I know this will come as a shocker, but being a summer associate is different than practicing as an associate. As a summer associate, you’ll spend as much time socializing as you will reading case law and statutes. In some respects, it’s like summer camp for future lawyers, but with better food and a paycheck. But most of the people you’ll be interacting with will be in the nitty-gritty of the practice. Pay attention to their experiences. Are they getting in early and staying late? Are they firing off and answering emails at 2 a.m.? Try to understand the culture of your firm before you’re asked to live it for yourself.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Do lots of things, but don’t overdo anything. Summer program activities can sometimes be loose, relaxed, casual affairs, but never lose sight of the fact they all function as part of one extended job interview. This isn’t college anymore. Read the room, be mindful of your colleagues, and don’t do anything that’s going to make anyone question whether they want to share a masthead with you. When in doubt, slow your roll and cool yourself off.

Experiment. There will be an expectation when you come back as a first-year attorney to pick a practice and commit to growing in that direction. There is no such expectation right now, which means now is the time for experimentation. Maybe you’ve wanted to be an M&A attorney since preschool, but why not take an assignment in IP if the opportunity comes up? Worst-case scenario, you confirm it’s not for you and get a peek into another practice area that gives you a better understanding of how the legal world works. But sometimes you end up finding an unexpected passion or a surprising mentor who reshapes the entire arc of your legal career. Maximize your opportunities for exploration and serendipity while you can.

I’m still close with many of the people in my summer associate class. These next few months will be an intense experience, and you’ll do best if you’ve got people to go through it with together. As I said at the top, it always comes back to relationships in this business — and you’re about to be gifted some of the most important of your entire career. Take care of your people, and they’ll take care of you too.

You’re only a summer associate once — or maybe twice if you’re fortunate. Make the most of it.

“[The total number of lawyers in the Am Law 100 stayed basically flat, at just below 93,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/)” between 2014 and 2015.

It’s actually worse than that for a fair number of the Am Law 100.  Compare numbers for 2009 and today, and you’ll find many firms whose size has remained constant over the past seven years.

This doesn’t work: Until professional services firms unearth a new business model, they must grow or die.

That’s the whole story.

A partner at a firm that once was small and now is large told me this:

When my firm was small, we made a promise to each associate that we hired: “If you’re good enough, we’ll make you partner.” That was a hard promise to make, because it meant that we’d grow forever. With our business model, we can only make one new partner if we also hire several new associates. We were telling new associates that we’d grow in perpetuity; on reflection, that seems silly.

Now, we’re big. And we’re silent when we hire.

Right.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
So what are law firms doing that aren’t growing?

That’s a particularly pointed question for firms showing no growth in number of lawyers, while simultaneously showing increased profits per partner over the last seven years. What’s up with that?

Let me tell you what’s up.

First, these firms have thrown everyone who was optional out of the equity ranks. If you’re not bringing in very substantial business, then you’re not an equity partner at those firms. You can’t increase PPP without either increasing the numerator (revenue) or decreasing the denominator (number of partners). If you haven’t grown, then you’ve cut the number of equity partners.

That also means you have a lot of unhappy folks working for you — the de-equitized multitude.

Second, these firms are not admitting new equity partners up through the ranks. They may be making new income partners — because income partners don’t count for the American Lawyer numbers — but they’re not sharing the dough with any new folks.

What are those firms telling the new associates they hire?

Damned if I know. But if they’re saying, “if you’re good enough, you’ll make partner,” then they’re lying. Because if the firm hasn’t grown in nearly a decade, then many, many people who were good enough were not being let into the club.

Third, those firms have used every financial trick in the books to inflate their numbers. They’re stopped the pension plan; the employees are contributing more for health care; income has been accelerated; payments delayed; there’s no more that can be done. Times are about to get very tough.

Fourth, they’ve started to squeeze the associates: Starting salaries haven’t been raised at the bottom and have been compressed as you go up through the ranks; bonuses are individualized in some way that doesn’t force the firm to match the market; the firm is silent about the rest. You can’t let the word get out that you’re suffering, so you do what you can to conceal it.

I’ve got some bad news for you: You ain’t seen nothin’ yet.

I’m a client. We now do fixed-fee deals for the majority of our work. And we’re never going back to the old days. Sorry.

We use alternatives to law firms — e-discovery vendors and the like — for much of what used to go to you. And we’re not going back. Sorry.

We’re worried about how secure our information is — and we’re starting to ask you hard questions about how you’re securing our information. That’s going to cost you a fair amount of money, and you can’t pass the cost on to clients.

For all but the most important matters — of which there are too few to feed you all — we’re going to more reasonably priced providers. (A very few law firms truly do the “bet the company” stuff. But there are far more firms competing for that work than there is work to go around.)

None of that is changing.

What’s the future of your firm in a world like that?

I don’t know what you’ll tell associates you’re hiring this year — youngsters hoping for partnership ten years hence — about your commitment to them. But I hope it’s honest, and it fairly reflects your vision of the future.

In this episode, I speak with Donna Edbril, a Certified Leadership Coach, about how she helps female lawyers find the balance between their personal lives and working in a law firm. Donna also shares her transition from starting out in law school and working in different companies to being a career coach. She also runs down the different advice she can give to people who are finding it difficult to set boundaries and the proven methods for them to take control of their career paths.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

# New Filing Alleges Simpson Thacher Attorneys Were Aware Of Client Aiding And Abetting Terrorists
## Firm's representation of Ericsson during period of misconduct raises questions.

New allegations in an ongoing case against Swedish telecommunication giant Ericsson suggest Simpson Thacher attorneys were aware that the multinational company made illegal payments to terrorist organizations.

The suit, filed in August on behalf of American service members and civilians killed or wounded by al-Qaeda, al-Qaeda-in-Iraq, and Islamic State, claims that Ericsson agreed to pay protection money to these groups in order to maintain its business prospects in Iraq and Afghanistan, despite knowing that these payments funded terrorist activity. Beyond the payments, Ericsson also allegedly facilitated the “direct transfer of high-tech, U.S. military-grade, U.S. origin communications technologies” to terrorist groups. And this all happened over the course of at least 15 years.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Earlier this week, the plaintiffs through their attorneys at [Sparacino PLLC](https://sparacinopllc.com/) filed a 779-page Amended Complaint alleging that Simpson Thacher was aware of these practices by 2014 — at least five years before they ceased — and helped the company as a “reputation launderer” by virtue of its standing in the legal community. There’s a bit of alphabet-soup with different Ericsson entities allegedly acquiring knowledge of the scheme at different times, but there are paragraphs like this one:

On information and belief, Ericsson AB also directly retained Simpson Thacher and/or Ericsson AB assented to the retention of Simpson Thacher on Ericsson AB’s behalf by LM Ericsson. When Ericsson AB did so, Ericsson AB had the specific intent that Simpson Thacher deflect any United States government scrutiny concerning Ericsson’s illicit payments in Iraq, including those relating to al-Qaeda, al-Qaeda-in-Iraq, and Islamic State. Infra at Part V. Ericsson AB and Simpson Thacher agreed as to that course of conduct, and thereafter successfully obstructed the United States government’s counterterrorism operations. This conduct was a but-for cause of Defendants’ protection payments in Iraq by no later than 2014, when Ericsson AB, on information and belief, retained Simpson Thacher alongside LM Ericsson or, alternatively, assented to LM Ericsson’s retention of Simpson Thacher on behalf of Ericsson AB. Ericsson AB and Simpson Thacher were aware of Defendants’ payments to al-Qaeda, al- Qaeda-in-Iraq, and Islamic State, Ericsson AB and Simpson Thacher both knew such payments were illegal and foreseeably aided acts of terrorism against Americans, and both Ericsson AB and Simpson Thacher both affirmatively chose to conceal such information from the United States government even though Ericsson AB and Simpson Thacher both had an affirmative duty of disclosure given Ericsson AB’s assertion that Ericsson was fully cooperating with the then- existing U.S. government investigation of Ericsson.

The “U.S. government investigation” resulted in the Department of Justice entering a deferred prosecution agreement with Ericsson and the company [agreeing to pay $1 billion for multiple FCPA violations](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/ericsson-agrees-pay-over-1-billion-resolve-fcpa-case) involving bribes to officials around the world, but pointedly not the terrorist organizations involved here. Simpson conducted the internal investigation in conjunction with the DOJ inquiry and finalized its report after the DPA was signed.

That report [leaked to reporters in February](https://www.icij.org/investigations/ericsson-list/ericsson-leak-isis-iraq-corruption/) and it kinda sorta mentioned the whole “paying off terrorists” stuff. Though, as the Amended Complaint puts it, “Many of the ‘findings’ were written in the passive voice to obfuscate the culpability of particular Ericsson personnel. Other findings were obvious examples of Simpson Thacher pulling punches.”

As one might imagine, the DOJ had some additional concerns at that point.

DOJ has publicly taken the position that LM Ericsson breached its ongoing obligations to the U.S. government under the DPA by having concealed the existence of that investigation and the findings set forth therein (representing the second time in roughly two years DOJ has accused LM Ericsson of breaching the DPA).

That’s all… well, that’s all not good. If the firm learned of the conduct after the fact and helped Ericsson keep it from the government it’s bad and if the firm had any knowledge of these payments before they stopped it’s way, way worse.

We reached out to Simpson for comment yesterday but have not heard back. We’ll update this story if we do. You can read the full Amended Complaint on the next page.

# Are The Stories About Your Law Firm Worth Telling?
## Recent events at Boies Schiller highlight the fragility of firms and the importance of culture.

International powerhouse Boies Schiller has had a humbling year. The firm had over 350 attorneys at its peak but has seen dozens — including about 60 partners — leave over the past few months. One of those partners, Natasha Harrison, was the heir-apparent to the firm’s leadership. Much of the exodus has been [blamed on a series of PR-nightmare representations](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/10/boies-schiller-loses-lawyers-over-controversies-involving-theranos-harvey-weinstein.html) on the part of founding partner David Boies himself, including his controversial representations of Harvey Weinstein and convicted fraudster Elizabeth Holmes.

But while those business-related problems have been known for many months, Business Insider [published a report this week](https://www.businessinsider.com/boies-schiller-flexner-llp-nepotism-bullying-allegations-2022-1) on the alleged extensive damage done to the firm’s internal culture. The allegations primarily relate to Boies Schiller’s second-in-command, Jonathan Schiller, but they point to a wide variety of morale-killing behavior.

The report details Schiller allegedly bullying associates and even other senior partners. Sources report multiple stories of him demeaning others within the firm, including several that drove attorneys to cry publicly. Schiller is also claimed to have embarrassed other partners in front of colleagues and clients, especially in his terse and potentially unprofessional emails.

It’s Not Just Gossip

I can already hear some attorneys writing off this reporting as tawdry gossip being shared by disaffected former employees. To some, the only factors that truly matter in a legal practice are the cases argued, deals done, clients generated, and invoices paid. To these people, a partner sticking their foot in their mouth or hurting a junior associate’s feelings doesn’t really affect a firm’s bottom line and so doesn’t merit the attention being paid.

I’m here to argue that this mindset is not only wrong, it’s actively damaging. We can’t discount conduct that negatively impacts people’s emotions, as opposed to the dollars and cents of the firm.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
A firm’s culture is established by what it does consistently. Every time a senior attorney is permitted to treat a junior attorney unprofessionally without consequences, it reinforces a culture of bullying. Every time decision-makers or those close to them are held to a different standard than others, it reinforces a culture of cliques, politics, and unfairness. The people who work in law firms tend to be smart and observant, and they tend to talk to one another. They hear when people are being treated poorly, and they’re going to figure out quickly whether they can expect to be treated the same way and whether firm management will have their backs if and when that happens.

If the published stories are to be believed, the current exodus from Boies Schiller is proof that culture matters. A firm that holds everyone to a standard of decency and kindness, from senior management on down, can weather the occasional misstep. Even the most kind and patient of us can have an off day where we snip at people. I’m sure we’ve all unintentionally hurt a coworker’s feelings at some point, as well.

Email in particular is a minefield for many, with how difficult it can be to convey tone. What might seem to the sender like a straightforward statement or a lighthearted jest can be received as a devastating critique or cutting insult. In places where we can trust one another to be kind and respectful, it’s easier to have constructive conversations or to grant one another the benefit of the doubt.

In places where team members can’t count on being respected, though, those intended or unintended slights can send people looking for the door.

Cultural Poison

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Reading between the lines of the Boies Schiller departures, some of them were unrelated to the juicy headlines coming out of the firm. Some attorneys openly left for better compensation packages at other jobs. Some were dissatisfied with firm management’s lack of transparency in its process. These are perfectly normal reasons for attrition, ones that even the most functional and culturally healthy firms deal with from time to time. The best of firms still won’t be a good fit for everybody. Some attorneys are more comfortable in firms that operate as open-book democracies, while others prefer to have a benign dictator handle decision-making while they focus on growing their practice. Some attorneys adore eat-what-you-kill objective comp systems, while others prefer softer, fuzzier approaches that better value nonmonetary contributions.

None of those realities matters when your firm is the subject of torrents of negative news stories. Boies Schiller may have reasonable explanations for some of its attrition. But that’s getting drowned out entirely by the mistakes, the unforced errors, and the disregard for a healthy firm culture evident in the stories making headlines. I have no firsthand knowledge about the veracity of any of these allegations. But even if you want to say those stories are overblown or just people being “overly sensitive,” it’s hard to deny that they’ve had a real impact in driving off attorneys who otherwise could have made that firm stronger. These cultural harms can devastate a firm’s bottom line and unnecessarily hurt the lives of those working there.

At its core, a firm is little more than a group of people who have agreed to work side by side. Humans are, and always will be, storytellers. Make sure the stories being told about you and your people are worth telling.

# The Great Law Firm Reopening Tracker: 2022 Returns To Office And Vaccination Mandates Abound
## The latest updates on how law firms are adjusting to the new normal.

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted virtually every facet of life. The times we live in are now uncertain, and nothing will ever be the same as it was before. Lawyers and legal professionals have been cloistered inside their homes for more than a year, and now that vaccinations are widely available, states across the country have reopened their economies, lifted their shelter-in-place guidance, and removed their mask mandates. But thanks to the Delta variant, masks are now making a comeback, even for the vaccinated.

[Ed. note: This was last updated on October 25, 2021.]

With all this taking place, major law firms — many fresh off a second round of [special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/special-bonus-tracker-2021/) and [salary increases](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/salary-wars-scorecard-tracker-2021/) to keep their attorneys as happy as possible — have been weighing their plans to get their employees back into the office. The rise of Delta, however, has now made some firms reconsider their reopening protocols.

As firms try to establish a market standard for what their return will look like, it should be noted that associates overwhelmingly support their firms’ remote work policies, and hope that a full-time office presence will no longer be necessary going forward — especially now, in light of surging cases thanks to Delta.

Just as we’ve done in the past when it comes to raises, bonuses, and austerity measures, we are compiling a table of all the firms that have announced reopening guidelines in these strange times. We want you to see exactly how the legal profession is dealing with this new phase of the coronavirus crisis.

Help us help you. Let us know what your firm is doing to protect employees and adjust to the new normal during this unprecedented moment in time.

[UPDATE: One of the authors responded and it’s… GLORIOUS! Appended at the bottom.]

The Wall Street Journal editorial page followed up its piece about how there was [probably no 10-year-old rape victim who needed an abortion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-abortion-story-too-good-to-confirm-joe-biden-ten-year-old-girl-indiana-ohio-caitlin-bernard-11657648618) — an op-ed editorial [fundamentally debunked within hours](https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/2022/07/13/columbus-man-charged-rape-10-year-old-led-abortion-in-indiana/10046625002/) — by digging deep to find a couple of guys willing to offer the scorching hot take that [Twitter will lose actually](https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitters-lawsuit-against-elon-musk-looks-like-a-loser-11657716142/), thus capping off the wrongest week in the history of the wrongest op-ed editorial page. [UPDATE: I was playing fast and loose with the term op-ed. The former was an editorial.]

Nobody seriously thinks Twitter is in trouble here. Business professor Scott Galloway went so far as to call the merger agreement “[hermetically sealed, it’s so airtight](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2022/07/14/nightcap-twitter-elon-musk-clip-orig.cnn).” Musk’s very capable lawyers will spend the litigation on the defensive. They might “win” to the extent they force Twitter to walk away with less than Twitter wants, but that’s not this op-ed — this op-ed asserts that Musk wins outright.

It’s like the lawyerly version of the worst hot take sports show.

Many observers think the company will prevail, or that Mr. Musk is likely at least to pay the $1 billion breakup fee.

[We do!](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/twitter-complaint-demonstrates-that-every-lawyer-everywhere-always-is-smarter-than-elon-musk/)

They’re wrong. He is likely to walk away largely unscathed, a belief reflected in Twitter’s stock price. This case will be a good lesson on the limits of boilerplate merger agreements and the difference between a corporation and its shareholders.

This is still the first paragraph of this thing and it’s already a joke. This case tests “the limits of boilerplate merger agreements” the same way the Super Bowl tests the NL adopting the designated hitter — this wasn’t a boilerplate merger agreement. Twitter didn’t send over LegalZoom’s “Standard $43 Billion Merger Agreement” for Elon Musk to sign like the naive babe in the woods that only the richest man in the world could be. This is an agreement between two sophisticated entities, at arms length, represented by elite counsel AND elite banks who all hammered it out throughout the night. This is as bespoke as bespoke agreements get in this world. A fact we know because…

Specific performance is used fleetingly, and for good reason. It is the ultimate act of coercion, and it makes sense only when there is no alternative. If one agrees to sell Hearst Castle, but tries to back out when a higher bid emerges, a court may specifically enforce the contract. There is only one Hearst Castle, and no other remedy can make the jilted buyer whole.

See, another reason specific performance is “used fleetingly” is that while it’s always a remedy available to courts, it’s not generally something people contract for. The painter in this example said, “I’ll paint the castle” not “I’ll paint the castle and if I don’t I agree that I will not object when the court orders me to paint the castle.” That second one is the bit Musk agreed to. At a certain point, when a billionaire and Skadden and Morgan Stanley all agree to an unusually explicit provision, that’s on them. And, again, this is why we know it’s not “boilerplate.”

It’s also completely wrong about Delaware even if this provision wasn’t in the contract. For this, we look to [Bloomberg’s Matt Levine](https://twitter.com/matt_levine/status/1547257915463159809?s=20&t=jDp4U7WC1lSyZzIkwPeBQA):

Honestly, these cases [are so simple to find](https://www.morrisjames.com/assets/htmldocuments/Snow%20Phipps%20Grp.%20LLC%20v.%20KCake%20Acquisition%20Inc.%202020-0282-KSJM%20.pdf). So these yahoos didn’t bother to perform even cursory research on Delaware law before spouting off?

Don’t worry… it’s going to be a trend in their article!

The authors also conjure up a convoluted theory how, assuming the court can’t order specific performance (it could), there’s no alternative remedy because making Musk pay the costs incurred by the merger he’s not performing won’t work because the shareholders aren’t a party to the lawsuit.

Twitter could have raised the stakes for Mr. Musk by including a requirement that he pay damages to its shareholders if he walked away. In that case, the shareholders could have sued for the difference between the amount Mr. Musk agreed to pay and the price any other suitor would pay—like the homeowner finding another painter. But the merger agreement doesn’t give shareholders this remedy.

Um… no:



You can read up on [that Hexion case here](https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/news-insights/hexion-v-huntsman-delaware-court-of-chancery-interprets-material.html) but the crux of it is this:

Although the court did not order specific performance of Hexion’s obligation to actually consummate the merger, it required Hexion to specifically perform its covenants related to financing and antitrust compliance and ruled that, if Hexion should fail to close, Huntsman’s potential damages would not be limited to the break-up fee.

Screwing up the finer points of Delaware law is one thing, but then they swing for the fences and try to get Elon out of everything and… wow:

The issue of the $1 billion breakup fee remains. Courts will be much more likely to make Musk pay to walk away than force him to walk down the aisle. But it isn’t clear he will have to pay that much. Breakup fees are supposed to reflect damages caused by a breach of contract. They aren’t supposed to act as a penalty. Given that Twitter isn’t obviously worse off by $1 billion—if at all—a court might balk at imposing such a high fee.

No. No no no no no. Contract agreements like these aren’t “meant to reflect” jack. Musk said “I’ll give you $1B unless there’s a material adverse effect,” not “I’ll give you $1B (or some smaller number if we don’t really think it’s worth $1B).” Delaware does impose some constraints on breakup fees, but generally they’re accepted as negotiated unless they’re upwards of 5 percent or more of the total deal. Since this fee is about TWO percent of the total deal, it falls below the 3 to 4 percent window that [Delaware routinely upholds](https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2015/05/07/omelveny-myers-discusses-break-up-fees-in-delaware-a-delicate-balance-for-all-parties-involved/).

So, to quickly recap, Musk will win if the agreement is boilerplate (it’s not), Delaware refuses to grant specific performance (it doesn’t), courts can’t issue monetary damages unless shareholders are a party (untrue), and the breakup fee is unreasonable under the law (it’s not).

Who did the Wall Street Journal even find to put this out here?

Mr. Heaton is managing member of an investment research firm. Mr. Henderson is a law professor at the University of Chicago. They are co-founders of Heaton Henderson LLC, a corporate governance consultancy.

Ah. J.B. Heaton is best known around these parts for a study where he tried to rank law schools by the quality of their overall team of scholars. [It was really fun](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/10/new-law-school-rankings-place-nyu-in-top-spot/) though didn’t say much about Delaware law expertise. Meanwhile, third-rate intellect Todd Henderson is just adding this string of nonsense to his existing legal hits like when [he called Sonia Sotomayor dumb](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/dumb-law-school-professor-calls-supreme-court-justice-dumb/) or [whined about the sad marginalization of a student group](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/crybaby-law-professor-quits-twitter-in-a-huff-over-uchicago-immigration-slur-debacle/) calling immigrants “[toilet people](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/you-should-absolutely-read-this-insane-law-school-event-promo-calling-immigrants-toilet-people/).”

One thing you’ve got to hand to Musk is that he’s swung conservative outlets like the Wall Street Journal behind a solar power and electric car mogul so hard that they’ll bend over backward to stan for him and all he had to do is say that he wants racists back on social media.

Unfortunately, that one savvy marketing move probably isn’t enough to get out of this contract.

[UPDATE: J.B. Heaton just emailed and it’s straight up high comedy.

Go find a friend who can do math and ask them to divide 37.54 by 54.20 and then go find someone who knows probability and ask them to explain to you what the answer means about the quality of our analysis versus yours. While doing so, ask Scott Galloway where he got his law degree and ask Matt Levine the last time he stepped into a courtroom.

Best wishes douche bag

Note, of course, that this math problem (0.6926 btw) is still completely irrelevant as a matter of law. But we need to use that… to find probability… and compare it to a business professor’s law degree or something? Or Matt Levine’s… courtroom experience? He’s a M&A lawyer and I-Banker so… he doesn’t go to courts? Look, I promise not to try to figure out what these doofuses are saying anymore.

But this is whole exchange is a pretty good breakdown of how serious they are. No citations to Delaware law or mention of the terms of the contract, just “DERP! MATH-ISH!

UPDATE 2: It gets better. After I told him this response was “hilarious” and thanked him he sent this:

Post away! I generally disagree with Todd about the pervasiveness of inferior intellects, but your – is it a blog post? – work is pushing me in his direction!
Yeah it IS crazy right? That the rest of us do “research” before we someone publishes it? Just wild.]

[[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/opinion/in-defense-of-the-country-lawyer.html)] * Per a new study from the American Bar Association, the sky is blue and women and minorities continue to face racial and gender bias within the legal profession.

[[Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/138eb3ae-b1c4-11e8-8d14-6f049d06439c)] * It seems that the Justice Department no longer thinks that employers should be forced to consider job applicants with criminal histories, going against Obama-era guidance that the EEOC has been following since 2012.

# How Many Biglaw Associates Will Lose Their Jobs Because Of AI?
## Of course Biglaw associates won't lose their jobs to generative AI -- at least not all of them.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

If you’re able to eliminate so much of the routine work, and a Big Law lawyer is now called upon for the more interesting advisory work, I can envisage we will see a reshaping of the leverage model, even if the size of law firms remains similar to where it is now.

— Gretta Rusanow, managing director and head of advisory services at Citi Private Bank Law Firm Group, in comments given to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/will-ai-steal-associate-jobs-or-have-them-saying-domo-arigato) on the rise of generative AI and how it will change law firm leverage. As AI takes on more basic tasks, she said, the number of entry-level lawyers will likely decrease while the number of more senior lawyers will increase, so that they can offer “strategic advice.”

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs.
