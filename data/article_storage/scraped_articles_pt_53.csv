# Partners May Be Able To Find Lateral Safety At Other Firms If Stroock Closes Its Doors
## Maybe even at firms that were discussing merging with Stroock....

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

I think there are several firms that have built relationships with people at firms that have an uncertain future. In a long-term effort, that can really pay off. Usually, the message sent to people at the firm is if anything changes and you decide to do something else, we want to talk to you. We have seen that happen at other firms.

— Kent Zimmermann, strategic consultant at Zeughauser Group who specializes in mergers, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/10/27/over-30-stroock-partners-to-join-hogan-lovells-as-ny-firms-prospects-appear-bleak/), on how partners at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan may be able to find a new home if things take a turn for the worse. The firm’s future is already looking quite bleak, thanks to a [mass lateral move of partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/the-end-may-be-near-as-stroock-loses-more-than-half-its-partners-to-hogan-lovells/) to Hogan Lovells following its latest [failed merger efforts](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/yet-another-firm-ends-merger-talks-with-stroock/).

# 'The Jig Is Up' -- Opening Up Jones Day's Black Box
## This is why there are so many disappointed associates at Jones Day.

Last week we asked you for more information about Jones Day’s compensation system, and boy, did you respond. See, JD doesn’t make it easy for associates to know how well they are being compensated, comparatively. The firm gives first year associates standard base salaries, dependent on their office, and after that, predictability goes out the window.

There is no official scale for older associates as the system is [“closed comp”](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/09/jones-day-secrecy-breeds-strength/) or [“black box,”](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/08/inside-straight-analyzing-black-box-compensation/) meaning that nobody knows what anyone else makes. Attorneys, both at the associate and partner level, are just supposed to live with the secrecy. Talking about your comp with colleagues is a violation of firm policy, the firm claims this promotes collegiality and teamwork by eliminating complaints over pay so lawyers can focus on their work and client service. Which sounds nice in theory, but, as we’ve seen, also breeds a lot of frustration.

Another key difference to the JD model: The firm doesn’t pay year-end or midyear bonuses; you get just your base salary. Mid-year, you’re notified of what your base salary will be for the coming year, which, allegedly should be above market to reflect the lack of bonuses, but not so much the reality for associates on the ground. The new salary goes into effect on July 1 and then the following June you get your next pay raise letter, starting the cycle anew.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
[Our call to open up JD’s black box](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/jones-day-finally-raises-help-us-open-up-its-black-box-of-compensation/?rf=1) was taken very well by associates, and we learned some interesting things in the process. First of all, associates at JD are desperate for information. The number and enthusiasm of responses we received was beyond compare. We also learned that no one is happy with compensation. Not a single associate wrote to us to tell us they thought the unique compensation structure at JD was beneficial in any way, and all of our tipsters are uniform in feeling they are getting less than the going market rate, once typical bonuses were factored in.

Between the black box, the confidentiality mandate, the “bonuses folded into the base salary” structure, and the midyear pay increases, the JD system seems to have been designed to avoid all transparency or scrutiny — which is obviously convenient for the firm, less convenient for the associates that work there. Also, a mantra of the firm has consistently been that some poorly performing associates make below market, some all-stars make above market, but that on average, JD pays market…. I am not sure how that could possibly be true.

Also, no one joins a firm thinking they’ll be the low performing associate. Most Biglaw types head into work assuming they’ll be the associate to make top dollar, but that is simply not the case for the majority of associates.

My comp for the year is the same as the new base cravath scale (not including the bonus), so I’m earning roughly 65k under market. [With] very strong performance reviews.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
See, even with great reviews, chances are still pretty good you’ll be making below market.

Every associate that I have spoken with or heard about is incredibly frustrated and upset. Because the salary gap is now so large, associates have already indicated that they were going to put out feelers for other jobs. If management does not act or at least address the situation soon, I am concerned that there may be an exodus of associates in the coming months, which would be incredibly demoralizing and hurt future recruiting.

When folks are working hours that would net them significantly more money at another firm, it is hard to disagree with associates looking for [new opportunities](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/elite-firms-need-to-increase-compensation-recruiters-smell-blood-in-the-water/).

[W]hen I joined Jones Day, I had no idea I would be so undercompensated and, more importantly, so unappreciated by the firm. We also have no great options for voicing our concerns. We have no associates committee, and the salary letter directs us to the Partner in Charge of the office.

And I’ll note again like other tipsters that Jones Day seems to be trying to peg salaries to the July 1 class year, thinking we will forget in 6 months that everyone else in our class year gets another bump PLUS a bonus. Finally, I note that some outliers are getting above this, sometimes equalling or surpassing those in the previous year (e.g., a class of 2014 grad getting near 210k), or even some way below this (e.g., class of 2012 grad getting near 210k). But even those high-end salaries are below market, and only happen to 1-2 people per class year.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The pay is honestly very low for most people and the way the firm has handled the Cravath bump is embarrassing. Many of us feel like the recruiting line about bonuses being folded in is not at all reflective of reality, which is completely unfair to recruits and us. Some people are well compensated, but even people who are ok with their bump are usually well below actual market.

I can confirm that we are essentially paid a salary-at best-slightly above base market in any given year, but not inclusive of any market bonus. I have consistently hit hours levels that at any “peer” firm would have earned me top market bonus, and have consistently earned approximately $15,000-50,000 less in any calendar year than I would have if I worked elsewhere.

See, I told you that the associates we heard from were not happy with the recent raises. Without getting bonuses, because they are supposed to be folded into the base number, they wind up well below their Biglaw peers.

JD has tried its best to trick associates into thinking we are being paid by market by (1) giving raises in July instead of in January, and (2) allegedly rolling bonuses into base compensation, but the jig is up.

I was reluctant to write in because who wants to discourage good people from coming to your firm, but enough is enough. Please warn recruits, if you come to Jones Day, DO NOT expect to be paid a market salary when bonuses are factored in. If you bill over 2000 and you have good reviews, your base pay will likely be at or above market, but NO ONE I have talked to is getting paid enough to compensate them for the market bonuses.

That’s the other disturbing trend we are hearing from tipsters, they feel their compensation reality is very different than what they were promised when they interviewed. As with [other firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/no-you-are-not-matching-the-market-1st-years-to-180k-doesnt-tell-the-whole-story/) that try to hide the ball regarding mid-level and senior associate compensation, it is incredibly important for potential hires (in law school or as laterals) to do as much due diligence as possible so they don’t wind up with an unhappy surprise a few years down the road.

Towards that end, we have compiled the compensation data we have received. In order to protect the identity of the tipsters, we’ve omitted the specific office location, but included whether first year associates were on the $180,000 or $160,000 base. We’ve also included a general description of the hours these associates worked, where we have the information, to provide more context for the salary numbers. Remember, these are the “all in” numbers, supposedly designed to fold in the market bonuses associates at other firms will receive come the end of the year.


As you can see, very few of these numbers outright break the [Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/?rf=1) for a given year, and when you factor in bonus season, well, you start to understand why there are so many disappointed associates at Jones Day.

# Clarence Thomas: The Convenient Textualist
## Who reads all of the statute anyway?

The ethical hits just keep coming for Clarence Thomas as a second story about the [gifts he collected from Harlan Crow](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/paragon-of-virtue-clarence-thomas-has-been-given-millions-of-dollars-in-value-off-the-record-and-it-totally-hasnt-impacted-his-judging-not-one-bit-nope/) expanded to include [buying and maintaining a house for Thomas’s mom](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/appearance-of-bribery-political-megadonor-wants-us-to-believe-he-bought-and-improved-justices-moms-house-off-the-record-because-of-history-or-something/). Rent free, of course. Thomas [doesn’t have a particularly good excuse](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/clarence-thomass-piss-ass-excuse-for-not-disclosing-megadonor-real-estate-sale/) for not disclosing this since the text of the disclosure requirements are pretty clear. I guess holding people to the text of the laws they break only matters for poor people facing life in prison whose lawyers sleep through trial. We also discuss a new spate of layoffs and why we still feel cautiously optimistic about the second half of the year and the decision by U.S. News [to delay its law school rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/u-s-news-delays-release-of-much-anticipated-law-school-rankings/).

# Cravath May Be A Compensation Leader, But It's A Follower When It Comes To Office Return Plans
## Some associates are very unhappy about this plan.

Biglaw firms are still trying to get associates to return to the office in an orderly fashion in our “post”-pandemic world. At this point, it looks like the [“Kirkland model”](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/associates-can-expect-to-be-in-the-office-3-days-each-week-if-the-kirkland-model-catches-on/) (i.e., in-office work for [three days each week](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/kirkland-sends-announcement-to-salary-hungry-associates-about-office-return-date/)) seems to have taken hold among elite firms.

But what about Cravath? What’s going on at the firm that just brought a compensation reckoning to Biglaw, with its $215,000 to $415,000 salary scale?

The firm recently rolled out a plan that seems eminently reasonable. Here’s an excerpt from a memo sent by Faiza Saeed, Cravath’s presiding partner (emphasis added; full memo available on the next page):

After several false starts, our return feels more promising this time, though we know the right cadence will be a work in progress. It will be rejuvenating to recapture some of the routine and togetherness we have missed, while we also embrace the flexibility that makes us more balanced and productive. Beginning Monday, March 21, we ask everyone to be in the office at least two workdays per week. After the spring holidays, as of Monday, April 25, we’ll move to three weekdays per week.

Just like Kirkland, Cravath will eventually require associates to work from the office three days each week, but at least they’re offering a ramping up period. Some associates, however, say these plans are “needlessly premature” and that they’re being “forced to return to a broken, archaic system for optics.”

“It is a monumental missed opportunity that is putting undue stress on so many still dealing with COVID,” said one source from the firm.

Cravath associates crave more than just money; they want better work-life balance opportunities, too. Some firms — like Quinn Emanuel, for example — have offered [indefinite remote work options](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/quinn-emanuel-will-allow-lawyers-to-work-remotely-indefinitely-from-anywhere-in-the-country/) for attorneys, but we’re not sure that Cravath is offering possibilities like this to its associates as part of its flexible remote work plans. For now, it looks like if associates want their Cravath cash, they’ll need to work at the office a few days each week to get it.

# Newly Merged Megafirm Slashes Partner Pay To Be 'Prudent' During Pandemic

If you thought working at a Biglaw firm during a pandemic was difficult because it’s forced the majority of the office into a work-from-home environment, imagine working at a Biglaw megafirm that merged just weeks before the crisis began. It’s an uncertain time for everyone, but there’s even more uncertainty when a newly combined firm is just starting to get its footing when disaster strikes.

This is what’s happening at Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath, the firm that was formed after Faegre Baker Daniels finalized its merger with Drinker Biddle & Reath on February 1. If you recall, the prospective Am Law 50 firm with more than 1,300 lawyers was one of the very first to [close its doors over coronavirus concerns](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/faegre-drinker-worldwide-office-closure-coronavirus/).

How is Faegre Drinker proceeding amid all of the salary cuts, furloughs, and layoffs that have come about at peer firms due to the global health crisis? The firm’s partners are [reportedly](https://www.law.com/2020/04/14/coping-with-post-merger-pandemic-faegre-drinker-trims-partner-pay-proceeds-with-integration/) taking a rather “sizable” hit for the team:

Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath has deferred its equity partner distributions by one-third for the second quarter in an effort to be “prudent and conservative” during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the firm said.

It is also monitoring the expenses generated by its workforce of more than 1,300 lawyers, consultants and professionals located across 22 offices, said co-chairs Andrew Kassner and Tom Froehle.

“It’s inevitable if it impacts our clients, it’ll impact the law firms. Everything has to be on the table as we plan going forward over the second quarter and third quarter and beyond,” Kassner said. He initially described it as being a cut in partner distributions, but then emphasized the firm was deferring those distributions: “It’s just a deferral. It’s all a matter of timing.”

Best of luck to Faegre Drinker in the months ahead. It sounds like the firm is doing right by its employees, which will hopefully lead to its success in the future.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# The Real Reason Cravath Raised Salaries
## Some brutal honesty from the folks at the top.

When the [salary extravaganza of 2016](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) kicked off, there was a good deal of speculation about Cravath’s motivations.

Was this an effort by Cravath to distance itself — and its coterie of peer firms — from the rest of the pack in the race to recruit the best and brightest law school graduates? Well, if it was, it failed miserably, as every firm from Midtown [to Bumblef**k](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/) matched Cravath.

Perhaps this was just an earnest effort to [respond to associate concerns](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-5-arguments-in-favor-of-a-biglaw-pay-hike/) about rising law school debt and health care costs?

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In a sense, all of these theories contributed to Cravath’s blockbuster announcement, but the most earnest phrasing comes from an unnamed senior Cravath partner:

We wanted associates to be able to live near the office, and they weren’t able to do that [at the $160K scale].

There’s your realpolitik, folks. You can say this move helped defray the financial burdens that associates face — which it did — but in the end, it’s about guaranteeing that an associate isn’t decamping to frigging Brooklyn every night like a Prole.

When we ping you to come down to our office at 3:30 a.m., we expect you there at 3:45!

Last night, Donald Trump [addressed](https://twitter.com/PaulIngrassia/status/1672101838173208576?s=20) a [group](https://www.patriotfreedomproject.com/) calling itself “Patriot Freedom Project” at his private club in Bedminster, New Jersey. The event was a fundraiser for January 6 defendants, whom Trump has often promised to pardon.

It was a typically rambling speech which began with a description of Portland, Oregon as a post-apocalyptic hellscape, before segueing into a denunciation of the “Biden crime family.” He then moved on to praise the brave Americans who descended on the Capitol to block the electoral certification, while simultaneously claiming that “BLM and Antifa” were responsible for much of the violence. And that was only in the first three minutes.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Then he started in on all the lawyers who are dying to come and work for him.

At Bedminster last night, Trump says some of the best lawyers and law firms in the country contacted him offering their help but he told them he didn’t need it. [pic.twitter.com/63UkRZVqog](https://t.co/63UkRZVqog)

— Ron Filipkowski (@RonFilipkowski) [June 23, 2023](https://twitter.com/RonFilipkowski/status/1672197637485867008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

They all come, and they all want to help. The biggest people. Some of the biggest people, the biggest law firms, the biggest lawyers, I say, “Listen, I don’t need any help. I don’t need any help in campaigns. We have so many people that are going to vote for us. I want you to guard the vote.”

It’s not entirely clear whether Trump was referring lawyers working for him in a personal capacity, or those working for his campaign. Indeed he seems to see very little difference between the two, and in the White House demanded that the Attorney General behave as his personal defender. He [reportedly](https://www.npr.org/2023/06/17/1182758035/donald-trump-lawyer-roy-cohn) complained, “Where’s my Roy Cohn?” when he thought government attorneys weren’t behaving enough like his legendary personal fixer.

In either interpretation, Trump’s account bears all the hallmarks of a classic [“sir story”](https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/16/politics/sir-trump-telltale-word-false/index.html) — i.e. it’s total bullshit.

Trump is the world’s worst client. In the best case scenario, he ignores his lawyers’ advice, gets himself indicted and/or sued because he can’t shut the hell up, and then fires them. In the worst case scenario, he does all of the above, but then makes them a target of his lunatic supporters, as he did last week, [calling](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/110527097618810290) former attorney general Bill Barr “a ‘disgruntled former employee’ & lazy Attorney General who was weak & totally ineffective” and a “Gutless Pig.”

Gone are the days when he could order up a squad of attorneys from Kirkland & Ellis or Jones Day, and not just because he has a terrible reputation for stiffing his clients.  As his former attorney Timothy Parlatore [acknowledged](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/06/16/federal-prosecutors-trump-indictment-parlatore-00102371) in a recent interview with Politico, the “biggest law firms” won’t get near Trump because of the reputational cost of being associated with a guy who fomented an insurrection and makes fun of rape victims.

Chris Kise, the former Florida Solicitor General, [got paid $3 million](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/15/trumps-save-america-paid-3-million-to-cover-top-lawyers-legal-work-00056968) by Trump’s PAC to leave Hogan & Lovells, because he could work for Trump or he could stay in biglaw — but he couldn’t do both. Similarly, Todd Blanche had to [resign](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/03/trump-todd-blanche-indictment-attorney-00090157) from Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft before he could represent the former president in his criminal indictments.

Meanwhile, Trump is having a hell of a time finding a criminal lawyer barred in Florida to take his case. As [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/13/trump-finds-no-new-lawyers-mar-a-lago-documents-arraignment) reports, Kise and Blanche spent last weekend interviewing candidates, with one prominent lawyer pulling out after his partners nixed it.

And the record is scarcely better for Trump’s campaign counsel. Cleta Mitchell’s partners at Foley & Lardner [pushed her out](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/cleta-mitchell-out-at-foley-lardner-after-troubling-donald-trump-call/) approximately five seconds after it emerged that she’d been freelancing for Trump’s campaign, including sitting in on the phone call pressuring Georgia Secretary of Stat Brad Raffensperger to “find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have.” Multiple attorneys, including [Jenna Ellis](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/trump-lawyer-jenna-ellis-declares-flawless-victory-after-stipulation-of-misconduct-in-co-bar-complaint/) and [Sidney Powell](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/sidney-powell-avoids-disbarment-as-judge-refuses-to-consider-misnumbered-exhibits-seriously/), have faced bar complaints for their involvement with the Trump campaign’s efforts to overturn the election. John Eastman, who “[retired](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/law-school-splits-with-trump-insurrection-rally-professor/)” from his position at Chapman University’s law school when his role in the electoral coup plot was revealed, is at this very moment defending his bar license in a California courtroom. And no tale is more cautionary than that of Rudy Giuliani.

But if there is a runner up, it is perhaps Jeff [“We’ll Call You If There’s an Oil Spill”](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/jeffrey-clark-is-the-oil-spill/) Clark, the onetime Kirland partner who had his phone seized by the FBI after trying to get the Justice Department embroiled in an effort to overturn the election. Like Cleta Mitchell, he’s landed a plum spot on the [wingnut welfare gravy train](https://americarenewing.com/about/), although his main job appears to be [ranting inanities](https://twitter.com/JeffClarkUS) on Twitter.

And, hey wouldn’t you know, Clark was in attendance last night for Trump’s speech in New Jersey. Not as an object lesson for what can happen when lawyers break bad, and presumably not as counsel for Trump. Clark was, in fact, one of the other speakers at the fundraiser.

These jokes write themselves.

# Courts Should More Often Admit When They Are At Fault
## Judges and court staff are extremely hesitant to admit fault and often lay blame on attorneys and others for issues caused by courts, perhaps as a way to protect the image of the judiciary.

As many readers of this website already know from firsthand experience, lawyers and law firms are not perfect, and mistakes often occur in the practice of law. Law office failure is fairly commonplace, and missed deadlines, failure to calendar events, and other issues often arise in legal practice because lawyers and staff are human and may make errors. Judges and court staff may also make mistakes since court bureaucracies may miss things and human error can occur in the judiciary. However, far too often, courts blame attorneys for issues that are the fault of courts, and judicial officers should more often admit fault when they are to blame for an issue.

When I was in law school, it was easy to view judges and the judiciary as almost infallible since the administration of justice is an idealized concept for people just starting in the legal profession. After becoming a practicing lawyer, I discovered that courts and their staff are often overburdened and underresourced. To be clear, judges and court staff often try their absolute best to administrate justice in the most efficient and equitable way possible, but errors, of course, are often made. In my experience, judges and court staff are extremely hesitant to admit fault and often lay blame on attorneys and others for issues caused by courts, perhaps as a way to protect the image of the judiciary. However, such tactics are not transparent, and courts should be more open about how they could do better.

For instance, earlier in my career, I filed a simple motion, and it took many months for the court to finally render a decision on the motion. Discovery was stayed in the case while the motion was pending, and by the next compliance conference, discovery had not been completed. At the conference, the court yelled at all of the lawyers for not completing discovery by the standards and goals by which the case was supposed to be resolved. This was shocking to the attorneys since the case was proceeding relatively quickly after discovery had resumed following the judge’s decision on a motion.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The main reason why the case had stalled for the better part of a year was because the court failed to render a decision involving a relatively straightforward motion for an extremely long time. Of course, the court was probably backlogged, and the court did not have the resources to submit a decision earlier. Nevertheless, the attorneys would have appreciated it if the court assumed some of the fault for delaying the case rather than directing the court’s anger toward the attorneys on the matter and making our lives more difficult in speeding up the case to account for the court’s delays.

Another time many years ago in my career, I had to file an appeal of a judge who had made a problematic decision. Rather than bore my readers with the technicalities of why the judge’s decision was erroneous, just take it from me that the court denied the motion based on the wrong grounds, and any seasoned practitioner in the jurisdiction would have recognized that the court’s decision was problematic. Our firm ended up filing an appeal so that we could have an appellate court overturn the problematic decision rendered by the court.

Rather than respond to the appeal, and because plaintiff’s counsel likely saw how the court’s decision was problematic, the plaintiff’s attorney agreed to discontinue the case. However, because of the procedures of that jurisdiction, we needed to ask the trial court that had rendered the problematic decision to approve the discontinuance. At oral argument for my motion to approve the discontinuance, the court seemed to understand how the court had erred when the decision subject to the appeal had been rendered. Rather than admit fault, the court merely related that a motion for reconsideration should have been filed so that the decision could have been corrected before an appeal was filed. However, it is not clear that the standards for a motion for reconsideration were satisfied in this instance since none of the facts or law had changed after the order had been rendered. The court could have accepted fault for not arriving at the right position in the original order, which had forced our client to spend significant resources drafting an appeal before a stipulation of discontinuance was offered by plaintiff’s counsel.

Let me be clear: I have much respect for judges and court officers since they have a very difficult and noble job. Court officers have acted especially admirably during the COVID-19 pandemic when administering justice during especially difficult times. Numerous active and retired judges have emailed me about my articles over the years, and I would love to hear feedback from jurists about this piece as I have enjoyed hearing from them about other articles. In any event, I have the most respect for people and institutions that can admit when they are at fault. No one is perfect, and when judges and court officers admit fault, they can dispense with the blame game and focus more on the administration of justice.

# Simpson Thacher Announces Bonuses
## A former bonus compensation leader weighs in.

A couple years back, Simpson Thacher made the bold move of stepping on Cravath’s toes and [acting first on bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/bonus-season-comes-early-and-its-not-cravath/). It was an impressive act of chutzpah designed to show that Simpson was the real market leader.

Then Davis Polk beclowned them by [releasing even bigger bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/associate-bonus-watch-davis-polk-beats-simpson/).

Properly chastened, Simpson Thacher is a follower once again. Partner and Executive Committee Chair [William Dougherty](http://www.stblaw.com/our-team/news/william-r-dougherty) alerted the firm of their upcoming bonuses in an email sent at 9 a.m. this morning. The numbers will not surprise you:

UPDATE (3:05 p.m.): A Simpson associate comes to the firm’s defense: “What’s with all the STB hate? So much shade for a firm that’s been, at worst, the second best for associate comp. Obviously I’m biased, but let’s not forget that (1) half of BigLaw associates are still receiving 2014 STB-scale bonuses (1st, 2nd, and 7th+ yrs), and (2) the still-current 2014 ‘DPW scale’ for 3rd-6th yrs was a relatively small bump over the 2014 STB scale for 3rd-6th yrs. And there was that whole [$160K thing](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/01/breaking-simpson-thacher-raises-associate-base-salaries/).”

# How To Keep Biglaw Partners Happy? Keep Them In The Dark When It Comes To Their Money...
## The 'black box' awaits as Biglaw firms consider making the shift for partner compensation.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

The way it’s been explained to me by every firm that has a closed system is it is so much easier to keep people happy when they can’t see someone is making more than them even though they have more in originations.

— Recruiter Jeffrey Lowe, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2024/01/16/in-partner-comp-does-ignorance-equal-bliss-firms-using-the-black-box-hope-so/) on why some Biglaw firms use a black-box compensation system for partners. This compensation model is in the news thanks to a recent decision by Paul Weiss to move its partners to a black box. Lowe offered that there may be “danger” in making such a move, as doing do may cause “fear and paranoia” among attorneys. “People choose to believe the worst and operate under that assumption,” he said.

# McGuireWoods Will Do What It Wants... And It Doesn't WANT To Give Raises
## The firm will give out summer bonuses, though.

On Thursday, McGuireWoods associates were invited on a call with firm management. That should have been enough of a tip-off that the firm would not be giving out raises. When you are going to follow the market, you want to do it in writing. When you are going to cheap out your employees, you tell them over the phone.

On the call, associates were informed that McGuireWoods prefers to look at associate compensation in the first quarter, so they will look at it then. For now, the old salary structure remains in place. One tipster described the message from management like this:

“What works for us is to take up compensation in the first quarter, we look at it in ordinary course at the beginning of the year. Other firms can do what they want — we’re going to do what we want.”

It’s funny to me that when firm leadership gets chesty about bucking a trend, it’s always about being cheap to their employees. Nobody ever says, “Other firms can do what they want, we’re going to do what we want. And we want to buy everybody a new car.”

All is not bad for MW associates. The firm is throwing out some summer bonuses. From our tipsters:

We are going to give everyone across the board a “modest, mid-year bonus” from the partners just as a way to say thank you. A small bump in July paycheck.

iii. Junior associates: $2500

b. Other markets

i. Senior associates: $5000
ii. Midlevel associates: $3000
iii. Junior associates: $2000

Hey, they wanted to do that, right?

It’s bad, but it could be worse. That summer bonus is not nothing. It can buy you a really nice suit for the lateral hire interviews you’ll be taking this winter.

# Biglaw Firms Shouldn't 'Penalize' Former Trump DOJ Attorneys, Says Former Trump DOJ Attorney

Many of those people were career prosecutors before being appointed. Law firms and others should be encouraging that type of experience and public service, [not] penalizing [those who go in and out of government].

— [Richard Donoghue](https://www.pillsburylaw.com/en/lawyers/richard-donoghue.html), a partner at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman in New York, commenting on the [job prospects of former Justice Department attorneys](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/law-firms-shouldnt-penalize-former-trump-lawyers-donoghue-says) who served during the Trump administration. Donoghue recently landed at Pillsbury after his stint as acting deputy attorney general during the final two months of Donald Trump’s presidency. Donoghue reportedly [resisted Trump’s claims of voter fraud](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/06/trump-doj-jan-6-515324) and even had a draft resignation letter ready to submit in the event that the president fired acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen. Did Donoghue have difficulty finding a job due to his association with the Trump DOJ? “There might have been some of that,” he said in an interview with [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/law-firms-shouldnt-penalize-former-trump-lawyers-donoghue-says).

# Indicted Kaye Scholer Partner Resigns
## Biglaw partner Evan Greebel is in Biglaw no more.

Evan Greebel and Martin Shkreli

Remember how there was a [Biglaw partner caught up](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/pharma-karma-martin-shkreli-and-biglaw-partner-arrested/?rf=1) in the whole Martin Shkreli securities fraud mess? While the rest of the world celebrated the downfall of the massive douchebag that rose to infamy by [raising the price](http://dealbreaker.com/2015/09/ex-hedge-fund-manager-turned-pharmaceutical-ceo-doesnt-see-the-big-difference-charging-750-today-for-life-saving-drug-that-cost-13-50-yesterday/) of a life-saving pill, Daraprim, by 5,000% (from $13.50 to $750), over in our little corner of the internet, there was plenty of schadenfreude-laced glee over the fact that a Kaye Scholer partner, Evan Greebel, got arrested alongside his former client. (Greebel represented Shkreli while at Katten Muchin, where he worked for more than a decade before joining Kaye Scholer.)

Though Greebel was [still gainfully employed](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-biglaw-partner-evan-greebels-arrest/) in Biglaw back in December, it seems that is no longer the case. As Law360 [reports](http://www.law360.com/topnews/articles/770924/kaye-scholer-partner-resigns-in-wake-of-shkreli-indictment):

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Evan Greebel, who remained a partner at Kaye Scholer despite being indicted for allegedly funneling cash from biopharmaceutical company Retrophin Inc. to investors in hedge funds founded by Shkreli, is no longer a partner at the firm, according to spokeswoman Andrea Orzehoski.

As for the exact date of Greebel’s resignation, Orzehoski would only say that it was recent and declined to discuss the results of the firm’s internal investigation of the attorney. Orzehoski said last month that upon conclusion of the probe, “the firm will take appropriate action.”

That isn’t the only shake-up in the notable case — he’s also made a change at the counsel’s table. With the means to hire the best of the best and the experience to know the big players in the white-collar world, Greebel initially tapped a well-known boutique, Morvillo Abramowitz Grand Iason & Anello, and partners Jonathan Sack and Benjamin Fischer. But all that is different now:

Gibson Dunn partner Reed Brodsky told the court on Feb. 8 that he will be defending Greebel against the criminal charges. Gibson Dunn partner Joel M. Cohen and counsel Lisa H. Rubin were also added to Greebel’s defense team, according to court records.

On Friday, Jonathan S. Sack and Benjamin S. Fischer of Morvillo Abramowitz Grand Iason & Anello PC were allowed to withdraw as co-counsel for Greebel, leaving Gibson Dunn as Greebel’s only attorneys.

White-collar enthusiasts may remember Brodsky for his former role in the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York, where he was lead prosecutor in the conviction of Rajat Gupta on insider trading charges. Though he is now on the other side of the room, this case is sure to reverberate in the legal world.

# A Perfect Match For Some... A Kind Of Match For Others... And Nothing For The Rest
## Truly national firm brings a patchwork of raises.

On Friday night, Perkins Coie surprised its associates with the raise announcement they’d been sweating out the entire month of June. In the memo copied on the next page, the firm informed associates in Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, San Diego, and Washington that they would be matching the prevailing market scale for associates up through their fourth year. Beyond that, in accordance with Perkins Coie’s existing practice, associates are compensated according to a range and the firm announced that it would bump up the top end of that range to match the market standard.

Not bad. It may have caused unneeded consternation to drag out this announcement until the last possible day, but it’s still better than 2016, when the firm waited until after the market raises went into effect to finally move and issue retroactive raises.

But the memo conveniently excludes the associates in the Bay Area. What about those associates? Well, according to tipsters they received a full match all the way up the scale. That’s in line with what the firm did in 2016 as well. They know what market butters their bread.

As for the other U.S. offices — from Anchorage to Madison — we don’t complete information at this time. Associates in Seattle, Bellevue, and Denver will be getting a mixed bag. Those offices already have an 1850-hour scale and a 1950-hour scale for associate compensation. Those on the 1950 scale will receive a market raise to match in the first two years, with the third-year and up operating along a range with the top end set at the market figure. The 1850-hour folks will receive no raise, but will get a “true up” payment for hours they work between the 1850 and 1950 target.

We also know that Portland, Madison, and Phoenix will all be getting nothing.



We said from the beginning that this modest raise was required by every firm that raised in 2016 unless they’re willing to admit they overdid it back then. Apparently, Perkins Coie thinks they did. Associates with student loan bills to pay seem to disagree.

Ed. note: Please welcome [Nicolette Shamsian](https://www.irell.com/professionals-nicolette-shamsian) to our pages, where she’ll be writing about fashion law.

Created in 1984, the Hermès Birkin bag is the epitome of luxury and class in the fashion world.  This bag is so exclusive that in order to be able to purchase it directly from Hermès, customers must have a strong relationship – and purchase history – with the brand.  The exceptional craftsmanship and timeless design of the Birkin bag together with its limited availability leads to a hefty price tag.  Today, the price of a Birkin ranges from $10,000 for a standard leather bag to $250,000 for an exotic bag.  Whether or not the bag is offered to them in their desired style, a customer who is offered a Birkin rarely turns it down.  The Birkin is seen as an investment piece that can sell for two-to-five times its retail value in the resale market.  The brand is continuing to grow every year, reporting revenue of $12.41 billion in 2022, up 29% compared to 2021.

It is no surprise that Hermès will go to any lengths to protect its renowned Birkin trademarks.  In Hermès v. Rothschild, Hermès filed a complaint against Mason Rothschild in the Southern District of New York, alleging that he was infringing its Birkin trademarks through his sale of NFTs called MetaBirkins.  Hermès’ complaint accused Rothschild of federal and common law trademark infringement, false designation of origin, trademark dilution, cybersquatting, and injury to business reputation and dilution under New York General Business Law.

Rothschild sought dismissal, arguing that his NFTs are shielded from Hermès’ trademark claims as creative expression protected by the First Amendment.  While the court denied Rothschild’s motion to dismiss, it determined that the NFTs should be evaluated under the Rogers v. Grimaldi test for artistic works.  Under the Rogers v. Grimaldi test, an otherwise artistic work is not entitled to First Amendment protection if the plaintiff can show that either: (1) the use of its trademark in an expressive work was not “artistically relevant” to the underlying work, or (2) whether the trademark is used to “explicitly mislead” the public as to the source or content of the work.  The second factor of the Rogers v. Grimaldi test requires that consumer confusion must be clear and unambiguous to overcome the strong First Amendment interests at stake.  The court found that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to both factors and the case thus went to trial in the end of January 2023.

It is important to note that the Rogers v. Grimaldi doctrine is itself currently under scrutiny in the Supreme Court case Jack Daniel’s Properties Inc. v. VIP Productions LLC.  Jack Daniel’s brought this case for trademark infringement against VIP Productions’ dog chew toys bearing the distinctive look of a Jack Daniel’s whiskey bottle alongside the slogan “Bad Spaniel’s.”  The Supreme Court will review the Ninth Circuit’s holding that the dog toys were protected as artistic parody under the Rogers v. Grimaldi test.  Brand owners expressed their concern about the Ninth Circuit’s decision for its protection of commercial products.

In arguing that his work is entitled to First Amendment protection under Rogers v. Grimaldi, Rothschild argued that his MetaBirkin NFTs, depicting faux fur-covered Birkin bags, are works of art created based on his interpretations of the world around him, even comparing the MetaBirkin NFTs to Andy Warhol’s Campbell’s Soup Cans.  More specifically, Rothschild maintained that the faux fur on the MetaBirkins “comments on the animal cruelty inherent in Hermès’ manufacture of its ultra-expensive leather handbags.”  In addition, Rothschild called the MetaBirkins an experiment to see if he could create the same kind of illusion that the Birkin bag has in real life.

Hermès introduced evidence of the Birkin trademark’s strong recognition and informed the jury that it has applied for a digital trademark for the Birkin.  Since luxury brands are starting to enter the digital space, Hermès argued that it is reasonable for customers to think that the MetaBirkin NFTs are associated with the Hermès brand.  Hermès also highlighted Rothschild’s motive to profit from his so-called “social experiment.”  Rothschild sold his first MetaBirkin for $23,500, which later resold for $47,000.  In total, Rothschild produced over 100 MetaBirkin NFTs, which sold for over $1.1 million.  Hermès also introduced evidence of text messages from Rothschild to the developer of the MetaBirkins stating, “We’re sitting on a gold mine.”

On February 8, 2023, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Hermès, finding that Rothschild infringed the Birkin trademarks even under the stricter Rogers v. Grimaldi standard.  Rothschild was ordered to pay Hermès $133,000 in damages.

This dispute did not cease with the end of the trial.  Hermès is currently pushing for a permanent injunction to prevent Rothschild and his affiliates from continuing to promote or sell his MetaBirkin NFTs and to reassign ownership to Hermès.  In his opposition, Rothschild argues that the type of permanent injunctive relief sought by Hermès is not appropriate in a case involving artistic expression and instead requests that the court simply require a “clear disclaimer.”  The opposition states that Hermès has “produced no evidence of any concrete harm that it has suffered from Mr. Rothschild’s promotion and sales of his MetaBirkins artwork,” and instead Hermès’ sales have continued to increase.  Rothschild also contends that the court should not grant injunctive relief due to Hermès’ unclean hands stemming from its “pattern of deliberately dishonest conduct throughout trial.”

If Hermès’ proposed permanent injunction is not granted, it is the view of brand owners that NFT creators may think they can continue to ride on the coattails of brands that have put significant time and money into building recognition just by paying a minimal damages award to the trademark owner.  This view would be consistent with 15 U.S.C. § 1116(a)’s rebuttable presumption of irreparable injury that was codified in 2020 in the Trademark Modernization Act. However, if the permanent injunction is granted, some are concerned that this may place NFTs at risk.  Some see NFTs as secure investments, fearing that if they can be destroyed by an injunction, buyers and sellers will be at financial risk and may be less likely to engage with NFTs.

As one of the first cases to discuss intellectual property rights within the metaverse, this case sets precedent that courts are willing to find trademark infringement between similar digital and physical commodities.  While this case raises concerns for NFT artists whose existing work can be the subject of another infringement lawsuit, it is a big win for brands who are trying to connect with their customers in the metaverse.  Gucci, for example, has already collaborated with Roblox to create a virtual garden exhibition celebrating Gucci’s 100th birthday, while allowing visitors to purchase Gucci NFTs.  Brands are now running to file trademarks specifically meant for the metaverse.

We will continue to see more activity in this case unfold as the parties are still awaiting the court’s ruling on Hermès’ motion for a permanent injunction and Rothschild’s renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial.

# 'You All Live In An Alternate Reality, You Corporate Shills' Among Number Of Statements Earning Lawyer A Tidy Benchslap

Biglaw attorneys are, generally speaking, corporate shills. But you don’t get to just say that out loud! There’s a gentility to this profession that we have to maintain. Philadelphia personal injury attorney Thomas Bosworth learned that the hard way, [enduring a tongue-lashing](https://www.law.com/thelegalintelligencer/2023/05/03/dozens-and-dozens-of-personal-attacks-fed-court-sanctions-high-profile-phila-lawyer-for-deposition-conduct/) from Judge Stephanie Haines of the Western District of Pennsylvania over “obnoxious” and “frankly appalling behavior” she identified upon review of deposition transcripts.

Bosworth, who scored a massive medical malpractice award last year as an associate before striking out on his own, apologized for the coarse deposition behavior, noting that he wasn’t proud of his behavior and takes ownership of his mistakes.

But while he showed contrition for the harsh tone — which, in addition to the corporate shills remark included calling an opposing attorney a “liar” and saying counsel “intentionally abuse people” — he was less willing to accept other allegations lodged by defense counsel:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Lawyers from Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough and Campbell Conroy & O’Neil, who represented defendants in the case, had lodged the [sanction motion](https://www.law.com/thelegalintelligencer/2023/02/03/coaching-intimidation-and-personal-insults-nelson-mullins-lawyers-seek-sanctions-over-ex-kline-specter-attorneys-conduct/) in January, alleging [Bosworth](https://www.law.com/thelegalintelligencer/2023/02/01/a-very-fast-way-for-a-young-attorney-to-destroy-their-career-attorneys-on-social-media-disrupt-rainmaking-dynamics-finding-success-and-trouble/)‘s conduct was so disruptive that the testimony elicited during the depositions was “unrecoverably tainted.”

That does sound sanctionable… and yet Bosworth raised the compelling counterpoint that they already settled the case. If the defense truly believed that this case was so remarkably tainted, then why settle? Perhaps that disconnect speaks to why the judge, according to the Legal Intelligencer account, focused so much more on the mean-spirited behavior than the allegations that Bosworth undermined the case.

Of course, settling doesn’t excuse misbehavior of any kind, but it does force one to take the sanctions motion’s fiery rhetoric about rendering the case “unrecoverably tainted” — which isn’t a word by the way… it’s “irrecoverably” — with a grain of salt. The defense’s request to file its specific money demand under seal doesn’t inspire much confidence that the request is going to keep things in proper perspective either.

Whether Bosworth ends up on the hook for the “tens of thousands” defense counsel alluded to requesting or not, this whole experience has undoubtedly chastened him.

# Morning Docket: 09.05.18
## * Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings will continue today, and we imagine that when his rulings are discussed, he'll be pummeled on own ""frozen trucker"" case -- but his involves a killer whale. [[National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/2018/09/04/brett-kavanaugh-returns-to-the-hot-seat-what-we-learned-and-whats-next/)] * Special counsel Robert Mueller says he'll accept written answers from President Donald Trump on questions related to whether his campaign conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election. As for the obstruction question, it seems like Mueller still wants an interview. [[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/us/politics/mueller-trump-russia-investigation.html)] * The Securities and Exchange Commission has reached settlements totaling about $216,815 with the former leaders of failed firm Dewey & LeBoeuf. Of course, that's nowhere near multimillion-dollar fraud that's been alleged, but at this point, Dewey even care anymore? [[American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/09/04/sec-reaches-financial-settlements-with-ex-dewey-leboeuf-leaders/)] * According to the American Bar Association, Florida Coastal Law, the last InfiLaw school left standing, is still out of compliance with accreditation standards. Coastal is already suing the ABA, so this latest decision is sure to inspire some additional filings from the school. [[ABA Journal](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/florida_coastal_is_still_out_of_compliance_aba_legal_ed_council_says)] * North Dakota Law has welcomed more than two dozen students who fled from beleaguered Arizona Summit Law with open arms. Why have so many Summit students flocked to Roughrider Country? All of their credits will be accepted there, which is a pretty good reason. [[Bismarck Tribune](https://bismarcktribune.com/news/state-and-regional/und-law-school-welcomes-in-arizona-summit-transfer-students/article_c3682219-fc03-559b-9dfd-954fbcfe8ee6.html)]

Winter is coming (or technically here); is a SCOTUS nomination as well?

More than a month has passed since President-elect Donald Trump told us to expect a Supreme Court nomination [“pretty soon.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/trump-to-make-scotus-great-again-pretty-soon/?rf=1) But even if a SCOTUS nominee to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia gets announced forthwith, it’s unlikely that this new justice will join the Court in time to participate in any decisions for the current Term.[[1]](#f1)

So that’s the “when” of this story. What about the “who”? In case you missed it over the holidays, Jan Crawford of CBS News, one of the most plugged-in Supreme Court reporters around, revealed Trump’s [five finalists](http://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/122516.html?_ga=1.176643045.1514966084.1422212612) (in alphabetical order, and with thanks to [How Appealing](http://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/122516.html); full transcript of the discussion [here](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/face-the-nation-transcript-december-25-2016-colbert-correspondents-panel/)):

- Judge Steven Colloton (8th Cir.) of Iowa
- Judge Thomas Hardiman (3d Cir.) of Pennsylvania
- Justice Joan Larsen of Michigan
- Judge William Pryor (11th Cir.) of Alabama
- Judge Diane Sykes (7th Cir.) of Wisconsin
These five judges all appeared on Trump’s [first SCOTUS list of 11 names](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/donald-trumps-supreme-court-shortlist/?rf=1), suggesting that his [supplemental list of 10 names](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/making-scotus-even-greater-trumps-supplemental-supreme-court-shortlist/) might represent something of a second tier. But the legal and journalism professions must thank the Donald for his not-so-short “shortlist” of 21. It made the SCOTUS process closer to a reality TV show, with more than a dozen competitors to start, and more fun than a traditional presidential process with maybe four to six contenders.

UPDATE (7:05 p.m.): According to Shane Goldmacher and Josh Gerstein of [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-strategy-supreme-court-233106), still in the mix are Judge Raymond Kethledge (6th Cir.), Judge Raymond Gruender (8th Cir.), and Judge Neil Gorsuch (10th Cir.). Judge Kethledge and Judge Gruender appeared on Trump’s first list, while Judge Gorsuch was on the second list.

Of the finalists, who has the edge? My money is on Judge Pryor and Judge Sykes, for a few reasons:

1. They’ve been on Trump’s radar screen for a long time. During the Republican presidential debate that took place right after Justice Scalia’s passing, Trump [called them out by name](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/donald-trumps-supreme-court-nominees/): “We could have a Diane Sykes or a Bill Pryor.”

2. The buzz is on their side. When I attended the National Lawyers Convention of the Federalist Society back in November, where numerous Republican power brokers (and many Trump shortlisters) made appearances, the SCOTUS talk [centered on Pryor and Sykes](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/442330/gop-consensus-trump-scotus-pick-sykes-or-pryor), and continued to focus on them [into December](http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/15/politics/trump-supreme-court-vacancy/).

3. Prediction markets favor them. See, e.g., [PredictIt](https://www.predictit.org/Market/2198/Who-will-be-the-next-confirmed-Supreme-Court-justice) and [FantasyJustice by Josh Blackman](https://fantasyjustice.lexpredict.com/stats).

(Yes, the top vote getter on FantasyJustice right now is Judge Neil Gorsuch (10th Cir.). But if you look at just the five finalists identified by Jan Crawford and eliminate the others, you’ll see that Pryor and Sykes are far ahead of Colloton, Hardiman, and Larsen. Also, as I know from having attended the Fed Soc conference in November, where Blackman was taking in-person predictions from attendees, some judges could — and did — strongly encourage their clerks, colleagues, and friends to make supportive predictions.)

4. They are both solidly conservative. They are conservative in terms of the outcomes they reach, writing opinions and casting votes [striking down various Obamacare provisions](http://dailycaller.com/2016/12/27/trumps-supreme-court-shortlist-is-making-the-rounds/) and [upholding voter ID laws](http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/15/politics/trump-supreme-court-vacancy/). They are conservative in terms of methodology, emphasizing Justice Scalia’s themes of textualism, originalism, and judicial restraint. Not surprisingly, they are active in the Federalist Society, aka the legal profession’s vast right-wing conspiracy.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

UPDATE (10:42 p.m.): According to [this study](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/09/25/us/politics/how-clintons-or-trumps-nominees-could-affect-the-balance-of-the-supreme-court.html), Sykes and Pryor are in the Alito-Thomas range of conservatism (with Sykes a little more conservative than Pryor).

UPDATE (1/7/2017, 9:45.m.): But this study is very much [open to question](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/09/27/comparing-the-ideologies-of-supreme-court-nominees/?utm_term=.aabf7edfecb5) (as Orin Kerr notes).

5. They are highly qualified and super-smart, yet not “elites” — a very “Trumpy” combination.

Pyror and Sykes have long and distinguished records of judicial service, and they are highly regarded as jurists. Even their ideological adversaries concede their brilliance. See, e.g., [Ian Millhiser](https://twitter.com/imillhiser/status/733001911645933568), author of [Injustices: The Supreme Court’s History of Comforting the Comfortable and Afflicting the Afflicted](http://amzn.to/2iRqfKl) (affiliate link): “Trump’s potential justices are really smart and really awful. Really. Awful.”

But they are not coastal elites: Pryor is from Alabama, and Sykes is from Wisconsin. They went to strong but not Ivy League or “T14” law schools: Tulane for Pryor, and Marquette for Sykes. They have not spent their entire careers in the federal system: Pryor served as Alabama’s attorney general before taking the bench, and Sykes was a state trial and appellate judge before joining the Seventh Circuit.

(Contrast them in this regard to Colloton (Yale, Office of Legal Counsel, federal prosecutor); Hardiman (Georgetown Law, Skadden Arps); and Larsen (Northwestern Law, Office of Legal Counsel). If Trump wants to “drain the legal swamp,” expect him to steer clear of the T14/Biglaw/Main Justice types, going instead with nominees from the “real America.”)

6. They have powerful backers. Pryor is pals with incoming attorney general Jeff Sessions, his fellow Alabaman, and Sykes gets support from incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, her fellow Wisconsinite. This type of stuff might sound silly, but in D.C. circles, connections matter. (For example, there are many lawyers across the country qualified to serve as U.S. solicitor general, but the ones getting buzz — George Conway, Chuck Cooper, Noel Francisco, and Greg Katsas — all have strong ties to the Trump White House or Justice Department.)

(One other random fact: Sykes was once married to conservative Wisconsin talk show host Charlie Sykes, a leader of the #NeverTrump faction during the presidential campaign. But she is his ex-wife, and they [divorced back in 1999](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/08/charlie-skyes-wisconsin-radio-conservatives-214175), almost two decades ago. This connection should not be an issue.)


Judge Diane Sykes and Judge William Pryor

As between Pryor and Sykes, who has the stronger shot? I’m going with Sykes. (Disclosure: I have had the honor of meeting both judges and I admire them both greatly, but I know Judge Sykes better, having participated in events with her at the University of Chicago and Marquette Law Schools.)

Here are the relevant factors:

1. Age. Members of Team Pryor [point out](http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/15/politics/trump-supreme-court-vacancy/) that he is younger than Sykes (54 to her 59). This is a problem for Sykes — presidents, especially Republican presidents, like their justices young — but not an insurmountable one. Justice Ginsburg was 60 when appointed to SCOTUS, and Justices Breyer, Alito, and Sotomayor were all over 55 when they joined the Court. Also, recall that women live longer than men; as noted by Josh Blackman, based on actuarial analysis, Judge Pryor and Judge Sykes have the [exact same life expectancy](http://joshblackman.com/blog/2017/01/06/the-actuarial-life-expectancies-of-the-scotus-short-list/).

Interestingly enough, Judge Sykes’s age could actually help her, at least in terms of getting the first Trump appointment. On inauguration day, Justice Ginsburg will be 83, Justice Kennedy will be 80, and Justice Breyer will be 78. While we wish all three of them long tenures on the Court, it is possible, even likely, that President Trump will get one or more SCOTUS appointments in addition to the one he currently has. So if he thinks Judge Sykes is a strong candidate (which she is), he would be well advised to appoint her now, to give her the longest possible tenure on SCOTUS.

The remaining four finalists — Colloton (53), Hardiman (51), Larsen (48), and Pryor (54) — are all young enough to be considered for future vacancies. But Judge Sykes this December will turn 60, which is traditionally viewed as the age cutoff for appointing a justice. So with the long game in mind, Trump should select Sykes.

2. Confirmability. Judge Pryor is a nominee in the mold of a Judge Edith Jones (5th Cir.) or a Judge Emilio Garza (5th Cir.). The full-throated expression of conservative views that Republicans love about him is also what would make him harder to confirm.

A recent interesting paper, [Searching for Justice Scalia: Measuring the “Scalia-Ness” of the Next Potential Member of the U.S. Supreme Court](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2874794), gave Pryor high marks for “Scalia-ness.” But when it comes to confirmation, “Scalia-ness” isn’t necessarily a plus.

Take abortion. It’s de rigueur for senators to ask SCOTUS nominees in their hearings for their views on Roe v. Wade (and Senator Chuck Schumer has already [highlighted protecting Roe](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/chuck-schumer-knows-how-to-spot-potential-supreme-court-justices-outside-the-mainstream/) as a priority). It’s then de rigueur for the nominee to say (1) Roe is precedent (duh); (2) I respect precedent (of course you do); (3) yes, precedent can be overruled (with a digression here on stare decisis and the circumstances under which a case can be overruled); and (4) sorry, can’t say more because abortion might come before the Court, toodles!

It’s a time-honored song and dance, but one that Judge Pryor would have a hard time performing. He previously stated, as groups like NARAL [love to tout](http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/media/press-releases/2016/pr05182016_trump-scotus.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/), that Roe was the “worst abomination in the history of constitutional law,” [amounting to](https://thinkprogress.org/meet-the-two-ultra-conservatives-trump-would-nominate-to-the-supreme-court-da6a78b686b6#.31thayul4) “a constitutional right to murder an unborn child.”

Statements like these, plus additional concerns raised by [African-American and LGBT groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Pryor_Jr.) about other aspects of Bill Pryor’s record, led Democrats to filibuster his Eleventh Circuit nomination. President George W. Bush had to resort to a recess appointment to place Pryor on the Eleventh Circuit, and his final confirmation vote was close: 53-45. Judge Sykes won confirmation by a [much more comfortable margin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_S._Sykes), 70-27.

3. Diversity. To be sure, President-elect Trump isn’t big on diversity, as reflected in his appointments thus far. As we [observed](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/trump-nominates-sullivan-cromwell-partner-to-lead-sec/) when he passed over Gibson Dunn partner Debra Wong Yang in favor of Sullivan & Cromwell partner Jay Clayton for SEC head, “even when choosing between two elites, President-elect Trump goes for the white male.”

But if he’s torn in the end between Pryor and Sykes, Sykes’s gender might be a tie-breaker, since it helps in terms of both confirmability and improving the GOP’s standing with women. Per Tim Alberta in the [National Review](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/442330/gop-consensus-trump-scotus-pick-sykes-or-pryor), “Sykes is considered to be every bit as conservative as Pyror, but is less controversial…. She also is — quite obviously — a woman, and Republicans have been eager for decades to appoint a female Supreme Court justice. (The Harriet Miers fiasco still haunts many GOP establishment types.) Allies of Sykes say it would prove especially difficult for Democrats to oppose her: She’s a 58-year-old single mother who hails from the heartland.”

4. Attractiveness. Some might find it stupid, distasteful, or even offensive of me to raise physical attractiveness in the context of comparing two Supreme Court contenders; presidents generally select justices for their minds, not their bodies. But Donald Trump is not your ordinary president. And as we know from his catty comments about people’s looks while on the campaign trail, as well as his willingness to consider Mitt Romney for secretary of state because he [“looked the part,”](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/24/us/politics/donald-trump-mitt-romney-rudy-giuliani-state.html) the Donald places a priority on appearance.

(I’m not at liberty to divulge details, but I have a friend who, some time ago, was offered a job with Trump basically because he met her casually and found her attractive (and told her as much). He eventually got to know her better and learned of her brilliance and accomplishments, but it was clear in my friend’s retelling of this tale that he wouldn’t have taken the initial interest in her had he not found her compelling in terms of her appearance.)

What does this mean for Judge Sykes and Judge Pryor? If you’ve seen them in person, you know that they are both rather attractive (especially by the standards of the federal judiciary). Judge Pryor looks like he could be a male model, and he keeps in shape by running. As for Judge Sykes, in 2004 she was named a [Superhottie of the Federal Judiciary](http://underneaththeirrobes.blogs.com/main/2004/07/_general_commen.html), described in her nomination blurb as “startlingly pretty and elegant,” with a “cool,” “businesslike,” “yuppie sort of appeal.”

So both Judge Sykes and Judge Pryor would pass Donald Trump’s “look the part” test. But as we know [all too well](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html?utm_term=.a5a17cd7aad0), Donald Trump is a red-blooded, heterosexual American male. If he interviews both potential nominees in person, as presidents traditionally do, I suspect he will find Judge Sykes more appealing.

(Again, my apologies to anyone who is offended by such frivolity while discussing a life-tenured position on the highest court in the land. But I’m sorry, this is the world that Donald Trump has made, and I’m trying to be a realist. Here at Above the Law, we call things as we see them, even at the risk of occasionally causing offense.)

In sum, I’m predicting that Judge Diane Sykes will be President Donald Trump’s first Supreme Court nominee. And I’m not alone in this prediction. For example, Jeffrey Toobin also [expects a Justice Sykes](http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-top-legal-stories-of-2017-donald-trumps-conflicts-of-interest-bill-cosbys-assault-charge-and-more) in 2017, noting that aside from her age, “she’s everything else they want in a Justice.”

Is it exciting to predict Justice Sykes? Not really. She’s one of the odds-on favorites at this point in time.

But you know what makes this process fun? How often the pundits’ predictions are wrong. When President Barack Obama was looking to nominate someone to fill the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, I was pretty certain that he would go with either Judge Sri Srinivasan (D.C. Cir.) or Judge Paul Watford (9th Cir.), and most other observers agreed. But then POTUS surprised everyone and nominated Chief Judge Merrick Garland (D.C. Cir.) to SCOTUS (which was, in hindsight, a brilliant move; Judge Garland was [thrilled to tears](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/merrick-garland-your-scotus-nominee/) by the nomination, while Judges Srinivasan and Watford were kept in “pristine” condition — unsullied by politics, and ready for elevation under President Elizabeth Warren).

And then, of course, we have an even bigger blooper by the chattering class: our collective failure to foresee the election of Donald Trump as our 45th president. So consider this a lesson learned: as long as the Donald is involved, accurate prediction is impossible.

P.S. But please, dear Lord, let Trump at least stick to his slate of 21 names. We do not need [Peter Thiel on the Supreme Court](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/report-donald-trump-would-put-peter-thiel-on-the-supreme-court-wait-what/).

[ [1]](#reff1) No new justice before the end of this Term — at least that’s what experts like former solicitor general [Ted Olson](https://twitter.com/chrisgeidner/status/799298789307772928) and veteran SCOTUS correspondent [Jeffrey Toobin](http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-top-legal-stories-of-2017-donald-trumps-conflicts-of-interest-bill-cosbys-assault-charge-and-more) believe (and I don’t disagree with them). Another former SG, Don Verrilli, believes that it’s [“possible”](https://twitter.com/chrisgeidner/status/799299384747888641) we might get a justice on the Court in time for the April sitting, but that would be “optimistic.”

If you look at the last few nominations, it has generally taken about three months to go from nomination to confirmation — Elena Kagan (announced 5/10/2010, confirmed 8/5/2010), Sonia Sotomayor (announced 5/26/2009, confirmed 8/6/2009, Samuel Alito (announced 10/31/2005, confirmed 1/31/2006). And those nominations didn’t come at the start of a president’s new term, when the Senate will be busy holding hearings for many other appointees, including Cabinet officials, and addressing other priorities (e.g., Obamacare, or the termination thereof).

We’re now into the fourth quarter of 2016, and we all know what that means in Biglaw: time to start [collecting from clients](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/01/the-two-faces-of-kl-gates/). Those Hamptons homes (and associate bonuses) won’t fund themselves, after all.

So now’s a good time to talk about law firm profitability, the subject of an interesting panel discussion I attended at the [Thomson Reuters Law Firm Leaders Forum](http://legalexecutiveinstitute.com/events/21st-annual-law-firm-leaders-forum-and-dinner/) called “A Comprehensive Update on Law Firm Financial Performance & Metrics.” It featured the following panelists:

Beau Grenier opened the discussion by noting that back in the day, law firm profitability was simply a matter of working the hours. That’s no longer the case today; in this challenging climate, law firms need to be more knowledgeable about their operations and have better systems for tracking productivity and profitability.

What can law firms do to make themselves more profitable in a highly competitive environment with little to no demand growth? Here are a few ideas that emerged over the course of the discussion.

1. Realization, realization, realization.

To paraphrase the [1992 election slogan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_the_economy,_stupid), “It’s the realization rate, stupid.” Law firms need to bill a higher percentage of worked hours and collect on a higher percentage of billed hours if they want to maximize profits.

Bill Josten, a law firm profitability specialist at Thomson Reuters, described the results of a study that TR conducted to compare financially successful firms (the “haves”) and financially struggling firms (the “have-nots”). He described some surprising findings about factors that did not dictate law firm profitability, including billing rates, geography, and market segment (e.g., an Am Law 100 firm versus an Am Law Second Hundred Firm). In other words, there are many paths to profitability as a law firm; you don’t have to be, say, Am Law 100 firm based in New York City with sky-high billing rates.

So what did make a difference in financial performance? Realization rates — how much of worked time got billed, and how much of billed time got collected — played a big role. Nudging up realization rates by just a few points can mean millions for some firms.

What can be done to improve realization rates? Law firms come up with all sorts of strategies, including rewards or punishments for timely entry of time. But at the end of the day, according to Ted Tinson of Sheppard Mullin, it’s mainly a matter of discipline. Some firms are just more disciplined than others about sending out bills on time.

Elizabeth Sharrer added that it’s important to educate your timekeepers about why time entry matters. At Holland & Hart, partners talk to associates about the business of law — which many firms [fail to do](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-sad-truth-one-stat-reveals-about-the-legal-industry/) — and the importance of factors like realization rates. “We want them to think like owners,” she said.

2. Have the right mix of timekeepers.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Comparing the “have” and “have-not” firms, Bill Josten noted that the “have” firms have a higher percentage of associates among their timekeepers. At “have” firms, 39 percent of timekeepers are associates, compared to 35 percent at “have-not” firms.

Associates are some of the most profitable timekeepers at a firm. Beau Grenier said that Bradley Arant enjoys a 40 percent profit margin on associates, compared to just 16 percent on non-equity partners. (Non-equity partners, who generally have higher salaries and lower billables than associates, are some of the least profitable timekeepers at a firm — sometimes even less profitable to the firm than paralegals.)

3. Attorney retention: it’s a thing again.

Josten pointed out that many firms don’t have enough senior associates — some of the most profitable timekeepers at a firm — because they either laid off too many lawyers during the recession or cut back on hiring too much. Now that the business climate has improved, attorney retention is an issue once again for firms (as it was during the pre-recession period).

In one recent survey conducted by Thomson Reuters, law firm respondents said that entry-level hiring was one of their top priorities. This surprised the TR team at first — they expected lateral hiring to be a bigger priority — but it reflects the desire of many firms to train their lawyers from the beginning and grow headcount organically. The general trend in entry-level hiring, per Josten, is to bring in fewer lawyers but retain them at a higher rate; if you’re going to invest so much in your lawyers, you don’t want to lose so many of them after a few short years.

At Holland & Hart, the firm is working on creating valued career paths that don’t necessarily include partnership, according to Elizabeth Sharrer. It has intentionally tightened up its partnership ranks (a general trend in the law firm world), but at the same time, it has tried to do as much as it can to retain talented attorneys who might not want partnership. It has done this through a strong commitment to pro bono, as well as bonuses and mini-sabbaticals for lawyers of a certain seniority. (The firm’s geographic focus on the Mountain West helps on the recruiting and retention front; Sharrer observed that Denver and Colorado are [hugely popular with millennials](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/21/us/denvers-appeal-to-millennials-jobs-mountains-and-yes-weed.html).)

4. Sometimes you have to spend money to make money.

In their study, Josten and his colleagues at Thomson Reuters compared expense growth at “have” versus “have-not” firms. One might expect the financially thriving firms to keep a tighter lid on expenses, but that’s not what TR’s study found. In 2015, the average firm saw about 3 percent grown in expenses, while the thriving firms had above-average expense growth, in the 4-5 percent range.

Josten’s takeaway: successful firms are willing to spend in order to grow. In terms of where they are spending their money, the “have” firms have beefed up their budgets for recruiting and marketing/business development.

One can see the logic here. Law is a talent-driven business, so one shouldn’t skimp on recruiting (or on lawyer compensation, including associate salaries and bonuses). And in a low-demand environment, marketing and biz dev are key to getting a larger slice of a static or shrinking pie. David Gaulin of PWC stressed that client relationships are more important than ever — so if you have to pay to fly out and see a client or take a client out to dinner, that’s marketing money well-spent.

5. Don’t ignore the importance of culture.

Beau Grenier closed the discussion by raising the issue of culture, citing studies showing that higher workplace morale and motivation can increase productivity and profitability. He asked the panelists if they agreed and, if so, what can be done to strengthen a firm’s culture.

Not surprisingly, the panel members agreed that culture is key. Elizabeth Sharrer emphasized that a law firm can’t be held together just by money; lawyers need to enjoy working and spending time with each other. To that end, Holland & Hart gladly pays to send partners on multi-day trips so they can bond with each other over activities like fly fishing. These trips can cost a few thousand dollars a person, but given the increased cooperation and cross-selling they promote, they’re totally worth it. (See tip four above about spending money to make money.)

An important component of culture is making sure the firm has an open and flexible approach to staffing and talent management. David Gaulin praised Davis Polk’s new [alumni rehiring program](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202767294568/Courting-Women-Davis-Polk-Launches-Alumni-Rehiring-Program?slreturn=20160906163756), in which lawyers who previously worked at DPW for three or more years before leaving the legal profession for at least two years can reapply for associate-level positions. He also said that law firms could learn a thing or two from his employer, PricewaterhouseCoopers, which gives employees the flexibility to ramp up and scale down in the workplace depending on what else is going on in their lives. For example, PWC has one program where employees can receive 20 percent of their compensation and retain full benefits while they take time off to deal with family responsibilities.

Culture isn’t just a buzzword to toss around during recruiting season. It is, as Elizabeth Sharrer put it, “a business imperative.”

# Judge Puts Debevoise In Charge Of Michael Flynn Case Because Bill Barr Can't Do His Job Right
## Come on, the guy HAS ALREADY ENTERED A GUILTY PLEA. Twice.

The early contender for dumbest thing I have to deal with today is Trey Gowdy baying into the wind that he’s “[never seen anything like this](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/flynn-judge-prosecutor-ignores-separation-powers-jenna-ellis).” By “this,” he means the idea that a judge would appoint an independent actor to argue in favor of continuing the prosecution of a guy who HAS ALREADY ENTERED A GUILTY PLEA. Twice.

It’s almost like Gowdy has not paid attention to the Supreme Court for, like, a decade. The federal judiciary is more than happy to appoint counsel to argue orphaned arguments, and while that usually doesn’t happen in criminal trials, usually the federal government isn’t walking away from straight-up guilty pleas from sophisticated actors with competent counsel.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Judge Emmet Sullivan issued an order last night appointing [Debevoise’s John Gleeson](https://www.debevoise.com/johngleeson) to serve as amicus on the case, and basically explain why Judge Sullivan shouldn’t throw Michael Flynn in prison for perjury since the former National Security Advisor took an oath in federal court to tell the truth and then admitted to all the elements of a federal crime. While represented by Covington.

Attorney General Bill Barr may not care about lying to law enforcement any more, having moved on to offering shadow support to his Republican cronies trying to make “unmasking” a scandal, which anyone with two brain cells and basic research skills can piece together isn’t a scandal, but maintaining the sanctity of the federal court as a place where people don’t lie willy-nilly is still a valid concern. The judge could, of course, just accept Barr’s half-hearted excuse and let this whole case disappear. That’s certainly the easy way out. But the federal judiciary used to have a backbone and Judge Sullivan managed to find it somewhere in the wreckage of the Trump tax case oral argument. There’s a good argument that federal judges wield too much power in this world, but “punishing people who lie to them” is exactly the power they need to prevent the whole system from becoming a joke.

Fox News has already started pretending that this is a crisis of the separation of powers, but it’s not. Unlike the Supreme Court keeping non-justiciable claims alive to please Tucker Carlson, Judge Sullivan is explicitly asking Debevoise to brief out whether or not he should use the judiciary’s contempt power to penalize someone who, if the Department of Justice is to be believed, lied to the court under oath. Because as I pointed out on Twitter as soon as the Flynn decision got announced, either he’s guilty or he perjured himself but it’s one or the other.

And Trey Gowdy is probably not stupid enough that he doesn’t know this distinction. He’s just positive the average Fox viewer is.

The pregnancy and gender discrimination lawsuit against the noted Biglaw firm of Morrison & Foerster just keeps on snowballing. It was back in April of 2018, that [three Jane Does first sued MoFo](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/mofo-hit-with-100-million-pregnancy-discrimination-lawsuit/?rf=1) as part of a $100 million class-action case alleging gender discrimination as women at the firm that take maternity leave are placed on a “mommy track” which negatively impacted their careers. Then, in January, an amended complaint was filed that added [three more Jane Doe plaintiffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/more-plaintiffs-added-to-astonishing-pregnancy-and-gender-discrimination-case-against-mofo/?rf=1). Now an [additional plaintiff has come forward](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5757636-MoFo-Plaintiffs-Second-Amended-Complaint.html).

Jane Doe 7, who was added in this second amended complaint, worked in the New York office of MoFo until September 2016. Jane Doe 7 alleges she had excellent work reviews until she took the first of two maternity leaves. When she returned from that first leave on a reduced schedule, she says she received her first negative performance review and was allegedly told, “she did not seem ‘committed enough’ to the firm.”

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/03/04/another-mofo-associate-joins-lawsuit-alleging-mommy-track-bias/) Law.com, it wasn’t until after her second maternity leave that she was ultimately forced out of the firm:

Following her second leave period, the suit alleges that Jane Doe 7 saw partners on her team divert chances to do meaningful work to male associates. About three months after she returned, Morrison & Foerster allegedly informed her that it was time for her to move on. The firm offered her a choice between a two-month probation period in which she could prove her commitment or ultimately be fired, or a three-month window in which she could look for other employment before resigning from the firm.

MoFo continues to strongly contest the allegations in the amended complaint:

“Nothing in plaintiffs’ filing of an amended complaint changes the fact that their allegations are baseless. We are confident in our defense,” the statement said. “We will continue to be one of the top family-friendly law firms, and our diversity and inclusion remains one of our proudest achievements and greatest priorities.”

We will be monitoring this lawsuit closely for any updates.

It’s an action-packed day for the legal profession when a Supreme Court justice announces his imminent retirement, but the Milbank money train stops for no one. Yet another Biglaw firm has decided to adopt the soon-to-be prevailing salary scale for its associates.

Earlier today, Winston & Strawn — a firm that brought in $981,223,000 gross revenue in 2020, placing it at No. 45 on the most recent Am Law 100 — announced that it would be matching Milbank. Here’s the salary scale that should look quite familiar to associates by now:

Class Year

Prior Salary Scale

New Salary Scale

2021

$205,000

$215,000

2020

$215,000

$225,000

2019

$240,000

$250,000

2018

$275,000

$285,000

2017

$305,000

$325,000

2016

$330,000

$350,000

2015

$350,000

$370,000

2014+

$365,000

$385,000

Because the firm’s fiscal year begins on February 1, base salaries for U.S. associates in good standing will be increased on that date.

Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Winston & Strawn.)

# Biglaw Firm Benefits From Lowered Expectations This Bonus Season
## Less-than-market bonuses, but some people are still happy.

Listen, not every firm can afford to pay their associates like the Cravaths of the Biglaw world. That’s okay. As long as the firm is transparent with their associates about their salary/bonus expectations, there’s not even too much that Above the Law can complain about.

But there’s no denying that after years of paying below-market salaries, and offering [tiny raises this summer](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/new-global-law-firm-touts-itself-as-big-player-gives-out-paltry-raises-anyway/?rf=1), associates at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner weren’t expecting the firm to break the bank this bonus season. And well, they didn’t. However, rather than lambasting the firm, at least some tipsters were left pleasantly surprised at the size of their (still not-market) bonuses.

Just look at these words from a glass-half-full-kinda associate:

BCLP bonuses came through today, and I am pleased! It’s much higher than I’d been lead to expect…. And, as a little lagniappe, the bonus will come through at the end of the week!

Well then! Congrats on your bonuses no matter how big they may be.

This is the bonus scale — with the hours threshold for each level — at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner this year:

Senior associates — even those billing the most hours — are looking at a $20,000 – $40,000 deficit compared to their peers at elite Biglaw firms. But I guess that doesn’t seem that bad if you never expected it anyway.

# Has Your Firm Announced Bonuses? Because These $1M+ PPP Firms Haven't

In our effort to keep you and the market writ large aware of associate compensation, we’ve been passing along every tip we learn about Biglaw’s annual associate bonuses. Still, there are some firms that just haven’t given their associates the good news on bonuses yet… almost a month after Biglaw bonus season kicked off.

Or maybe we’ve just had some tipsters who haven’t reached out yet. If you see a firm on this list that has made a bonus announcement, let us know and we’ll get this list amended. There are some firms with notorious black boxes that we can always use more information on — they may have informed associates of bonuses and no one’s talking lest they be outed. If you’re in this boat, at least drop us a line to tell us bonuses have been announced, even if you can’t go into specifics.

Plus, the last time we put this list up, there were three firms that had announced earlier in the week that had never informed Above the Law. It’s possible there are a few stragglers like that again.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
But given the length of this list, we’re genuinely concerned that a lot of associates out there are still sweating to hear about bonuses. That’s not an idle fear this year either — given the summer bonuses that most firms handed out, there’s reason to be concerned that some firm is going to try and “match” the market by deducting the summer figure. Let’s keep them honest.

Without further ado, here are the firms with $1M+ in profits per partner that have not yet announced bonuses to us. If you receive any information about these firms then let us know! Don’t just assume someone else told us. Please [email bonus news to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# This Federal Judge Would Really Like Facebook To Be Consistent When It Comes To Privacy
## Judges don't like a flip-flop.

What you are saying now sounds contrary to the message that Facebook itself disseminates about privacy.

— U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria of the Northern District of California in a hearing in the privacy litigation against Facebook stemming from the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Judge Chhabria [called out the inconsistent statements](https://www.law.com/2019/05/29/in-cambridge-analytica-case-judge-calls-out-facebooks-flip-flopping-privacy-rhetoric/) the social media giant has made, depending on the audience. Facebook’s attorney, Orin Snyder of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, argued that there’s no longer a privacy interest in information people choose to share on Facebook. However, Judge Chhabria was quick to point out that’s not what Facebook has said when [called before ](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2018/04/10/mark-zuckerberg-brings-in-house-legal-lobbying-entourage-to-capitol-hill/)regulators.

# Attorney Layoffs Hit Well-Liked Biglaw Firm

Baker Donelson is used to praise. [Perennially](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/which-biglaw-firms-are-the-best-places-to-work/) ranked on [Fortune’s list](http://fortune.com/best-companies/baker-donelson-32/) of the best places to work, a whopping [93% of employees](http://reviews.greatplacetowork.com/baker-donelson) consider it a good place to work. It has also won recognition as a firm that [values diversity](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/the-best-law-firms-for-diversity-2016/) and is great for [new dads](https://www.fatherly.com/50-best-places-to-work-for-new-dads-the-complete-list-1114921020.html). But today’s news from the firm is much, much different.

We’ve gotten information from a delightfully chatty tipster about layoffs being conducted by Baker Donelson in two of their Florida outposts:

Baker Donelson is conducting layoffs in the Orlando and Ft. Lauderdale offices this week. The attorneys being cut are in the Consumer Finance Litigation and Compliance group. This particular group went on a hiring binge in late 2014/early 2015 when it was swamped with work… The firm lured attorneys and support staff from other firms with the promise of a lot of work for the foreseeable future.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
It seems this practice group had all the work… until it didn’t. When the work stops flowing in, and the practice group starts mysteriously shrinking, well, suspicions run wild:

Everyone on the “[team]” in these offices noticed the slowdown, but the practice group managers in Atlanta assured the Orlando and Ft. Lauderdale [team] that they had nothing to worry about. When attorneys started disappearing from the ranks, there were further assurances that those departures had nothing to do with a lack of work.

Still not going to make most people feel better. And all this is before, according to our source, more formal layoffs commenced. As you can imagine, this has led to a distinct hit to the morale at the firm:

Each of the attorneys who came to the firm were aggressively recruited and some left associate positions at well regarded firms to come to a sinking ship. Now these attorneys, along with support staff, will be looking for new jobs. Even the people who survive the cuts are looking to leave because there is no more trust in management. Finally, some of the attorneys who “left” prior to the official layoffs are communicating with the newly laid off attorneys to see if they were treated similarly. The firm may be dealing with some unhappy former employees if it gets out that the stealthily laid off were not given the same benefits as the more recently laid off.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
When we reached out for comment about the layoffs, Baker Donelson responded:

We have had a limited number of departures for a variety of reasons. We are always mindful of matching our personnel to the needs of our clients and continuously monitor that throughout the firm. This allows us to remain strategic about appropriate staffing with our clients’ needs in mind. With more than 650 lawyers, a few departures can be expected from time to time.

Not that I am one to doubt the authenticity of media statements, but this sounds like a lot of corporate doublespeak. Suffice it to say some lawyers have found themselves involuntarily looking for new jobs.

And naturally there is resentment bubbling from the attorneys who once thought they’d found a great place to work for themselves. The parting shot from our tipster:

So much for Baker Donelson being a great place to work.  Management should focus more on getting clients instead of being highly ranked on meaningless surveys.

# The Biglaw Firms That Strike Fear In The Hearts Of Opposing Counsel (2024)
## These firms are home to the most cutthroat litigators out there.

If you’re working in-house and dealing with bet-the-company litigation, you want the very best litigators in the world to be on your side — especially during times like these. You want a firm with litigators so strong that opponents gasp in fear at the very mention of its name. You want a firm that is known internationally for going for the jugular and coming out on top.

But how can you ensure that you’ve picked the right firm? BTI Consulting Group just made it a little easier with the release of its annual ranking of the firms most likely to trigger dread in opposing counsel, as determined by a poll of in-house counsel. After reviewing all responses, BTI named the “Fearsome Foursome,” the most-feared litigation firms in the country. These are the firms you do not want to see on the other side.

So, which firms are being [honored this year](https://bticonsulting.com/themadclientist/62-law-firms-most-feared-in-litigation) for their ability to strike fear in their opponents’ hearts and minds?

- Quinn Emanuel
- Kirkland & Ellis
- Jones Day
- Gibson Dunn
Per BTI’s Michael Rynowecer, this is why these firms give GCs nightmares:

1. Redefine the Rules
Unbound by established definitions and norms — the most feared firms forge new interpretations of long-standing precedents. They challenge convention and establish a new set of rules — to their client’s benefit.

2. Take on What Others Won’t
New and novel matters are increasingly part of the legal landscape and growing faster than ever before. Some firms stop and wonder if they want to take these matters on. The same is true for thorny issues and conflict-adjacent matters. The most feared firms relish the challenge.

3. Very Early Assessments
New litigations have fewer facts than ever as they unfold. But The Fearsome Foursome operate confidently despite limited known facts. They may adapt, adjust, and pivot, but they get out of the gate quickly and ensure they are on the right track. They share their early assessments with their clients — who see this as a valued differentiator.

4. Unrelenting
Unrelenting isn’t a trait — it’s a way of life. Every obstacle is a test. Setbacks exist as opportunities for the Fearsome Foursome to surmount each one.

5. Link Unconnected Ideas
The Fearsome Foursome excel at linking ideas together — even when the connection is far from obvious. They reframe and reposition their thinking, rigorously considering opposing viewpoints. This unconventional thinking leads to breakthroughs and novel thinking — often the antidote for new and novel complex claims.

The BTI report also named six firms as “Awesome Opponents” — firms with lawyers corporate counsel would prefer to steer clear of in litigation (in alphabetical order):

- Dentons
- Duane Morris
- Husch Blackwell
- Irell & Manella
- Latham & Watkins
- Paul Hastings
BTI has also introduced an additional 43 law firms as “Intimindating Opponents” (i.e., firms clients would “rather not see” in litigation). Click [here](https://bticonsulting.com/themadclientist/62-law-firms-most-feared-in-litigation) to see the full list.

Congratulations to all of these hardworking firms, and good luck to those who oppose them in court — it certainly sounds like you’ll need it.

Back in December, [Steven Ellis](https://www.proskauer.com/professionals/steven-ellis), chairman of Proskauer Rose, announced that he would be [stepping down](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/biglaw-firms-chair-to-step-down-due-to-health-related-reasons/) from his role due to health-related reasons. Ellis was due to lead the firm until its regular election cycle, slated for September 2025, but his sudden decision to bow out from his role set the stage for an election to take place this month. The results of that election are now in, and Proskauer has a new leader, effective April 2024.

Proskauer’s new chair elect is [Timothy Mungovan](https://www.proskauer.com/professionals/timothy-mungovan). He’s worked at the firm for more than a decade and has taken on several leadership roles in the past — not only does he currently serve as chair of the firm’s securities litigation practice and as a member of the firm’s executive committee, but he’s also the immediate past chair of the firm’s litigation department.

In a brief statement given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/01/19/proskauer-elects-litigation-leader-as-next-chair/), Mungovan addressed his predecessor, noting that thanks to Ellis’s “tremendous leadership, Proskauer is experiencing great momentum.” He went on to look to the future, saying, “From cutting-edge transactions to high-stakes litigation and trials, there is significant opportunity across all our practices. I look forward to working with everyone at the firm to continue to execute on our strategic vision.”

In his own statement, Ellis said, “I have every confidence that Tim will continue to drive Proskauer forward as a destination firm for talent and clients across the globe.” During his time serving as the top Biglaw firm’s leader, Ellis responsibly guided the elite firm through the pandemic, including its best year ever in 2021. According to Am Law, the following year, Proskauer grew by 6.1% and saw its best performance to date in terms of total revenue and profits.

Congratulations to Steven Ellis on a job well done, and congratulations to Timothy Mungovan on his rise to the top of the firm.

# Gibson Dunn Says Sanctions Motion Presents 'False And Misleading Account'
## Will this be enough to avoid the roughly $854K sanctions motion?

Gibson Dunn is pushing back after [an unsealed sanctions motion and some very skeptical judge comments](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/gibson-dunn-on-wrong-end-of-854k-sanctions-motion/) earned the firm some unfortunate notoriety. Plaintiffs accused the firm of holding up discovery with one hand, while arguing that further discovery was “too late” with the other.

The Biglaw firm representing “the artist formerly known as Facebook” in the Cambridge Analytica case says the motion presents a false account and that the team is [“mortified” by the judge’s comments](https://www.law.com/2022/04/12/gibson-dunn-mortified-at-possible-sanctions-over-facebook-discovery/), suggesting at hearings that the plaintiffs may have a point when it comes to their discovery complaints.

From the firm’s perspective, “Discovery in this case has not been easy, and has involved numerous disputes between the parties on important and often technically complex issues that have taken time to work through.”

The judge said that Gibson Dunn’s opposition faces a “little bit of an uphill battle” based on what he’s seen so far, so this opposition filing better be epic.

In our original post, we noted that there are perfectly reasonable explanations for some of the alleged missteps. But Judge Chhabria seems inclined to take a dim view of so many issues compounding upon themselves.

We’re looking forward to the upcoming May 19 hearing!

# Lawyers Wonder: Is The Money Worth The Cost?

There’s a very famous bit (at least to dinosaurs and their parents) between the comedian Jack Benny and a thief. (If you don’t know who he is, Google him.) Benny, whose public persona was as a skinflint and who played that part very successfully both on radio and TV, is accosted by a mugger, waving a pistol, who says to Benny, “Your money or your life.” Benny hesitates for a good few seconds.


How would you answer that question? It’s a variation on what I call “is the juice worth the squeeze?” Some lawyers wonder whether the money is worth the cost in many ways.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
How to count the various costs? Let’s see. How about these? Less time, or no time, with family and friends. Lousy health. Physical and mental stressors. Substance abuse. No free time to spend however you want to spend it. No time to travel or volunteer. No time to engage in activities that mean something to you. Hobbies? What are those? How about time to read a book for pleasure or lie on the grass and watch clouds scoot across the sky? Remember, dinosaurs, we did that as kids before video games? The world has changed dramatically since I entered practice more than forty years ago. Is the profession in a better place now? You tell me.

Charles Duhigg, a New York Times investigative business reporter and Harvard MBA, [recently wrote an article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/21/magazine/elite-professionals-jobs-happiness.html) about discontent and unhappiness among the “professional elite.” That group would include us. What Duhigg found, probably not to anyone’s surprise, and certainly not to mine, was that “….there’s no magic salary at which a bad job becomes good.” Can anyone reading this relate to that? Would anyone disagree?

The headline reads “Wealthy, Successful and Miserable.” Based on his conversations and research, Duhigg concluded that factors making us miserable include oppressive hours, political infighting (both backstabbing and what I affectionately like to call “frontstabbing,” when the shiv faces you rather than from the more polite rear), competition due to globalization, and the “always on” culture that the internet has wrought. But Duhigg found that it was more than just those factors that pretty much everyone will agree on are creators of today’s work environment.

So, what constitutes a “good job?” Research shows, says Duhigg, that once you can provide financially for yourself and family (and that depends on the standard of living you have imposed upon yourself), then additional salary and benefits don’t matter. “Much more important are things like whether a job provides a sense of autonomy-the ability to control your time and the authority to act on your unique expertise.” Environments of mutual respect and collaboration enhance the concept of a “good job.” Even in a corporate or law firm environment, a sense of autonomy and the authority to act knowledgeably are possible if you are not micromanaged, a pet peeve of mine and a topic for another time.

Meaning. People want their jobs to be meaningful. For example, when you’re slogging through discovery, it’s hard to find any meaning in reviewing a slew of responses objected to on boilerplate grounds, knowing that you are going to have to “meet and confer” and then file a motion to compel. How much meaning is there in that? And how often is there any “smoking gun” found in discovery? Maybe in a deposition from time to time (“were you lying then or are you lying now?”) but certainly not in written discovery, at least in the years I was doing that. I hated that part of my job. 

What is meaningful? It can be anything, any word, any deed that makes the world better. People want to feel as if what they do matters. Everything does matter, although people rarely take the time to tell others that. And maybe that’s a place to start. People perk up at a word or two of praise. How hard it is to say “good job” when that’s true?

Duhigg’s article should provide comfort and support to all of us who didn’t get into the elite law schools, who didn’t get offers from Biglaw, who often had to bump and fumble around for a while (and yes, I am definitely one of them, remember I went to Whittier Law School.)  Many of Duhigg’s HBS classmates were “also-rans,” who failed to get the jobs they wanted when they finished. What Duhigg learned was that these “also-rans” learned from their own rejections, from their own setbacks, that their failures did not preclude eventual successes, often on their own terms and in their own ways. Maybe we don’t make the most money or even close to it, but many of us “also rans” like what we do, do it well and take pride in so doing. Duhigg’s career is Exhibit A.

Hedging against risk (and we lawyers are notoriously risk-averse), that is, choosing professional degrees and careers that promise “stability,” Duhigg says, is short-sighted. Stability? What passes for stability in our profession these days? Just look at the wreckage of legal careers over the past decade, whether just starting out or [being laid off](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/the-next-recession-is-coming-but-are-biglaw-firms-preparing-for-more-layoffs/) at whatever career point and that’s not to say that there won’t be more pain ahead.  

I have friends who have made very respectable amount of money as lawyers, but who have hated every moment of it. I don’t know whether they’ve found any meaning in what they’ve done. As Duhigg notes, “finding meaning…is difficult work.” And we all know that you can’t bill for that.

# Many Attorneys Practice Defensive Lawyering
## Lawyers might try to take steps to avoid risks and liability in how they run their practices, but this can have an adverse impact on clients.

I was speaking with a physician friend of mine recently about some of the annoying issues my buddy needs to deal with in the medical field. My friend told me that one of the most annoying things physicians need to contend with is defensive medicine. This is the practice of some doctors to try to insulate themselves from malpractice or other grievances by ordering tests that might be excessive, but which will show that the doctor did everything they could to investigate a matter if scrutinized in the future. Although lawyers need to deal with different issues, many attorneys may also feel the need to take certain steps that are primarily motivated to avoid lawsuits, and I have witnessed numerous instances of “defensive lawyering” in my own career.

A lawyer’s primary job is to minimize the risk that their clients will be liable for their conduct. Indeed, clients routinely ask lawyers to evaluate their risk for civil and criminal liability and to fashion ways that they can avoid liability. It therefore naturally flows that lawyers might also try to take steps to avoid risks and liability in how they run their practices, but this can have an adverse impact on clients.

I first witnessed defensive lawyering when I was a young associate working at a midsized law firm. One of the firm’s clients was a group of interconnected companies, and the company names were pretty generic. One of the client’s group of companies got sued, apparently as a mistake. The client’s company name was similar to one of the allegedly responsible parties, so the plaintiff decided to sue the client’s company along with other companies. The client said that it never developed this company, that it had no assets, no bank accounts, nothing. This company had been formed years ago for a purpose that never materialized, and the client just never wound down the entity.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The partner related that it was very unlikely that anything bad would happen to the client if we did not respond to the litigation since the company did not have assets and likely could not be connected to other concerns of the client. However, the partner related that he could not suggest this hands-off strategy. In the off chance that a default judgment was obtained and could stick against another one of the client’s companies that had assets, the lawyer would be in serious trouble for not responding to the litigation.

Accordingly, the client had to spend money to safeguard against the small risk that there would be issues down the line. To be honest, I think the partner made the right call since litigation should generally be responded to and the client did not mind paying the legal fees associated with this strategy. However, this got me thinking about how covering the lawyer’s liability can be part of the decision-making process of many attorneys.

At another time in my career, a lawyer failed to file a document, which seriously jeopardized some of the causes of action we were pursuing in a given case. Partners at the law firm were nervous about the case, and it was eventually decided that we would amend our papers to pursue other causes of action that were not dependent on this given filing. The other causes of action also provided alternative avenues of recovery for the client, and since facts revealed in discovery supported the causes of action, the pleading was eventually amended. After this point, the case became much less about the causes of action that would be difficult to pursue because of the lack of the filing by our office and became more about those new causes of action. The amended pleading was probably a net benefit to the client, and became one of the reasons why the case eventually resolved favorably, but this strategy was definitely borne out due to defensive lawyering over any other reason.

Lawyers are just like the people they represent: they want to do everything they can to limit liability, and this might include taking action that might have little upside for clients. Lawyers should be more aware of this justification for pursuing legal tactics and ensure that the interests of the lawyer and client are well balanced when pursuing a given strategy.

# On Lateral Moves: The Lawyer Gets Paid More, And The Client Gets Screwed

You’ve got a big case going. The case is keeping four lawyers busy at the firm you’ve retained. The relationship partner is good on his feet; he makes all the court appearances. A second partner is the subject matter expert. He knows the case. Behind the scenes, he really matters. And two associates are pulling on the laboring oar.

You’re talking to the relationship partner about the case.

“By the way,” he says, “I’m probably moving to another firm on Friday.  Obviously, we can service your business at either firm, and I’ll be happy to put you in good hands either way.”

That was pretty clean, you think. Maybe he jumped the gun a little bit on the announcement, but it was less gross than the mess that many lawyers make when they switch firms. Of course, one thing really matters.

“Are the other three lawyers going with you?”

“The partner is not. One of the associates will probably be moving.”

Does anyone really think that clients are pleased by this nonsense? I understand that it’s a free world, and all that, but you’re moving to get paid more money, and it’s likely to cost your client a bundle.

As a client, if I go with the new firm, I’m screwed. I’ll lose the guy who actually knows the case, and I’ll lose one knowledgeable associate.

If I stay with the old firm, I’m screwed. I’ll lose the guy who does the court appearances, and I’ll lose a knowledgeable associate.

If I retain both firms, to keep the team together, I’m screwed. Because two plus two never equals four in these situations: Two hours plus two hours somehow equals five hours, and clients end up paying for the extra hour.  People inevitably waste time as new lawyers come up to speed and two different firms try to coordinate with each other.

I know that recruiters love seeing lawyers change firms. It’s how recruiters make money.

And I know that some lawyers love switching firms. They oversell their book of business and get overpaid for a little while. (Hey! Don’t accuse me of being cynical. [Look at the facts](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/where_are_they_now_nearly_half_of_lateral_partner_hires_dont_stay_full_five).)

I know that legal publications love big lateral moves. Between lateral moves and Trump, a magazine can fill a whole issue.

But does anyone ever look at this from the client’s perspective? It is an uncommon move that thrills clients; the typical move causes disruption and increases costs, while providing no benefits. Maybe people should pause to think before changing firms, or maybe firms should offer discounts as lawyers who have switched firms spend more time than necessary to handle the business.

# Judge Threatens Biglaw Partner With Sanctions Over Paternity Leave Request
## The judge's ruling is quite concerning.

One by one, Biglaw firms across the country have realized that in order to recruit and retain the best talent, they need to offer the best perks and policies for a progressive new generation of lawyers. That said, law firms continue to support attorneys who are embarking upon the fantastic journey into parenthood by offering lengthy, gender-neutral parental leave programs. But sadly, the courts these lawyers litigate in are often several steps behind, with judges in various jurisdictions refusing to accommodate continuance requests for child births and adoptions.

Alexander Fumagali — a partner at Lewis Brisbois who’s looking forward to the birth of his first child — now finds himself questioning his career thanks to what’s going on in court surrounding his child’s birth and his parental leave.

Please note the UPDATE below.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Fumagali, 36, is lead counsel in a case representing defendant South Florida Stadium LLC, the entity behind the Miami Dolphins franchise. Miami-Dade Circuit Judge David C. Miller set the case for trial during a time when Fumagali’s child is due. Fumagali has filed motions on three occasions seeking a parental-leave continuance, but Miller has denied them each time, and ruled that a fourth motion would result in sanctions.

In Florida, the Rule of Judicial Administration 2.570 requires judges to grant a presumptive three months of leave for the birth or adoption of a child should a lawyer be lead counsel on a case. Here, Miller has now thrice refused Fumagali’s motions, ruling that “someone else from the law firm will need to try the case if the baby is born at the time this is tried,” and that the case, filed in December 2020, has been in limbo for longer than the time the Florida Supreme Court “has determined to be reasonable for the conclusion of the case.” Fumagali shared his thoughts with the [Daily Business Review](https://www.law.com/dailybusinessreview/2022/09/06/baby-or-client-lawyer-claims-hell-be-denied-paternity-leave-as-judge-threatens-sanctions/):

“If this ruling stands, then other lawyers will have to choose between being present for the birth of their child or giving up their client,” Fumagali, 36, said. “I’m the lead counsel and the client hired me specifically. I love being a lawyer, but more importantly, I want to be a good father and husband. And I don’t know how this is going to affect those duties, which are most important.”

Fumagali is currently deciding whether to challenge Miller’s decision before Florida’s Third District Court of Appeal.

Michael Allen

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors. [Michael Allen](http://www.laterallink.com/about/team/1) is Managing Principal at Lateral Link, focusing exclusively on partner placements with Am Law 200 clients and placements for in-house attorneys.

In 2016, we saw around 8,500 lateral moves in the top Am Law 200 law firms. From this number, associates accounted for around 5,000, partners 2,000, and counsel, 1,300.

As courtesy of Leopard Solutions, a database that we leverage to improve our recruiting performance developed by our good friend Laura Leopard, here is a breakdown of moves within the top 200 law firms by attorney type:


We are seeing an increasing demand in the job market for counsel-level attorneys. In 2016, around 15 percent of the total number of attorneys who moved within the Am Law 200 were at the counsel level. I noticed this trend [back in August 2013](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/08/the-of-counsel-carousel/), and predicted that this portion of the market would just continue to grow, especially as firms are slower to promote into equity ranks.

At Lateral Link, we have successfully stayed ahead of the trends, and probably even helped to establish some of them. When it comes to creating markets for attorneys, one of the most important values that we provide our candidates comes from our ability to leverage information with key decision makers.

[Lateral Link](http://laterallink.com/) is one of the top-rated international legal recruiting firms. With over 14 offices world-wide, Lateral Link specializes in placing attorneys at the most prestigious law firms and companies in the world. Managed by former practicing attorneys from top law schools, Lateral Link has a tradition of hiring lawyers to execute the lateral leaps of practicing attorneys.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

Gabe MacConaill

We have seen Joanna’s letter in The American Lawyer. Her heartbreak is palpable and her words have moved us all. We have nothing but the utmost sympathy and compassion for the family as they grieve the incredibly tragic loss of Gabe. This is a painful reminder of the need to raise awareness and continue providing programs and services to help all lawyers and staff in addressing mental health issues.

— A [spokesperson for Sidley Austin responding](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/11/12/as-attorney-suicides-mount-a-survivor-speaks-out/) to [the heart-wrenching article](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/biglaw-widow-blames-firm-for-husbands-suicide/) by Joanna Litt, widow of Sidley partner Gabe MacConnaill who [died by suicide](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/10/biglaw-partners-death-due-to-self-inflicted-gunshot-wound/) earlier this year, laying some of the blame for her husband’s death at the feet of the Biglaw firm.

Time’s up, Biglaw.

Last week, RollOnFriday reported that a [partner at Baker McKenzie was sanctioned](http://www.rollonfriday.com/TheNews/EuropeNews/tabid/58/Id/5522/fromTab/36/currentIndex/0/Default.aspx), but not fired, after the firm’s investigation into his alleged sexual assault of an associate. When news of this story first broke, we firmly stated that “[a]t some point, time is going to be up for Biglaw. There is going to be a reckoning.” Only a few days have passed, and it appears that the reckoning has come.

The Times, a British publication, reports that Baker McKenzie is now under preliminary investigation by the Solicitors Regulation Authority to assess whether the firm’s actions in this case amounted to professional misconduct. Under the SRA’s code of conduct, the alleged sexual assault should have been immediately reported to the organization. Here are the details, according to [The Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/law-firm-baker-mckenzie-gagged-assault-victim-gtf9tgb8q):

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The regulator pointed out that its code of conduct specifically refers to non-disclosure agreements. It stipulates that “entering into an agreement which would attempt to preclude the SRA or the legal ombudsman from investigating any actual or potential complaint or allegation of professional misconduct” may demonstrate that a law firm is not complying with professional principles.

Officials are also understood to be investigating whether Baker McKenzie reported the incident to the police.

Baker McKenzie is “in dialogue” with the Solicitors Regulation Authority over the alleged sexual assault. A spokesperson gave this statement to the publication:

“As a firm, our values of inclusion and diversity are extremely important to us and we are committed to ensuring the safety and wellbeing of all employees. That is why we are commissioning an independent review of this particular incident and how it was subsequently handled by the firm. The review will also consider how we handle complaints of sexual misconduct and other inappropriate behaviour toward colleagues, to ensure we are guaranteeing the protection of our employees.

“We are really sorry this incident ever happened and we acknowledge we should have handled it better.”

What the Baker McKenzie spokesperson neglected to mention was the fact that the accused partner in the alleged sexual assault “is no longer in the office and will be leaving the firm,” important information that was later relayed to the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/a8333cac-0a88-11e8-8eb7-42f857ea9f09). It’s very significant that the partner was allowed to remain with the firm when this incident was kept under wraps, and now that the details have been leaked to the media, that partner is leaving the firm. One wonders whether the partner is leaving of his own accord, or whether he was forced out by Baker McKenzie management.

Law firms can no longer sweep these issues under the rug. Sexual predators must be held accountable. Men and women alike, both victims and bystanders, must speak up for themselves and speak out on behalf of others because the time to come forward is now. Only together can we inspire the change necessary to stop this disturbing behavior from being so prevalent in the legal profession. Time’s up, Biglaw.

# There's No Going Back: It's Time To Embrace A Hybrid Workplace Model
## Legal departments should embrace a flexible hybrid work arrangement.

It has been a little over two years since the global pandemic took hold and changed our work and personal lives forever.  While we are not completely out of the proverbial woods yet, it does appear that we have made it through the worst of it. As I think about what our lives look like today, I can see very clearly that things have changed dramatically in how in-house lawyers now approach both their work life and their personal life.

During the days of the pandemic, I know I struggled mightily. I was consumed by feelings of loneliness and isolation. It was that loneliness and that isolation that drove me to connect with other lawyers on LinkedIn. Twenty of us even got together to write a [book](https://www.amazon.com/Networked-Distancing-Connections-Cultivate-Businesses/dp/B08M7JBKBN/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3EZA56PXZKPBS&keywords=%23networked&qid=1653825187&sprefix=+networked+%2Caps%2C97&sr=8-1) about our experiences. When our legal team reunited in-person on our college campus, it was truly a joyous occasion for me. The feelings of loneliness and isolation I had during the height of the pandemic melted away instantly.

As our legal team worked to find its footing in the post-pandemic world, however, I came to realize that the way we worked would never be same. While I enjoyed working in-person together again on our college campus, I could see that our entire legal team did not feel the same. They wanted to make our hybrid work arrangement permanent. As it turns out, our legal team is not alone. In a recent survey of 250 in-house legal professionals conducted by [ContractWorks](https://www.lawnext.com/2022/03/survey-legal-departments-failure-to-adopt-technology-forcing-in-house-lawyers-to-return-to-office-despite-clear-preference-for-hybrid.html), 64% of respondents said that they preferred policies that would allow them to work from home. With this article, I have teamed up again with Jon Jelenko and Flo Nicolas to highlight why legal departments should embrace a flexible hybrid work arrangement.

Embracing Hybrid Work As A Retention Tool For Diverse Teams

In-house legal teams clearly have an opportunity to embrace their teams’ overwhelming preference for hybrid work as a way to retain the talent. This is especially true of the younger and more diverse talent that legal departments are desperately trying to attract and retain. In a recent [article](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/hybrid-work-making-it-fit-with-your-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-strategy) by McKinsey & Company, a global management consulting firm, authors Bonnie Dowling, Drew Goldstein, Michael Park, and Holly Price, noted that younger employees (18-34) were 59% more likely to consider leaving their jobs than older employees if hybrid work wasn’t an option. Far from being just a millennial trait, these authors noted that black employees were 14% more likely to consider leaving their jobs than their white counterparts, and LGBTQ+ employees were 24% more likely to consider leaving their jobs than their heterosexual counterparts if those jobs didn’t support a hybrid work option.

Legal teams would do well to take note that there are compounding effects beyond simply losing or failing to attract this diverse talent, as diversity and inclusion is also significant driver of retention and performance. The same McKinsey article reported that employees were 47% more likely to stay with their organization if it was inclusive and 90% more likely to go out of their way to help a colleague if they work in an inclusive organization.

When I talked to Jon and Flo about writing this article, Flo confirmed for me and for Jon that working in a predominantly white legal department can be highly stressful. Although working from home doesn’t entirely diminish that pressure completely, it may actually relieve the stress of feeling alone and not having to “code-switch” (changing one’s behavior to fit in by assimilating the acceptable culture) when working in-person.

Now that companies are calling their teams back to work, surveys show that people of color have expressed a desire to continue with the hybrid blend of in-office and remote work that started during the pandemic. Many people of color who thrived and flourished working remotely may feel overwhelmed by the thought of working in office environments that lack serious representation of diverse cultures.

As we move forward, legal departments can no longer use traditional DEI initiatives alone. They must act to promote diversity and inclusion. As Sheela Subramanian and Ella F. Washington note in their February 25, 2022, article, “[Why Flexible Work is Essential to Your DEI Strategy,”](https://hbr.org/2022/02/why-flexible-work-is-essential-to-your-dei-strategy) to “make good on recent public commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion, organizations must invest in initiatives that actively support their employees of color, and they can start by making pandemic-era flexibility a permanent offering for all.” While I may have found it lonely working remotely, my experience is not an experience shared by all.

In our next article, Jon, Flo, and I will delve into how legal team leaders can embrace technology to keep their teams connected and enable them to be efficient in any environment, but especially in a remote environment.

That’s really the only drama left with these announcements.

Bonuses will go out to associates on track for their billable minimums. Associates who miss out in April have the opportunity to catch up in October.

But that’s not the only exciting news from Pillsbury. As the memo notes:

We are considering additional ways to both reward your hard work and address the stresses many of you have described. We welcome your ideas and will be sharing information soon.

Here’s your chance, Pillsbury team. Get the firm on board with special gifts [to rival Davis Polk’s offerings](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/grading-all-the-davis-polk-gift-bonuses/). Not just for yourselves but for the entire legal community. Because if the last two weeks have taught us nothing else, it’s that Davis Polk will keep raising the bar to not be outdone by anyone else.

# Sullivan & Cromwell Joins The Salary Discussion

We’re entering the stage of the raise cycle where we start hearing from associates wondering why their firm hasn’t moved yet and whether or not that’s something they should be more worried about. And while it would make for great Above the Law fodder to muse that every firm that didn’t announce raises last week is secretly hemorrhaging money and marching to the Dewey Hall of Shame, the reality is that it’s not July 1 yet and firms still have time to make announcements.

Sure, it’s great to be an early mover. It builds a lot of goodwill to flex the compensation muscle early and prove you have what it takes to run with the leaders. And no one wants to be the last to move either. But in the vast in-between, there’s not really much incentive to move because whether a firm moved on day one or day 15 is going to be lost in the ether by the end of the summer.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Sullivan & Cromwell was one of the firms that hadn’t moved yet, despite all of its supposed peers moving already. But now it has and everything is back to normal.

S&C doesn’t put out a memo of lockstep raises, but the tips we’ve gotten so far track the market, so we’ll offer with all appropriate grains of salt this approximation of the new S&C salary scale.



Notably absent from the good news are the S&C counsel. We’re hearing that counsel will not partake of these raises, just as they didn’t partake of the special bonuses. These combined slights creates the awkward gap where eighth-years could take home $30K more than special counsel several years their senior. Yikes.

# Jones Day To Prepare For A Bad PR Campaign The Likes Of Which They've Never Seen Before

Oh boy! There’s already a[ bunch of shit being piled on Jones Day](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/even-jones-day-lawyers-are-giving-trumps-election-lawsuits-some-serious-side-eye/) for their role in enabling the legal fantasies of Donald Trump and pretending that the Supreme Court will deliver the election to Trump. And, rightly so. [Not the first](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/jones-day/) (or last) time Above the Law has[ called out the Biglaw giant](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/the-biglaw-firms-doing-trumps-election-bidding/), but in the grand media pond, we are relatively niche fish — we’re a bunch of former lawyers writing to an audience of practicing lawyers, after all — and it’s been great to see mainstream sources dunking on Jones Day.

And it’s about to get so much worse.

I’ve had my[ issues with the GOP never-Trumpers turned political action committee, the Lincoln Project](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/the-lincoln-project-got-every-damn-thing-they-wanted/), and I stand by the position that liberals should be wary of any “help” from them. But. But, well, this is going to be fun. Today, Greg Sargent at the Washington Post [reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/11/10/inside-lincoln-projects-new-campaign-targeting-trumps-law-firm/) that the PAC is launching an ad campaign attacking Jones Day.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Televised anti-Jones Day ads? You know Above the Law is here for that.

The new [@ProjectLincoln](https://twitter.com/ProjectLincoln?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) campaign will also target Jones Day's clients.

“I’d like to know how General Motors justifies working with a company that’s aggressively seeking to undermine the validity of a free and fair election,"" [@TheRickWilson](https://twitter.com/TheRickWilson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) tells me.[https://t.co/ugh4Rhqr5u](https://t.co/ugh4Rhqr5u) [pic.twitter.com/Dnx2nFvxo7](https://t.co/Dnx2nFvxo7)

— Greg Sargent (@ThePlumLineGS) [November 10, 2020](https://twitter.com/ThePlumLineGS/status/1326192891971112961?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

The Lincoln Project has said that they will continue to advocate for expanded voting rights and anti-voter suppression laws even in a post-Trump world. And as Sargent notes, this is part of that effort:

“These people have now decided that attempting to undermine the outcome of a just and fair election is perfectly acceptable for their legal practices,” Rick Wilson, GOP strategist and co-founder of the Lincoln Project told me, in a reference to Jones Day and other firms representing Trump and the GOP.

Wilson said the Lincoln Project will “bring a light on that,” noting that such efforts  help Trump in “waging law fare against the American people.”

Oh, and it gets better: there’re also going after Jones Day’s clients. As Wilson says, “I’d like to know how General Motors justifies working with a company that’s aggressively seeking to undermine the validity of a free and fair election.”

Some of these 78 lawyers, are they going to have a landing spot? Probably not. There aren’t a lot of immediate openings for ECVC [emerging company, venture capital] or capital markets. They might need to reposition, go down market or in-house. Big Law opportunities will be scarce.

— Nick Goseland, a Bay Area legal recruiter at Macrae, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/12/06/whats-next-for-cooleys-laid-off-attorneys-and-staff/), on what the lawyers who were recently laid off at Cooley should be expecting when it comes to their futures in the legal profession. Last month, [Cooley laid off 150 employees total](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/cooley-layoffs-2022/), citing the need to deal with the firm’s “overcapacity.”

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Biglaw Firms Must Conduct More Layoffs, Before It's Too Late
## Layoffs are a necessary part of the law firm life cycle. Don't tempt fate.

For years now, law firm leaders have not been laying off enough lawyers to protect their profitability. This is the startling conclusion that’s been drawn from a [recent report](http://www.altmanweil.com/dir_docs/resource/95e9df8e-9551-49da-9e25-2cd868319447_document.pdf) released by Altman Weil, a law firm consultancy.

Altman Weil surveyed 356 law firms — including 49 percent of the largest 350 firms in the country, and 48 percent of the Am Law 200 — and according to the report, 59.5 percent of leaders from those large firms said overcapacity was hurting their bottom line. As the report notes, the larger the firm, the larger the problem, with 75.6 percent of leaders from law firms of 250 lawyers or more claiming that an overabundance of lawyers was diluting their profits. This information, coupled with the fact that 62 percent of law firm leaders said that demand for legal services has not yet rebounded from pre-recession levels, could be a recipe for disaster.

Biglaw firms haven’t been laying off attorneys en masse, like the [Great Lathaming of 2009](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/02/nationwide-layoff-watch-latham-cuts-440-190-associates-250-staff/), but that doesn’t mean they’ve stopped stealthily conducting layoffs. As we know from our wealth of tipsters, some firms have been conducting stealth layoffs for years. About 96 percent of law firm leaders reported that their firms had employed under-performing lawyers, and approximately 73 percent said that the way they’ve been dealing with those chronic under-performers is by removing them from the firm.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Which lawyers have been (or should be) the primary targets of these cuts? It seems that Biglaw firms have a nonequity partner problem. Here’s more information from the [Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/home/id=1202758021650/Too-Many-Lawyers-Report-Faults-Firms-for-Resisting-Layoffs?mcode=1202617075486&curindex=4):

The overcapacity issue appears to be most acute among nonequity partners, the Atlman Weil report found. “Nonequity partners present the most obvious target for law firm rightsizing, as that class has been allowed to grow larger than current economics and likely future demand can justify,” the authors wrote.

Only 19.8 percent of survey respondents from large firms said that their nonequity partners were “sufficiently busy.” By comparison, 78.9 percent of large firm leaders surveyed said that their associates were sufficiently busy.

“The role and value of nonequity partners is in flux,” one anonymous firm leader said in the survey. “They fill needs now, but their value in the future is uncertain.”

In case you’re wondering whether you should be worried about your law firm’s stability and your continued employment, things haven’t gone sideways for Biglaw quite yet — after all, with 5.8 percent revenue growth, law firms just had their [best quarter in the past eight years](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/law-firms-have-best-quarter-in-8-years/), the highest law firms have seen since before the 2008 recession. “The world is not falling apart,” said Eric Seeger, an Altman Weil principal and the author of the report. So go ahead, keep rallying for that [first-year base salary increase to $190,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-who-will-lead-the-charge/), but please keep in mind that with those compensation bumps may come the waves of layoffs needed to sustain your firm’s profitability.

Layoffs are a necessary part of the law firm life cycle. With too much disruption, the legal industry could be looking at an extinction-level event in years to come. Don’t tempt fate.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# This Am Law 100 Firm Has Reversed All Salary Cuts, And Is Making Good On Promise Of Back Pay

The COVID-19 winds have really changed at the Biglaw firm of Pillsbury Winthrop. The firm, which placed 62nd in the most recent Am Law 100 rankings, was early in the trend of rolling back their austerity measures, and now those cuts are completely over.

Back in the spring, the firm made series of [austerity cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/am-law-100-firm-cuts-pay-for-all-to-avoid-covid-19-layoffs/), designed to avoid layoffs, that included reducing partner monthly draws by a minimum of 25 percent, cutting associate and counsel compensation by 20 percent, and cutting all staff compensation by up to 15 percent for those who make more than $100,000 and by 10 percent for those making between $75,000 and $100,000 (with chief officers volunteering to take higher reductions, commensurate with those of partners). In August, [Pillsbury began the process of rolling back the measures](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/am-law-100-firm-rolls-back-salary-cuts-pledges-to-repay-employees-in-full/) by reducing the salary cuts and pledging to pay everyone back the money they missed out on.

Now the firm has completely reversed course. As of October 2, all of the salary cuts are officially over. What’s more, those promised payments of rebates of withheld pay have also been made — a feat the firm credits to its  strong year-to-date performance.

Orientation for first-year students at law schools across the country begins in a few weeks, and most incoming students are dreaming about the $180K salaries they believe they’re sure to receive upon snagging a Biglaw job — and luckily for them, Biglaw hiring seems to be up. For those of you who wish to keep the Biglaw fantasy alive, we’ve compiled a list of all of the law firms that have extended offers to 100 percent of their most recent summer associate classes.

How many first-year associates in large law firms across America will soon be cashing in on those extravagant $180K paychecks? If you’re an incoming law student, we’ve got some information that’ll help you answer that question.

Following up on last week’s post on [Biglaw offer rates](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/summer-associate-offer-rates-2017-make-way-for-more-record-hiring/), here are more firms that have given offers to all of their summer associates:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Congratulations to everyone on their offers. If you’re an incoming law student, you may someday know the joy of what it’s like to receive a Biglaw offer.

If you have offer rate additions to this list to share or if you have corrections to the list — e.g., an office listed above that does NOT belong on the 100 percent list — please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Summer%20Associate%20Offer%20Rates) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Summer Associate Offer Rates”), or text us (646-820-8477). We keep our tipsters anonymous. If and when we receive enough information, we’ll do another follow-up.

Right now, it’s more newsworthy if a firm does NOT have a 100 percent offer rate than if it does. On that note, please let us hear about firms that are NOT issuing offers to all their summer associates. If you know of a firm or an office with an unusually low offer rate — which we will arbitrarily define here as something under 66 percent, or two-thirds — please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Low%20Offer%20Rate) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Low Offer Rate”). If we hear about any firms with particularly low offer rates, we will investigate and perhaps write a story.

# Law Firms Trying Not To Go Bankrupt This Next Recession
## The recession hit Biglaw hard and they aren't interested in going through that again.

While superficially the economy continues to slowly inch forward, cracks in the foundation are becoming increasingly glaring to anyone willing to look. With the last recession still fresh in their minds, law firms are committed to not entering this next downturn with their pants around their ankles like last time.

When the last recession hit, a bunch of once-stable law firms got curb-stomped by reality when the check came due on their heavily leveraged lifestyle. Firms were borrowing big from banks and living high on generous lines of credit. It allowed firms to fool themselves into thinking they’d survive the economic catastrophe working its way through their clients and that rosy revenue projections would keep the cash flowing. [Dewey know how that turned out](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/10/14/the-collapse-2)?

American Lawyer has a new piece highlighting how firms have spent the intervening years turning away from the banks and [toward keeping more capital in-house](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/11/07/law-firm-debt-levels-shrink-as-partners-put-more-skin-in-the-game/):

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“The debt load carried by firms today is quite a bit different from the debt load that was carried by firms in 2008 and 2009,” [Citi Private Bank Law Firm Group Managing Director Michael] McKenney said, looking at a sample of 60 law firms in the Am Law 100, which does not include any firms that completed significant mergers or acquisitions in the past 10 years.

Among that sample, he said, bank debt per equity partner was $94,000 at the end of 2008. At the end of 2018, bank debt per equity partner was $57,000 at the same 60 firms.

But on the flip side, McKenney said, capital contributions per equity partner have jumped, from $330,000 in 2008 to $549,000 in 2018. The increase is due in part to law firms’ success in recent years, he noted, as capital contributions are often taken as a percentage of a partner’s earnings.

Upping the ante and lowering the debt is all well and good, but the comparison missing from this analysis is the slashing of the equity partner ranks over the last decade. If bumping up capital contributions per partner by 66 percent is impressive, but if that move corresponded with reducing equity partner headcount by 30-40 percent, it’s not as big a leap as it would seem.

Whether it’s these increased contributions or a general belt tightening elsewhere, it’s definitely enough to reduce firm debt loads which is all that’s important. Still, the consolidation of the firm’s capital in the hands of fewer and fewer equity partners does make the firm more reliant on those partners for its financial wherewithal. At a certain point, a firm puts itself in the unenviable position of a five-partner poaching representing a significant dent in the firm’s rainy day funds. There are advantages to spreading out the risk.

But this is all academic if the recession guts demand so badly that firms can’t keep revenue coming in the door. As we watch the barbarians gather at the gates, law firms are furiously repairing their ramparts. We’ll learn whether or not they’re successful soon enough.

# Should Christmas Eve Be A Firm Holiday?
## Is this a perk or something we should be doing as a default?

Joe and Elie discuss the major headlines in law firm news. Paul Weiss found itself in hot water after putting out a picture promoting its new partnership class of predominantly white dudes. It’s a lesson in the damage visuals can cause… and how to address incidents like this. Jones Day inserted itself… again… into the war on workers by entering the Slate labor dispute. And does your firm give the staff Christmas Eve off? Shouldn’t everyone be doing this?

# How To Plan An Informational Interview
## Here are 12 tips if you’re asking for an informational interview and would like to be respectful of your interviewee’s time.

Recently, I shared some [job search tips](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/tips-for-finding-your-first-legal-job/) for lawyers seeking their first legal jobs or those looking to re-enter the legal workforce. One tool I mentioned that can be helpful when looking to break into a market is the informational interview.

Here are 12 tips if you’re asking for an informational interview and would like to be respectful of your interviewee’s time. (Note: I refer to the person you’re hoping to speak with as the “interviewee” rather than the “interviewer” because, in an informational interview, you are the person asking questions to obtain information from the interviewee. Remember that this is not a job interview, in which you are on the receiving end of the questions.)

1. Send an initial e-mail or LinkedIn message that:

a. makes it clear that you are asking for an informational interview and on what topic(s),
b. offers enough background on yourself as necessary, but as succinctly as possible,
c. shows how you are connected or how you came across the interviewee’s profile,
d. states the time commitment you are looking for (no more than 20-30 minutes!),
e. offers several time slots when you are available but invites the interviewee to offer alternative times, and
f. asks permission to send your resume and a list of questions you’d like to ask. Follow up with these items only after the person has agreed to speak with you, but at least a day in advance of the call.

2. Be sure your messages are free of any typos and include a proper signature block and link to your LinkedIn profile. Do not, however, shower the person with so much information or a full job application bundle such that it seems like “homework” just to navigate your request.

3. If you do not hear back from the prospective interviewee, it’s okay to follow up, but wait 7-10 days. No one likes a follow-up 12 hours later when you are asking for a favor.

4. You may offer to speak by phone or by Zoom, but make it the interviewee’s choice; do not push a Zoom meeting on someone. Offer to send a calendar invite. If you do offer a Zoom meeting, be prepared to send a meeting link.

5. Be prepared to take the lead in the conversation. It’s fine to remind the interviewee of your basic experience, but do not waste time repeating your whole resume.

6. Keep the informational interview to the time frame you requested.

7. Follow the interviewee’s cues as to how formal or informal your conversation will be, but err on the side of treating this like an actual interview. It’s great practice for a true interview!

8. Take notes if you can, but above all, be sure to LISTEN to the answers to your questions. There’s nothing more annoying than plodding through a list of pre-ordained questions when some have already been answered earlier in the conversation.

9. At the end of your interview, ask if there is anyone else the interviewee recommends you speak with, including anyone they might introduce you to. Ask for their suggestions on next steps.

10. As I discussed recently in [The Importance of Authentic Networking](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/the-importance-of-authentic-networking/), any networking or relationship building must be a two-way street. Always ask your interviewee if there is anything you can assist them with. It may be something as small as sharing a link to an article they might enjoy or sharing news of your shared alma mater. Just be sure to ask how you can reciprocate. And ask permission to stay in touch and ask what method they prefer.

11. Be sure to follow-up with an immediate thank you message the day of the interview. Send any articles or reciprocity you’ve promised. Connect with the individual on LinkedIn if you haven’t already.

12. If your interviewee agrees that you should stay in touch, stay in touch! If you’re conducting multiple informational interviews, you may consider keeping a spreadsheet with names of interviewees, notes on your conversations, and reminders to follow up every few months.

If used correctly, the informational interview can be a powerful tool for you in your job search. Good luck!

# Second Woman Accuses Former DLA Piper Partner Of Inappropriate Behavior
## She alleges she was ""afraid"" of the partner.

Louis Lehot

A second woman, this one a former Human Resources manager at the firm, has come forward with allegations of inappropriate behavior against former DLA Piper partner Louis Lehot. The woman anonymously [filed a complaint](http://www.wigdorlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EEOC-Supplement-to-Charge-10.21.2019-Final-Filed.pdf) with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging Lehot intimidated her and that she was “physically afraid” to be around him, going so far as to say she was uncomfortable being in the building when Lehot was in the office.

The HR manager further alleges that when she complained about Lehot’s inappropriate behavior[ she was told](http://www.wigdorlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EEOC-Supplement-to-Charge-10.21.2019-Final-Filed.pdf) “Louis is just Louis.” She also says that despite a history of positive performance reviews she was fired from the firm after she complained about Lehot.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Earlier this month, DLA Piper partner Vanina Guerrero released an open letter to the firm, and filed a complaint with the EEOC, [alleging that Lehot, repeatedly sexually assaulted her.](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/dla-piper-partner-accused-of-sexual-assault-by-fellow-partner/) She also wants the firm to release her from their mandatory arbitration agreement so she can pursue her claims in court. The firm has been conspicuously silent on the forced arbitration agreement — despite the [attention their arbitration stance](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/kamala-harris-gets-dragged-into-dla-piper-sexual-assault-controversy/) in this case [has garnered](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/law-school-students-protest-outside-of-dla-piper-over-alleged-sexual-assault/), but, they did announce that Lehot had been [let go from the firm.](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/dla-piper-partner-out-amid-sexual-assault-allegations/) Then the firm put Guerrero on [leave](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/now-the-dla-piper-accuser-has-been-put-on-leave/), saying they’d uncovered allegations unrelated to Lehot during their investigation of her claims. Lehot[ released a statement yesterday](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/dla-piper-partner-accused-of-sexual-assault-speaks-out/) contesting the allegations against him and saying Guerrero was “exploiting” the #MeToo movement.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/10/21/second-woman-files-eeoc-claim-about-former-dla-piper-partner/) Law.com, Jeanne Christensen, partner at Wigdor who represents both women, took the opportunity to lash out at the firm’s response to the allegations against Lehot, saying, “The era of DLA Piper protecting its male rainmaking partners at the expense of the physical and emotional safety of the firm’s female employees must come to an end.” She went on to say:

“How many more women must come forward with tales of abuse by Louis Lehot before DLA Piper stops retaliating against female employees who dare report misconduct by male partners?” said Wigdor partner Jeanne Christensen, who represents both women. “Having now watched DLA Piper engage in a public campaign of victim-blaming and retaliation against Ms. Guerrero, it would come as no surprise if other women at DLA Piper with relevant information are terrified of coming forward,” she said in a prepared statement.

DLA Piper responded to the latest round of allegations, saying this development was designed to distract from the firm’s investigation into Guerrero and contesting the allegations:

“Consistent with Ms. Christensen’s previous communications with the media, her most recent letter is filled with inaccuracies and falsehoods, which will be demonstrated through the proper channels at EEOC,” the firm said.

Lehot has not yet responded to these new allegations.

# Biglaw Associate Gets His Protest-Related Charges Dropped, Hopes His Case Will Help Other Peaceful Protesters

On June 5, Debevoise & Plimpton associate [Justin Maffett](https://www.debevoise.com/justinmaffett) was peacefully protesting racial injustice in the wake of the murder of George Floyd when he was arrested and [charged with breaking New York City’s curfew](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-associate-arrested-for-breaking-curfew-after-protest-has-his-firms-support-for-now/). That curfew violation was a class B misdemeanor and carried with it not just a potential six-month prison sentence, but if found guilty, Maffett would have a criminal record.

More than a thousand others received summonses for curfew violations, and over 60 percent were issued to Black or Latinx people, including Maffett. But unlike many of those who were arrested, Maffett had some very powerful representation. Helen Cantwell, a white-collar partner at Debevoise and a former assistant U.S. attorney at the Southern District of New York, stepped up to serve as his defense lawyer, also offering her counsel to any other Debevoise employees arrested during the protests.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Although Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance said his office would forgo the prosecution of low-level offenses related to the protests (e.g., unlawful assembly or disorderly conduct) the charges still remain for many, and those who were arrested for breaking the emergency curfew are still fighting their charges — but not Maffett. After a series of exchanges with the New York Office of Court Administration (OCA), his charges were dismissed.

“I can’t say whether I was treated differently. But I do acknowledge that not everyone has a former prosecutor like Helen in their corner or a billion-dollar law firm at their back. It isn’t lost on me that this played a role here,” he said in an [interview with the American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/09/24/after-getting-his-protest-related-charges-dropped-debevoise-lawyer-hopes-to-help-others/), where he details his experience of being arrested while protesting. “But we didn’t advocate this just for myself, but for all of those charged, because we can do something there. And because we can, I believe strongly that we should.”

In an op-ed published in the [New York Law Journal](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2020/09/24/debevoise-associate-nyc-should-dismiss-curfew-charges-against-peaceful-protesters-like-me/), Maffett argues that all curfew-related summonses levied against peaceful protesters should be dismissed. “It does not take a law degree” to see why it would be in the interest of justice, he writes.

Protesters should not face different legal consequences just because they were out protesting during the one week the curfew was in place. This is arbitrary and does not inspire confidence in our legal system.

For far too many New Yorkers, justice has been delayed and due process has almost come to a halt. If cases are not immediately dismissed, these arrests made by the NYPD in response to the protests will only serve to exacerbate this mounting crisis. Our court system should not be clogged with cases involving these nonviolent, low-level issues, nor should everyday New Yorkers be forced to continue to pay attorney fees, take days off work, or make arrangements for child care in order to defend themselves against such claims. The city should instead focus its limited resources toward more urgent needs.

Maffett’s court documents are currently under seal, but he has disclosed them to Above the Law, with his firm’s permission. He thinks their publication is in the public’s interest because it will provide a roadmap to other lawyers working on these curfew cases to make similar arguments. They are available on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2020/09/New-York-v.-Maffett-2020.pdf).

“I believed then, and still believe today, that all of these charges should be dismissed in the interest of justice,” Maffett says. We hope that, armed with the arguments made in his own case, others will be able to get their charges dismissed as well.

* Despite facing uncertainties, per a recent Am Law survey conducted before the election, the vast majority of law firm leaders are moderately optimistic about how 2017 will pan out for their firms and more than a quarter of them expect profits per partner to grow by more than 5 percent. Unfortunately, “the reality for most firms is not as sunny.” [[American Lawyer](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202772551063/Survey-Big-Law-Leaders-Say-Theyre-Bullish-on-2017?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL&slreturn=20161028222950)]

* This situation reads like a bad law school final: Brooklyn Law Professor [Samuel Murumba](https://www.brooklaw.edu/faculty/directory/facultymember/biography.aspx?id=samuel.murumba) is asserting his rights as a tenant by squatting in a waterfront apartment building that was once owned by the law school and later sold to a real estate developer for $35 million. In an almost comical twist of fate, the law school, which is being sued for $2 million, is now trying to evict a professor who teaches property law.

* President-elect Donald Trump has added a seasoned antitrust attorney to his transition team for the Department of Justice. David Higbee of Hunton & Williams worked for the Bush administration from 2001 to 2005, where he spent his final year in the Antitrust Division. He’s one of two transition team members with antitrust experience, and his appointment could mean a “hands-off approach to antitrust enforcement.” [[Reuters](http://reuters.com/article/USLegal/idUSL1N1DU00K?il=0)]

* “Part of my job is to worry and ask, ‘Are we doing everything we can so the American public can go about their day without it having to be a constant worry?'” Will this University of San Diego School of Law graduate be the next Homeland Security secretary? According to anonymous sources, Frances “Fran” Townsend under consideration for the top homeland security position. [[San Diego Union-Tribune](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/the-conversation/sd-who-is-frances-townsend-20161128-htmlstory.html)]

* Following a conviction for misdemeanor DWI, City Court Judge Leticia Astacio of Rochester, New York, violated the terms of her sentence by admitting she again drank alcohol and is no longer allowed in any non-public areas of any courthouse after being stripped of all of her duties. She’ll continue to collect her $173,700 annual salary for her position, even though she’s not permitted to perform her job.

# It's Time For More Money At This Top 50 Biglaw Firm

Did your firm match the Cravath scale yet? How about the Davis Polk scale or the Milbank scale? If your firm has matched either of the prior salary scales, there’s a high likelihood that Cravath cash will soon be headed your way, so just try your best to be patient.

Associates at Dechert — which came in at No. 37 in the most recent Am Law 100 after taking home $1,071,163,000 gross revenue in 2020 — no longer need to be patient. Earlier this week, the firm announced a Cravath match. If you recall, the firm announced a [Davis Polk match](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/top-50-biglaw-firm-offers-associates-more-cold-hard-cash-with-dpw-match/) back in February. Here’s what associates can expect their compensation to look like (retroactive to January):



Raises for counsel are still on a case-by-case basis at the firm. How is your firm handling salary increases for counsel? Please let us know so these attorneys aren’t kept in the dark.

One again, congratulations to everyone at Dechert!

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

Gibson “Done” the thing that is!

OK that one was a stretch. Anyway Gibson Dunn has announced raises and bonuses. This is your number 9 firm per the ALM 200 with $2,736,637,000 in gross revenue last year. And despite all those big bucks clients, the story that’s kept the firm most in our minds of late is the hard work they’ve [done on behalf of the Markel family](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/9-years-after-law-professor-murdered-jury-finds-charlie-adelson-guilty/) as the state works its way up the chain in that murder-for-hire scheme.

It’s a full match with those off the grid receiving a separate notification. No date is provided for payout date.

Anyway, the firm is doing the matching thing… here you go!



Congrats.

The real estate market has been on a roller coaster through the pandemic, seeing dramatic highs and lows as both buyers and sellers learned to navigate ongoing uncertainties.

PLI has put together a one-day program titled [Negotiating Real Estate Deals 2022](https://www.pli.edu/programs/negotiating-real-estate-deals?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2), where Program Chairs Martin Polevoy of DLA Piper and Jon Mechanic of Fried Frank, some of the nation’s most respected real estate lawyers, and a group of expert faculty will share battle-tested tips and techniques for negotiating even the most complex transactions. 

This informative, interactive program will combine prepared presentations with audience engagement to cover issues including:  

- The key changes in the real estate market in 2022
- How the real estate space is developing in the growing Bio-tech industry
- Purchase agreements and what you need to know about them before closing a deal
- How to structure and utilize Joint Ventures for real estate transactions
- Strategic negotiation skills for loan workouts

- Commercial Property-Assessed Clean Energy (C-PACE) Financing
- The negotiation of loan workouts
- Case law on promissory note issues, including lender liability
- Key issues in mezzanine lending
- Communicating with ratings agencies

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Women Lawyers Left Behind In Patent Courts, But Some Law Firms Buck The Trend
## Men dominate patent litigation, but women come out on top at several firms.

Women may often be seen in courtrooms, but they’re rarely heard. In fact, according to a study released last month by the New York State Bar Association, no matter the level or type of court, women attorneys continue to be [shut out from speaking roles](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/women-continue-to-be-shut-out-as-lead-counsel/), accounting for only 25 percent of lead counsel roles.

But what happens when we look to more specialized courts dealing with specific practice areas? The team at Docket Alarm looked to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) to analyze how women fared in terms of speaking roles, but the results were quite disappointing. Here’s a stunning quote from Docket Alarm’s study, which was recently published at [Patently-O](https://patentlyo.com/patent/2017/09/analytics-litigation-diversity.html):

[P]atent litigation is dominated by male attorneys. Of the top 100 law firms, 55 have less than 10% female attorneys on cases, and 8 firms have never had a single female attorney work on their PTAB AIA-Trial cases. On average, attorney appearances are only 12% female. When representing patent owners, the percentage of female attorneys drops further to 9.8%.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
This is incredibly disheartening for women who may be interested in pursuing a career in patent law, but thankfully, there are several firms where women’s appearances and speaking roles in PTAB cases are plentiful:

Rank	Firm	Percentage Female
1	Osha Liang	72%
2	Goodwin Proctor	48%
3	Crowell & Moring	47.3%
4	McCarter English	46.7%
5	Arnold & Porter	42%
According to Docket Alarm, there are a few more firms that qualify as runners-up in terms of women’s appearances on America Invents Act (AIA) trial matters before PTAB. At least 25 percent of the attorneys who argue in favor of their clients before PTAB at these firms are women: Kasha Law; Covington & Burling; Mayer Brown; Drinker Biddle & Reath; Ascenda Law Group; Keker & Van Nest; Ropes & Gray; WilmerHale; and Venable.

It’s obvious that there is still much, much more work to be done to improve women’s footing in patent practice and their representation of clients before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. Change can’t come quickly enough, but we must congratulate these few firms for standing up, standing out, and bucking the trend by highlighting their women lawyers’ talents. More firms should strive to diversify their high-level patent practices like these firms. On behalf of all women who are interested in patent law, we thank you.

# Biglaw Firm Unveils Plan To Do Away With Billable Hours As A Metric To Evaluate Associate Performance
## One Biglaw firm has a plan in the works to put an end to the tyranny of the billable hour.

The billable hour can be a harsh mistress. But in a lot of Biglaw firms, it is the primary mechanism by which associates are able to gauge their performance. Many firm have hours thresholds that need to be met in order to qualify for an annual bonus, and high-billing associates are generally regarded as go-getting, rising stars at the firm.

Of course, there are lots of problems with that model. It certainly isn’t one that encourages efficiencies and clients have taken issue with that fact. Now one Biglaw firm has a plan in the works to put an end to the tyranny of the billable hour.

Clifford Chance has [announced](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/05/02/clifford-chance-looks-to-scrap-billable-hours-as-appraisal-metric-396-13417/) a pilot program that will judge the performance of associates on a combination of knowledge, thought leadership, innovation, pro bono work, and business development. The year-long program is being launched in the firm’s Dubai and Abu Dhabi offices. Associates in those offices will still diary their time, which will give the firm valuable comparative data and create client time sheets as needed.

[Caroline Firstbrook](https://www.cliffordchance.com/people_and_places/people/directors/caroline-firstbrook.html), chief operating officer of the firm, said of the program:

“While utilization is widely used as a core metric across the industry, it has a number of broadly acknowledged limitations, most notably that it does not directly incentivize efficiency or contributions to nonbillable work that may be invaluable to the firm’s overall strategy and to the continued development of exceptional client service.

“By running a pilot on this scale, with a large number of data points, associate input and partner and management feedback, we expect to be in a position to draw informed conclusions on the way ahead for the firm. The Middle East partners and leadership team are taking a bold and exciting step here that will provide insights into these questions that have simply not been available to us before now.”

Hopefully the program will only grow.

Nearly 1,200 attendees packed the Diplomat Beach Resort in Hollywood, Florida, late last month for the Legal Marketing Association’s annual gathering.

The agenda was filled with programs exploring niche areas — ESG guidance for firms, the science behind rainmaking, and DEI communications best practices, to name a few.

A keynote by the author Laura Gassner Otting and networking events like an ’80s dance party helped round out the three days of professional offerings (and good vibes).

“The energy and sense of community at this conference was unique, motivating and palpable,” LMA President Roy Sexton wrote on LinkedIn. 

One perennial LMA favorite is the general counsel panel, and this year’s drew inspiration from daytime TV. 

Presented on a festival-style stage, “How to Win Big at the Legal Marketing Gameshow” saw Jennifer Dezso of Thomson Reuters leading three GCs through a wide-ranging discussion of what law firms are doing right and what they’re getting wrong. 

Here are a few takeaways.

GCs Want Outside Counsel to Be Curious

If there was one clear theme throughout the panel, it’s that private practice lawyers who show curiosity about their clients will score big points with general counsel.

Peter Nguyen, GC of the Descartes Systems Group, described curiosity as the key differentiator in evaluating the law firms he works with.

“I want to have that engagement,” he said. “I want you to really understand — want to understand — what it is about my business that you can help us with.”

This curiosity is often central to the value law firms provide.

That’s because general counsel aren’t looking to just get answers to legal questions. They want guidance based on an organization’s unique goals and circumstances.

“Sometimes lawyers are a little hesitant to actually weigh in and give an opinion on what you should do,” said Jodi Trulove, general counsel at Bates White LLC. “We want you to tell us what you think we should do, but you have to understand us first.” 

For law firms looking to demonstrate this trait to potential clients, the RFP process provides one big opportunity. 

Fender’s general counsel, Aarash Darroodi, described receiving template-based RFP responses from law firms — an approach he called “fundamentally a mistake.”  

Instead, he would like to see a law firm respond to an RFP with an offer to come look at the company’s operations in-depth, gaining a better picture of his organization before a proposal is prepared.

“First of all, it shows initiative on your part. It shows the fact that you care,” he said. “And plus, it shows us that you’re going to submit something that’s directly related to our existing organization.”

GCs Are Actually Fine With the Billable Hour

Don’t believe the hype around the end of the billable hour. But do know that general counsel are closely watching how it is implemented. 

Nguyen said he has no problem paying for his lawyer’s time — particularly coming from a company that charges for professional services. 

But he is also wary of “getting nickeled and dimed for minutiae.”

“I’m happy to pay for a partner to spend their time on my file,” he said. “I don’t want 10 associates researching the same matter.”

Darroodi had a similar take, saying the mere fact that he’s being billed by the hour isn’t a problem — but that the billable hour’s implementation can be. 

GCs May or May Not Enjoy Socializing With Their Outside Counsel

When it comes to client events and law firm communications, it’s important for firms to remember they’re ultimately dealing with individuals. 

As such, opinions can be all over the map. 

“I don’t want to spend time with my lawyers,” Darroodi said to laughter, comparing the idea to hanging out with his dentist. 

He would, however, be happy to join a lawyer for a nonbillable visit to discuss his company’s business operations. He also urges outside counsel to get to know their clients as individuals. 

As an example, he noted his own Persian background, saying he’d welcome a Persian New Year greeting but has never received one.

Meanwhile, Trulove said she sees the value in client dinners and events, but would also look for ways to improve them, while Nguyen noted the benefits of discussions with external counsel outside of formal settings. 

Views on law firm communications were similarly varied, with panelists discussing personalized outreach, targeted client alerts, and even text messages as preferred options. 

At one point, Deszo jokingly interjected: “It’s almost as if clients are individuals who have unique preferences.” 

GCs Will Continue to Focus On Diversity

In response to a “fill in the blank” question, Darroodi described law firms as “misguided” on diversity, equity, and inclusion.  

He noted his own organization’s push for improved DEI — both internally and among outside counsel — and what followed in his interactions with firms. 

Darroodi described Zoom calls with law firms where diverse lawyers would join the call but “simply nod.” He eventually reached out to one such lawyer — a sixth-year associate and Ivy League graduate — to find out why. 

“After 25 minutes of peeling back the layers,” Darroodi said, the associate confirmed that they were asked to only sit in on the call, but not participate, in response to Darroodi’s request for a diverse team. 

Darroodi described the scenario as “fundamentally wrong,” adding later that he bases law firm hiring decisions on these types of issues and wants to see firms improve business development training for diverse lawyers. 

Nguyen, who described firms as “behind” on diversity, also focused on business development, saying law firms must develop their pipeline.

“My team is diverse in many ways, and I want my service providers to reflect that as well,” he said.

Trulove also noted that law firms have a long way to go on DEI, but said she does see things improving. 

“In-house counsel are pushing law firms to do better, and I have seen some improvement in that regard.”

GCs See Big Potential in Generative AI (but Can Be Wary of Its Use)

Like just about everyone else, the panelists expect AI to eventually change legal work, mostly through streamlining more routine tasks.

Nguyen noted that his own use of ChatGPT has already changed his practice. 

“I really encourage my team to use ChatGPT, but to figure out the boundaries around it,” Nguyen said. 

He hopes law firms will do the same, leveraging technology to speed up their operations, while freeing lawyers up to pursue high-level tasks and deliver better value.

Figuring out the quality controls in legal work, however, was an area of concern.  

Trulove noted ChatGPT’s tendency to provide inaccurate information, adding that if a law firm were using it, she would like to know exactly how it’s being used.  

AI is “evolving significantly and has a lot of risk to it,” Trulove said. “And so we’re looking very closely at when it would be appropriate to use it.”

Darroodi noted a “skunkworks” team in his organization that helps them stay at the forefront of technology trends. It’s a particularly important goal when it comes to artificial intelligence.

“As I always say, AI doesn’t grow linearly, it grows exponentially,” he said.

# Texas Firm Hands Out Bonuses
## Market match or not?

Haynes and Boone handed out individualized bonuses late last week, including the announcement of the summer bonuses, which the firm held up until the end of the year to see if lawyers made their targets. That kind of defeated the purpose of a “summer” bonus, but whatever.

At least some associates are satisfied with their haul:

Haynes and Boone released bonuses last night. Market match in Texas so long as you hit undefined “performance requirements.” We also had our summer bonuses included in EOY bonuses as long as you billed 2000 hours in the last 12 months. If you didn’t hit “performance requirements,” the firm still paid most people a bonus, but discounted from market. Laughing at the Locke Lord article you just posted where associates are okay with sub-market bonuses. You can still make market at a Texas-based firm, and Haynes and Boone once again proves it’s a market leader in this state! Summer bonuses and NY market bonuses in December… holiday cheer indeed!

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Sure, you can still make market at a Texas firm… you just shouldn’t make market at a Texas firm. The tipster refers to [this article](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/firm-pays-sub-market-bonuses-and-associates-are-cool-with-it/) where a Locke Lord associate confesses satisfaction with being paid less in exchange for better hours and a lower cost of living. Seems like the Locke Lord lawyer fully understands the real value of the Texas market.

That said, Texas attorneys should still be making good money. Just because associates billing 2600 hours a year living in $3500/month studio apartments should be making more than Texans doesn’t mean Houston lawyers should be living in abject poverty. It’s still good work in a real city. But some Haynes and Boone folks are telling us the compensation isn’t really all its cracked up to be at the higher levels. For example, one senior associate explained that, even with above-target hours, the bonus is coming in around 80 percent of the market scale, and that coupled with the summer raise and bonuses disparities, the bonus is functionally less than 50 percent of what other firms are paying.

So it seems, at least at a certain level of seniority, that the Locke Lord associate working reasonable hours may have the last laugh after all.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Law School Students Are Taking To The Street Over Biglaw Firms With Mandatory Arbitration Agreements
## Students are amping up pressure on Biglaw firms that use mandatory arbitration agreements.

If legal industry insiders thought they could just wait out the uproar over[ mandatory arbitration agreements ](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/mandatory-arbitration-agreements/?rf=1) as a condition of employment at Biglaw firms, well, they may have misjudged the situation. A group of Harvard Law student activists, organized as the [Pipeline Parity Project](http://www.pipelineparityproject.org/about/) (PPP), have kept the heat on Biglaw firm [DLA Piper](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/one-biglaw-firm-refuses-to-do-away-with-forced-arbitration-agreements/) when they defended their use of mandatory arbitration agreements with social media pressure (#DumpDLA) and they launched #DumpVenable when[ Venable](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/venable-law-firm-targeted-by-harvard-law-school-students-over-mandatory-arbitration-agreements/) reversed course on their use of the agreements.

And now students at elite law schools are upping the stakes with more direct action. According to a PPP [press release](http://www.pipelineparityproject.org/law-students-nationwide-step-up-pressure-campaign-against-law-firms-use-of-forced-arbitration/), students are stationed in front of Venable and DLA offices in Washington, D.C. and Boston handing out leaflets about mandatory arbitration agreements:

Lane Shadgett, 1L at Georgetown University Law Center, said that students felt they had no choice but to take this step: “Firms like Venable and DLA Piper need to know that we will continue to hold them accountable for their behavior. Today, by physically showing up at their offices, we are doing our part to make sure that both current employees and students who aspire to work there know about their use of forced arbitration, and how it deprives them of their rights.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Additionally, students sent an [open letter](https://www.coworker.org/petitions/don-t-let-law-firms-hide-harassment-and-discrimination) to the National Association for Law Placement (“NALP”) asking them to include questions in their [directory of legal employers](https://www.nalpdirectory.com/) for on-campus recruitment to assist students in identifying which firms use mandatory arbitration agreements:

NALP is uniquely positioned to gather and distribute this information to law students. We hope that NALP will use its influence to collect and disseminate this information, which is critical to us as we make important decisions about our futures.

Specifically, we urge NALP to adopt the following questions:

1: Does your firm require any employees (including summer associates, first-year associates, paralegals, or other non-lawyer staff) to sign a mandatory arbitration contract, regarding certain or any types of disputes, as a condition of employment?

2: If yes, does this mandatory arbitration agreement include a non-disclosure or confidentiality agreement which encompasses workplace misconduct?

As the dominant organization in legal recruiting and career development, NALP’s leadership in this matter can affect meaningful change because it will empower students to make career choices that align more closely with their values. Thank you for your consideration and we look forward to hearing your thoughts on this issue.

For those who have been following the story closely,[ you’ll recall that last summer](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/which-biglaw-firms-still-require-summer-associates-to-sign-mandatory-arbitration-agreements/), a survey letter on behalf of all T14 law schools went out to every law firm recruiting on their campuses, asking that the firms disclose whether they require summer associates to sign mandatory arbitration agreements and nondisclosure agreements related to workplace misconduct, including but not limited to sexual harassment. Unfortunately, only about half of the firms actually responded to the inquiry. The hope is clearly that if the questions were asked as a part of NALP’s directory, more firms will be forthcoming.

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

According to reporting by ALM, which Am Law 100 firm saw revenue increase 13.1% to $1.38 billion in 2022, in part because the firm added 170 lawyers (including 50 partners) and opened new offices?

Hint: “A major factor in our success is the lateral hiring and expansion we’ve done [in the past five years] for the health, growth and diversification of the firm,” said the firm’s co-chair. Of course, due to those lateral additions, and currency headwinds, profits per equity partner declined 5.5% last year to $3.69 million.

See the answer on the next page.

# How To Make The Most Out Of Black Friday For Lawyers
## The true meaning of Thanksgiving is to nourish your body for Black Friday.

The holidays are upon us, and nothing brings in the season quite like rampant consumerism! It can be hard to buy gifts for people who have a knack for talking about work even on their days off. That’s why the friends and family of lawyers often resort to “what gift should I buy a lawyer” searches on Google and why said lawyers often end up with snazzy patterned socks. Thankfully, the folks at the ABA Journal have released an ongoing series of annual recommendations that you can check out[ here](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/2023-gifts-for-lawyers-guide-ideas-to-kick-off-shopping-this-black-friday-and-cyber-monday-photo-gallery). (Above the Law’s own holiday gift guide will be published soon as well.)

But you come to Above the Law for the inside baseball on these sorts of things. What lawyers really want depends on who is doing the giving. Are you a law firm? The correct gift is money. It is always money. [Milbank raised the bar weeks ago](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/milbank-raises-associate-salaries-and-announces-year-end-bonuses/), what the hell are you other corporate people doing? Chop-chop.

For everyone else, stick to quality of life improvements. Despite already making six figures, [a significant amount of lawyers are picking up side gigs](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/lawyers-with-side-hustles-are-becoming-more-commonplace-in-biglaw/) — buy them something that takes some of the planning out of their other hustle. Whether it’s crafting supplies for their Etsy account or a nice ring light for their [TikTok](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/looking-for-a-cool-jd-advantage-gig-have-you-considered-tiktok/) or [OnlyFans](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/a-lawyer-that-moonlights-on-onlyfans-forgot-the-cardinal-rule-marketing/), they’ll appreciate that you made their JD Advantage work just a little bit easier.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Between all the BS they deal with at work, who wants to deal with their own? You really can’t go wrong with the Squatty Potty, bidet, or heated toilet seat combo. Have three lawyer friends? Buy one item for each person and tell them to work together! Drop the word synergy a couple of times just to show them how smart you are too.

Happy consumption!

Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP (photo by David Lat)

Congratulations are always in order when a Biglaw firm, particularly one as prestigious as Cravath, announces its new class of partners. But[ this year’s class](https://www.cravath.com/Cravath-Announces-New-Partners-11-07-2018/) of new partners at the firm stands out as it is comprised entirely of women.

It isn’t the first time Cravath has had a diverse partnership class. [In 2016, the attorneys elected to the partnership were also all women](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/cravath-names-new-partners-and-all-three-are-women/?rf=1), but with another impressive slate of women joining the ranks of partner, it’s clear the firm’s commitment to integrating women into the top levels of the profession is genuine.

Congratulations to these talented lawyers! They’ve joined a pretty exclusive list of who’s who in the legal profession. Kudos to Cravath for actually making another concrete step forward on gender equality in the profession. Hopefully, other firms will follow suit.

Has your firm recently announced its new partners? If so, what do the selections — in terms of number, practice areas, diversity, or other considerations — say about the state of your firm? Feel free to [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20New%20Partners) (subject line “[Firm Name] New Partners”) or text us (646-820-8477). Thanks.

# Cahill Is Experiencing Some Pain Points Thanks To Slowdown In Leveraged Finance Work
## The firm is still down but it's trying hard to make sure it's not out for the count.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

I’ve been doing this for 44 years, and this slowdown in leveraged finance experienced over this period of time is the longest since leveraged finance has been around. This is the longest period of inactivity or lessening of activity since it started.

— [William Hartnett](https://www.cahill.com/professionals/william-hartnett), Cahill’s executive committee co-chair, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/09/07/facing-falling-profits-cahill-seeks-to-adjust-amid-decline-in-leveraged-finance-market/) on the firm’s plight in the wake of the dearth in leveraged finance work over the past several years. Cahills revenue plunged in 2022, dropping by 19.5%, and partners have left the firm this year thanks to stagnant market activity. The firm is planning to expand into other practice areas thanks to the slowdown. Previously, Hartnett referred to the [firm’s financial issues](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/this-biglaw-firms-finances-suffered-in-2022-but-its-nothing-fatal/) due to work slowdown as “some body blows, but nothing fatal at this point.”

# Silicon Valley Giant Finally Moves On Associate Pay

What a difference a week makes. Just last Monday, all the associate drones in Biglaw offices around the country were reasonably content with their salary. Now that Cravath has unleashed the new, bigger, better associate compensation grid, no one is happy with yesterday’s paycheck. Anxiously refreshing the Above the Law homepage, young lawyers are waiting for the big players in their city to move to the new scale.

Well, a major Silicon Valley player has made their move. Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati announced this evening they too are giving U.S. associates a raise.

The class of 2016 and summer associates will be getting a pay bump too. And the firm says attorneys not on the U.S. associate salary scale, which includes counsel, Of Counsel, staff attorneys, and attorneys in their Brussels office will be dealt with individually.

We are covering this story as market conditions develop, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

# In Traditional Law Firms, Remote Lawyers Are Always Second-Class
## But it's important to remember that remote work can offer the market’s top lawyers more options for their careers.

Ed. note: Please welcome José Ancer to the pages of Above the Law, where he’ll offer thoughts on the realities of remote work and the differences between boutique and Biglaw firms.

The COVID-19 pandemic revealed something that a lot of the more progressive lawyers and law firms have known for a very long time: as it relates to legal services, there is nothing universally advantageous about traditional offices. Many elite lawyers are just as productive, or more productive, working from their home offices or from co-working spaces closer to where they want to live. Having a “distributed team” is also a hell of a lot cheaper.

Of course, that doesn’t mean “remote work” is for everyone. Nothing is for everyone. I can tell you, as someone who’s been building high-functioning remote legal teams for years, working from Colorado with a gorgeous mountain view from my home, there are specific kinds of personalities that are built for it. We’ve even found law students and junior associates who thrive in a remote environment, given the right conditions.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The one common trait that we seem to have found at [Optimal](https://www.optimalcounsel.com/), where our lawyers are located all over the country without a single central office, is that the types of lawyers who really enjoy remote work also tend to be the types who avoided study groups in law school. “Loner” is too strong of a word; I prefer “self-contained.”

We’re the types of people who already have our own friend groups, perhaps even families, and just aren’t looking to our work environment for a big social scene. It doesn’t mean you won’t find us cracking jokes and posting memes in a casual Slack channel, or even having lunch or drinks with a colleague, but there is a much stronger sense among remote lawyers generally that work is for working, not socializing, and as for actual socializing, thanks, but I prefer my own actual friends and family.

So a meaningful number of high-performing lawyers are heavily interested in not working from a traditional office. Surely in a competitive market economy, elite Am Law 100 law firms looking for scarce talent will be rational and give those lawyers plenty of leeway to work the way they want to, right? Oh, if life were so simple.

There is one big reason why any lawyer looking to build their career outside of a traditional office will always be “second-class” in an elite law firm that has traditional offices, no matter what that firm says.

Think about the entire work culture of any Biglaw firm playing the “profits per partner” tournament that we all know so well. Virtually every meaningful facet of that culture is designed to identify the lawyers who accept their job being the first, second, and third priority in their life. These are, from the perspective of Biglaw, the real players.

Work-life balance? Want to attend your kid’s ballgames? Go on a vacation more than once a year (if that) and not work? Have control of your weekends? Sure, in 2023 the smarter firms will have some kind of track for you. But don’t delude yourself into thinking you’re going to get those things and be a real player. That’s just not how the system works. Again, from the cold calculus of the PPP system, the real players don’t ask for these things.

“Return to office” is no different from this. The mere request from a law firm that their lawyers come back to the office is a test; a sorting function if you will. Like all the other ways the firm tests your allegiance, they know that the real players will do what the firm says. Again, sure, maybe they’ll leave open some “flexible” track if they can’t get enough of the talent they need fully in the office, but step onto that track, and you are now marked as second-class.

If a law firm or company has traditional central offices, the “room where it happens” (so to speak) will be in one of those offices. Fact. That’s just how office politics works. This doesn’t preclude those organizations from offering remote work tracks, but the people on those tracks know that they are dramatically lowering their chances of climbing the hierarchy.

For a lot of lawyers who really want to work remotely, this “deal” of more flexibility but lower status is perfectly OK. They accept being B-class as the price to pay for having a better personal life.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
But what about ambitious lawyers who don’t accept this? There is nothing inherently incompatible with preferring to work on your own terms but also wanting to build a substantial book of business and eventually make partner. To these lawyers, our entire roster at Optimal being among them, I say: Your only choice is a fully remote law firm.

It is only in a fully distributed legal team that being yourself a remote lawyer does not make you second-class. That “room where it happens” is a Zoom room or a Slack channel. The work cultures and status hierarchies of fully remote firms function completely differently from traditional law firms, including so-called “hybrid” firms, because there is no group of people sitting in one location schmoozing with each other and playing water-cooler politics to monopolize key opportunities.

As young lawyers build their careers and sort out their lives, they need to ask themselves some hard questions about what they really want, and what they’re willing to do to get it. Everything has a price. We already know the personal price of being an Am Law 100 partner. That price is not going to change any time soon. It takes enormous sacrifices by design. It’s a sorting function.

For those ambitious lawyers who are realizing that working from somewhere other than a handful of mega-cities, or having significant autonomy over their daily schedule, is not just a nice amenity but a foundational priority, understanding the “price” that office politics forces on remote workers is key. You can choose to pay that price in a “classic” law firm and accept lower status. Many lawyers are doing this, and good for them.

But combining ambition and the work-life flexibility of distributed teams requires building completely new institutions. In the world of elite venture-backed tech startups, my practice area, having extremely high-functioning, ambitious, and very well-compensated fully remote teams is not some new thing. You find these teams all over the place.

But for legal, the ecosystem of elite fully remote law firms is just getting started. The technology is there. The model is proven. The clients are ready and willing to try something new. I’m not talking the past decade’s “cloud law firms” made up of nothing but semi-retired types who never collaborate and won’t even think about hiring associates. These new firms are full law firms, with law school pipelines, training infrastructure, associate teams and staff, and everything needed to collaborate on projects and deals. Just without a central office.

We’re not under any illusion that we’re going to “disrupt” Biglaw or remake the Am Law 100. To us, it’s really about offering the market’s top lawyers more options for their careers beyond Biglaw, in-house, or get out of law.

With a better variety of career options on the table, we’re confident that elite lawyers can and will sort themselves out.

# Biglaw Firm Will Pay Associates & Staff To Take A Day Off And Volunteer
## What is your firm doing to promote volunteerism?

For some Biglaw associates, there’s nothing more important than meeting their billable hours requirements so they can collect their full bonuses at the end of the year. But for others, there’s nothing more important than giving back to their community. One firm just made performing community service an easier pill to swallow for those who would rather be billing, and a treat for those who were already planning to give up their free time to do so.

Being a good world citizen is a trait that’s valued highly at O’Melveny & Myers, and thanks to a new program, the firm has made it easier for all eligible employees across its 15 global offices to live up to that goal by giving them a paid day off to volunteer. Beginning on July 1, 2017, O’Melveny’s new “Giving Back” program will allow employees to volunteer with a a qualifying nonprofit organization on a cause important to them without having to sacrifice a single cent from their paychecks.

O’Melveny is one of only a few large law firms to have a dedicated Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program, which unifies the firm’s community involvement programs, scholarships and mentorships, veteran initiatives, charitable giving, sustainability efforts, and pro bono legal work.

“So many of our corporate clients have these wonderful, dedicated CSR programs that make a real difference in their communities and for their employees,” said Rochelle Karr, director of O’Melveny’s CSR program. “We saw an opportunity to build on the values that O’Melveny holds at its core by patterning our CSR program after our clients’ and working with them on shared causes.”

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
George C. Demos, the firm’s chief operating officer, said that this day of volunteering “provides opportunities for each of us to make a difference, both locally and globally,” and that the Giving Back program is “consistent with O’Melveny’s values and is inclusive of all the ways we give back, including legal services, volunteerism, and sponsorships.”

# Kirkland & Ellis, World's Wealthiest Law Firm, Enters The Bonus Fray
## Has the firm shattered the market on these special bonuses?

As predicted, now that [Cravath has signed off](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/cravath-special-bonus-2021/) on the latest round of special bonuses, Biglaw firms of all stripes have waltzed in to grace their associates (and counsel) with piles of cash. Now, the most profitable Biglaw firm in the the world has decided to offer some input.

What is Kirkland & Ellis planning to bring to the table?

The No. 1 firm in the country, known for its above-market bonuses, brought in $4,154,600,000 gross revenue in 2019, but it’s not going to be shattering the market on special bonuses. Instead, Kirkland is offering its associates a [Davis Polk match](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/) and throwing a bone to its [overworked and underpaid non-equity partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/01/kirkland-ellis-non-equity-partners-know-exactly-where-they-should-be-somewhere-else/) (“non-share partners” or “NSPs”) as well. Here’s what the special bonus scale looks like at K&E (full memo available on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/kirkland-special-bonus-2021/2/)):

Rather than offering a $64K payday for its eldest associates in the Class of 2014 and beyond, the firm is reserving that sum for its partners in name only, perhaps in the hope that they’ll be a little less desperate to escape the firm and keep endlessly working like the leveraged little assets they are.

Kirkland acknowledges in its bonus memo that business demands have been “unrelenting” and thanks to the team’s “remarkable ongoing efforts,” there are no hours requirements attached to these bonuses. As noted above, payments will be made on April 30 and September 30. Congratulations to all.

(Flip to the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/kirkland-special-bonus-2021/2/) to see the full memo from Kirkland & Ellis.)

[](https://matterly.io/)Today’s law firms are increasingly implementing customer relationship management (CRM) tools to save costs, improve efficiency, and more. [Matterly](https://matterly.io/) is raising the bar when it comes to law firm software by offering one of the most comprehensive and user-friendly solutions on the market, built on the powerful Salesforce platform.

We recently sat down with the co-founders of Matterly, Steven Berkovitch and Ariel Bouskila, and Matterly developer Stratten Waldt to discuss why they created Matterly and how it’s changing the face of legal CRM.

Can you give us an overview of why you formed your firm BBLaw and created Matterly?

[](https://matterly.io/)
Steven Berkovitch

Steven: We started BBLaw back in 2015. We landed in a very unique industry, specialty financing and fintech. Our clients are in the business of financing and funding small businesses across the country through a variety of means. We started out like every good small firm, keeping track of everything in a handy spreadsheet.

Ariel: When we first started, our clients were funding lots of small businesses. Dozens of matters quickly became hundreds, and it snowballed from there. We realized we didn’t have a good way to keep track of it all – how do I know what my next tasks are? How do I follow up on the things that I need to keep track of, like court dates, due dates for discovery, and court appearances? Time tracking and billing was another big issue – we were doing that on spreadsheets as well. Now we had multiple different spreadsheets with multiple different tabs and we never knew where to look. So, we sent Steven out to a conference to look for a CRM tool.

Steven: We were looking for internal purposes as well as for our clients’ benefit. Updating them on the status of their cases had started to consume most of our day instead of actually getting work done. I was surprised at the CRM options I saw – they were very outdated. Each could only handle some of the tasks we needed and didn’t offer the integrations we wanted. We eventually found Salesforce, which allows you to custom build almost anything you want. Because our practice was so unique, we really had no choice but to build our own CRM.

Once we learned to use Salesforce and realized its benefits, we were able to build what we didn’t realize at the time was cutting-edge software. We thought it was software every law firm should have, but little did we know that we actually had something that nobody else was using and something that was really useful. I would talk to friends and realized they were trying to jerry-rig the same kind of solution from things available on the market. Our goal became to combine legal billing software, case management software, legal intake software, and document management into a single CRM product, which became Matterly.

Ariel: We realized that, not only does our software work for us in our unique space, it works as general law firm software as well.

How did you decide to go from it being an internal tool to a tool you marketed?

Steven: Pre-COVID, when unemployment was at its lowest, we were having difficulty finding office staff for administrative tasks like calendaring. We were forced at that point to use technology to fill those gaps. Once we started going down that path, we realized that, in addition to cost savings, it created efficiency and employee happiness, because no one got stuck doing mundane administrative tasks that weren’t part of their job description.

The law firm software we built was great and we kept tweaking it to make it better, aiming for full automation and complete ease of use. Eventually we realized that although the software was initially designed for our firm, and our needs it was something that every firm needed. Matterly’s role is to take all those administrative duties away from people and have them automated to expedite the completion of the tasks and promote efficiency.

[](https://matterly.io/)
Ariel Bouskila

Do you still use [Matterly](https://matterly.io/) at your firm and why?

Ariel: I use it all day, every day. Our firm is still growing, and there’s only so much that can be done by hiring more administrative assistants, paralegals, or even lawyers. Matterly allows Steven and I as partners at the firm and our clients to get an overview of everything that’s happening at the same time. I can run reports and see what cases are out there. If an action was filed, I can run reports to see what my next court dates are. It helps a lot in terms of planning and organization, as well as for being able to process the amount of cases that we handle.

[](https://matterly.io/)
Stratten Waldt

Stratten: The technology itself is a multiplier. We have about 20 employees right now and more than 20,000 cases in the system. We’ve successfully closed probably 1,000 cases per person over the past couple years.

Steven: I don’t think any similar firms can come close to what we do. We have an email parser that allows us to automatically take information like dates that come in emails from the court system and automatically populate them into Matterly, matched to the case’s index number or caption. We’ve partnered with a nationwide process server company to automatically collect summonses and complaints, send them out for service and trigger dates into the system. These are things that are normally done by humans at most firms, which takes time and costs money. More than that people can make mistakes and certain things caneasily get missed when you get several emails every minute from the court systems. We don’t like to miss anything.

Who can benefit the most from Matterly?

Steven: The nice thing about Matterly is that there are certain components geared toward specialty practices, but also a general platform suitable for lawyers who do standard hourly billing. We built in a time management system with time tracking capability. It’s legal billing software that really works for smaller or larger firms. You can assign specific employees to certain cases and limit access rights to cases as needed.

Management can view everybody’s time in a single report or compare users by billing and time usage. If you think matters are being overbilled or underbilled, you can compare all that information in a simple report. Another great thing is that you can give your clients access to their own files, giving them full visibility and removing guesswork when they receive bills. They can see their own court dates and receive automatic alerts for important case activity or deadlines. It’s all about being open and giving them the ability to see the information they need without having to wait for you.

Ariel: To sum up what Steven was saying, Matterly would work for any practice, whether it’s a small firm handling a large volume of cases or a large firm with hundreds of attorneys with a big case backlog. Both firms have the same issue, namely a limit to the amount of time that a person has in a day. Matterly is law firm software that gives you access to everything in one fell swoop, making it much easier for managers to manage and practitioners to practice. All its features help firms in the judgment enforcement space, general litigation, contract matters, transactional work, and more. There are always due dates, meetings, and appearances.

[](https://matterly.io/)

Stratten: Matterly does have specific, preconfigured modules for things like collections and litigation, but any new types can be added by a firm as they need them.

Why is it important that Matterly was built by lawyers?

Ariel: It’s very important that it’s built by practitioners, because we’re the ones that know what we need. Lawyers tend to speak legalese when they’re explaining what they need, and not everybody fully understands it. We understand it and we work through it. We’ve actually gone through thousands of cases from start to finish. We know what the system needs right now. At the same time, we understand that different law firms and different lawyers have different needs and different wants. It is beneficial that the software is created and being improved on by practitioners that understand the needs and wants of the end users of the product.

Can you talk a little bit about Matterly’s user interface?

Steven: Our goal was to create a simple, almost form-based layout for entering a matter. We wanted to make sure it was fully customizable to all legal needs. It’s really just about understanding what information a firm needs to open a matter. A conflicts check can take place once you enter a party’s information. The system can alert you if a party is in your system already and alert whoever’s responsible for that conflict so they can check to make sure there’s no issue and create that matter. Matters can be assigned automatically to specific people, who can set matters up the way they want, set email alerts, and set up automatic reporting. All these features are ideal for remote work scenarios. We wanted a one-stop shop where everything is stored and where a team can work together cohesively without having to call each other multiple times a day.

What does Matterly bring to CRM in terms of cost-effectiveness?

Steven: Cost-effectiveness is one of our big focuses. How many people out there today want to do case intake? Not very many, right? If you can cut it down to one person doing it or eventually to have intake fully automated, that’s our goal.

How do you handle customer service issues or feedback from clients?

Ariel: That’s one of the main ways we’re hoping to grow Matterly. We want to see what our customers are interested in, what features they like, what features they don’t like, what features they would want added to it, and then deploy them. If there’s one thing we’ve learned from this whole process, it’s that everything is possible and it’s probably simpler than you think it is. And we’re trying to develop not just superior results for today, but superior results for tomorrow. We want to have the software fill in all the gaps an attorney might have. Whatever comments and feedback clients have we will definitely take.

Stratten: When we’re deploying for clients, part of the onboarding process is doing discovery calls and interviews with their stakeholders to find out what about the system needs to be adjusted, what works well, or what is slightly off but has a good foundation. We take that feedback and we implement it for them. Because of the deployment model we’ve chosen, everybody has their own instance of matter. It’s not like other software where you’re locked into what you have. When you make changes to your instance of Matterly, you’re making it your software.

Some of the things we do for the clients are very specific or not worth implementing in the core Matterly package, but some are. Certain client requests are absolutely things we’re going to bring into the core function. We might custom build certain features for a client, but then include it in the overall product going forward.

What is the most useful Matterly feature for each of you in your day-to-day work at your firm?

Ariel: My favorite feature is probably the ability to generate documents. There’s a lot of what we do that comes off of forms, letters, summonses, and complaints. They’re essentially standard forms with a few fields that need to be filled in. Matterly tracks those fields, and when you input a matter, it prepares documents at the click of a button and emails them to the client for review and verification. So, what could potentially take hours of attorney work is done in minutes, with no errors.

Steven: I’m torn between two features. Matterly has the ability to parse all the emails from the New York court system, automatically download any documents, and save them to the appropriate case file. It’s built on Salesforce, so you have the ability to access it from anywhere in the world. We also have this really awesome partnership with a postal company that can automatically send out our mail. It gives us the ability to mail documents directly from Matterly, which cuts down on human error, complete with tracking.

[](https://matterly.io/)
What features are the favorites of your clients?

Ariel: People really like the time tracking aspect of our legal billing software. They can bill different rates for different users or for specific matters. Matterly has a start/stop feature where you describe what you’re doing when you start working on something and automatically calculate the rate when you’re done based on the amount of time that you spent. An automatic billing feature allows Matterly to automatically send out invoices to clients, broken down by matter or entity. They can also set different rates for the same person within two different matters or two different clients.

Steven: It’s all about the seamless progression after using the time tracker straight to automatic billing. We also have credit card and ACH processors that you can set up at the onset of a matter.

Why should firms use CRM in general and Matterly specifically?

Steven: It may seem daunting at first, but ultimately it will save you a lot of time and headaches. It will help you in overall firm management. You can sign up for a free trial and get a feel for it to see if it’s something that actually works for you.

Stratten: We’re here to provide whatever support you need, whatever guidance or training will make Matterly work for you. Again, one of the benefits of our deployment model is that we can hold your hand through it. So, if this is your first CRM, great. We’ll onboard you and make sure you have training videos. If it’s a transition, we’ll do videos covering how it’s different from what you’re used to or how you manage the system yourself internally. If you need to add a filter or change the layout, that’s not something we need to do. It’s not the best use of our time or your money. We’ll show you how to own your own platform. People usually see law firm software as this thing they just use, but don’t own. That’s something we’re trying to change and I think we’re doing a pretty good job.

Ariel: Matterly gives you the ability to modify the fields or the layout to meet your needs. The product is easy to use even for those without a technical background.

Steven: Our belief is that no two firms are alike. Out of the box, Matterly can apply to most firms, but for a significant amount of firms there’s 10 to 15% of it that the firm is going to want to customize or tweak, and you can easily do that. It’s a big differentiator from other CRMs on the market.

Salesforce can be daunting for many law firms. Why should lawyers be using legal solutions that involve Salesforce?

Ariel: Once you get a feel for it, you’ll see that [Matterly](https://matterly.io/) is built in the most user-friendly way possible. Salesforce is fairly simple to use once you get the hang of it. We also offer training videos that hold your hand through the entire process. Try it free for 30 days and see what you think. There’s no commitment.

You have everything you need at your fingertips. You have a functional search bar and reporting on all of your matters and the stages they’re in.

Steven: We’re able to create custom layouts that include only the information you want to see.

Why do you believe Matterly is the best legal CRM on Salesforce?

Steven: It’s built by practitioners for practitioners. We speak your language. We know what lawyers are looking for, and when you ask for certain things, you don’t have to explain what you mean.

Ed. note: Please welcome our newest columnist, [Jayne Backett](http://www.fieldfisher.com/people/b/jayne-backett), who will write about the legal world from her perspective as a female partner in a large law firm.

When I was ten years old, my father bought me a half set of golf clubs, so I could start learning the game. It was, to date, the greatest gift he ever gave me. Not just because I was able to learn to play golf (which was an incredible opportunity in itself), but because I spent my formative years navigating the smoking club rules.

When I was a young teen, British golf clubs fell into three categories as regards women:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
- Women Allowed (restricted) – you could play, but only at certain times, and you could come in the clubhouse, but only into certain rooms;
- Women Allowed (dire conditions) – your changing room was unheated, with no showers, it was located at the far end of the car-park and was home to a colourful selection of spiders, mice and squirrels; and
- No Women Allowed – yes, these places genuinely existed, you could not join, there were no women’s tees, no women’s changing rooms, and women were banned from the entire clubhouse.
The calamitous effect of The Equality Act 2010 was to outlaw discrimination in private clubs and associations, which forced them to change their ways. I remember some golf clubs dragging themselves kicking and screaming into the progressive world just a few years ago and only under duress, the threat of the loss of a bar licence looming if that club didn’t pull up its three-quarter-length argyle socks.

So, what did the old-school, all-male cigar room at the golf club teach me? It taught me some crucial lessons on what was needed to survive and thrive in a stuffy, male-dominated environment, most of which I have subsequently applied to my legal career. Here are five of the best:

1. There’s always an inner circle.

Rule number one is to have the emotional intelligence to observe the politics and the interactions of the members and assess carefully whose views usually win out, then work out who are the people that actually make, enforce, and preserve the rules. Surprisingly, I rarely find this to be the person or the group with the obvious power title. There’s inevitably a set of back-channelling types who sit behind the scenes and have the real influence, and that’s what you need to suss out. It can take a while to get to grips with the identity of these people, but once you know who they are, you have to find an “in” with them. This will be your route to freeing yourself from the shackles of the regime in place and your pass to flex the rules in your favour without recrimination.

2. Respect the rules when there’s no mileage in breaking them.

My least favourite rule of the golf club was the rule about no shorts being worn above the knee – as if the knee were some kind of arousing and distracting part of the body, putting people (men?!) off their backswings – it meant excruciating shopping excursions for shorts of proportions that didn’t exist in the High Street shops, since no other sane teen girl would buy such a disgusting item. Eventually, I would retreat back to the pro shop and ask the club pro to order me the same shorts that Mildred or Dorris (who had been members since 1941) wore last week, and then I’d put them on and cry, looking at my calves peeping out between long shorts and high socks. It made for a fantastic set of tan lines. I learnt to suck it up and wear this heinous attire since the clucking and flapping that ensued if you tried to raise the hemline, mainly from the older female section of the club, was so fiercely counterproductive to your reputation that the rule break had no mileage. It was one that needed macro change and eventually, the professional women players and their fashion-forward sponsors started to move the boundaries, and most clubs have followed that lead. You have to learn when to toe the party line, even if it’s killing you inside.

3. If things don’t go your way, don’t scream at people about it.

This might sound like an attack on women being too emotional about issues, but it isn’t; this is my view generally, and it applies to how men deal with problems as well. I find that anyone who screams, stamps their feet, and throws their toys out of the pram rarely finds favour from their peers, and if you put people’s backs up, they won’t want to help you with your problem. Sometimes, you have to be persistent but patient with finding the right fix. It doesn’t mean always putting up and shutting up, but it’s about practical problem solving, it’s about taking a deep breath when you’re frustrated and using your best interpersonal skills to win votes for change. You have to talk to the influencers and help them see the benefit of taking any given course of action. When I started to play better at my club, I would win competitions, and it would mean I had a platform to speak. Mostly in my early speeches, I would just say thank you and abide the formalities but, as my confidence grew, I would use the speeches to plant eloquently worded seeds about changing attitudes, and I’d practice doing the same at club annual general meetings, speaking rationally about how things could be different.

4. Performance means power.

Law firms and golf clubs work the same in this sense, the star performers in the organisation have an enhanced influence on the rest, and so one way to have influence over the majority quickly is to be phenomenal at what you do and to use that success to champion change. It sounds simple, but I see often (in golf and the law) that certain high flyers have become so focussed on their achievements that they forget that they can use their status for the greater good.

5. Don’t lose sight of the bigger picture.

If I am navigating the smoking room rules well, I am making constant assessments of my actions versus the perception others have of me, and things can become quite granular. I am endlessly on my toes, attuned to all of the sensitivities related to my progression – did I wear too much lipstick to last night’s event, should I have had that second glass of wine, what did people make of my thoughts on Donald Trump. It can be exhausting and draining to over-analyse. So don’t! When things are done, move on. If, on reflection, you genuinely believe (or are lucky enough to be told) that something wasn’t the best course of action last time around, then re-gear and manoeuvre things back to where you want them to be. Ultimately, those most engineered for adaptation will evolve and succeed, so don’t lose sight of the bigger picture on the way.

# Biglaw Firm Announces 'Significant Expansion' Of Benefits Offerings
## A big new benefits announcement involving vacation time, parental leave, and more.

While we all understandably fixate on salary and bonuses, benefits can be just as critical to an attorney’s job satisfaction. To the extent we talk about benefits at all, we usually talk about parental leave expansions, but there’s a much wider array of offerings firms could be putting on the table for associates — benefits that will impact attorneys with far more regularity than parental leave. Unless you’re a Duggar or something.

Goodwin just announced its You@Goodwin program with a number of new benefits for employees in its U.S. offices. Given that we’ve not heard about bonuses from Goodwin yet, most associates probably saw the email to all and felt a little teased when it was just a benefits announcement, but keep your heads up because there’s some good stuff in here:

Expanded paid parental leave policy. All lawyers will be eligible to take up to 18 weeks and all GO! Team members will be eligible to take at least 12 weeks of paid child bonding leave. In addition, all birth mothers will be eligible to take at least six additional weeks of disability leave.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Of course parental leave is still getting top billing. At 18 weeks, the policy falls [a little shy of some others](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/biglaw-firm-announces-industry-leading-parental-leave-policy/), but it’s certainly following the trend toward expanded leave. The policy does reflect the industry-standard gap between attorneys and staff, which never makes sense because “having a baby” seems to have very little to do with post-graduate degrees. Even vacation tiers make sense — attorneys are under more stress day-to-day than staff and may need more vacation — but there isn’t much reason to tier parental leave. Maybe to reflect that they’ll be home more often during the first year? I guess that makes some sense, but is it six weeks’ worth?

The firm is also offering 12 weeks of leave to all employees for close family members with serious health conditions.

Modified vacation policy. Lawyers will move to flexible vacation, while full-time non-exempt GO! Team members and paralegals with five or more years of service will be eligible to accrue up to 20 days per year. There will  be no specified limit to the total number of vacation days in a calendar year for lawyers.

Unlimited vacation, y’all. Realistically though, attorneys are rarely going to take all 20 days offered to staff let alone something on top of that. But it does open the door to a mid-level ahead on hours to book the sort of once in a lifetime two-month trek that attorneys can only afford once they’re working too hard to actually take. If you find yourself in this boat, why not try to get to South America or Africa to close out the year?

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
For its part, the firm is serious about pushing associates to at least take some sustained vacation:

First, we will encourage all of you to take a vacation of two consecutive weeks per year, in addition to other vacation time you take during the course of the year. Taking the time to relax and recharge is essential –  especially in our fast-paced industry. We firmly believe that well-being and balance are fundamental to our ability to do our best work for clients.

Even if work schedules find a way to mess that up, just making the statement represents a critical shift in thinking about mental health that too few firms would be willing to put out there.

Substance abuse and depression assistance. As an early signatory to the American Bar Association’s pledge to advance well-being in the legal profession, Goodwin will continue to offer training on signs of substance abuse and depression, and how to get help.

One of the more welcome trends in Biglaw is the institutional commitment to the obstacles the profession puts on mental well-being. And while we’re on record as [disagreeing with Goodwin’s decision to go teetotaler](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-summer-programs-phasing-out-boozefests-to-create-all-new-worse-sexual-harassment-opportunities/) in an effort to curb both substance abuse and reduce the risk of sexual harassment, we’ve also lauded the commitment to getting ahead of the problem. The new program offers services to the entire firm and household members including on-site behavioral health counselors.

Speaking of health, the firm announced an expansion in voluntary health plan add-ons and expanded elder care and special needs services.

Perhaps most importantly for young associates, the firm expanded its student loan refinancing options.

Congratulations to Goodwin employees on their new benefits, and a reminder to attorneys everywhere to keep us abreast of any new benefits.

# The Charge Of The Lawyer Brigade
## Brexit opens some opportunities for lawyers...

Michael Allen

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors. [Michael Allen](http://www.laterallink.com/about/team/1) is Managing Principal at Lateral Link, focusing exclusively on partner placements with Am Law 200 clients and placements for in-house attorneys.

Last Friday, we witnessed what many thought was impossible — the United Kingdom voted 51.9% to 48.1% to leave the European Union after 43 years, thus beginning the long and tedious process of negotiating the aptly-named Brexit. Estimates of how long the political, legal, and financial untangling will take are unknown, but experts predict a minimum of two years with extensions being available to ensure the terms of the agreement are met.

One factor of the U.K.’s decision to leave the EU is how much extra work will be needed from attorneys to retool contracts and regulations, not to mention the time-consuming task of consulting with clients on the extensive impact of this change. The U.K. legal market contributes £20B ($27.4B) annually to the country’s economy, with London serving as the hub of the global professional services sector. Regulatory framework and banking laws will need amending or updating, and U.K.-based law firms have already set up hotlines and are coordinating efforts to handle the influx of client calls. We’ve received memos, emails, and marketing decks on how firms and companies are setting out to handle the short- and long-term implications of the U.K. serving notice.

As the British are leaving, predictably law firms in the United States and Europe will be impacted and are scrambling to ensure the questions and needs of clients are met during this uncertain time. While it is possible Britain will delay its exit from the EU until all of the financial and regulatory details are worked out, we can be certain it will be a priority to ensure the stability of the U.K.’s economy while still adhering to the financial EU rules in place.

Several firms are already positioning themselves as Brexit experts. Allen & Overy, Baker & McKenzie, Clifford Chance, Skadden have all launched whitepapers, hotlines, webinars and more to establish themselves as leaders in the post-Brexit marketplace. The turmoil and uncertainty generated in the wake of the vote, has financial and corporate entities looking to firms for indications on the implications of the Brexit vote.

According to our data, the firms with the most regulatory attorneys include an array of names such as Buckley Sandler, Wiley Rein, Epstein Becker, Steptoe & Johnson and Crowell & Moring. There is little overlap between this list and the list of the largest players in the British market which includes, Norton Rose, Hogan Lovells, Dentons, White & Case, Squire Patton Boggs, Reed Smith and DLA Piper.

How Brexit will affect lateral movement is unclear so far. We anticipate however, that the firms establishing themselves as authorities on the matter, will be able to poach lateral attorneys with the promise of extra work — especially partners — and ergo, extra pay. Firms with a heavy presence in London, but meager regulatory offerings are already scrambling to grow these practices to “remain in the game,” so to speak.

# Global Law Firm Facing Cash Flow Problems, Considering Terminating Partners
## Has the firm really put this behind them?

CKR Law is only five years old but has over 50 offices around the world. The rapidly expanding firm came on the scene after we all determined that [Growth Is Dead](https://www.amazon.com/Growth-Dead-What-firms-brink/dp/1481896040), yet jumped full force into the mindset of success through expansion.

Now, [according to reporting from the New York Law Journal](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2019/05/14/global-law-firm-faces-cash-crunch-struggles-to-pay-partners-389-68818/), CKR is facing a “cash flow crunch” that could send some partners packing:

In emails in the last month, the firm’s management began blaming some partners for the financial crunch. In a May 10 email viewed by ALM, Rinde said only partial payments would be paid May 15 and June 15, prioritized to certain partners. He wrote that certain practices “did not meet financial commitments previously made to the firm,” and said some partners failed to collect “hundreds of thousands of dollars” in bills that could have been used to pay lawyers.

He also said “substantially underperforming” partners will be let go, and the firm will be eliminating “certain redundancies and making adjustments to other fixed expenses.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
If the culprits really are underperforming practices and realization failures, then the firm must have played its finances pretty close to the bone because the impact has spilled over to a number of partners all over. According to the NYLJ, “[t]wo sources close to the firm said many partners haven’t been given their regular draws for at least the past two months.” Apparently, some emails from the managing partner blamed these holdups on bank errors but taking a holistic view of the emails at the heart of the NYLJ story, that feels like that might not be entirely accurate. At least some additional explaining is necessary. And that’s another problem the firm now faces — once the partnership feels they can’t trust the leadership team, it’s hard to earn that trust back.

Still, the firm feels it’s getting its ducks in a row. As recently as last week, an internal email expressed confidence that enough of the underperforming practices had already been dealt with and that CKR could put the cash flow problems behind them. Another partner on the firm’s executive committee indicated that the “overall strategy is sound” despite these hiccups.

On the one hand, rapid growth is going to lead to some troubles absorbing practices and ensuring that everyone’s pulling in the same direction. That may not be the fault of either firm or partner — sometimes things just don’t gel. A firm that’s honest with itself can address those issues quickly to get itself back on track. Still, even in a rapid growth phase, a firm would do well to make sure it has the reserves or some line of credit available to consistently pay its obligations.

If we’re taking the firm’s most recent emails seriously, they’ve weathered this crisis. But hopefully everyone involved in the firm’s leadership will walk away from this properly chastened that they need to keep an eye on their cookie jar funds. This time around, it might have been some deadweight that can be easily tossed aside but someday soon the market is going to take a fundamental hit and the firm is going to need to be able to keep itself in the black.

# Charting Biglaw Happiness Across The Country
## The cities with the happiest midlevel associates.

There’s a lot of data to breakdown in Am Law’s [annual survey](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/the-best-biglaw-firms-if-you-want-to-be-happy-at-your-job/) of midlevel associates. We know that Schulte Roth has taken the title of most satisfied associates and white men are much happier at Biglaw than women and minorities ([no shocker there](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/surprising-exactly-no-one-women-and-minorities-are-less-satisfied-in-biglaw-than-white-guys/?rf=1)). The latest numbers give a run down of [which legal markets](https://www.law.com/2018/09/10/data-snapshot-where-are-law-firm-associates-happiest/) are able to boast the happiest associates.

As is befitting its reputation as the toughest legal market, New York doesn’t score particularly well by any of the survey metrics. They first asked midlevels (defined as 3rd through 5th-year associates) about their general work satisfaction. The national average was a rating of 4.32 (out of a possible high of 5), and the following cities ranked the highest:

1. Los Angeles 4.52
2. Houston 4.48
3. Dallas 4.46
4. Miami 4.44
5. Philadelphia 4.43

They also asked the midlevels to report how they felt about their benefits and compensation. The survey was completed before the[ most recent round of Biglaw salary increases](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2018-associate-salary-increase/), and overall satisfaction with salary averaged 4.15. Associates in Atlanta seem to feel perpetually undervalued, and their salary satisfaction came in last, at 3.93. Those that felt the best about how they were compensated were as follows:

1. Miami 4.53
2. Los Angeles 4.46
3. Miami 4.45
4. Houston 4.39
5. Chicago 4.35

The last category broken down by city is whether the associates saw themselves still at their firms in 2 years. The national average was 4.28 — New York scored well below that average at 4.05, we told you it was a brutal place to work, though not as bad as San Francisco/Silicon Valley which scored a depressing 3.97. The cities where midlevel associates actually thought they had a future at their Biglaw firm are:

1. Dallas 4.44
2. Houston 4.4
3. Chicago 4.33
4. Atlanta 4.26
5. Los Angeles 4.22

# Biglaw Firm Orders Attorneys Back To Office Next Week, Cancels Vacation Carryover Policy
## Tis the season to get back to the office, worms!

Leadership at Simpson Thacher’s London office have a looming date with the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future after telling associates that the firm will not be organizing holiday coverage next week and that everyone needs to come back to the office. Oh, and while they were at it, the office blanket nixed vacation carryover requests. Happy holidays!

Roll On Friday does a fantastic job keeping the UK legal market honest and broke this [exclusive account of how the firm’s London management went full Grinch](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-simpson-thacher-bartlett-gives-lawyers-yuletide-middle-finger).

It began with an email from real estate finance team partner Tom Lloyd, in an offering on Wednesday that opened with the “generous” concession that the team could work from home on December 21 to accommodate holiday preparations and travel. But then it turned ugly:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“Secondly: there will be no cover for holiday leave 27-29 December. It will likely be very quiet but everyone is expected to pick up things that come in on their transactions that are urgent in that time. Everyone is expected to have their laptop with them wherever they are (this is a general expectation when on holiday not just for this).”

The email also canceled cover for the first week of January.

To be clear, this isn’t about lawyers trying to eke out a free holiday. These are lawyers with unused vacation days hoping to exercise those days during the lowest activity week of the year. This is actually a boon for the firm, but Lloyd didn’t see it that way, instead bitterly complaining that everyone with vacation days in hand at the end of the year was “disappointing and, being honest, irritating.”

And so, for the lawyers’ own good, from next year they will no longer be permitted to carry over their unused holiday: “Unless we cancel someone’s pre-approved holiday, we will not be approving any carryover of holiday from 2024 to 2025”, said Lloyd.

“People need to plan ahead better”, he concluded. And if that isn’t a lovely Christmas message to your team, ROF doesn’t know what is.

The office’s managing partner Jason Glover sent his own holiday message:

“Each of Wednesday 27th, Thursday 28th and Friday 29th are working days with the Wednesday and Thursday being core office days where attendance is expected”, he said.

“Friday is a day when you are permitted to work from home”, he allowed, “although the office will be open for those who wish to come in. Cheers.” It brings a tear to the eye, so it does.

The UK considers Boxing Day a real holiday, but one suspects Simpson Thacher would also have everyone in on the 26th if they could.

Rather than attempt a kicker for this article, I give you the conclusion to Roll On Friday’s article because it simply cannot be outdone in light of Glover’s email about the firm’s “core office days” next week:

ROF emailed Glover for comment, but he wasn’t around: “I am away from the office returning Tuesday 2nd January. I will be picking up e-mails infrequently”. If only his associates could say the same.

# Morning Docket: 08.11.16
## * ""Could a firm with a different business model suffer, potentially, if they don't match the $180,000? Maybe."" Law firms may be competing for fewer students than in years prior thanks to decreased law school enrollment, but Biglaw's new starting salary scale doesn't seem to have made a big impact on the summer associate applicant pool -- at most schools, OCI participation has held steady or risen only slightly since last year. [[Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/08/09/on-campus-interviews-remain-steady-amid-associate-salary-hike/)] * “Are you listening? He just flat out lied. ... [I]t could be bad."" In a text message that was included in a federal court filing earlier this week, a former aide to New Jersey Governor Chris Christie claimed that the governor lied when he told the media none of his staff knew about a plan to block George Washington Bridge traffic. Uh-oh! [[New York Times](http://nytimes.com/2016/08/11/nyregion/chris-christie-george-washington-bridge-case.html)] * ""We'll tell the council that there's a giant need for affordable law schools like us, and we're going to meet that need."" After learning it was [unlikely his school would receive accreditation](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/accreditation-woes-for-dallass-first-public-law-school/) due to students' poor qualifications, Dean Royal Furgeson Jr. of UNT Dallas Law shrugged it off, saying the school would ""get a fair hearing.""

* “Could a firm with a different business model suffer, potentially, if they don’t match the $180,000? Maybe.” Law firms may be competing for fewer students than in years prior thanks to decreased law school enrollment, but Biglaw’s new starting salary scale doesn’t seem to have made a big impact on the summer associate applicant pool — at most schools, OCI participation has held steady or risen only slightly since last year. [[Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/08/09/on-campus-interviews-remain-steady-amid-associate-salary-hike/)]

* “Are you listening? He just flat out lied. … [I]t could be bad.” In a text message that was included in a federal court filing earlier this week, a former aide to New Jersey Governor Chris Christie claimed that the governor lied when he told the media none of his staff knew about a plan to block George Washington Bridge traffic. Uh-oh! [[New York Times](http://nytimes.com/2016/08/11/nyregion/chris-christie-george-washington-bridge-case.html)]

The bitter cold days of winter are officially here, judging by the snow the recent nor’easter dumped on New England and the plummeting temperatures all up and down the eastern sea board. But there’s one way Biglaw associates can keep warm — by counting all the money that’s being showered on them! That’s right, it’s bonuses season and we’re happy to report yet another Biglaw firm has joined the bonus party.

On Friday, Allen & Overy announced year-end bonuses that match the prevailing market rate. The bonus scale is as follows ([you can read the full memo on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/ao-bonuses/2/)):

Class of 2020: $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2019: $15,000
Class of 2018: $25,000
Class of 2017: $50,000
Class of 2016: $65,000
Class of 2015: $80,000
Class of 2014: $90,000
Class of 2013: $100,000
Class of 2012: $100,000

Plus the Magic Circle firm is also signaling they’re playing ball with the elite of Biglaw. Back in the fall, it was trending [among Biglaw firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-fall-special-bonus-tracker-which-biglaw-firms-are-handing-out-cash-for-associates-hard-work-during-the-pandemic/?rf=1) to pay special bonuses, in appreciation of associates‘ hard work during the pandemic. Of course, some, ahem[ Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/cravath-bonuses/), decided to wait on special fall bonuses. But now A&O has[ joined the firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/cravath-bonuses/) handing out the special bonuses now — better late than never! Those special bonuses range from $7,500 to $40,000, depending on class year, and are in addition to the year-end bonus numbers. So yeah, Biglaw associates have a lot to be thankful for! As a tipster at the firm notes:

Associates are thrilled and relieved that the firm’s commitment to expanding in the US market is reflected in its appreciation for the associates’ contribution’

All bonuses at the firm will be paid on January 15, 2021.

As always, we depend on you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Ask A Legal Recruiter: Can Someone Lateral From An Accounting Firm Into Biglaw?
## What can a new recruiter do to be successful? And how is the Biglaw lateral market looking?

For almost two decades, Kinney Recruiting has been a premier international legal recruitment agency and home to some of the most respected legal recruiters in the world. This week Daniel Roark, Jessica Chin Somers, and Jack Hopper tackle your burning questions, starting with what makes a good legal recruiter. If you have any questions, would like to know more about how legal recruiting works or want our take on the market, email [askarecruiter@kinneyrecruiting.com](mailto:askarecruiter@kinneyrecruiting.com) and we will get back to you with our take! 

Question: What makes a good legal recruiter? What can a new recruiter do to be successful?

[Daniel Roark](https://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/recruiters/daniel-roark/): Recruiting is a unique industry in that there is very limited training, educational requirements, certification processes, governance, industry oversight etc. It is a career that encompasses sales, consultancy, subject matter expertise, technology, and good old-fashioned gabbery. As such, new recruiters dive straight into the “doing” part of the job with oftentimes little oversight and unclear directives. And this sink-or-swim environment is also very much integral to the job – to make a market out of communication, information, and old-fashioned effort. My tangible advice to new recruiters is three-fold: 1). Shadow more experienced recruiters whenever the opportunities present themselves. Just as associates learn at the feet of partners about how to interact with clients, handle crisis, assess risk, communicate effectively (both formally and informally), etc, a new recruiter can learn the myriad soft skills required by this profession by learning from more experienced recruiters. 2). Shrink the market into bite-sized, achievable goals. New recruiters generally don’t have a pipeline of candidates, client relationships or deep market knowledge, and they face pressure move quickly since the sales cycle of our business is so long (several months can pass before a new recruiter closes a deal and receives a fee). So, initially, new recruiters should focus their efforts on one or a very few job leads they are excited about and can own until these position(s) are filled. This strategy requires knowing the opportunity inside and out, recruiting and vetting every possible candidate within contact, and working the job until it is filled. 3) Structure your days. It’s easy to run down useless rabbit trails, just as in the practice of law. Bottom line: recruiters are measured by the deals they close. We are not rewarded for how many hours we work, how many phone calls we make, how many conversations/meetings we take, or how many industry articles we read, even though these activities are critical to long-term success. But working on a schedule with fixed tasks and deliverables (e.g., making a set number of phone calls a day) is a suggested way for recruiters to structure the sometimes amorphous nature of our profession. Many new recruiters wash out because they fully embrace the freedom of a commissions-based career without organizing their days around the sometimes-boring, but essential tasks required to be successful.

Question: I’m curious to know what the market is right now for laterals in Biglaw, specifically tax. Can someone lateral from an accounting firm into Biglaw?

[Jessica Chin Somers](https://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/recruiters/jessica-chin-somers/): There is always a need for good tax lawyers in Biglaw, especially tax lawyers with law firm experience and good JD and LLM grades. However, because tax is a niche practice, it is not as easy to get many offers. Some tax practices really want candidates with specific types of tax experience (for example, securitization tax or bankruptcy tax) and so they will wait forever for the right candidate.  Some transactional practices have a strong preference against tax planning candidates. The best thing to do is connect with us and let us keep a pulse on the market for you, so when there is a suitable opening, we’ll make sure you get in front of the decisionmakers.

Question: How’s the Biglaw lateral market looking?

[Jack Hopper](https://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/recruiters/jack-p-hopper/): While it is difficult to generalize about the Biglaw market as a whole, we have not noticed any dramatic down turn in hiring in Biglaw as of October 2022. Yes, there are areas that have experienced a slowdown – capital markets for one, and certain firms “overhired” during 2021 in corporate, M&A specifically – but there are other sectors that remain strong or that are “heating up” – real estate, litigation and bankruptcy for instance. Some firms have implemented a hiring freeze, but this has certainly not been a market trend. The takeaway is that for the “best and brightest” candidates, while such perks as huge signing bonuses like we saw in 2021 may not be the norm, opportunities abound.

# Roberts Says Separation Of Powers Means He Can’t Testify, Senate Should Remind Him It Also Means 'Good Luck, Paying Your Bills, A**hole!'

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote Senator Dick Durbin yesterday informing him that he would decline the invitation to appear at an upcoming Senate hearing to explain why he’s the ringmaster of a whole circus of corruption down on First Street.

The Senate is interested in getting some insights into how the Chief Justice of the United States intends to restore confidence in the judiciary when his boys are [collecting half a million in unreported vacations from donors](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/paragon-of-virtue-clarence-thomas-has-been-given-millions-of-dollars-in-value-off-the-record-and-it-totally-hasnt-impacted-his-judging-not-one-bit-nope/) or conveniently [declining to mention that the other half of their transactions are lawyers with business before the Court](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/biglaw-head-bought-neil-gorsuchs-property-in-2017-yes-we-are-just-learning-about-it-now/). And that’s before we even get to the stuff about one justice refusing to step away from issues [directly implicating his wife](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/no-clarence-thomas-still-isnt-going-to-recuse-himself-in-january-6th-related-case/).

Roberts considered the request and responded with [a condescending lecture on the separation of powers instead](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2023/04/Roberts-Letter.pdf).

Testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee by the Chief Justice of the United States is exceedingly rare, as one might expect in light of separation of powers concerns and the importance of preserving judicial independence. The Supreme Court Library compilation of “Justices Testifying Before Congress in Matters Other Than Appropriations or Nominations” has identified only two prior instances — Chief Justice Taft in 1921 and Chief Justice Hughes in 1935.

You see, the American constitutional system is a beautiful collection of checks and balances where each branch fulfills a critical role in the delicate regime. It’s like a game of rock, paper, scissors. Here’s an explanation of the rules according to John Roberts — the Supreme Court is rock in this example:

Roberts provides no justification for this interpretation of the separation of powers except that very few of his predecessors have appeared before Congress to speak about court administration. While the Chief seems to see this as indicative of some unspoken constitutional restriction, it’s much more likely that no one worried that Fred Vinson’s justices were on the take.

Instead of appearing, Roberts included a two-and-a-quarter page “Statement on Ethics Principles and Practices” that he got the other justices to sign. The document amounts to a completely toothless “we promise what we’re doing is ethical, okay?” Unfortunately for Roberts, you can only go to this well so often. There’s nothing substantively different about this statement than what he put out [the last time people looked to him to take an ethical stand](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/chief-justice-wants-you-to-know-he-has-the-utmost-contempt-for-you/). Or [the time before that](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/09/constitution-day-judicial-ethics/). 

In other words, we’ve already tried the Chief’s plan of “doing nothing” and it’s not worked.

As Gabe Roth of Fix the Court put it, “Following weeks of scandal, Americans had been seeking some reassurance that nine of the most powerful people in the country understood their responsibility to act above board, avoid corrupting influences and be honest in their dealings and disclosures. No such comfort comes today.” 

But it’s interesting that the report he cites includes “Other Than Appropriations” in the title, because Durbin should remind Roberts in a response that in a very real way this is very much about appropriations. Senator Chris Van Hollen, whose subcommittee oversees judiciary appropriations, [suggested that he would tighten the Court’s pursestrings absent serious ethical reforms](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/dems-consider-going-after-supreme-courts-money-if-they-dont-get-an-actual-ethics-rule/) the latest spate of ethical buffoonery.

If Durbin and the Senate Democrats have the collective will to strike a blow for checks and balances, their response is easy. Here’s a template!

Dear Mr. Chief Justice,

Thank you for your letter of April 25, 2023 declining our invitation to appear before the Committee. We also wish to thank you for your impromptu lesson on the separation of powers, a subject that we also take seriously. The United States Senate will not approve any future budget that does not reduce the SCOTUS operating budget by 85 percent. (Apparently this is called “the power of the purse” and is another famous separation of powers concept!) Enjoy your day.

P.S. As an additional cost-saving measure, we’re voting to cut off your access to the building at One First Street and we’re excited for your return to the glorified broom closet here at the Capitol. Perhaps as officemates we will have an opportunity to meet face-to-face by happenstance since you believe respecting the bare minimum of your constitutional obligations is insufficient to warrant a meeting.

Some worrywart Democrats might express concern that it’s dangerous to go down the road of holding the judiciary’s budget hostage to force it to enact administrative changes. Which is true!

But compared to the harm of a lawless judiciary engendering [record low public confidence](https://news.gallup.com/poll/394103/confidence-supreme-court-sinks-historic-low.aspx), budgetary sanctions are pretty tame.

During early bonus season, Biglaw firms are usually pretty eager to fall in line to prove their financial prowess. Which firm decided to join the Milbank bonus scale earlier this week, but kept things so casual that the memo was sent from its presiding partner’s cellphone?

It’s Debevoise, and it looks like the firm has adopted the Milbank scale for its U.S. associates. On Tuesday night, associates received this message from [Michael Blair](https://www.debevoise.com/michaelblair):

On behalf of all of the partners, thank you for your dedication to serving clients and building the firm.

Michael

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Bro. Debevoise’s cool factor just went up a little in our book.

Here’s the bonus scale that the firm will be using for its associates:

Class of 2019 – $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2018 – $15,000
Class of 2017 – $25,000
Class of 2016 – $50,000
Class of 2015 – $65,000
Class of 2014 – $80,000
Class of 2013 – $90,000
Class of 2012+ – $100,000

Read the full bonus memo on the next page. Bonuses at Debevoise will be “payable in the usual manner at year end.”

# Top 6 Reasons Why Your Partner Compensation Isn’t Higher
## A few general rules of thumb that help explain why you are likely hitting a plateau when it comes to compensation.

Michael Allen

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://bit.ly/2KxFPa6) team of expert contributors. [Michael Allen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelallen/) is the CEO of Lateral Link. He is based in the Los Angeles office and focuses exclusively on Partner and General Counsel placements for top firms and companies. Prior to founding Lateral Link in 2006, he worked as an attorney at both Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and Irell & Manella LLP. Michael graduated summa cum laude from the University of California, San Diego before earning his JD, cum laude, from Harvard Law School.

If you feel like you are always fighting to make a few more bucks at your current law firm, and you wonder whether other firms would value your practice more, we have a few general rules of thumb that help explain why you are likely hitting a plateau.

1) RPL v. PPP. True to the name, Revenue Per Lawyer is determined by dividing firm revenue by the total number of attorneys (both associate and partner level). Profits Per Partner is derived from dividing firm profits by the number of equity partners. A general rule of thumb is that the closer these two metrics are, the less profits equity partners will earn from the firm’s platform; if associates on average are generating a similar amount of revenue as equity partners are receiving in profit distributions, then partners are more or less not realizing profits from increased leverage or profitable bill rates (or a combination of both). Even worse, if PPP is less than RPL, then partners are actually subsidizing the costs of associates. It is not surprising that K&E has RPL of around $1.6mm and PPP of around $5mm while Steptoe has RPL of around $1mm and PPP of around $1mm. In short, K&E partners are very profitable given the platform while Steptoe partners hit a plateau with their profitability.


2) Leverage. Leverage is the ratio of all lawyers minus equity partners, to equity partners. In essence, it describes how the firm structures its practice around its main profit makers. As long as associates are generating more than they are taking after the firm incurs their direct and associated costs, leverage will increase the profit margin for equity partners. One single partner can only bill so much time regardless of premium bill rates. For example, say a partner bills out at $1,000 an hour and collects on 1,800 hours. That is $1.8mm in top line revenue (i.e., revenue before paying for office, admin, marketing, partner compensation, and the like). Without staffing and keeping busy associates as well, partners cannot expect to earn more than 40 percent on the very high end from his or her time. However, if the partner keeps four associates busy at premium rates, they greatly increase their and the firm’s earning potential. If four associates bill out at $600 per hour for 2,000 hours, the firm generates $5mm topline from keeping an additional four associates busy. Since associates are compensated at around market, a bigger chunk of their RPL flows through to the equity partners, who receive a higher take on profits. Unsurprisingly, there is a positive correlation between profitability and leverage, with diminishing returns.


3) Contingency. Now we are talking potentially big gains. Many law firms just don’t have the appetite for full-blown contingent work. Some firms dabble in hybrid contingent work by receiving partial payment from litigation funding that guarantees some lower billable rate and some sort of success fee kicker. We have seen some game-changing wins for certain firms from taking on the right contingent matters and hedging the opportunity cost of a loss in time spent on such matters by accepting confirmed, reduced rates from a litigation fund. That said, many firms have committees that approve these kinds of alternative fee structures, and if the firm doesn’t have the appetite to entertain the risk, a partner with a potentially lucrative contingent matter, coupled with litigation funding just may find him or herself boxed out of big gains.

4) Conflicts. The bigger the firm, the more likely the conflicts. Imagine winning a matter or transaction, and you are gearing up to staff the work, just to find out that the conflict committee has decided to decline the opportunity for either business or legal reasons. For every dollar of work conflicted out, you can expect to miss out on at least 25 cents. Unfortunately, we have seen some partners conflicted out of millions of dollars in lost revenue that went to another firm because of conflicts. You may want to ask yourself whether the firm’s office in Abu Dhabi is working for you or against you. Conflicts are sometimes crippling and game changing.

5) Profit Margins. Although profit margin is controlled by a number of factors, the most important two are cost controls and bill rates. Some firms are just not managed efficiently. They have empty offices with long-term leases, they are effectively funding pension plans, or possibly they are writing off time and not collecting on work. Either way, conservative firm management in controlling cost is a necessary element of running a lean machine. That said, lean cost controls aren’t sufficient for high profit margins. Premium bills rates, coupled with efficient staffing arrangements, are necessary to generate high profit margins unless you are a firm with one or two offices and are expected to work your own hours and keep half of an associate busy. The firms that compete on price as a measure value are limited in their ability to pay their partners, and partners at these firms will finds themselves actually subsidizing their associates, not vice versa.

6) It’s not the firm, it’s your practice. Some practices are just not all that scalable, albeit important service practices that are necessary in a full-service platform (or maybe more appropriate in boutiques). The reasons are mostly tied to bill rates and leverage. Over time, we have seen T&E move to the boutiques, tax is mostly limited to servicing deals, and the like.

Your firm may offer the best platform for your practice, but for most, you likely have hit a plateau in compensation.   If you have questions on how to increase your compensation or how your business projects with other firms, my colleagues and I at [Lateral Link](http://mainspringlegal.com/) are happy to help.

# Another Biglaw Firm Raises Billing Requirements In The Wake Of The Pay Raise
## This is becoming a trend, and it's not surprising.

How are law firms paying for the [Great Associate Pay Raise of 2016](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2016-salary-increase/)? Anecdotal evidence suggests they’re taking several different approaches, sometimes in combination.

A firm can make [clients](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/new-york-biglaw-makes-waaaay-more-money-than-the-rest-of-you/) pay for the raises, by raising rates. It make partners pay for the raises, by taking the money out of partner profits (let’s see if we notice this when the new Am Law 100 rankings come out next month). It can make support staff pay for the raises, by conducting [staff layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/staff-layoffs/) (and taking other steps to trim expenses). And it can make associates pay for the raises, by making them work hard(er) for the money.

Wilson Sonsini — which [raised associate salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/silicon-valley-giant-finally-moves-on-associate-pay/) last June, a little on the late side (after peer firms like [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-firm-bumps-salary-to-attract-and-retain-the-best-and-brightest-attorneys/) and [Fenwick & West](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/that-180k-payday-is-spreading-on-the-west-coast/) had raised) — is now raising its billable-hour requirement. A disgruntled tipster reports:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
[Last week] WSGR sent an email to associates raising bonus hour requirements to 1950 hours (from 1900) and providing that individuals who release their time late can see their bonuses reduced by $5,000 or more (which is a bit ridiculous in my opinion). They also claim that 1950 hours is consistent with market — I am not aware of other CA-based firms having this requirement, unless this is a recent development.

Actually, in fairness to the firm, a number of WSGR’s peer firms do have either a billable-hours requirement or target of 1950 (at least for $180K scale and/or bonus eligibility). See, e.g., [Cooley](http://www.chambers-associate.com/cooley/true-picture/3562/1), [Fenwick](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/that-180k-payday-is-spreading-on-the-west-coast/), [Morrison & Foerster](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/associate-bonus-watch-mo-money-at-mofo/), and [Orrick](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/associate-bonus-watch-a-west-coast-player-weighs-in/).

And the strategy of making associates pay (quite literally) for delinquent time entry is also not new to Biglaw. See, e.g., [Norton Rose Fulbright](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/07/biglaw-firms-new-timekeeping-policy-may-screw-associates-out-of-bonuses/), [Hughes Hubbard](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/12/hughes-hubbard-is-the-latest-firm-to-crack-the-time-keeping-whip/), and [Simpson Thacher](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/11/simpson-thacher-threatens-to-withhold-salary-for-delinquent-time-keepers/).

As for raising the billable-hour requirement in the wake of the pay raise, that too is something we’ve seen before. See, e.g., [Crowell & Moring](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/with-great-raises-come-great-increased-billing-requirements-the-other-side-of-raises/) and [Perkins Coie](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/firm-offers-raises-retroactive-to-july-1/). (If your firm has pulled a similar move, let us know, [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Hours%20Requirement) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Hours Requirement”)).

There’s no such thing as a [free lunch](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/06/inside-straight-no-such-thing-as-a-free-lunch/) — especially in Biglaw.

# Firm's Good Deed Couldn't BEE A Worse Metaphor

Honey bees are critical cogs in a functioning ecosystem. We all like things to grow and those things need pollinators. So after years of [colony collapse disorder](https://www.epa.gov/pollinator-protection/colony-collapse-disorder) wreaking havoc on the natural order of things, it’s nice to see companies doing their part to help keep the noble Apis functioning.

So frame everything we’re going to say here through the lens that what this firm is doing deserves praise. But how the firm markets its social responsibility to its employees might require some attention.

Enter Fenwick & West, a firm that has yet to match the latest salary jump — though we suspect it will eventually. The firm scored a messaging victory with its bonus system that offers [a little extra to high billers so they can actually take a vacation](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/market-bonuses-with-extra-money-earmarked-for-lawyers-who-really-need-a-vacation/), so it knows how to send a message.

But they can’t all be home runs.



Yes, because no imagery better expresses a commitment to collegiality and work-life balance than sitting at a desk watching a swarm of genetically coded serfs toil for their queen until the moment they die and are unceremoniously dumped on the ground to make way for the next class. Bees do have a superpower: conveying to associates the virtue of quiet servitude.

If there’s a lesson here, it’s not that no good deed goes unpunished, it’s that not every good deed needs a livestream.

Obviously no one at the firm was trying to tell associates, “Watch this, everybody — see how these little jackholes never ask their queen about Milbank sharing royal jelly?” but you don’t always get to control how a rhetorical artifact plays out once it leaves your hands.

Imagery aside, it also says, “We put all this effort into food porn for Pooh Bear, but we’ve not had time to hash out salary.” Which isn’t necessarily fair because it’s not like the same firm representatives sorting out Operation Honey Pot here are in charge of comp structure, but optics aren’t always fair.

Honestly, whenever I’m done covering this industry, firms should pay me as an outsider to just to read their internal and external communications and tell them, “Okay, here’s how this one unintentionally backfires on you.” Because this isn’t the first story I’ve written where the disconnect between praise and annoyed tipsters is a communication breakdown. My free advice to Fenwick now that this one is out there is to spin it as “these bees are working from home… and now you can permanently too!” or something.

So good for Fenwick for investing in a worthy endeavor. Just remember to run your messaging by a bigger hivemind first.

# The Glass Ceiling Report: Law Firms Say They Support Women, But Are Nowhere Near Closing The Gender Gap
## The legal profession is still overwhelmingly male, with policies skewed in their favor.

The pandemic brought about a lot of bad news, but when it came to women’s progress in the legal profession, there was no news at all. No news is good news, right? No, and women are sick and tired of this being the case.

Despite the fact that women lawyers across the country have led movements for gender equality and equal pay, women are still “struggling” to find gender parity within the law. Women continue to be underrepresented in private practice, especially when it comes to attaining leadership roles. In fact, in the last year at the average law firm, from associate to equity partner, women’s representation has increased by no more than a percentage point, a statistic that’s been depressingly static for years.

There are now more women in law school than ever before, but men still lead the pack when it comes to private practice, making up about two-thirds of attorneys in this sector of the legal profession with gender-discrimination suits still being continuously filed by women. What’s more (but more accurately, much less) is that within those private practice firms, only 23.3 percent of equity partners are women.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
This was all during the coronavirus crisis, when women working at law firms were “disproportionately affected” by the “intensified … struggle of balancing law careers with caregiving responsibilities.” In fact, according to Law360’s survey, 42% of attorneys who left their firms in 2020 were women, and women of color made up 13% of those departures.

How can progress for women in the law be made when the odds seem to be stacked against them? Some law firms are leading the way, and thanks to Law360’s annual [Glass Ceiling Report](https://www.law360.com/pulse/articles/1415466), we now know which ones are the best for women.

Law360 surveyed more than 270 U.S. firms, or vereins with a U.S. component, about the demographics of their lawyer workforce as of December 31, 2020. Firms were then grouped into tiers based on U.S. attorney headcount, and ranked by the percentage of women across three attorney levels and how those measures compare with the potential marketplace of hires.

In the biggest of Biglaw category, those with 601+ attorneys, the top 5 firms are:

1. Jackson Lewis
2. Littler
3. Debevoise
4. WilmerHale
5. Ogletree

For Biglaw firms with slightly smaller headcount, 251-600 attorneys, the top 5 are:

Law firms continue to claim that they’re trying to change; they’ve been doing so for years, with little to no progress, and the pandemic made this even more apparent.

[T]hese uninspiring numbers aren’t a sudden result of the pandemic. Many firm leaders have [entrenched biases](https://www.law360.com/pulse/articles/1163514) about women that affect compensation, assignments and evaluations — judgments that can present particularly large obstacles for female attorneys of color. In spite of parental leave policies, female attorneys who shift time from their careers to their children risk the perception of [being uncommitted](https://www.law360.com/pulse/articles/1295575/law-firms-must-note-pandemic-s-outsize-impact-on-women) to their firms, creating a tougher climb up the legal hierarchy.

If these barriers were eliminated industrywide, the number of women coming through the legal pipeline would likely be even larger. At this stage, firms’ headcounts show that many industry heavyweights face extensive work at creating an equitable gender breakdown in their attorney ranks.

During these unprecedented times, law firms must do much, much more to support women. Kudos to all Biglaw firms that do more than just pay lip service to gender parity and actually follow through to make these important and necessary changes.

This bonus season is off to a shit start. All I know is that if tax reform passes, New York needs to go to $200K to compensate for the lost SALT deduction. Only states and cities that levy SALT tax should get a raise.

— A disappointed Biglaw associate, offering commentary on Biglaw’s 2017 bonus season and the [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1), which if enacted, would [completely eliminate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act_of_2017#State_and_local_taxes) federal deductions for state and local taxes (SALT). According to a Tax Foundation report, New York has the [heaviest state and local tax burden](https://taxfoundation.org/state-local-tax-burden-rankings-fy-2012) in the nation.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# BIGLAW SUMMER BONUSES HAVE ARRIVED
## The first bonuses of the year... or maybe the last bonuses of last year.

The summer blockbuster season is upon us, and while it may be gray and dismal in New York today, the world of Biglaw is about to heat up with the first announcement of summer bonuses.

Last year, after Milbank kicked off the first wave of salary movement, firms started sweetening their matches with an extra bonus to brighten the summer for associates. We wondered at the time whether or not this would become a routine practice around Biglaw or if this was just another one-off to add to the crazy summer of 2018. As it turns out we’re still wondering, but this move certainly complicates the industry comp picture.

The firm handing out bonuses is Perkins Coie, a firm that most wouldn’t expect to be the first mover in this space and that’s because — in a sense — they are the last mover. When we reached out, they provided the following statement:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“Earlier this week, Perkins Coie announced that we will pay special, mid-year bonuses to eligible associates and counsel in all our offices. The bonuses will range in size up to $25,000 based on office and seniority.

Last summer, when other firms announced associate salary increases and special summer bonuses, we increased our compensation in most offices and earlier this year we increased compensation in two additional offices. We did not pay the special bonuses last summer given our broad geographic footprint and diversity of markets, but we continued to consider the issue. We recently decided to pay bonuses to eligible associates and counsel across our 16 U.S. offices as a “catch-up” for the bonuses they might have received last summer.”

So this is probably correctly styled as the summer bonus the firm didn’t offer last year, making this bonus payout functionally Perkins Coie finally making the pot good. Except, even if this is a catch-up, could some Biglaw behemoth already toying with summer bonuses use this news as a signal that it’s time to pull the trigger and assert itself as the new market leader?

No doubt there are some partner meetings coming up. Could this be an agenda item? We’ll be paying close attention over the coming weeks.

# At This Point, Get Clarence Thomas For Tax Evasion
## Get buddy up out of here.

Funny thing about being a member of the highest court — you get to break whichever financial laws you want! At least, [that’s what a friend told Clarence Thomas one day](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/thomas-responded-to-his-paper-trail-of-law-breaking-with-my-friends-said-it-was-okay-we-should-expect-better-of-our-judiciary/) and he’s been running with it ever since. As Thomas’s financial shenanigans have come to light, Chief Justice John Roberts hasn’t really said much in the way of condemning his behavior or demanding actions that line up with redressing wrongs done. But you know who has a great reputation for doing that? The IRS.

In 1999, Anthony Welters lent Thomas a considerable cash sum to buy an RV. It was loaned on very generous terms with an understanding that the balance would be paid by 2004. Then 2008 came. At that point, Welters decided to forgive the debt. But you know what the IRS considers forgiven debts? That’s right — income!  And if Clarence doesn’t make good on that income he failed to report, they might come for him. It also doesn’t help matters that the numbers given don’t make much sense. From the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/us/politics/clarence-thomas-rv-loan-senate-inquiry.html):

In a contemporaneous note to Justice Thomas, summarized by the investigators, Mr. Welters said he was doing so because the justice’s many years of “interest only” payments now exceeded the purchase price of the bus. For that reason, Mr. Welters told Justice Thomas, he did not feel it was appropriate to continue to accept payments, even though he had the right to them.

But Mr. Welters’s math doesn’t add up: Even if Justice Thomas had made all the scheduled annual interest-only payments, that would only amount to a little over $180,000 — nearly $87,000 short of the purchase price. What’s more, the only proof of payment that Mr. Welters was able to provide to investigators was a copy of a single canceled check, dated December 2000, for $20,042 — the amount of a single interest payment.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
If we take as a given that Thomas made at least one $20k payment to Welters — because that’s how it looks:

Senate Finance Committee finds ""Justice Thomas Did Not Repay Substantial Portion of $267,230 Loan"" from wealthy friend for RV that NYT first reported [pic.twitter.com/zWibRGuLsn](https://t.co/zWibRGuLsn)

— Justin Elliott (@JustinElliott) [October 25, 2023](https://twitter.com/JustinElliott/status/1717258415875989592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

There’s still the matter of the compounding interest. When Welters decided to stop collecting, the principal — along with the interest — all becomes taxable income. Maybe that’s why Thomas has been [speaking at so many FedSoc fundraisers](https://www.propublica.org/article/we-dont-talk-about-leonard-leo-supreme-court-supermajority?utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter) — you can play with the Constitution all you want, [but you better not play with the IRS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G56VgsLfKY4).
