# Biglaw Is Doomed If This Becomes A Trend
## Surprising no one, clients are increasingly refusing to pay for associates.

The Biglaw financial model relies upon leverage, the fancy term for throwing armies of young associates at a matter and watching the profits funnel ever upward into the partnership coffers. While $2000/hour partners may [inspire a few headlines](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/2000-an-hour-lawyers-thats-one-way-to-fund-salary-increases/), multi-millionaires billing four figures aren’t nearly as lucrative as a couple of $180K associates grinding out 2400 hours at $400 an hour. This is how Biglaw stays big.

The fact that deep-pocketed clients are forking over — in substantial part — for these fresh-faced lawyers to get all their on-the-job training is just another perk of sitting on top of the Biglaw food chain.

But general counsel may have finally had enough of it. At least according to this [Am Law Daily report](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202798363967/Pay-for-Associate-Hours-More-Companies-Say-No-Thanks/) on the recent SOLID Summit:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
At a Manhattan [conference on legal innovation](https://www.cowenevents.com/) this month, Mark Smolik, the general counsel of DHL Supply Chain Americas, had a message for the law firm representatives in his audience.

“Sorry, law firms. You spend on the training,” Smolik said. “I cannot afford to pay your associates $325 an hour.”

Instead, Smolik told the group, he’d go straight to the source for young legal talent, and “pick them up right out of law school.”

Biglaw already faced an associate demand problem as document review vendors have chipped away at the need for the legions of litigation minions of the past, while review technology — [for example, Kira Systems](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/artificial-confusion-the-overblown-threat-of-artificial-intelligence/) — will reduce the need for transactional headcount. If clients rob firms of the profit motive to hire young lawyers, then just how much business sense does it make to be Biglaw? That overhead doesn’t pay itself.

That said, we’ve heard clients talk about [drawing a line in the sand](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/some-clients-are-super-pissed-about-associate-raises/) over paying for associate salaries before. At the end of the day, Cravath still got its pound of flesh. But it’s one thing to complain about fees and another to take the bull by the horns and hire young lawyers directly. With in-house departments using their own headcount to handle more matters, the Am Law 50 may still manage to collect some associate billables on complex matters. A solid brand can open even the stingiest wallets.

But the rest of the legal industry might find all their leverage blink out of existence.

Efforts to increase diversity and inclusion in the legal industry have been gaining steam in recent years, with the spotlight increasingly focused on the specific steps lawyers and firms can take to make improvements. 

Several upcoming programs from PLI will provide useful insights into the current state of diversity and inclusion in the legal industry and what’s being done to make progress. The first is a one-day program, [Diversity & Inclusion in Law Practice 2022](https://www.pli.edu/programs/diversity--inclusion-in-law-practice?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2), with a panel of experts reviewing diversity and inclusion in the legal profession today and discussing practical policies and best practices you can put into action in your own workplace.

Topics to be covered include: 

- Recognizing what needs to be done (both individually and institutionally) to build an inclusive workplace
- Identifying proven practices and policies you can implement to advance diversity and inclusion initiatives in your law office 
- Learning how to create mentoring circles that extend beyond your law office to counter diverse attorneys’ professional isolation and support retention efforts
This program is ideal for all members of the legal profession who are concerned about diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace, regardless of their role or the nature of their organization. [Register](https://www.pli.edu/programs/diversity--inclusion-in-law-practice?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2) today. 

Another program, [Unconscious Bias: How to Recognize and Disrupt Its Impact on Your Decision-Making Process](https://www.pli.edu/programs/unconscious-bias--how-to-recognize-and-disrupt-its-impact-on-your-decision-making-process?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2), is a one-hour briefing designed to shed light on unconscious bias (also known as implicit bias) and how it might impact your decisions at work.

Everyone has unconscious biases, and this session will offer ways to identify yours, and how they may surface at work. Topics to be discussed include: 

- Defining unconscious bias and explaining its impact on decision-making
- Examples of law office unconscious bias and strategies for disruption
- Defining microaggressions/micro-inequities and common examples of how they occur in the legal profession
- Strategies to disrupt unconscious bias in your decision-making process
- Strategies to eliminate microaggressions in the legal profession 
[Register](https://www.pli.edu/programs/unconscious-bias--how-to-recognize-and-disrupt-its-impact-on-your-decision-making-process?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2) today to learn more about this critical topic.

Finally, for an in-depth look at implicit bias — with an interactive twist — check out PLI’s on-demand program, [Diversity and Inclusion in the Legal Profession: Addressing Implicit Bias](https://www.pli.edu/programs/diversity-and-inclusion-in-the-legal-profession?t=ondemand&p=340629&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2). 

This two-hour program takes learners behind the scenes at the production of a TV drama about a fictional law firm, inviting participants to help make choices around casting, scripts, and storylines to help improve diversity. Through role-playing and goal-setting, participants can gain an understanding of the issues limiting progress on DEI in law firms, and learn ways to address them and create positive change.

[Register and start learning today](https://www.pli.edu/programs/diversity-and-inclusion-in-the-legal-profession?t=ondemand&p=340629&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2).

# Associates At This Firm Are REALLY Pissed About Their Bonuses...
## Associates at this firm say morale is terrible.

… and they haven’t even received them yet.

Earlier this month, we asked readers to [get in touch with us](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/so-who-is-pissed-about-their-bonuses/) if they were angry about their bonuses. This week, we received a slew of complaints from associates at Irell & Manella, the elite California firm that was once known for its market-beating bonuses. Unfortunately, in recent years, the firm’s bonus bounty — while still better than the standard market match — has been smaller than usual. In fact, since 2011, when the firm paid [double the Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/01/associate-bonus-watch-irell-whacks-cravath-again/), Irell’s bonus payouts have shrunk in size each year. Considering the fact that many associates could have jumped ship to Hueston Hennigan, a firm that announced [incredibly generous bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/associate-bonus-watch-still-more-boutique-bonus-bounty/) this week, on top of a [spring bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/associate-bonus-watch-spring-bonuses-is-this-real-life/) paid earlier this year, those who remained at Irell are understandably upset. Here’s a gripe we received from one Irell associate:

Associate morale at Irell is terrible. The firm seems to be squeezing out more associates. Meanwhile, across the way we see Hueston Hennigan flourishing and richly rewarding their associates. People around here are kind of depressed.

Everyone is hoping the firm will step up and be competitive with Hueston Hennigan, but no one thinks it will happen. For years, Irell was dominant on the compensation front. People came to Irell because Irell could not be beat compensation wise. That is no longer true.

A second Irell tipster contacted us with the following information: “All the associates feel worn out and let down. The firm hasn’t even announced the MEETING to announce bonuses yet.” Given that Irell usually announces its bonuses before Christmas, that means there’s going to be a meeting next week, or the firm is going to break with tradition and keep its associates waiting until after the holiday.

What do Irell associates think will happen when their bonuses are finally announced?

The consensus among associates seems to be they will do the same they did last year. The firm usually comes in over Cravath, but considering the Hueston Hennigan bonuses, I think people are going to be disappointed anyway.

For the record, this is what the Irell bonuses looked like [last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-same-as-it-ever-was/) (with the market bonus, i.e., Cravath, indicated parenthetically). We’ve updated this for the 2016 scale:

If and when Irell pays out the exact same bonus scale as it did last year, associates who opted to remain with the firm are going to feel pretty hurt. We think that this Irell associate really hit the nail on the head with her commentary about bonuses:

No one wants to feel like the associates who deserted to HH are doing better than the associates who decided to stay and be loyal. It’s personal. The people who stayed, they want to feel like they made the right choice and that the firm recognizes and appreciates them. That’s where it is lacking — a lot of associates here don’t feel appreciated.

A final Irell associate described the firm’s partnership as “tone deaf,” “blind to outside perception,” and “out of touch.” Will those in charge of the firm even care that its associates are so upset? We certainly hope so, but if not, we have a feeling that a [certain boutique law firm](https://www.hueston.com/careers) would be happy to harbor some additional Irell & Manella refugees.

So who else out there knows the holidays won’t be happy (at least money-wise)? Drop us an [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com) and let us know — we’d love to hear your complaints. Funny, biting, or otherwise interesting responses may be published anonymously here on Above the Law.

Ramble on: Y. Peter Kang of Law360.com reports that “[Pa. Court Tosses ‘Excessively Rambling’ Med Mal Appeal](https://www.law360.com/articles/963128/pa-court-tosses-excessively-rambling-med-mal-appeal)” (subscription required for full access).

You can access Tuesday’s ruling of the [Superior Court of Pennsylvania](http://www.pacourts.us/courts/superior-court/) at [this link](http://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Superior/out/Opinion%20-%20Affirmed%20-%2010324137623811662.pdf).

Regardless of how rambling the brief turned out to be — and it can be persuasively argued that any amount of rambling is too much where an appellate brief is concerned — the brief’s critical objective flaw, according to Tuesday’s ruling, was that it was 4,548 words longer than the applicable 14,000-word limit for principal briefs in Pennsylvania state court appeals.

# When Exactly Will These Biglaw Associates See Their Bonuses?
## Just because associates are getting market sized bonuses, it doesn't mean they're happy.

On the surface, there’s not too much remarkable about the bonus announcement made by Paul Hastings. The bonus scale is on par with the market, there’s extra money available for associates who had an especially good year, and associates who missed the hours requirement for [special summer bonuses ](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/the-raise-train-continues-reaching-11-u-s-offices-yesterday/)have an opportunity to true up if they hit the end-of-the-year billing targets.

Here’s the expected bonus schedule:

Read the full memo below.

So, if the basics are in line with the market standard, what’s there to complain about? Well, the announcement didn’t come out until February 25th and the compensation memo indicates that associates will be paid 2018 bonuses “in March” with no indication which of the 31 days of the month they might expect their money.

And some associates are pissed:

Paul Hastings just matched the market scale for bonuses, but is scheduling them to be paid “in March,” just showing a stunningly casual disregard for their associates’ ability to do any financial planning. Not only are we the last to pay out, but we still don’t even know by how much we’re last.

Yes, waiting until late February to make a move is Paul Hastings [standard operating procedure](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/associate-bonus-watch-better-late-than-never-2/), but that doesn’t mean all the associates are taking it with an accepting shrug. As a tipster reports:

Associates at PH are livid, and I think it invites an open question about whether or not a promise to “pay market” necessarily implies that you pay *near the same time* as the market (and not months later).

As Tom Petty crooned, waiting is the hardest part.

# Uh-Oh! Why Is This Biglaw Firm Deferring Partner Profits?
## This firm may not be out of the woods just yet...

We looked at cash collections… the recapitalization process, the tax, and the cash flow of the firm… and we think the prudent thing to do is to defer the distribution.

It’s not unusual. We look at the cash needs of the EUME business on a month-by-month basis and defer partner profit distributions if needs be, this has happened a small number of times this year. But we want to be making those distributions every month by having the working capital position of the firm and our cash flow management where they need to be — that’s what we’re addressing right now.

— [Stuart Fuller](http://www.kwm.com/en/people/stuart-fuller), managing partner of 2,000-lawyer firm [King & Wood Mallesons](http://www.kwm.com/en), explaining why [profits were not being disbursed to partners](https://bol.bna.com/why-king-wood-mallesons-is-deferring-some-partner-profits/), despite the fact that partners were recently asked to [contribute $18.4 million to the firm](https://bol.bna.com/king-wood-mallesons-raises-18-4m-from-partners/) in a capital call. Fuller says that capital infusion won’t be paid until summer’s end, and the firm needed to pay U.K. partners’ taxes in July. Partners are still receiving their monthly draws.

When asked if this would be the last month that partners’ profits would be deferred, Fuller said, “We are being very conservative with our working capital. We made that communication with our current partners… They have the entitlement to get that profit.”

# The 2020 Litigation Finance Survey Report
## Lawyers in every single industry we examined saw a significant uptick in firsthand experience with litigation finance.

Since publishing our inaugural litigation finance survey in 2017, in partnership with [Lake Whillans](https://lakewhillans.com/), each subsequent iteration has been a story of ever-increasing traction for the practice of third-party funding. Our 2020 findings continue this narrative, and show a marked increase in the scale and momentum of the field’s development and acceptance. Perhaps the most striking finding in this year’s survey was a nearly 30 percent year-to-year increase in the percentage of respondents reporting that they had firsthand experience with litigation finance.

Other findings include:

- Lawyers in every single industry we examined saw a significant uptick (at least 10 percent) in firsthand experience with litigation finance.
- Nearly 100 percent (99.36 percent) of respondents with firsthand experience with litigation finance agreed that they would use litigation finance again.
- The proportion of respondents who would not consider litigation finance has plummeted since the 2019 survey.
- Roughly three-quarters of our respondents stated that litigation finance has become more relevant to their practice in the last year.
We note that our survey data was collected before the COVID-19 crisis and the financial turmoil it has caused. These findings demonstrate that litigation finance is well poised to meet the challenges companies and law firms are now facing. Claim monetization, financing of claimholders, and capital for law firms are core offerings of a litigation financier like Lake Whillans, and are likely to become even more attractive solutions to many more companies and firms as we move through 2020 and beyond. We expect that next year’s survey results will show marked differences as litigation finance further penetrates every segment of the market driven by new necessities and creative problem solving.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

Rudy Giuliani (Photo by Rob Kim/Getty)

New Trump attorney Rudolph Giuliani went on Sean Hannity tonight and decided to completely blow up one of Donald Trump’s many legal cases. He blew it right the f**k up. It’s gone. Bye-bye.

Donald Trump has been arguing that he didn’t have a relationship with adult film actress Stormy Daniels, that he knew nothing about Michael Cohen’s hush-money payment to Daniels, and that he generally knew nothing about nobody. Trump went on Air Force One and said that he did not know about Michael Cohen’s payment.

And Rudy Giuliani just went on cable television and basically [called Trump a liar](https://twitter.com/yashar/status/991855306350133249).

Yep, Giuliani said that Trump did reimburse Cohen, “funneling” the money through a law firm (which is not a word you want to use when your personal attorney is under investigation for fraud), but Trump “didn’t know the specifics of it.” A flabbergasted Sean Hannity actually pressed Giuliani on the point. He noted that Cohen has repeatedly said that he paid the money out of his own funds, without asking Trump. Giuliani said, “I don’t know. I have not investigated that. No reason to doubt him… I like Michael a lot.”

Yeah, so, Cohen didn’t even get a full-throated expression of support from Giuliani. Chew on that, Michael, when you are weighing whether or not to plead out and flip.

Trump supporters, I suppose, will argue that Trump just paid his lawyer $130,000 without asking why. And Cohen will still argue that he paid a porn star $130,000 without asking his client if he needed to. But… there is literally no rational person who could possibly believe all that any more. Trump people thought Mexico was going to pay for the wall, so I’m not impugning them with the heavy burden of rational thought, but Giuliani just told us what we already know: that Trump and Cohen have been lying about Stormy Daniels this whole time.

So… you have to ask why. The answer is in the very next thing that came out of Giuliani’s mouth: “That money was not campaign money, sorry. I’m giving you a fact now that you don’t know. It’s not campaign money. No campaign finance violation.”

Donald Trump is personally concerned with the implication that he slept with a porn star. But his legal team has always, always, always been more concerned with the campaign finance violations. Paying hush money to a porn star is just gross. The campaign finance violation is a crime.

It seems likely that Giuliani made the decision to give up the ghost on the porn star payment, which was always a lie and a very obvious one at that, in an exchange to say the next line: the money was not “campaign” money, so… no violation. That’s the bigger fish, in Giuliani’s mind. Whether he actually consulted with anybody on the Trump legal team is a matter of debate. Who is actually running Trump’s legal team at this very physical moment is a matter of debate, [given the upheavals of today](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/ty-cobb-out-emmet-flood-in-constitutional-crisis-looms/).

The problem is that NOTHING Giuliani said actually inoculates Trump or Cohen from any possible campaign finance violation. Giuliani can say that “it’s not campaign money,” but that’s Rudy being worried about the entirely wrong thing. If Cohen made the payment, then that could be viewed as a campaign contribution. Paying somebody back for campaign contributions doesn’t… unmake the violation. Did Michael Cohen give Trump a personal loan? Was he paid back with interest? Just because Trump can donate as much of his own money to his campaign doesn’t mean Michael Cohen can.

Giuliani also said that Trump paid Cohen back over time, which could be a whole other ball of trouble for Trump. Was he, for instance, still paying Cohen off — sorry, “back,” — after it became clear that the F.B.I. was looking into Cohen? Was Trump… structuring the payments to avoid reporting requirements? Giuliani was not speaking with the discretion necessary of a defense lawyer who is going to risk going on television.

And for good measure, Giuliani ALSO said that Trump fired James Comey because Comey would not publicly say that Trump was not a target of the F.B.I. investigation. … Which sounds MORE like obstruction of justice than ever before.

After Giuliani was hired, [I said on All In With Chris Hayes](http://www.msnbc.com/transcripts/all-in/2018-04-20) that the #Resistance shouldn’t at all be worried about Giuliani coming on the team… because Giuliani is an old, bad lawyer who was more likely than not to make things worse. I feel like it’s taken a week for me to be proven right. The man just went into a friendly interview, admitted that the president and his personal lawyer have been lying, ineffectively tried to set up a defense to campaign finance violations, and deepened the case for obstruction of justice.

And you know what? None of this probably really matters because Robert Mueller and the S.D.N.Y. probably already have all the documents they need to prove that Giuliani was, I guess, telling the truth about all the dirt he just exposed on TV.

‘Take care of this cat situation, right meow.’

An associate at a Biglaw firm in London has reportedly lost his job over something absolutely, pawsitively ridiculous.

As first reported by [RollOnFriday](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-travers-smith-associate-dismissed-after-complaining-client-sold-him-flea), an associate at Travers Smith — a firm that brought in $244,327,250 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 26 on most recent UK 100 ranking — was on a secondment at Inflexion, one of the firm’s private equity clients. While there, an employee posted on the company’s internal messaging app, attempting to sell some kittens. The associate jumped at the chance, offering to take two, but little did they know that this attempt to buy some pets would end in catastrophe.

One week later, the associate attempted to return the kittens because they had fleas. That’s when all of the trouble started. From RollOnFriday:

[The seller] refused, but over the next couple of weeks the Travers associate repeatedly messaged her to say that she needed to take the kittens back and refund him because their fleas meant they were not sold as described, sources told ROF.

His requests culminated in an eight page letter which set out “all his legal and statutory rights” and demanded that the seller take the cats back and refund him or he would initiate court proceedings against her, said sources.

What a sourpuss. From there, a chain of events began that would land the associate’s career in the litter box.

Inflexion reported the associate to HR, HR went to legal, legal went to Travers, and the associate’s secondment was lost. Travers Smith reportedly asked the associate to apologize to the seller at Inflexion and donate the cats to shelter. According to ROF, the associate allegedly refused to give the cats away for free, and said they would do so if, and only if, the firm refunded the purchase price.

# Solicitor General Don Verrilli's Surprising Credit Card Debt
## Why does a wealthy former Biglaw partner carry credit card debt at high interest rates?

Your Honors, can you spare a dime? (Photo of Donald B. Verrilli Jr. by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)

Deities of the legal profession: they’re just like us! They carry too much credit card debt, at excessive interest rates.

Back in 2009, we arched an eyebrow at Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor’s [$30,000 in dentist and credit card bills](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/06/does-judge-sotomayor-need-a-visit-from-suze-orman/). Conventional wisdom in personal finance frowns upon carrying such big balances, especially given the usually high rates that accompany credit card debt (as opposed to, say, secured debt like a home mortgage).

But it seems that Justice Sotomayor isn’t the only high-flying legal eagle to ignore this advice. A tipster recently drew our attention to the financial disclosure forms of the [outgoing Solicitor General](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/solicitor-general-don-verrilli-to-step-down-perhaps-before-all-scotus-opinions-are-announced/), Donald Verrilli Jr. If you look at his [2012 form](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Donald-B-Verrilli-2012Form278certified.pdf) (page 13) and his [2015 form](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Donald-B-Verilli-2015Form278.pdf) (page 6), you’ll see five-figure credit card balances at rates ranging from 12 to 23 percent. We share our source’s puzzlement:

How does a former longtime law firm partner consistently carry credit card debt with double-digit interest rates? What sort of basic personal finance lessons did he miss along the way?

Either he’s weirdly broke/illiquid (doesn’t seem to be the case!) or he’s casually indifferent to basic economic sense, which kind of suggests we need higher taxes (which we do)!

My money is on casual indifference. The amounts in question, while in the five figures, are probably too small for Verrilli to care about. On his home mortgage, a much more significant sum (between $500,001 and $1 million), he has a very nice rate of 3.125 percent.

So I wouldn’t be surprised if this consumer debt is just an oversight. If you look at the other pages of his disclosures, you’ll see ample liquid assets that could easily be used to eliminate those pesky credit card balances. Don Verrilli is not a poor man. Back in 2011, when the former Jenner & Block partner was confirmed as SG, his net worth clocked in at [more than $4 million](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/06/musical-chairs-don-verrilli-confirmed-as-solicitor-general/).

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The members of the Supreme Court like to [“CVSG”](http://www.scotusblog.com/reference/educational-resources/glossary-of-legal-terms/) — “Call for the View of the Solicitor General” — but they might want to ignore him when it comes to personal finance.

(P.S. One possibility that just occurred to me: could Verrilli be taking advantage of some kind of 0% APR balance transfer offer? If you avail yourself of such an offer and then have to list it in a federal financial disclosure, do you list the interest rate as the 0% introductory rate, or the rate that kicks in after the introductory period ends? If you know the answer to this question, please feel free to [email me](mailto:dlat@abovethelaw.com?subject=Don%20Verrilli).)

UPDATE (6/6/2016, 11:10 a.m.): We’ve received some interesting reader mail in response to this story; thanks, readers! Several of the messages raise the possibility that Verrilli isn’t carrying a balance; pays his credit card bills in full each month, perhaps to get points or miles (which is a best practice of personal finance); and just happened to have a high-spending month at the end of the reporting period (maybe because of spending on holiday gifts right before the end of the reporting period on December 31).

This is certainly possible. It’s worth noting, however, that if you read a lot of federal financial disclosures (as we do here at ATL), you rarely see any credit card debt under “Liabilities” — which is why Verrilli’s jumped out at us. For example, take this [2014 report on the Supreme Court justices’ disclosures](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/06/underneath-their-robes-a-detailed-dive-into-the-justices-financial-disclosures/) — the only justice who reported credit card debt was Sotomayor, even though the justices all presumably have credit cards that at any given time of the month have some balance on them.

Here’s the [relevant guidance](https://www.oge.gov/Web/278eGuide.nsf/Chapters/Liabilities?opendocument) from the Office of Government Ethics on reporting credit card debt, which notes that the following type of debt does not have to be disclosed:

Revolving charge accounts, such as credit card balances, if the outstanding liability did not exceed $10,000 at the close of the reporting period.

This explains why it’s rare to see credit card on federal financial disclosures. Many officials either (1) pay off all their credit card debt, or at least get it down to below $10,000, right before the end of the relevant reporting period, or (2) don’t have balances exceeding $10,000 in any event (whether they carry these balances or not).

In Don Verrilli’s case, he didn’t bother to get his debt below $10,000 prior to filing his disclosures (or perhaps he or his assistant misread the admittedly complex forms and instructions). So that’s why his credit card debt jumped out at us (and our initial tipster); it’s so unusual to see credit card debt listed on these forms for officials in his type of position.

Legal recruiting is all about getting the right attorneys into the right jobs. But to do that, recruiters have to get the attention of busy Biglaw lawyers and convince them to hitch their lateral career plans to the recruiter’s wagon. Especially when in-demand attorneys get a constant stream of recruiter correspondence, well, that’s no easy feat.

One recruiter is using the Summer of Swift to get Biglaw associates to respond. Above the Law tipsters have shared a recruiter email larded up with Taylor references, lyrics, and song titles. What an excellent way to stand out from the pack.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)

Subject: Lateral Haze? SWIFTly enter your new Era

[Name], are you Ready For It? Let us help you through the Lateral Haze and into your next Era.

It’s me. Hi. You’re not the problem, it’s the market. But really. If this unpredictable lateral market has you discouraged, you’re not alone. While it is anything but normal, we are seeing new searches posted daily and firms are still hiring!

If you or someone you know is interested in a lateral move, let our expertise and connections bring good karma your way.

No Bad Blood here, just the recruiting team of your Wildest Dreams:

IT’S A LOVE STORY, JUST SAY YES:

Just like Taylor Swift’s music, we’ve aged well, and ourtrio of recruiters have a combined 25+ years of experience. We are former Big Law and government attorneys, and last year was our most successful year ever.

SHAKE IT OFF TO YOUR NEXT JOB:

We will assist you to become the best Bejeweled version of yourself! When you walk into that interview, you will shimmer. We help you every step of the way, from resume edits/suggestions to interview preparation, interview scheduling, and salary negotiation.

THEY’VE GOT A BLANK SPACE (ON THIS APPLICATION), AND WE’LL WRITE YOUR NAME:

Let us do the hard work. First, we connect via a brief phone call to hear more about you and your ideal position. Next, we send you job postings from the markets of your choosing. Lastly, you pick where you want to be submitted, and voila. We handle the rest from there and make you stand out as the most competitive applicant.

ANYTHING BUT A CRUEL SUMMER:

While this market is anything but normal, opportunities exist if you know where to look! We often receive unpublished job orders and are in regular communication with our clients. We currently have multiple candidates interviewing + receiving competitive offers.

LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DO:

We won’t make you do anything you don’t want, but we would love to briefly chat if you or someone you know is interested. We won’t share your resume or information unless you explicitly give us permission. Confidentiality is our #1 priority.

Now is the IDEAL time to connect with us for moves later this summer and into the fall. We maintain an active national practice assisting attorneys in markets including Atlanta, Boston, California, Chicago, DC, Denver, the Midwest, Nashville, NYC, the Pacific Northwest, and Texas, among others.

We look forward to connecting with you soon.

Buddy

Buddy Apple, Esq.

Managing Director

Wegman Partners, LLC

# Attorney Sentenced To 7 1/2 Years In Prison For 'Systematically Defrauding' Biglaw Firm
## The judge was unimpressed with his excuse.

A former Cooley attorney, James Brien, was [sentenced to seven and a half years in prison](https://www.law360.com/articles/1420556) for “systematically defrauding” the law firm and another former employer, the English governmental agency Commonwealth Secretariat, for over £640,000 ($886,000). His scheme involved diverting payments made by both the Commonwealth Secretariat and Cooley to his own bank account.

At the Commonwealth Secretariat, Brien switched payment details for money owed to a consultant, Phil Simmons, to his own bank account. He followed that up with more fictitious invoices, to receive a total of £146,000 from that employer. He left the agency in 2018 over an unrelated disciplinary issue.

As [reported by](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/ex-cooley-lawyer-jailed-audacious-ps600000-fraud) Roll on Friday, that was far from the end of the story. He also was convicted of diverting funds to his own bank account while employed as special counsel at Cooley:

But the 48-year-old was also an expert fibber, and he managed to secure a job at Cooley by lying about the reasons for his departure.

Once he was in the door, the lawyer embarked on a new scam which saw him divert £403,000 paid by two clients to Cooley into his own account, followed by £90,000 from the Maldives government. His fraud only came to light when Simmons popped up and asked about a payment he was owed.

Brien was convicted of three counts of fraud and Judge Martin Griffiths called him “a strange person as far as I can see,” and “gave evidence with a capacity to lie, repeatedly.” And the judge referred to Brien’s blaming of an unknown hacker for the financial malfeasance as “complete moonshine.”

I guess the judge was happy to tell Brien how he really feels.

# A Biglaw Firm That Really Cares
## A look at Jenner & Block's co-managing partners.

Listen, I am surprised as anyone. When I sat down to interview Jenner & Block’s Co-Managing Partners Katya Jestin and Randy Mehrberg, I hardly anticipated being wowed by the firm’s dedication to social justice and pro bono representations, but here we are.

In this episode of The Jabot, I chat with Katya and Randy about their overall philosophy for managing a Biglaw firm, prioritizing diversity, the challenges in trying to create a unified culture across a giant firm and how has the pandemic heightened those issues. We also talk about Jenner & Block’s representation of Stacey Abrams’s Fair Fight Action and the need to modernize the Voting Rights Act.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

# Why The Mid-Market May Be The Prime Market For Tech Development
## Striking a balance between informed user feedback and a true partnership outlook make these firms great candidates.

There’s always a splash when an elite firm announces a partnership with a new legal technology firm. But as we discussed on [Legaltech Week](https://www.lawsitesblog.com/2021/02/legaltech-week-2021-02-05-legalweek-post-mortem-plus-the-panelists-top-stories.html) last episode, there are pitfalls with firm partnerships. Big firms can see the product as their proprietary tool and impede development by driving innovation toward their own parochial needs. With all the fanfare, a company just might set themselves up with a pair of golden handcuffs.

But products aren’t getting anywhere without user feedback. Perhaps the answer is the oft-overlooked mid-market.

This idea really hit me while catching up with Will Norton of [SimplyAgree](https://simplyagree.com/) during the Legalweek virtual festivities. SimplyAgree rolled out version 2.0 of its deal management tool in October and it already appears to be taking off like gangbusters, with December seeing the company’s biggest month of activity with about double the engagement. As one might expect, all the credit goes to the feedback the company gathered from its earlier release and constant engagement with users to find out what people want and to probe them with questions like, “But if we built this again from scratch, how should it look?”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Every time I talk to Norton, he makes a great counter-intuitive point. Over the summer, he told me that, even though it seems more labor-intensive, the company had [stepped up individualized trainings](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/iltaon-announcements-run-gamut-from-tool-for-combatting-racial-injustice-to-long-expected-acquisition/) rather than stick with the usual group setting during the pandemic because they were getting better engagement and adoption from more one-on-one remote trainings. Which makes a lot of sense but was certainly not what I expected to hear in a world where technology is applauding its mass collaboration tools. So I was ready for the unexpected take in a world where tech companies are always trumpeting their sexy initial investments from Biglaw heavies.

“If I were advising another startup I’d say start with Am Law 200 firms who will keep working with you on the product to get it better,” Norton said. “You can have closer connections and relationships with chief technical officers and partnership.” It makes a lot of sense. For a big firm to take a chance on a new product it’s naturally going to take some measure of control that tech companies may not be ready to cede. Small firms offer a lot of feedback, but if the users aren’t technically savvy themselves it may not translate into something that can drive the product forward. But mid-market firms may be a Goldilocks zone of tech development with dedicated IT professionals on staff to partner with, but not big enough to think they automatically own the process.

For Simply Agree, the expansion into the big firm world is underway, but relationships with mid-market firms remain invaluable as the transactional side undergoes a philosophical transformation with attorneys moving away from delegation and embracing more direct control of the whole process through tech.

There’s not a single path to innovation in any space, let alone the legal market. Maximizing revenue streams with big ticket commitments may work for some and it may burn others. Padding the coffers with venture capital money may ease the path to success for some while leaving others beholden to short-sighted masters. Monitoring a company’s path can shine a light for another aspiring product, but it can also help clients figure out exactly what kind of product they’re buying.

Joseph Simons

President Donald Trump is reportedly thinking of bypassing the current Republican acting chair of the Federal Trade Commission in favor of Paul, Weiss partner [Joseph Simons](https://www.paulweiss.com/professionals/partners-and-counsel/joseph-j-simons). Simons is the current co-chair of the Antitrust Group at Paul, Weiss and has previous experience at the FTC — he was the chief of the FTC’s competition bureau under President George W. Bush.

Though it should be noted the president has not made his final decision on the position, he is expected to announce his pick in September.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The acting chair, Maureen Ohlhausen, has been a Republican commissioner with the FTC since 2012. [According to Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-09/trump-is-seen-bypassing-acting-ftc-chief-in-favor-of-outsider), she’s been actively campaigning for the permanent position:

After becoming acting chairman, Ohlhausen criticized the Democratic-led agency under the Obama administration, saying it imposed “unnecessary costs” on businesses. She also vowed to lead the FTC with “regulatory humility” and promoted a campaign she called “Economic Liberty” to examine occupational licensing requirements that she said raised barriers for entering certain professions.

There are currently three positions on the five-seat commission open. For the open Republican seat Noah Phillips, chief counsel for Senator John Cornyn, and Christine Wilson, an in-house lawyer at Delta Air Lines Inc., are rumored to be in the running. For the Democrat seat, senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America, Rohit Chopra’s name has been floated.

As with many positions in his administration, President Trump is somewhat behind schedule in filling the opening. The previous two administrations have appointed their FTC chairs in February and March of the years they took office.

# Another Elite Law Firm Kicks Mandatory Arbitration To The Curb
## It isn't surprising this firm is against mandatory arbitration.

It shouldn’t be too surprising that Selendy & Gay has done away with mandatory arbitration agreements for their employees. After all, the Quinn Emanuel spin-off was recently [forced into arbitration](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2019/04/24/judge-dismisses-suit-against-quinn-emanuel-by-partners-of-spinoff-sends-to-arbitration/) with Quinn over client fees, so if there was ever a firm sympathetic to concerns about mandatory arbitration, it is them. Regardless of why it came about the [People’s Parity Project](https://www.peoplesparity.org/coercivecontracts/) — student activists that have kept the heat on Biglaw firms over their use of mandatory arbitration agreements — announced yesterday that Selendy & Gay has done away with the agreements.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/09/19/another-firm-abandons-mandatory-arbitration-as-pressure-continues/) Law.com, Selendy & Gay’s official statement on the matter steered clear of the firm’s history with forced arbitration:

“After looking deeply into the issue, we decided to eliminate mandatory arbitration agreements because it is an important issue to our employees and prospective hires, and we determined that doing so is in the best interests of our firm,” said David Elsberg, Selendy & Gay’s co-managing partner.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The practice of mandatory arbitration agreements in Biglaw first came under fire when Munger Tolles was [called out on social media for the practice](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/biglaw-firm-tries-to-force-summer-associates-to-arbitrate-sexual-harassment-claims/) last year. That firm changed their policy as a result, and other firms [voluntarily did away](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/this-biglaw-firm-is-the-first-to-step-forward-and-do-away-with-mandatory-arbitration-for-all-employees/) with the [practice](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/another-biglaw-firm-kicks-mandatory-arbitration-to-the-curb/). Others [required some good, old-fashioned pressure](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/law-school-students-stand-up-to-biglaw-firm-win/), but eventually eliminated the agreements. But, of course, there have been some firms that have [held fast](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/one-biglaw-firm-refuses-to-do-away-with-forced-arbitration-agreements/), despite complaints.

Carl M. Buchholz

Today is a very sad day for two Biglaw firms. [Carl Buchholz](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/people/b/buchholz-carl/), the managing partner of DLA Piper’s Philadelphia office and former managing partner and CEO of Blank Rome, has died. He was only 51 years old. According to those close to him, Buchholz had been battling an illness for a very long time.

Buchholz, a 1992 graduate of the University of Pennsylvania Law School, clerked for Judge Anita Brody of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for one year’s time before joining Blank Rome. Buchholz remained with the firm for nearly a decade before temporarily leaving private practice to serve as special assistant to the president and executive secretary at the White House Office of Homeland Security in Washington, D.C. He returned to Blank Rome in 2003, where he was elevated to executive partner before becoming the firm’s managing partner and CEO three years later, in 2006.

Buchholz unexpectedly stepped down from his managing partner role at Blank Rome in March 2011, after having recently being re-elected to serve another three-year term in that role. One year later, he joined DLA Piper, where he worked for only two years before he was named as the managing partner of the firm’s Philadelphia office.

Buchholz’s practice focused on commercial litigation, but thanks to his political ties, he amassed a great amount of work in lobbying and government affairs matters. Buchholz was active in Republican politics, and worked as co-chair of Pennsylvania Attorney General Tom Corbett’s transition team, as well as Pennsylvania general counsel for the Bush-Cheney 2004 presidential campaign.

James Brogan, a partner in DLA Piper’s Philadelphia office, shared these words with the [Legal Intelligencer](http://www.thelegalintelligencer.com/id=1202758539128/Carl-M-Buchholz-Head-of-DLA-Piper-in-Phila-Dies-at-51?slreturn=20160425094557) in the wake of Buccholz’s passing:

He had been ill for some time. It’s a great loss. He was active as managing partner of the Philly office until he left us. Since joining us just a few years ago, he led our efforts in Philly and throughout the firm and community. We admired Carl not just as a lawyer, but as a leader, a person, a husband, a father and a friend. He had an incredibly wide range as a lawyer. From the very beginning of his career he excelled in the courtroom, the boardroom and the Oval Office.

In a separate interview, Brogan shared the following with the [Philadelphia Business Journal](http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/morning_roundup/2016/05/carl-buchholz-law-firm-leader-and-former-white.html): “A lot of people will pretend to listen. But he always listened carefully. Then he would plan. Then he would act. And he always followed through on what he said he would do. Even over the course of the last year, he was unflagging in his team play and you could always depend on his word.”

Buchholz is survived by his wife and two children. We at Above the Law would like to extend our condolences to Carl Buchholz’s family, friends, and colleagues.

From salary cuts to furloughs to layoffs, the coronavirus crisis has hit the legal profession particularly hard. Unfortunately, during these unprecedented times, there is far more to worry about than hitting your billable hours. The health and wellness of loved ones — especially aging adults — is now more important than ever considering the toll that COVID-19 has taken on our elder population. Keenly aware of the added stress that caring for someone in this age group can cause, one Biglaw firm has added a new benefit to its already extensive benefits package alleviate some of those worries.

McDermott Will & Emery has partnered with Homethrive to offer all of the law firm’s U.S. employees fully covered family caregiver services. This new benefit will be available immediately. This benefit is being offered as part of the firm’s commitment to the [American Bar Association’s Well-Being Pledge](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/biglaw-firms-pledge-to-help-lawyers-struggling-with-substance-abuse-mental-health-issues/), a program that was first rolled out in 2018 to help lawyers in need. Homethrive will provide care guides who can offer coaching and concierge services to assist with the care of aging loved ones who live at home with MWE law firm employees. From the firm’s [press release](https://www.prweb.com/releases/mcdermott_will_emery_partners_with_homethrive_to_offer_employees_family_elder_care_benefit/prweb17269568.htm):

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“As part of our ABA pledge, we are committed to providing wellness programs with a focus on mental health awareness and support to our lawyers, professional and administrative staff alike, especially during these uncertain times. We are happy to partner with Homethrive as an additional resource to an already robust benefits package that aids caregivers and their families,” said Alyona S. Richey, McDermott’s Benefits Director.

“We are delighted to be partnering with McDermott Will & Emery to help ease the burden of family caregiving that might be affecting their employees,” says Dave Jacobs, Co-founder & Co-CEO at Homethrive. “McDermott Will & Emery recognizes that especially now during the pandemic is a great time to invest in a family caregiving benefit as their employees may be worried about aging loved ones more than ever. The isolation and loneliness experienced by older adults also has the potential to significantly affect their caregivers working at McDermott Will & Emery and we commend the Firm for providing additional support to their employees during these challenging times.”

Kudos to McDermott Will & Emery for offering this important new benefit to its employees. This will really be of assistance to employees who were struggling with the responsibilities of caring for an aging loved one on top of all of their work.

Firms atop the Am Law rankings are falling all over themselves to match, if not top, each other in associate compensation. Law firms run on people, specifically people firms can leverage, and locking down elite talent in a red-hot recruiting market requires bold moves. When firms are sitting on largesse from outstanding 2020 billing, sweetening the salary pot is one way to stay ahead of the game.

But what about the firms with offices outside the NY and DC hotbeds? Does the recruiting bonanza matter as much in locking down associates in St. Louis? Frankly, it’s more interesting to see how major firms operating in smaller markets handle this recent round of raises than the staid Midtown Manhattan firms.

Polsinelli has over 20 offices across the United States and represents one of our earliest looks at how firms will handle these raises outside of the city.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  


Presumably the $200K figure affords the major market associates (NYC, DC, SF, etc.) just a shade off the new $205K scale match. But associates in smaller markets like, say, the aforementioned St. Louis, will be getting less. Polsinelli appears to be betting that there are some markets it plays in that aren’t competing for talent based on salary.

Though as a non-lockstep firm, Polsinelli may not be taking a particularly big gamble. They still have wiggle room to up the stakes to secure a coveted lateral relocation if they want. How the lateral wars play out in these smaller offices will tell us a lot about the state of these markets.

In any event, some positive news for Polsinelli attorneys regardless of location!

# The Biglaw Firms Where Lawyers Did The Most Pro Bono Work (2020)

Law schools across the country just opened up for in-person classes, and many students have their future careers on their minds. This year’s early interviews have already wrapped up and many offers have already been made, but how can law students create meaningful distinction between firms? Perhaps they can take a look at the firms’ pro bono numbers.

Over the course of the last year, members of the legal profession have sprung into action to deal with crisis after crisis after crisis, offering their services without cost to those in need. From health and humanitarian aid during the pandemic to racial justice initiatives to assisting with voting rights and combating election misinformation, lawyers in America were inspired to do their very best to help those who needed their assistance the very most.

But which law firms were able to contribute the most to society?

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The American Lawyer has compiled a ranking of Am Law 200 firms based on their pro bono work in 2020. Half of their scores come from the average number of pro bono hours per lawyer, while the other half represents the percentage of lawyers who performed more than 20 hours of pro bono work.

Here are the [top 10 firms](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/06/28/the-2021-pro-bono-scorecard-national-rankings/) for the [“pro bono on steroids”](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/06/28/with-pro-bono-on-steroids-law-firms-met-immense-need-by-rising-to-the-occasion/) year that was 2020:

- Covington & Burling
- Hughes Hubbard & Reed
- Jenner & Block
- Orrick
- O’Melveny & Myers
- WilmerHale
- Dechert
- Skadden
- Arnold & Porter
- Paul, Weiss
It should be noted that at each firm listed, the average attorney performed 151.6 hours or more of pro bono work last year, and the Am Law 200 as a whole contributed about 5.453 million hours of pro bono work. Congratulations!

# Why Many Cases Settle Right Before Trial
## The pressure felt right before a trial is unlike anything else experienced in litigation.

Many people understand that numerous lawsuits settle right before trial, and often, right before the beginning of jury selection or other preliminary stages of trying a case. I always wondered why parties would wait until the absolute last minute to settle a case when they might have spent months or years litigating a matter at the cost of many thousands of dollars. Earlier in my career, I settled a case right before jury selection while the parties were in court, and the experience gave me some insights.

Pressure

Throughout the course of a case, the parties do not really have much pressure on them to settle. Sure, they will face mounting legal fees as a matter drags on, but clients can pay this over time, and this makes it less likely that fees will have a massive impact on a client’s decisions. Moreover, throughout the course of the case, parties might not need to interact with a judge or even come to court since most depositions and other pretrial matters are conducted outside of court.

At trial, clients are confronted with the probability that they will be hit with a huge bill since trials are exhaustive and require all of counsel’s time. Additionally,  interacting with a judge can be a daunting experience for parties (not to mention, many lawyers), and a trial is the time when reality breaks in and parties understand that they are going to need to testify in front of members of the public and face other indignities of a trial. I once saw a party decide to settle a case immediately before a trial upon seeing the reality of members of the public who could have been jurors starting to pile up outside a courtroom. The pressure felt right before a trial is unlike anything else experienced in litigation.

Everyone Is Together

In many cases, the trial is the first time that all of the parties to a case and their counsel are assembled at one time. A deposition is usually only attended by the party being deposed, and motion hearings usually only involve counsel. Sure, some cases involve mediations or settlement conferences, but even in the aftermath of COVID-19, many of these sessions are being held remotely, which can affect the impact these sessions have.

At trial all of the principals and their counsel are in the same place, at the same time. This makes it easy for the back and forth of settlement demands and offers. Sometimes, it can takes weeks for parties to exchange settlement numbers, and right before trial, this process can take a matter of minutes. When it comes time to memorialize the terms of a basic settlement, the parties can easily put a statement on the record, sign a brief writing, or agree by email to the essential terms. The ease with which parties can settle right before trial makes this an ideal time to resolve matters.

Exhaustion

The process of preparing for trial can also put the parties and their counsel in a good position to settle a case. Parties need to perform time-intensive tasks leading up to a trial, including motions in limine, compiling jury instructions, drafting a jury verdict sheet, preparing witnesses and other tasks. Depending on the tasks, the parties themselves need to be closely involved with these steps since they often need to be prepared for trial, provide feedback about motions, and participate in other ways.

By the time counsel and their clients get to trial, they might be genuinely sick of litigating and are eager to put the matter behind them so that they can move on with their lives. Trials require substantial brain space and time, and sometimes the parties and their counsel view settlement as a more preferable option, even if they are not getting everything they want in a resolution.

In any event, trials are a unique part of litigation, bringing all of the stakeholders to a lawsuit together and putting pressure on parties and counsel in different ways. As a result, matters are usually ripe for settlement right before the parties begin to try a case.

# Biglaw Firm Passes On Representing Kanye West After Rapper Refuses To Back Away From Antisemitic Remarks
## Distancing themselves from antisemitism is probably a smart move.

[It was only a few days ago ](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/amid-fallout-from-antisemitic-rants-george-floyd-conspiracy-theories-and-more-kanye-west-turns-to-familiar-biglaw-face-for-legal-help/)that reports flew around Biglaw that Brown Rudnick was representing rap star Kanye West. And not just any partner was reported to helm the representation, but Camille Vasquez — the partner who crossed over from legal powerhouse to pop culture phenom for her [successful representation of Johnny Depp](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/fan-favorite-lawyer-in-johnny-depp-case-speaks-out-after-verdict/) in his defamation case against Amber Heard.

West certainly needs the legal help since he’s been on a whirlwind tour of problematic behavior. He launched antisemitic attacks on social media that got him booted from Twitter. [He spread](https://www.npr.org/2022/10/19/1129747423/kanye-west-george-floyd-lawsuit) vicious, unfounded rumors that it wasn’t former police officer Derek Chauvin that caused George Floyd’s death but rather fentanyl — and as a result is facing a $250 million lawsuit. He wore a [“White Lives Matter” shirt](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/kanye-wests-white-lives-matter-drama-everything-to-know/) to his Yeezy fashion show. And he’s lost deals with Balenciaga and Adidas as a result.

Now he’s also lost his high-powered lawyer.

TMZ is [now reporting](https://www.tmz.com/2022/10/24/kanye-west-johnny-depp-attorney-camille-vasquez-no-longer-working/) that because Ye is refusing to back away from his hateful words of antisemitism, the firm *is* backing away from the rapper:

Sources with direct knowledge tell us after Kanye doubled and tripled-down on his anti-Semitic remarks over the weekend, Camille informed her firm, Brown Rudnick, she would no longer work with Kanye.

We’re told Brown Rudnick still attempted to work with Kanye, but only under the condition he publicly retract his hateful and anti-Semitic words. Our sources say Kanye refused to do so, and fired Brown Rudnick.

Whatever the reason, it feels like a smart move for the firm. No Biglaw firm wants to deal with doubts about its stance on antisemitism from clients and associate candidates.

# Ranking The Top M&A Biglaw Dealmakers In America (2023)
## How many lawyers from your firm were able to clinch a spot in the prestigious M&A dealmaker ranking?

When it comes to dealmaking in the M&A world, Biglaw firms often rely upon their top partners to make it rain. Some of these partners are simply superstars — they don’t stop at making it rain, they make it pour. So, which lawyers are leading the way for their firms? Thanks to the recently released Mergerlinks ranking, we now have that information.

Mergerlinks is a London-based company that provides financial data as well as deal attorney profiles, including some of their metrics. The company created the rankings based on total value of the deals led by lawyers in North America as well as lawyers internationally.

Without further ado, these are the top M&A lawyers in North America:

- Scott Barshay / Paul Weiss / ~$121.6 billion deal value
- Melissa Sawyer / Sullivan & Cromwell / ~$79.5 billion deal value
- Louis L. Goldberg / Davis Polk / ~$70 billion deal value
- Jeffrey Chapman / Gibson Dunn / ~$65.9 billion deal value
- Matthew G. Hurd / Sullivan & Cromwell / ~$60.6 billion deal value
- Edward D. Herlihy / Wachtell / ~$50.2 billion deal value
- Alan Klein / Simpson Thacher / ~$43.8 billion deal value
- Daniel E. Wolf / Kirkland / ~$37.8 billion deal value
- Adam Emmerich / Wachtell / ~$37.6 billion deal value
- Andrew Brownstein / Wachtell / ~$33.5 billion deal value
As noted by the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/02/15/which-ma-attorneys-drove-the-most-business-as-deal-leads/), due to a lack of gender diversity within the top North America dealmakers ranking, Mergerlinks also created a ranking for the top female M&A dealmakers in North America, based on not just the women leading the deal, but also the women serving as second chair or doing the most work on the deal. These are the top female M&A lawyers in North America:

- Karessa Cain / Wachtell / ~$84.9 billion deal value
- Melissa Sawyer / Sullivan & Cromwell / ~$79.5 billion deal value
- Shanu Bajaj / Davis Polk / ~$75.7 billion deal value
- Sarah Solum / Freshfields / ~$51.1 billion deal value
- Elizabeth Cooper / Simpson Thacher / ~$18.4 billion deal value
- Ingrid Rechtin / Covington / ~$17.9 billion deal value
- Audra D. Cohen / Sullivan & Cromwell / ~$16.3 billion deal value
- Deborah Birnbach / Goodwin / ~$15.8 billion deal value
- Laura Knoll / Skadden / ~$15.8 billion deal value
- Taurie M. Zeitzer / Paul Weiss / ~$14.5 billion deal value
Congrats to everyone who made the cut for the Mergerlinks ranking!

# Biglaw Firm Demonstrates Its Commitment To Paying The Top Of The Market
## A second round of raises at the firm.

The danger (well, let’s be honest, danger is a wild over statement, particularly as a war rages in Europe) of quickly announcing raises when the market moves is that you may have to issue a second round of raises if another competitor comes over the top.

That’s what happened to Fried Frank. The firm was[ quick to match](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-firm-ensures-fun-friday-for-associates-with-early-morning-money-match-memo/) the Milbank raises last month. But then Davis Polk came over the top, well, at least for midlevel and senior associates. And they are matching yet again.

The new salary scale at Fried Frank is as follows:



The re-raises will also be retroactive to January 1. Read the full memo [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/fried-frank-re-raise-22/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Debevoise Gets In On The COVID Appreciation Bonus Excitement
## But, what'd they decide?

It looks like [Kirkland](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/kirklands-not-giving-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-salty-about-it/)‘s not-so-subtle ploy to try and and convince Biglaw to back away from the special bonuses sweeping the industry isn’t really working. Way back (read: last week) when Cooley started the [COVID appreciation bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cooley-bonuses/) game, it wasn’t clear that the rest of Biglaw would follow.

But then [Davis Polk ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/)got involved with a new standard, one that dwarfed the Cooley scale. The gauntlet was thrown and firms like [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/milbank-bonuses/), [Irell](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/irell-bonuses/), and [Hueston Hennigan](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/another-elite-firm-affirms-their-commitment-to-the-top-of-the-bonus-scale/) got on board. Now with [even more firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/sullivan-cromwell-makes-a-move-in-covid-19-bonus-war/) announcing bonuses of their own, it’s clear that truly elite firms will bow to this peer pressure. And last night, Debevoise & Plimpton decided to announce their own set of COVID appreciation bonuses.

So, what did the firm decide? They’ll be matching the top scale set by David Polk last week. If you haven’t already memorized that grid, no worries. It spans between $7,500 and $40,000, depending on year, as follows:

Plus, the firm indicated this money won’t change their year-end bonus pool, which they expect to be at least as generous at their 2019 largesse.

Chevazz Brown, DiversePro Founder

“What good is first class if my brothers can’t sit? / That’s my next mission, that’s why I can’t quit / Just like LeBron, get my brothers more chips.” — [J. Cole](https://www.complex.com/music/2019/02/the-story-behind-j-cole-middle-child-video-explained-by-director-mez)

This week, I had the opportunity to host a Clubhouse room with Chevazz Brown, TSU Thurgood Marshall School of Law alum, Jackson Walker partner, and DiversePro founder.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
It’s been fantastic witnessing the number of attorneys joining Clubhouse every week. Meanwhile, some of us Texas attorneys are still [struggling with Zoom](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/i-m-not-cat-video-shows-lawyer-can-t-turn-n1257168). In any case, I’m prepared to move forward.

Several years ago, Brown noticed there was a dynamic market for connecting people in underrepresented, diverse, and military communities to lawyers from their respective communities who can understand and relate to them.

[Three weeks ago](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chevazz-brown_diversepro-the-lawyer-for-you-activity-6758074851333865472-WE3t/), Brown launched [DiversePro](http://www.diversepro.com/): a new, online community-focused directory that helps individual and business clients find lawyers with specific cultural, linguistic, and experiential competencies. DiversePro features 100,000+ lawyers around the U.S. in 67 practice areas and 270 specialties, including, specifically: women lawyers, lawyers of color, LGBTQ+ lawyers, lawyers with disabilities, and lawyers who are military veterans and active duty. With this community tool, clients can choose from a wide selection of lawyers with diverse cultures, languages, and life experiences whose unique perspectives and skills can enhance legal services and improve outcomes.

During our Clubhouse chat, it became quite evident how much Brown cares about this market and how much time, capital, and sweat equity he has invested in this platform. I believe Brown has discovered a strong [product-market fit](https://a16z.com/2017/02/18/12-things-about-product-market-fit/) for his community-focused directory. And I hope after learning a bit more about DiversePro, you will create or claim your profile!

Without further ado, here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation:

Renwei Chung (RC): I enjoyed our Clubhouse chat and noticed that most the room was filled by your network. Why did you join Clubhouse and what are your thoughts on how networking affects one’s career success?

Chevazz Brown (CB): A colleague learned of DiversePro and recommended Clubhouse as a way for me to share it with others. She invited me to join. Glad I did! It’s a great platform to learn from people outside your usual circles.

As for networking, if done right, it can positively affect one’s career. For me, my approach simply has been to make friends genuinely and without agenda. I’m enriched by those friendships, and those relationships have helped make my professional life meaningful.

RC: You mentioned a number of affinity groups during our conversation. Are there any particular programs that influenced you?

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
CB: I’m influenced by all of the great programming presented by those groups. But I’m most influenced by the leadership of those groups. In Houston, we formed the Coalition of Houston Diverse Bar Associations, consisting of:

- Asian American Bar Association of Houston
- Hispanic Bar Association of Houston
- Houston Lawyers Association
- Korean American Bar Association of Texas
- Mexican American Bar Association of Houston
- Middle Eastern Bar Association of Texas
- South Asian Bar Association of Houston
The Coalition amplifies our collective voice and the great work each group is doing individually to advance their community and diversity.

One significant initiative is to help bring greater diversity to our judiciary, particularly at the federal level in Houston — the most diverse metropolitan region in America. Our judiciary is most effective in satisfying the legal needs of the community when it reflects the community it serves.

RC: Why did you launch [DiversePro](https://diversepro.com/)?

CB: I saw a problem: Consumers in underrepresented and diverse communities lack dedicated tools and resources to efficiently find cultural, linguistic, and experiential competence that they want and need in lawyers.

So I created a community tool: an online lawyer directory that helps those communities, along with the military and business communities, find lawyers who truly get them or their customers because of a shared or specific culture, language, or life experience. Featured are women lawyers, lawyers of color, LGBTQ+ lawyers, lawyers with disabilities, and lawyers who are veterans or active duty military.

RC: What type of research did you do, what surprised you, and what does success look like for DiversePro this year?

CB: I first researched how to start a business and what pitfalls to avoid. I then did research to validate the idea, consisting of market and platform validation. Very interesting. I learned:

- Technology has changed legal consumer behavior
- Legal consumers today are unpredictable, informed, connected, and picky
- They prefer self-help and research before contacting a lawyer
- 42% go online to research how to solve the legal issues themselves
- Of those who go online for self-help, over half also are researching lawyers online
- Overall, 31% of legal consumers research lawyers online
- There is significant room and demand for a platform like DiversePro
- Legal consumers view cultural, linguistic, and experiential competence as an enhancer
DiversePro’s first year will be a success if people are using the platform. In my analytic logs, I hope to see users conducting searches (e.g., immigration and Korean), using the “Message” or “Phone” feature (to contact lawyers), and using the “Share” feature (to share a lawyer’s profile with someone).

I also hope to see featured lawyers across the U.S. coming to DiversePro in droves to CLAIM OR CREATE their profile and sharing with the world what makes them and their community special.

I also hope to secure strategic partnerships with legal departments, like Coca-Cola, who may benefit from DiversePro as one of the many ways it finds diverse outside counsel talent in furtherance of its awesome diversity goals.

I want the success or failure of DiversePro to be tied directly to the success or failure of the communities it was designed to help. If I can do that, DiversePro will be a smashing success.

RC: What have you learned about yourself throughout the entrepreneur journey and during this COVID-19 era?

CB: I learned (or was reminded) of a couple things. First, I’m fortunate. I’m fortunate to be healthy and gainfully employed. So many folks are hurting right now. My heart goes out to them.

Second, I’ve got what it takes to be a successful entrepreneur –- the grit, the creativity, the problem-solving skills, the passion, and the support of friends and family.

RC: What made you want to initially enter the legal profession?

CB: Initially, tbh, Bobby Donnell -– the main character on the hit TV show The Practice. Loved him. His life as a trial lawyer piqued my interest. But, of course, I then did my research and got encouragement from a friend’s dad who was a lawyer in the Army JAG Corp. I sensed that the legal profession could open so many doors. I was sold. And I was right.

RC: What advice do you have for others who want to become partners at their respective law firms?

CB: Believe you can. Produce high-quality work product and exercise good judgment and work ethic. Do what is right. Be responsive and sensitive to the demands of your internal and external clients. Be proactive and creative in adding value to your firm. Network, i.e., make friends. Pursue leadership. And be nice.

RC: We covered Coca-Cola’s GC [Bradley Grayton’s letter](https://aboutblaw.com/Vif) establishing [new outside counsel ](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/coke-gc-tired-of-good-intentions-wants-law-firm-diversity-now)[guidelines](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/coke-gc-tired-of-good-intentions-wants-law-firm-diversity-now) for its U.S.-based firms. What are your thoughts on this?

CB: Love it. Kudos to Mr. Grayton and Coca-Cola for demonstrating leadership, resolve, and character. I hope it inspires other legal consumers to take similar steps to help move the needle.

There is an economic solution to lack of diversity and lack of professional equality in our profession. What Coca-Cola, DiversePro, and others are doing advances the economic solution.

RC: We touched a bit about the importance of mental health care in the legal industry. Can you share your thoughts about this with our audience?

CB: It’s difficult sometimes to accept that mental health applies to you. It applies to everyone. Our profession is hard. And it can take a toll. Be mindful of the need for balance, meaningful breaks, and professional help or help generally. I regret not being mindful of those things earlier in my career.

Take care of yourselves.

RC: Thank you for your time today, is there anything else you would like to share with the ATL audience?

CB: Thanks for reading. Please share DiversePro with your family, friends, and networks. And if you are a woman lawyer, lawyer of color, LGBTQ+ lawyer, lawyer with a disability, or lawyer who is a veteran or active duty military — please CLAIM OR CREATE your profile on DiversePro today.

# Some Thoughts On What Might Happen If The Bill Cosby Case Is Retried
## Will the prosecution be able to do any better the next time around?

The Bill Cosby case ended, predictably, in a mistrial.  The only real question remaining is whether the prosecution will be able to do any better the next time around, if indeed there is one.

With testimony about the event from only one witness, Andrea Constand, and no forensic corroboration, that’s already a tough case for the prosecution.  Also weighing on their chances is the fact that at trial Ms. Constand contradicted the version she gave during earlier police reports, that she repeatedly telephoned Mr. Cosby after the alleged crime, and that she even went to see him perform with her parents.  All of this casts doubt on whether her word alone will ever be enough to convince any jury beyond a reasonable doubt.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
But things could change in the next trial. For example, prosecutors might persuade Judge O’Neil to permit more than just Kelly Johnson, the woman who made similar complaints against Cosby, to testify.  If the prosecutor can put on a greater number of similarly situated women, the game shifts.

Problem is — the law protects, to some extent, people who have been accused of similar acts (and even found guilty of them), and for a good reason.  A person should not be convicted on a theory that he has a “propensity” to commit a crime. That would be unfair.  Let’s say at 22 you’re charged with auto-theft (joy riding).  Later, at age 35, you’re in a bad divorce and your wife accuses you of stealing her car.  If a jury knew you’d done it before, the chances of them presuming you innocent are greatly diminished.

Bill Cosby, remember, had never been guilty of any sex assaults in the past.  True, there have been plenty of allegations, but either because of lack of evidence or the amount of time passed since the alleged events, no charges had ever been brought against him until this case.

How does a judge make a decision about how many floating allegations against a defendant should come in?  They do a balancing test.  What’s fair for a jury to know is weighed against what is too prejudicial to be probative.  One prior allegation is certainly fair.  Two, maybe.  Ten or more would seem to flip the scale.  The jury might start off disregarding the presumption of innocence and instead assuming — this is the kind of guy who does this.

If the case is retried, it’s possible it might go better for Cosby.  His lawyers now have a full idea of how the prosecution witnesses present at trial.  They might pick a different make-up of the jury (once they finally speak to the jurors in the first case.) And the defense witness excluded by the judge — the woman who worked with Ms. Constand and claimed she was told by her that the claim was made up — might be able to testify.

Important to know is the how the jurors split. Was it 1 to 11 for conviction, or 6 to 6, or 1 to 11 for acquittal?  While it’s never certain the next jury will react in the same manner, knowing the split will inform both the prosecution and defense how better to play their cards next time.

If the split was 1 to 11 for acquittal (11 people voting to acquit), maybe the prosecution will decide not to retry it — not to put Ms. Constand through what was certainly an emotionally grueling process again. It could be enough to know there’s quite a few civil lawsuits out there likely to snag Mr. Cosby more easily than the criminal case. The standard of proof is lower.  Remember what happened to O.J.?

[](http://atlbookofbusiness.libsyn.com/mario-leissner-from-king-spalding-episode-6)Welcome (back) to [Book of Business](http://atlbookofbusiness.libsyn.com/), the Biglaw-focused podcast that I host with veteran legal recruiter Robert Kinney, Founder and President of [Kinney Recruiting](http://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/). We realize that some time has passed since our [last episode](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/book-of-business-new-offices-new-frontiers/), but it’s for good reason: the legal recruiting business is booming right now, and my globe-trotting co-host hasn’t been easy to schedule over the past few weeks.

To make up for the hiatus, we recently recorded two episodes. We’re releasing one now, and we’ll release the second next week.

In this week’s episode, reflecting Robert’s international travels, we’re joined by a great guest from overseas: [Mario Leissner](https://www.kslaw.com/people/Mario-Leissner), founder and Managing Partner of the Frankfurt office of King & Spalding. Mario shares some of the insights that have helped him develop an eight-figure book of business, as well as his thoughts on how the changing political environment in Germany might affect the European economy and legal market.

If you’re a partner at a leading law firm who might be interested in joining us on Book of Business, please feel free to email me and Robert Kinney, subject line “Book of Business.” I can be reached at [dlat@abovethelaw.com](mailto:dlat@abovethelaw.com?subject=Book%20of%20Business), and Robert Kinney can be reached at [robert@kinneyrecruiting.com](mailto:robert@kinneyrecruiting.com?subject=Book%20of%20Business).

# Attorneys Should Avoid Dead-End Practice Areas

It’s not you. It’s me.

In the olden days, it was not uncommon for lawyers to work at one or a few law firms for the entirety of their careers. It was much more common for lawyers to make partner at their firms and build a practice at one law firm over several decades of legal practice. In recent years, it is much more common for lawyers to move from job to job over the course of their careers. This is because it is less common to be offered partnership, and lawyers may need to jump ship because of the finances of a firm or a variety of other reasons. In order to make themselves as marketable as possible, lawyers need to be deliberate with career choices and not spend too much time in dead-end practice areas. By being more cognizant of career choices, lawyers can ensure that they are most marketable when looking for future employment opportunities.

Throughout legal history, there have been practice areas for which numerous lawyers focused and which are not really practiced a ton right now. For instance, railroad law used to be an important practice area for over a century, and numerous lawyers specialized in this area of the law. Nowadays, not too many people practice railroad law (although I know a few who do actually specialize in such matters), and when this work dried up, many lawyers were likely left in the cold with little tasks to do.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
There are certain practice areas that essentially have a built-in shelf life, and lawyers in such fields routinely face employment issues. For instance, large mass torts matters can go on for years, even decades. Over the course of such mass torts matters, such cases can develop their own processes and procedures as the courts implement case management orders and other specialized rules in order to cater to these specific types of cases. Moreover, discovery demands, interrogatories, and depositions in such mass torts matters can all be specialized and extremely different from how such processes are handled in other cases.

Staying too long in such mass torts cases or any other similar practice areas can pose a number of problems. Perhaps primarily, there will come a time when these types of cases will run out or at least decrease dramatically. This can impact a lawyer’s job security as firms without work to handle in a given practice area may need to terminate attorneys and staff who work in that practice area.

Working in a dead-end practice area can also impact your marketability when you look for the exits and try to find work either before or after the music runs out and work dries up in the practice area. Hiring managers may think that experience with the specialized cases of a given mass torts matter or other specialized practice area are not transferable to other types of cases. The years of experience that an attorney has handled such matters may not be deemed an asset by hiring managers who are looking for attorneys who can handle more traditional types of cases that do not have specialized procedures. Of course, law firms looking to hire attorneys for other mass torts cases may like an attorney who previously worked in other mass torts matters before, but to keep yourself marketable, it is best to be open to other types of jobs.

There are a few things that attorneys should keep in mind when determining if they are in a dead-end practice area in which they should not stay long. For one, if the evolution of technology would make a practice area extinct (and this includes if artificial intelligence or other innovations can replace an attorney’s work) then it might be a good idea to look for the exits as soon as possible. Moreover, if it looks like a settlement will occur in the not-to-distant future, and the music may soon end in a mass torts matter, attorneys may be well-advised to begin looking for other work to avoid the possibility of being laid off once a mass torts or other matter concludes.

In addition, if an attorney sees that they may have a hard time explaining how their current work is an asset in their desired future job, that attorney should look for the exits. It can be easy in a legal career to just look at short-term goals, and attorneys may only care about a job’s salary and other benefits before deciding whether they wish to take one job or the other. However, attorneys need to look at the long game and see how a job can position them well for the decades they intend to practice law.

Of course, it usually does not hurt to stay a year or two in a job just to get your bearings, and in certain job markets, attorneys just need to take any job which they are offered. However, lawyers should try to avoid dead-end practice areas at all costs so that they can remain marketable throughout the course of their careers.

# Biglaw Partner Predicts Donald Trump Will Make History

If all goes according to schedule, we are one short week before the start of the first Donald Trump criminal trial — the New York hush money trial. Of course, the former president would very much like that plan to fall apart. Toward that end, the Trump legal team is [asking](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-hush-money-trial-judge_n_66109db8e4b0c063ffb9348b) — again — for Judge Juan M. Merchan to recuse himself. But don’t get too excited about that strategy. Hogan Lovells partner, and former acting Solicitor General, Neal Katyal calls the ploy “nonsense.”

Appearing on Jen Psaki’s MSNBC show, Katyal said, “His legal strategy is first lie, then deny, then delay. And we’re on the delay phase of this. It’s his last-ditch effort.” And he went on to predict Trump will be convicted in the case — a first in American history. “I strongly suspect Donald Trump will be convicted at the end of that trial,” he said. “That will be the first former president to be convicted criminally.”

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“Legally, none of this is going anywhere. That’s the beauty of the American criminal justice system: It’s 12 jurors, it’s rules of evidence and the like, and these kinds of nonsense arguments will go nowhere,” he said. “That’s why I suspect he’ll be convicted.”

Katyal took a similar position on the documents case pending in Florida. Despite a friendly judge overseeing the case in Aileen Cannon, Katyal said, “If it does go to trial, he’s gonna be convicted almost certainly there as well.”

# A Lateral-Partner Mess Down In Texas
## Has this game of musical chairs left one partner without a seat at the table?

Here is a pretty crazy sequence of events that just went down in the Houston legal market.

Earlier this month, corporate partners [Douglas McWilliams](http://www.velaw.com/Who-We-Are/Find-a-Lawyer/McWilliams--Douglas/) and [Jeff Malonson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-malonson-a655525) announced they’d be [leaving Vinson & Elkins for Simpson Thacher & Bartlett](http://fuelfix.com/blog/2016/02/14/three-ve-partners-with-energy-experience-leave-for-other-firms/). Over the years, V&E has seen a few partners leave for national and international firms invading Texas — e.g., Adam Larson to Kirkland & Ellis.

After returning from a ski trip in Utah and seeing his office being packed up, McWilliams got cold feet and asked to stay at V&E, where he has been for more than twenty years. As he told [FuelFix](http://fuelfix.com/blog/2016/02/18/energy-lawyer-decides-to-stay-at-ve/), “Simpson Thacher is a great law firm that offered a national brand and a national practice that was extremely enticing. But I had not gotten a single good night’s sleep since I decided to leave. I underestimated the personal relationships I have here at V&E.”

Vinson & Elkins was [happy to oblige](http://fuelfix.com/blog/2016/02/18/energy-lawyer-decides-to-stay-at-ve/). “He asked if he could stay,” V&E chair [Mark Kelly](http://www.velaw.com/lawyers/markkelly.aspx) said. “Of course. Doug is a fine lawyer.” (This type of abrupt turnaround by a lateral partner is unusual but not unheard of, as [noted by Am Law](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202750489305/A-Vinson-Partners-Quick-Turnaround-Plus-More-Lateral-Moves?kw=A%20Vinson%20Partner%27s%20Quick%20Turnaround%2C%20Plus%20More%20Lateral%20Moves&cn=20160224&pt=Am%20Law%20Daily&src=EMC-Email&et=editorial&bu=The%20American%20Lawyer&&slreturn=20160124155241).)

So where does this all leave Jeff Malonson? This is where things get… messy.

One source tells us that Malonson asked for his job back but, well, wasn’t offered quite the same warm “welcome back” as McWilliams. So then he told Simpson he was coming by himself, but STB said it was interested only in a package deal — in essence, “We want both of you or neither.” This basically left Malonson in the lurch — a beached whale, an orphaned child, pick your metaphor — and he wasn’t happy about it (and wasn’t shy about sharing that with McWilliams, or so we hear).

We reached out to McWilliams and to Malonson yesterday. Neither got back to us, but sometime between last night and this morning, Malonson changed his [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-malonson-a655525) to remove Simpson Thacher as his employer. (We’ve posted the pre-revision version, which lists STB as his employer, on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/a-lateral-partner-mess-down-in-texas/2/).)

We reached out to Vinson & Elkins and Simpson Thacher as well. STB didn’t respond. V&E issued a short statement denying that Malonson asked for his job back:

Jeff Malonson did not request to be readmitted to the V&E partnership. Mr. Malonson’s resignation from the V&E partnership was made effective as of February 12. He advised us that he was being admitted to the STB partnership on that same date.

That hasn’t happened yet, at least judging from the [Simpson website](http://www.stblaw.com). But one can’t rule out Malonson going to Simpson just yet; FuelFix [previously reported](http://fuelfix.com/blog/2016/02/14/three-ve-partners-with-energy-experience-leave-for-other-firms/) that he’d be joining in March (although query why neither Malonson nor Simpson responded to our inquiry to confirm his joining the firm).

It’s also possible that Malonson might find a new professional home at a third firm. While he wasn’t as well-loved at Vinson & Elkins as Doug McWilliams, Malonson does have his own book of business, with clients like New Source Energy Partners and QR Energy.

Ah yes, energy — a troubled industry, with oil [still in the low $30 range](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/23/oil-prices-fall-as-opec-producers-squabble-over-output-targets.html). This is the backdrop against which the V&E lateral partner drama is playing out. According to one source at the firm, both Malonson and Adam Larson (who moved to Kirkland) were “talented and well-liked partners who represent substantial business.” Furthermore, morale is low among some associates because “capital markets work in the energy industry, V&E’s bread and butter, has ground to a halt, and bonuses were stealthily stingy.” (As you may recall, V&E bonuses this cycle were the [subject of intense disagreement](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/associate-bonus-watch-above-market-bonuses-for-big-billers-in-texas/).)

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As a result of these issues, some V&E associates are looking around for new opportunities (with varying degrees of voluntariness to their searches). But it’s not the easiest time to be a lateral associate in the Texas market, says one source:

V&E’s capital-markets associates are stuck in a tight spot in the market where there is near-zero activity in energy IPOs and high-yield issuances, and the only firms hiring are out-of-town, PE-focused practices — K&E, STB, Sidley, Willkie. Mid-level and senior associates without private equity or general M&A experience are not competitive lateral candidates, regardless of pedigree.

UPDATE (6:15 p.m.): A different source pushes back on this, reporting that cap markets associates at V&E continue to get expressions of interest from out-of-town firms like K&E (sometimes with generous signing bonuses attached).

Meanwhile, Vinson & Elkins partners will probably earn less this year than last. The key financial metric at V&E is “dividends paid,” which combined with an individual partner’s “sharing ratio” determines how much that partner earns. In 2014, V&E enjoyed its best year ever, with a dividend number around $740,000 740. In 2015, the firm had its second-best year, with the dividend number around $712,000 712. In 2016, the firm is forecasting around $690,000 690, but it’s possible it won’t meet that number if the energy market continues to languish.

UPDATE (11:30 p.m.): The preceding paragraph reflects the following correction: “dividends paid” is just a number, not a dollar figure. The formula for translating “dividends paid” into dollars is: Dividends Paid x $1,200 x Sharing Ratio = Compensation. So this means V&E partners earn a bit more than previously reported (because, for example, 740 dividends paid works out to $888,000, not $740,000).

(McWilliams, by the way, has a “sharing ratio” somewhere above 3.5, placing him near the top of the V&E scale (meaning he enjoys annual comp in excess of $2 million). One tipster passed along a rumor that V&E offered him more money than Simpson to stay — but V&E denied that it made any counteroffer, and a second source with knowledge of the Houston legal market said V&E couldn’t (or wouldn’t) have given McWilliams a richer offer than STB.)

So what kind of shape is V&E in? Let’s not overstate the problems. Yes, some individual V&E associates might be facing tricky situations, and yes, partners would be doing better if the firm weren’t quite so focused on energy. But overall the firm still boasts solid financials, no debt, and a healthy receivables holdback. In addition to Doug McWilliams, certain partners — including [Keith Fullenweider](http://www.velaw.com/lawyers/KeithFullenweider.aspx), [Steve Gill](http://www.velaw.com/lawyers/stephengill.aspx), [Kai Liekefett](http://www.velaw.com/lawyers/KaiLiekefett.aspx), and [Matt Strock](http://www.velaw.com/lawyers/MatthewStrock.aspx) — continue to have strong and busy practices.

The real issue for V&E going forward is how it can convert itself from a Texas market leader into a national or even international firm, along the lines of a Kirkland or a Latham & Watkins.

Will Vinson & Elkins succeed in that transformation? How well can V&E weather the current storm? And where in the world will Jeff Malonson wind up?

If you can help us answer these questions, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Vinson%20and%20Elkins) or text us (646-820-8477).

UPDATE (7/21/2016): All’s well that ends well; Jeff Malonson [is now at King & Spalding](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202763323523/Lateral-Misfire-Leads-to-King-amp-Spalding-for-Vinson-Partner?slreturn=20170103131039).

# Biglaw Phishing Scam Results In Identity Theft
## The mistake was caught by the firm when employees started reporting they were victims of fraud.

We’ve [said it before](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/7-cybersecurity-tips-for-lawyers/), and we’ll say it again — law firms have to be on top of their cybersecurity. That includes making sure client data is secure (obviously), protecting the firm network from hackers, and educating their employees about best practices. It seems there’s been a breakdown in that last area at one Biglaw firm.

Fresh off of news the firm had been one of almost 50 [targeted by Russian hackers](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/beware-of-big-hacking-in-biglaw/?rf=1), we’ve learned that Proskauer Rose has fallen victim to a phishing scam that has left the personal information of its employees in the hands of criminals.

According to our tipster, firm employees were notified last week that a fraudulent email to the payroll department, purporting to be from a firm executive, resulted in firm W-2s being sent to phishers. The leaked information included the full names and social security numbers for the employees. The mistake was caught by the firm when employees started reporting they were victims of fraud.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
[S]ome employees had reported that tax returns had been filed in their names by unauthorized individuals in acts of identity theft. [A firm] email requested that anyone else affected report their problem, which resulted in a number of other employees advising that they too had experienced similar tax return fraud.

Yikes. As if tax season wasn’t stressful enough, you might also find out you are the victim of identity theft! Fun times.

Though it is unclear what, if any, proactive steps are being taken by Proskauer to make sure a similar issue doesn’t happen again, they are being responsive to the issue and assisting affected employees and working with law enforcement. The firm responded to our inquiry about the incident with the following statement:

On March 31, we learned that 2015 W-2 tax form information for certain employees was disclosed to an unauthorized third party in response to an email that fraudulently purported to be a legitimate request from one of our senior executives. The information was not obtained through any breach of our information technology systems or information technology security, and the incident bears no relation to recent reports of cyberattacks on law firms. No client or other firm data were affected in any way by this isolated incident.

We have notified law enforcement authorities, and are working with outside advisors and our internal staff to mitigate any potential harm or inconvenience that may be caused to our employees. Among other support, we are assisting all potentially affected employees with appropriate government filings. We also are offering two years of free identity recovery services to all U.S. employees, whether or not they currently appear to be affected.

We are committed to assisting our employees and taking steps to ensure that an incident like this does not happen again.

# Annoying Lawyers Sometimes Get More For Their Clients

Most of us already know from our legal training that lawyers have an ethical obligation to diligently advocate for their clients. However, many attorneys act with reasonable constraints about the tactics they use to advocate for their clients in order to preserve their reputations and possibly because long-term relationships with adversaries can assist clients over time. Nevertheless, lawyers sometimes employ annoying tactics either because of their personalities or because they are simply doing their jobs trying to advocate for their clients. Even though such tactics can make attorneys difficult for adversaries to deal with, they can often lead to better results for clients, at least in the short term.

After I left Biglaw and began practicing as a “street lawyer” who actually went to court and took depositions, I realized how important relationships with adversaries were to a representation. Adversaries usually have a say about a number of courtesies, such as extensions, accepting service over email, and other matters. Moreover, having a good relationship with adversaries can help lawyers resolve matters and obtain favorable settlements for clients. As a result, it may make sense not to be needlessly annoying to adversaries so that all of these benefits of long-term connections can be realized. However, I have seen time and time again in my career how annoying lawyers can sometimes obtain short-term advantages for clients.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
For instance, one time, I heard about a deposition in a mass torts case where one of the attorneys who was representing a defendant at the deposition was well known for being somewhat annoying in his tactics and for staying at the periphery of the social circle of lawyers who practice in this area of the law. I can attest to these facts since I practiced in this mass torts circuit and had firsthand experience with this lawyer.

At the deposition, the lawyer objected to pretty much every question the plaintiff’s attorney asked her client (in this mass torts case, it was common for plaintiff’s lawyers to ask questions of their clients at depositions, I know this is somewhat uncommon in other contexts). In any event, the objections were mostly pointless since the jurisdiction in which we practice preserves all objections for trial except for objections as to form, and this lawyer was objecting for all types of reasons. The plaintiff’s lawyer got so frustrated with this attorney that she agreed to stipulate this lawyer’s client out of the case then and there to avoid the meaningless objections being made by that attorney. Now granted, I was not at this deposition myself, but it was totally the type of thing that could happen in those cases, and being annoying helped that lawyer get a significant advantage for his client.

At another time in my career, I represented a corporate client that had a representative who was going through some health issues. It was pretty clear that the potential deponent was too sick to provide reliable information, and that a deposition would be harmful to her health. Even though we got proof that this was the case, my adversary insisted that this deponent be produced for a deposition. We offered to proceed by written questions, provide any other discovery my adversary wished, and other compromises, but the adversary would not budge. To my adversary’s credit, he stated that as a human, he agreed with me that this person probably should not be produced for a deposition, but as a lawyer, he needed to be annoying to get every advantage he could for his client. Especially since he made it clear that this annoying tactic was part of diligent representation, I did not hold it too much against my adversary that he was taking the position he was.

In any event, this annoying tactic created an immense amount of stress and uncertainty with my client. My client definitely considered settling the case instead of possibly needing to produce a witness for a deposition that could be harmful to this person’s health. I of course do not condone sticking to litigation tactics that could cause a bona fide health issue, and if I was in my adversary’s shoes, I might not have insisted as much that a witness be deposed even though a deposition could cause health issues. However, employing this annoying tactic did have some short-term benefits for the adversary’s clients, even though it may have frayed relationships over the long term.

I am sure that every lawyer has a story of somewhat-annoying adversaries employing annoying tactics and getting unpredictable results, and if you have stories of your own, please reach out to me, I’d love to hear them. Again, employing annoying tactics can harm long-term relationships between adversaries and may not be good practice in many contexts. But somewhat unfortunately, attorneys can obtain short-term benefits for clients by employing annoying tactics that some attorneys may not feel comfortable using.

# Another Biglaw Firm Is Showing Associates Their Cravath Cash
## Money, money, money!

One by one, Biglaw firms are rushing in to match Cravath’s new salary scale, and the latest firm to do so is Boies Schiller Flexner. If your firm hasn’t matched yet, now seems to be the time.

In an email to associates, BSF’s management confirmed their commitment to staying on top of market compensation. That means associates will be making between $215,000 and $415,000, depending on class year, as base pay for associates in good standing. Here’s Boies Schiller’s new scale:

Class	Salary Effective January 1, 2022
2021	$215,000
2020	$225,000
2019	$250,000
2018	$295,000
2017	$345,000
2016	$370,000
2015	$400,000
2014+	$415,000
Those associates who have remained on the firm’s formula compensation system — which is directly proportional to a lawyer’s work and originations, and often results in higher-than-market compensation — will see an adjustment in their salaries compared to the new salary scale as well. New associates may elect formula compensation, as opposed to market compensation, if they so choose.

This new salary scale is effective as of January 1, 2022, and associates will see the cash in their upcoming paychecks. Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Boies Schiller.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Milbank) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Milbank”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Top Biglaw Firm Ups The Ante To Match Cravath Salary Scale For Associates
## Exciting news for associates at this firm.

Money, money, money — and even more money: that’s what Biglaw firms are handing out to associates thanks to the Cravath salary scale that’s quickly being matched by the masses. The latest firm to adopt the Cravath scale is one that matched the Davis Polk scale less than one week ago.

The firm we’re speaking about is Debevoise, a firm that’s ranked at No. 31 in the most recent Am Law 100, with $1,224,942,000 gross revenue in 2020. On [February 23](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/crush-those-wednesday-worries-with-a-cash-stack/), the firm was paying salaries of up to $406,500, and today, on March 1, the firm is paying salaries that are much, much higher.

This is what the Cravath scale will look like at Debevoise:

2021: $215,000
2020: $225,000
2019: $250,000
2018: $295,000
2017: $345,000

# Money Matters: These Top 50 Biglaw Firms Haven’t Announced Bonuses Yet
## On behalf of your associates: Come on, hurry up!

It’s the beginning of a new year, and while news about year-end bonuses and special bonuses continues to trickle in, dozens upon dozens of firms have remained completely silent. Why? The market (i.e., all of the firms that have matched the generous [Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/first-mover-on-bonus/) as well as the [Davis Polk scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/davis-polk-bonuses-21/)) has already spoken — very loudly, in fact. There aren’t any decisions left to be made… except, of course, whether or not your firm is planning to stiff associates during this hot lateral market.

Which firms in the Am Law 50 haven’t uttered a word (that we know of) to their associates about bonuses yet? Here’s a list of the firms that have yet to match (along with their most recent gross revenue, as of 2020). Do with it what you will, and please feel free to correct us if we’re wrong.

2. Latham: $4,333,763,000 (bonuses are typically announced in January; the firm has already [announced and paid out special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/latham-special-bonuses-2021/))
7. Morgan Lewis: $2,446,000,000 (bonuses were [announced on 1/1](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/morgan-lewis-bonus-2021/))
10. Jones Day: $2,226,424,000
16. Greenberg Traurig: $1,730,230,000
19. Cooley: $1,552,149,000 (bonuses are typically announced in February; bonuses were [announced on 2/15](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/money-matters-top-20-biglaw-firm-officially-announces-a-milbank-match/))
21: King & Spalding: $1,529,418,000
26. Reed Smith: $1,310,596,000
38. Holland & Knight: $1,044,337,000 (bonuses will be announced during first quarter of 2022)
39. Squire Patton: $1,042,000,000
40. K&L Gates: $1,019,674,000
41. Wachtell: $1,010,664,000 (associates at this firm don’t typically share information on their compensation; likely nothing to see here)
47. Faegre Drinker: $937,037,000
49. Troutman Pepper: $918,010,000

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Another Biglaw Firm Reports Dismal Gender Pay Gap
## At Allen & Overy, average bonuses for men are 42.1% higher than for women.

In the United Kingdom, all employers with more than 250 employees have to submit a report with salary information to assess the gender pay gap. Allen & Overy is the latest Magic Circle firm to release its data under the Equality Act 2010 — and while A&O’s gap is[ not as pronounced](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/last-year-women-at-this-magic-circle-firm-earned-about-40-percent-less-in-bonuses-than-men/) as the pay gap at other firms, it seems there is still a lot of work to be done.

The average pay gap between male employees and female employees was just under 20 percent (19.8). As has[ become a trend](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/prominent-law-firm-paid-female-employees-30-percent-less-in-bonuses/) in analyzing these reports, women tend the occupy support roles at the firm, and thus account for a big part of the disparity. As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2018/03/12/allen-overy-gender-pay-gap-report-71-of-firms-lowest-earners-are-women/) Law.com:

The report reveals that more than 25% of London staff are women in business support roles, and that 71% of employees in the firm’s lowest-paid quartile are female – an imbalance which means that average hourly pay for male staff is 19.8% higher and average bonuses for men are 42.1% higher.

But just saying the pay gap can be chalked up to different roles at the firm is overly simplistic and inaccurate. A closer look at the top pay quartile — comprised of associates, counsel, senior managers and directors — still reveals a 13.6 percent pay gap.

The firm, through Global HR director Sasha Hardman, has acknowledged the pay discrepancy is a problem, and one they are actively trying to combat:

[Global HR director Sasha] Hardman said: “Following [senior partner] Wim Dejonghe and [managing partner] Andrew Ballheimer’s appointments in 2016, gender diversity has been a priority area of focus. The gender pay gap report is a helpful proof point. More of the senior roles in the upper quartile [of our employees] are held by men, which impacts the bonus discrepancy.”

The firm’s report acknowledges that it has “not succeeded in retaining and promoting enough” of its best women, and that it has put strategies in place – including creating a gender advisory committee – to ensure it is making progress.

Only time will tell how effective these strategies really are.

# City Attorney Spraying Anti-Trump Graffiti While Drinking Wine Is All We Have Left
## That's a man, wearing an ascot, holding a glass of wine, who tagged an upscale supermarket.

For the liberal elites, it’s come to this. We’ve been reduced to this. We are all Duncan Lloyd, an assistant city solicitor in Philadelphia. Lloyd was busted by surveillance cameras videoing a buddy spraying “Fuck Trump” on the side of a newly opened Fresh Grocer. Lloyd is pictured below in his civil disobedience uniform.



Yes. That’s a man, wearing an ascot, holding a glass of wine, who tagged an upscale supermarket.

This is our life now, hyper-educated coastal elites. We’re not going to stock up on guns and insta-waffles. We’re not going to hop in a Prius and [ethanol-roll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_coal) motorists we disagree with. We’re not going to [burn an American flag](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/flag-burning-is-settled-law-so-smoke-em-if-you-got-em/), because we don’t own an American flag, because what kind of jingoistic prick can find space for a freaking flag in a one-bedroom apartment?

All we can do is turn up our noses, drown ourselves in an earthy vintage, and tastefully vandalize what establishments we pass. We are a broken, beaten people. It’s just like high school. We’ve got our books and our vastly superior reservoirs of knowledge and empathy, they’ve got a viselike grip on our underpants. “F**k Trump” isn’t a protest, it’s a prayer, only we’re too smart to really believe that there’s an invisible sky judge who is listening.

Republicans are all too happy to pounce on our [weakness and despair](http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20161201_City_attorney_identified_in_anti-Trump_vandalism.html):

“If the image of an upper-middle-class city attorney clad in a blazer and sipping wine while vandalizing an upscale grocery store with an anti-Trump message strikes you as perhaps the most bourgeois sight imaginable, that’s because it is,” said Joe DeFelice, chairman of the Philadelphia Republican Party.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
I bet Joe DeFelice doesn’t know how to recognize or pronounce “ascot,” or suspects his supporters are too stupid to know what one is, so he chose to [snark Lloyd’s blazer](http://billypenn.com/2016/11/30/philly-gop-to-city-fire-ascot-clad-wine-sipping-f-k-trump-graffiti-lawyer/):

“Nothing can better represent the hysterical pearl-clutching of the ‘progressive’ elite in response to this earth-shattering election, when residents of Chestnut Hill and similar neighborhoods across the country discovered – gasp – that other people have a voice too.”

It’s not the discovery of their voice that has us clutching our pearls. It’s the waking nightmare of having to listen to it. We already gave these people the History Channel, and they turned it into 24 straight hours of men with visible ass-crack fishing, chopping, and fighting over trash left behind in a storage locker. WHAT WILL THEY DO WITH C-SPAN? I cannot abide live coverage of Tom Cotton buying guns and meat at Walmart.

Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney says Lloyd can keep his job he hasn’t made a final decision about Lloyd’s job. Unquestionably, that’s a double-standard. If a Trump supporter had written “Go Trump” on the side of a synagogue, or a library, or really anything of intellectual value, he’d be out on his ass.

But that’s because these Trump people are actually frightening. They ran on a campaign of white supremacy. When they vandalize your city, the action is but part of a larger campaign of hate crimes and intimidation.

When Duncan Lloyd vandalizes your city, it’s part of his larger campaign of finding a way to crawl out from under his covers in the morning. Look at him. LOOK AT HIM. He’s not out here trying to send the children of Trump supporters back to Mexico. He’s not trying to destroy the climate so Jesus can Rapture him to Graceland. He just wants to be able to look his cats in the eye without feeling ineffectual and ashamed. “I made a statement today, Odysseus and Penelope. I’m not going to let this be normalized.”

So, laugh at Duncan Lloyd. Laugh at all of us. Cackle away! But remember, it’s people like Lloyd who are at least trying to deal with reality. It’s all you Trump voters who will be looking the other way while he pulls your pants down and takes what coins you’ve scraped together. The con man is going to screw you guys the hardest.

One day, you’ll be asking to borrow Lloyd’s spray paint.

UPDATE (12/2/16, 12:00 p.m.): The mayor’s office says that it has not decided on a course of action yet: “We’re waiting to hear the full story, and we’re waiting to see if any charges are filed. The Mayor and Solicitor Sozi Pedro Tulante will make a decision on [Lloyd’s] employment based on that information.”

UPDATE (12/2/16, 5:15 p.m.): Mayor Kenney told [Philly.com](http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20161201_City_attorney_identified_in_anti-Trump_vandalism.html), “It’s still working out. It’s certainly hateful and inappropriate and unacceptable… but people are human beings and they make mistakes and it’s a dumb mistake. It’s hateful graffiti, hateful graffiti is never acceptable whether it’s a city employee or not.”

The Philly.com article has more biographical detail about Lloyd: “Lloyd, 32, attended Germantown Friends School and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and Temple University’s Beasley School of Law, according to his LinkedIn page. He makes $63,207 a year, working in the Labor and Employment unit, representing the city mostly in federal and state discrimination lawsuits.”

# Law School Openly Begging Students To Talk To Kasowitz
## The firm can't get anyone to hang out at their table.

Law firm events for 1Ls are always a little stilted and awkward. Only one semester through their journey toward lawyerhood, 1Ls don’t have the best banter worked out to share with seasoned attorneys and the firm’s representatives are all standing around wondering why they’re losing precious billable time on this. Still, everyone goes to these events because it’s free food and drink and a chance to get career services off your back.

Which is why it’s such high comedy that Kasowitz Benson not only can’t fill its recruiting event — the law school has resorted to begging students to show up or they’ll have to cancel it altogether.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

UVA’s career services folks sent around an email gamely trying to drum up interest in what appears to be a stillborn Kasowitz event:

Hi 1L’s,

We hope you are having a nice break. You’ve been awfully quiet out there. Seeing that it is the new year and time to be getting going, I am writing to remind people that the Kasowitz firm is doing a UVA-only dinner in NY this Wednesday night. To say that the RSVP’s have been minimal would be something of an understatement. We hope this means that there is currently nobody in the greater NY area who wants to work ultimately in the greater NY area. I just have a sinking feeling that I will be thinking of this event in eight months when people are sitting in my office telling me that they will do ANYTHING to get a firm job in New York City.

In fairness to the students, the event is in New York, already limiting the number of potential UVA attendees and students may be loathe to jump into law school work when many students around the country are still [waiting on their grades](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/as-law-school-students-still-wait-for-grades-their-professors-go-partying-in-new-orleans/).

On the other hand, could this be more fallout from Kasowitz’s disastrous turn as Donald Trump’s lawyer? Back in 2017, the New York Law Journal was already musing that the decision to become the face of Trump’s legal woes could be [destroying the firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/when-people-start-writing-about-you-destroying-your-firm-things-arent-going-well/) — which was then hemorrhaging lawyers and about to clock a 7 percent revenue hit.

Sometimes it’s unfair to judge a lawyer by the clients they keep. But it’s all in the attitude a lawyer brings to the party. Emmet Flood will walk away from his time advising Trump as a respected Washington power lawyer who took on a matter of national significance with detached professionalism. Kasowitz, on the other hand, approached the Trump case with [true-believer enthusiasm](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/marc-kasowitz-takes-break-from-partying-at-trump-hotel-to-talk-to-the-press/). These distinctions matter to students and lawyers considering whose practice they want to join.

If UVA students are really shying away from the firm because its founder invited a none too flattering spotlight on his practice, it’d be a shame. After all, the firm is more than the first name on the letterhead, and even if students are skittish about affixing their wagons to Marc Kasowitz’s star right now, that’s no reason to write off the firm as a whole.

Besides… free food.

UPDATE: The firm’s weighed in with a statement:

“As reflected in our offer and acceptance statistics and associate satisfaction surveys, our summer and permanent associate recruiting has been and remains exceptionally strong. We don’t currently recruit at UVA, but several Kasowitz partners who are UVA alumni have invited a small group of New York area students to join them for dinner to get to know the firm. We are delighted that four students will be attending and have every expectation that the dinner will be a success.”

First of all, great. It’s nice that this event is going forward. Second, their statement appears to be “it’s cool, we weren’t really into UVA either” which seems a bit like a jilted Tinder date. UVA’s a great school and hopefully this event is every bit the success they expect.

In this week’s episode of The Jabot podcast, I speak with Lisa Kirby, Chief Intelligence and Knowledge Sharing Officer at Diversity Lab. The Diversity Lab is the organization behind Mansfield certification, which is designed to encourage Biglaw firms to consider women or minority candidates for leadership roles, and hold Biglaw firms accountable for their lofty diversity goals.

We discuss how the program was developed, common misconceptions about the Mansfield Rule, the difficult work of getting lawyers to think outside the box, what diversity really looks like in the legal profession, and what needs to be done to get there.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wears when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

According to data collected by ALM for its 2021 Am Law 200 ranking, by what percentage of Biglaw partners are equity partners?

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Hint: The percentage dipped — slightly — from 2019, and the firms ranked 101-200 had a higher percentage of equity partners than the Top 100.

Throughout the Biglaw COVID-19 cost-cutting measures it’s been clear that the most severe move — [one most firms try to avoid](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-slashes-salaries-but-hopes-to-avoid-layoffs/) — is layoffs. Unfortunately, not every firm is able to avoid letting folks go during the global pandemic.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/dailybusinessreview/2020/04/15/greenspoon-marder-combines-layoffs-pay-cuts-expecting-revenue-decline/) Daily Business Review, Am Law 200 firm Greenspoon Marder has confirmed that, in anticipation of revenue shortfalls, they’ve instituted firmwide pay cuts and laid off employees. According to reports, 40 staff members and 5 attorneys have been let go.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Firm co-founders Gerry Greenspoon and Michael Marder had this to say about the cuts:

“There is no question that our firm, like every other firm in the country, will experience a loss of previously projected revenue as a result of this unmatched global business slowdown,” said Marder and Greenspoon. “As a result, our firm has decided to implement various cost-cutting measures in order to preemptively parallel this unexpected impact upon revenue with currently anticipated costs and expenses. It is our sincere and honest hope that many of these reductions will be temporary.”

# BakerHostetler Was Ordered By The Court To Stop Working On This Matter... It Looks Like They Ignored That
## It's hard to believe any firm would think this was acceptable.

A few years back, the Second Circuit told BakerHostetler that, no, they can’t represent an alleged fraudster when they’d previously been representing the victim. It seemed straightforward enough and frankly it was a little shocking that the firm thought they could get away with it. But not as shocking as new emails out there suggesting that after being ordered off the case, BakerHostetler continued acting as shadow counsel for Prevezon, a company at the heart of the Russian influence campaign that ensnared the Trump campaign.

It was the brouhaha over the Magnitsky Act that brought Natalia Veselnitskaya to Trump Tower during the campaign. That law was named after Sergei Magnitsky, the attorney who inspired U.S. sanctions on Russia after dying in Russian custody for exposing… the fraud Prevezon was charged with.

After the courts benchslapped BakerHostetler for trying to perform an endrun around basic professional responsibility, it seemed as though this was over. But new documents acquired by the [Dossier Center](https://www.khodorkovsky.com/dossier-center/) and [reported by the Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/natalia-veselniskaya-email-leak-exposes-trump-tower-russians-dirty-lobbying-operations?ref=scroll) indicate that BakerHostetler took this order and promptly wiped its proverbial ass with it.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Emails apparently sent to and from lawyers at BakerHostetler, however, suggest that the law firm continued to serve Prevezon as a kind of shadow counsel even after the disqualification.

Once that ruling had been handed down, leaked emails indicate that in November 2016 Cymrot at BakerHostetler suggested an alternative lawyer who could be hired by Veselnitskaya to work for Prevezon. In an email sent five months later, Cymrot said BakerHostetler had still discussed the case “on a regular basis” and would continue to hold “team” meetings with the new counsel.

Despite being disqualified from taking part in the case, the emails suggest BakerHostetler helped draft the settlement with the U.S. government in May 2017 and even acted as a go-between, passing on messages and an invoice from the new lawyer, Mike Hess. Hess did not respond to questions from The Daily Beast. BakerHostetler was asked about this and other allegations, but did not respond.

Oh, and the documents say that Faith Gay, then of Quinn Emanuel and now of Selendy & Gay, was also publicly representing Prevezon while coordinating with BakerHostetler behind the scenes. Apparently there’s an email from a Quinn associate in 2017 flagging the “question” that could be raised if people learned that BakerHostetler was still working on the case.

If you’re thinking that the work BakerHostetler was doing for Prevezon sounds like the sort of work Skadden was doing in Ukraine — work that probably should have triggered registering as a foreign lobbyist — well, that’s an issue too!

At the end of April 2016, emails suggest a BakerHostetler invoice addressed to HRAGIF described professional services at a cost of $111,387.45, including issues relating to the Magnitsky list, which named the sanctioned individuals, for “review and markup materials regarding issues with Magnitsky Act” and “materials for Congressional committee.” It also included numerous line items on time spent discussing “lobbying registration requirements” and “review of… FARA requirements,” as well as drafting the “certificate of incorporation” to set up HRAGIF in the first place.

According to a leaked email dated July 14, 2016, [Mark] Cymrot wrote to Veselnitskaya to explain the invoices. “Natalia: I am attaching the HRAGIF and Prevezon matter,” the email says. “It now contains 5 months of Baker time, which is largely support for the public relations effort.”

“It seems that the purpose in creating this nonprofit was to avoid registration under FARA, and they would not be the first law firm to try and use that tactic to avoid registration,” Fischer, from the Campaign Legal Center, told The Daily Beast. “That’s what Manafort did on behalf of the Ukrainian political party and it’s also what helped lead to the charges against him because the evidence showed—and he knew—that the beneficiary of his activities was actually the Ukrainian political party not this innocuously named sham nonprofit.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The Daily Beast quotes former prosecutor Cristy Phillips delivering the best summary of what BakerHostetler’s actions mean if all of this turns out to be true:

“The integrity of our judicial system depends on lawyers upholding their obligations as officers of the court. Most fundamentally, if a court issues an order, lawyers have to follow it and make sure that others on their side follow it. There were numerous senior lawyers on these emails and they all clearly violated a Second Circuit court order. And these were not inexperienced lawyers, several of them are former Department of Justice attorneys,” she told The Daily Beast.

“We’re talking about a case where witnesses had died and other witnesses’ lives and safety had been threatened. These were not low-stakes decisions.”

— A response to a survey conducted by The American Lawyer, concerning the [use of the term “white shoe” for large law firms](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/09/17/lawyers-business-pros-diverge-on-whether-white-shoe-label-should-go-offering-pointed-commentary/). According to Am Law’s survey results, 50.6% of overall respondents said the industry should continue to use the label.

# The Biglaw Recruitment Process Is Worse For Everyone
## The hellscape that is pre-recruitment is incredibly popular.

When you tell people outside of the legal profession that you (functionally) interview for the Biglaw job you’re going to take after law school graduation after only completing 1/3 of law school, they think it’s wild. Like how do firms know how good you’ll be as a lawyer if you haven’t even completed the majority of your legal training? How do you know what job you want two years in the future? Sure, we’ve all been indoctrinated into the system such that it no longer seems weird, but it is a bizarre system.

And yet, it’s getting even worse.

The on-campus interview process — which placed initial interviews for summer associateships that beget post-graduation employment offers in the weeks before 2L year or the early part of the semester — is no longer the hotness for Biglaw firms. In an effort to have first dibs on the best and brightest, law schools are taking direct applications from 1Ls as early as April. And, as[ reported by](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/big-law-skips-ahead-of-on-campus-recruiting-in-race-for-talent) Bloomberg Law, the direct application process is very popular at some Biglaw firms:

“This direct hire process will likely be filling about 50% of our class, at least,” said Nicole Wanzer, director of attorney recruiting at Morrison Foerster. “Were we to wait for traditional OCI and lean only on traditional OCI, we feel like we would be missing out on some of the talent that’s getting picked up earlier in the process.”

The shift has had a snowball effect. Weil Gotshal & Manges has already [opened](https://careers.weil.com/) applications for its 2025 summer program, allowing first-year law students to apply directly—a process dubbed “pre-OCI”. Other prominent players such as Jones Day, Milbank LLP, Paul Hastings, and Davis Polk & Wardwell open up their direct applications as early as mid-April for jobs that start the summer after the second year of school is completed. MoFo is launching its own advanced consideration application system for first-year students this year, which opens May 1.

And in response, law schools are [moving up their OCI ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/02/fomo-in-biglaw-recruiting-will-more-law-schools-switch-their-dates-for-on-campus-recruiting/)to the beginning of the summer.

So what happened to derail the import — and established timeframe — of OCI? Back in 2018, the National Association for Law Placement [ditched their rules](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/the-recruiting-game-done-changed/) which dictated how and when firms could contact candidates. We called it “[organized chaos](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/new-nalp-rules-for-law-school-recruitment-seem-to-promote-organized-chaos/)” when announced. With the benefit of hindsight, NALP’s executive director Nikia Gray calls it “the free market system.” But in reality, it seems like a lot closer to a shitshow.

Students in particular are losing out in the new system. Putting the stress of the summer associate interview process before they’ve completed their first full year just sucks. Especially when you consider some of the other developments that came once NALP noped out — like [exploding offers](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/biglaws-exploding-offers-are-adding-unnecessary-stress-to-law-students-lives/) that slash the amount of time law students can evaluate a firm or interview with their competitors.

And firms are increasingly concerned that they have less information with which to judge potential associates.

Morrison Foerster is considering adding new assessments or writing exercises to its interview process to help gauge applicants, Wanzer said.

“With the speed of the process, it’s definitely exacerbated the challenge to make sure that the talent you’re seeing—and, more so, the offers that you’re extending—are to people who are going to succeed,” she said.

Maybe we just should have kept the old system before Biglaw devolved into a prisoner’s dilemma. But what do I know.

The weight of the world sits on you, so the people in the firm — attorneys and staff alike — depend on you to thrive. That was really weighty.

— Richard Scheff, currently a partner at Armstrong Teasdale, [explains to Law.com](https://www.law.com/2019/08/27/when-a-managing-partner-exits-a-firm-does-it-signal-new-career-goals-or-firm-troubles/) on why he left Montgomery McCracken, his firm of 28 years. At the time of his departure from Montgomery McCracken he was both the firm’s executive chairman and the firm’s largest revenue generator.

# Biglaw Firm Showers Associates With Cold, Hard Cash

Another day, another Biglaw firm that’s offering tremendous heaps of money to its associates and counsel for all of their hard work during the pandemic. By [our count](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/special-bonus-tracker-2021/), dozens upon dozens of law firms (64, to be exact) have offered special bonuses thus far, leaving us to wonder which firms are waiting it out until the bitter end of the cycle to thank their lawyers for all they’ve done in these unprecedented times.

The latest firm to announce bonuses is Katten Muchin, a firm that brought in $669,709,000 gross revenue in 2019, placing it at #63 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking. The firm has of course matched the Davis Polk special bonus scale, and its bonus matrix can be seen below (full memo on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/katten-special-bonus-2021/2/)):

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Although the firm’s standard billable requirement for bonuses is 2000 hours, Katten is only requiring 1900 hours annualized (including pro bono, firm citizenship, and firm legal work) for these special bonuses. The May payment is based on four months of work, and the September payment is based on eight months of work. The firm is offering two catch-up payment periods in August and December so that everyone will have the opportunity to reap these rewards.

Congratulations to everyone at the firm on these fantastic bonuses!

(Flip to the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/katten-special-bonus-2021/2/) to see the full memo from Katten.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Elite Biglaw Firms Suck At Client Service
## Clients have spoken -- the top Biglaw firms ain't all that.

When you think of the very top of the Am Law 200 — say the top 20 Biglaw firms or so, you probably assume those are the very best of the best, and that clients who engage those firms receive legal services second to none. But what if the reality was far different?

That’s one of the [fascinating findings from the GC Thought Leaders Experiment,](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/06/12/large-pedigreed-firms-underperform-on-service-quality-compared-to-other-firms/) they asked in-house departments to evaluate 1,400 legal matters and the results show that hiring the biggest of the Biglaw firms did not result in better service. Indeed, the Am Law 21-200 did better than the top 20 across several metrics including responsiveness, efficiency, quality of work, and solutions focus. Hell, they did better on every metric they tested for. And what’s more, the differences are amplified when you compare the Am Law top 20 to the Am Law 101-200.

The survey methodology didn’t ask respondents to rank firms, but instead asked them to rate the service on specific matters. Even when controlling for variables such as the size of the matter, the length of the firm/company relationship and the type of legal work, the surprising results were the same:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Note that this isn’t an opinion survey: no one ranked firms. These are 28 companies’ evaluations of over 1,400 legal matters; and because we knew which firms and lawyers handled each matter, we were able to determine which firms performed better or worse, as well as identify trends. We also controlled for many variables (such as type of legal work, length of client/firm relationship, size of legal matter, amount of spend with the firm, and the like) to test and re-test our findings. But the result was the same. On the whole, when clients look to hire firms, bigger or more pedigreed is not necessarily better.

It probably makes sense that some factors, such as cost/efficiency, aren’t the elite firms’ strong suit — after all, clients pay a premium for the best of the best attorneys. But the Am Law top 20 are even losing when it comes to solutions focus — defined as “is the outside lawyer demonstrating creativity, strategic thinking, and a ‘yes, and here’s how’ (rather than ‘no’) mindset?” — which is the most relevant factor when clients evaluate whether they’d recommend the firm. The Am Law 20 scores 4.34 in that metric, compared with 4.53 for the Am Law 21-200 and 4.56 for the Am Law 101-200.

So why are the top Biglaw firms falling behind on this essential skill set?

This, too, may be a by-product of staffing leverage (associate to partner ratio) at the largest and most pedigreed firms: as bigger teams liaise with the client, the lead partner may not learn quite as much about the business or matter. And this may be exacerbated by the reality that in-house lawyers are stretched too thin with less time to work with outside lawyers; more than before in-house teams are expected to focus their time and energy collaborating with internal clients to drive business results.

But if clients are consistently less happy with the elite firms, why exactly do they remain at the top of the heap? The authors, Firoz Dattu and Aaron Kotok, point to several reasons that elite Biglaw firms continue to bring in work, such as the possibility that they have reached a tipping point or the high cost associated with switching firms that have an established relationship between the firm and the company, but most importantly that there’s a lack of information to in-house decision makers:

It’s that the legal market has an information problem: we don’t know which firms are performing better, so we are forced to default to brand (and high cost) as proxies for quality. But that is changing, as discussed in this[ Above the Law article](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/if-a-tree-falls-in-biglaw-and-no-one-hears-it-does-it-make-a-sound-meet-firoz-dattu/). Clients, in essence, are finding out that the blue chip firms of the past are not necessarily the blue chip firms of the present (and future). Likewise, the “insurance” rationale for choosing certain firms for high-stakes work based on historical reputation should dissipate over time (but won’t disappear).

Now that the information is out there, it’s up to the biggest Biglaw firms to respond.

# 'Tone-Deaf And Unseemly': In-House Counsel A Bit Put Off By Biglaw Salary Hikes

This isn’t of too much consequence or import to us if firms don’t attempt to pass the cost through to clients in the form of higher rates. But even if they say they don’t/won’t, clients may tend to wonder.

It seems a bit tone-deaf and unseemly in this market and coming off of the pandemic (with so much economic dislocation) for firms to be raising salaries to these levels and talking publicly about bonuses and how well partners are doing. Discretion would be the much better part of valor here.

— the general counsel of a financial services company, [commenting](https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/2021/06/10/seems-a-bit-tone-deaf-clients-react-to-big-law-associate-pay-bump/) anonymously on the recent wave of salary increases that are rocking the Biglaw market in the wake of associate bonus payouts that could reach as high as $164K, depending on class year.

# More Raises Ahead For The Legal Profession In 2017
## This is certainly good news for the industry overall.

High off of this summer’s [MoneyLaw](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/moneylaw/) raises, you might not think things could get better for the legal profession — at least not in terms of compensation. But there may be more good news in 2017.

According to [Time](http://time.com/money/4470679/best-jobs-salary-increases-2017/), staffing company Robert Half has identified 10 jobs poised for salary bumps in 2017, and of that list, six are in or related to the legal industry:

- Litigation support / e-Discovery professionals: 7.3% (junior level) to 8.9% (senior level)
- Lawyers: 5.8% (senior level) to 6.9% (midlevel)
- Compliance professionals: 6.4% (senior level) to 6.9% (midlevel)
- First-year legal associates (large law firm): 6.2%
- Contract managers: 5.4%
- Compliance analysts: 5.4%

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
My guess is the the “First-year legal associates (large law firm)” entry will just be the market ripple effect as firms catch up to the Cravath scale, or make other, smaller adjustments to their compensation based on that bump. But it is encouraging for others outside of Biglaw associate ranks, like ediscovery and compliance professionals, to see their sliver of the market is improving as well.

The Time article pays particular attention to the salary increase expected in compliance:

Most legal workers, for instance, can expect a salary bump in line with the national average, according to the firm’s data. But for compliance managers — a role that [senior executive director Paul] McDonald says has grown steadily since the [introduction of Dodd-Frank](http://time.com/money/3949583/dodd-frank-financial-reform-anniversary/) and other financial reforms — salaries will climb 6.9%.

This is certainly good news for the industry overall.

# This Is Absolutely What You Need To Start Calling The Lawyer In Your Life

There are actually a lot of things you can call a lawyer: attorney, counselor, esquire… plus the job specific titles like prosecutor, solicitor, barrister. The list is long (but don’t call them doctor, [that’s just dumb](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/11/any-lawyer-who-calls-himself-doctor-like-a-ph-d-should-get-punched-in-the-mouth/).)

You may think with all these rhetorical options, no more are needed. There was a time, not so long ago, when I would have agreed. But then I heard the term “attack librarian.” Combining the penchant for research with an argumentative streak is a brilliant move. And honestly, attack librarian is the platonic ideal of lawyering.

Admit it, your life is better now that you’ve heard attack librarian. You’re welcome.

The family of the late [Harry S. Jackson III](https://www.foxrothschild.com/harry-s-jackson-iii), a young Fox Rothschild partner, has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against tractor-trailer driver, Cheick Yameogo, and the vehicle’s owner, Western Express Inc., for allegedly causing the car crash that killed Jackson through negligence and recklessness.

Jackson was just 33 years old when he died on the PA Turnpike on July 29, 2022, after his car collided with a jackknifed tractor-trailer. Jackson’s untimely death came about one week before he was supposed to get married, and just days before his 34th birthday. “I don’t think an accident like this occurs without reckless conduct,” said Feldman Shepherd co-managing shareholder [Alan Feldman](https://feldmanshepherd.com/attorneys-professionals/alan-feldman/), who is representing the estate.

As noted in the [complaint](https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/documents/402/132957/JacksonV.WesternExpress.pdf), Jackson’s estate is not only bringing wrongful death and survival actions but is also seeking punitive damages. Feldman spoke to the [Legal Intelligencer](https://www.law.com/thelegalintelligencer/2023/05/16/estate-of-fox-rothschild-partner-who-died-in-car-crash-files-wrongful-death-suit/) about Jackson’s premature death, saying, “Everything was in front of him. An amazing life.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“This was clearly a young lawyer who was going places,” Feldman said. “He was enormously respected by his colleagues.” …

Feldman said he did not know Jackson while he was alive but that he has spoken to Jackson’s colleagues at Fox Rothschild. “I’ve never heard anyone described in such glowing terms,” Feldman said.

Prior to his passing, Jackson was involved in Fox Rothschild’s gaming practice and was developing an expertise in e-sports. He’d recently been named co-chair of firm’s American Indian Law practice group, as he was a member of the Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape Tribal Nation who served as an elected member of its nine-member trial council.

“The world was his oyster,” Feldman went on to say. ”Harry’s passing is just a reminder that we’re on this earth for whatever time is allotted to us and that we have to enjoy every day.”

A law student saved the day.

Last month, we shared with you the tale of a [heroic law student](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/who-is-the-mystery-law-student-who-came-to-the-rescue-of-a-biglaw-partner/) who came to the aid of a Biglaw partner who was involved in a violent altercation with some local ruffians.

[John P. Rowley III](http://www.bakermckenzie.com/en/people/r/rowley-iii-john-p/), a partner at [Baker McKenzie](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/baker-mckenzie/), shattered his hand and sustained cuts and bruises after being pushed into a departing train and kicked and punched by several teens at the Gallery Place Metro station on May 12. Luckily, GW Law student [Andrew Miller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmillerlaw/) was just behind Rowley, and ran to his assistance, pulling the teens off of the former federal prosecutor before they could do any more harm. Miller suffered a concussion as a consequence for being a good samaritan. But, this story has a very happy ending for both Rowley and Miller.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
At some point after the attack, Rowley began communicating with Miller, and one week after the assault, Miller found himself with an offer he couldn’t refuse. [Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/06/20/good-samaritan-scores-summer-associate-gig-after-train-station-assault/) has more information on what happened next:


Andrew Miller

Rowley called Miller and offered him a position as a summer associate in the firm’s Washington, D.C., office. Miller … started at the firm on June 12.

“I practiced law for quite a while now and, frankly, natural leaders are hard to find,” Rowley said. “When I met [Miller] and I got to know him a little bit, reflecting back on the courage of jumping in, he was the kind of person that we wanted to have here at the firm this summer.”

Miller was genuinely shocked that Rowley extended an offer to him, but he’s thrilled about working at a firm that was willing to take a chance on someone like him, just because of his unquestionable selflessness and his willingness to step in during an emergency situation when others turned away.

“I’m sure I’ll tell my grandkids about it,” Miller said about his once-in-a-lifetime experience and the resultant job offer. Kindness counts, even in Biglaw.

As Little Monsters everywhere know, Lady Gaga sure knows how to put on a show, but the fireworks don’t stop once she gets off the stage. According to recently unsealed court documents, the pop singer-turned-actress was deposed in September 2017 as part of singer Kesha’s ongoing legal battle against producer Lukasz “Dr. Luke” Gottwald, and Gaga got into a really fiery exchange with Dr. Luke’s lawyer, [Christine Lepera](https://www.msk.com/attorneys-Christine_Lepera), one of the nation’s top music lawyers.

Before we get into the details, here’s background on the case, from the [Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/lady-gaga-lambasts-dr-lukes-lawyer-in-explosive-kesha-deposition):

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In 2014, Kesha accused Dr. Luke of forcing her to take a date rape drug and then taking advantage of her in a hotel room. He denied the allegation, and Kesha dropped her California suits against him in respect of the allegation in 2016, but other suits continued in New York.

Kesha has claimed that the producer denied her profits from her work including the smash single “Tik Tok.” Dr. Luke, in turn, filed a defamation claim and framed her attempts to get out of the record deal as extortion.

Gaga, whose real name (Stefani Germanotta) appears in the transcript, is a survivor of sexual assault, and her lawyer, Orin Snyder of Gibson Dunn, noted before she began to testify that the deposition served as a “trigger event” for his client. “She has experienced in the past few hours some PTSD reactions which is causing some trauma and emotional reactivity,” Snyder said. “So she is crying now the record will reflect.”

Later on, Gaga described a time when she saw Kesha wearing only her underwear in Dr. Luke’s home studio, and spoke of the singer’s “immense sadness and depression and fear,” saying she seemed “visibly very different than when I had seen her before.” Lepera then asked if Gaga thought Kesha’s rape accusation had damaged Dr. Luke’s reputation. “I made my view of him and his reputation when I saw her in that back room,” she said. “That was an image that—of something that happened to me, and I felt and knew in my heart that she was telling the truth, and I believe her.”

Here’s what happened next:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Lepera: “With respect to Mr. Gottwald himself, you have absolutely no personal knowledge or information as to any interaction between him and Ms. Sebert, correct, physical or otherwise?”

Gaga: “Yes, I do have knowledge… She told me he assaulted her.”

When the lawyer asked if her information was based purely on Kesha’s account, Gaga replied: “Well, you know, when men assault women, they don’t invite people over to watch.”

Things went downhill from there, with Gaga issuing an exasperated “oh, ma’am” as Lepera’s line of questioning about her “factual knowledge” of Kesha’s alleged assault continued, unabated. From the [deposition transcript](https://www.scribd.com/document/398569447/Lady-Gaga-s-deposition-in-Dr-Luke-s-defamation-lawsuit):



Lepera kept going, using an awkward example of whether Gaga would automatically believe a victim who had accused her own father of rape. Gaga held steadfast in her testimony in support of Kesha, saying, “I believe her. And I know it to be true.” When Lepera once more asked, “You weren’t there, correct?” that’s when the superstar let loose on the celebrity lawyer, issuing this incredibly fiery response.

####“Don’t you roll your eyes at me. You should be ashamed of yourself.”
Let the record reflect that this may be the first time that a celebrity has uttered such words during a deposition. We would’ve paid good money to be a fly on the wall in the room where this proceeding took place just to see the look on Christine Lepera’s face after Lady Gaga dropped the depo mic like that.

Give this woman an Oscar already.

What firms do general counsels absolutely, positively not want to face in court? Answering that question is the motivation behind a survey from BTI Consulting Group. They asked 300 general counsels in a free form question which law firms they would least like to see as opposing counsel and compiled their “Fearsome Foursome” list.

So who made the cut this year (in alphabetical order)?

Dentons
Jones Day
Kirkland & Ellis
Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Congratulations on your fierceness.

[According to](http://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/841458/the-4-firms-that-strike-fear-in-gcs-) Law360 (sub. req.), turning up on this list is old hat for Jones Day, Kirkland, and Skadden, but brand new territory for Dentons. The addition of Dentons in the “Fearsome Foursome” means Quinn Emanuel lost its seat on this high-powered train.

So what is it about these firms that strikes fear in the hearts of GCs? According to Michael Rynowecer, CEO of BTI Consulting Group, they just don’t give up:

General counsels who responded to the survey pointed to a few things that the four firms named most-feared in the courtroom have in common, the first of which is an unrelenting approach, Rynowecer said.

“They have several strategies in place at once and keep coming at the issue,” he said. “Not only do they overturn every rock, but they find new rocks to overturn and keep coming up with new ways to act in their clients’ interests.”

# Salary Wars Scorecard: Which Firms Have Announced Raises And Bonuses? (2018)
## Where does your law firm stand?

Since we broke the news of the new $190K salary scale for associates at large law firms in the United States — a trend that was [started by Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) on Monday, June 4, 2018 — several firms have fallen in line and matched the scale, but dozens more firms have remained completely silent. Maybe this Above the Law feature will encourage some more firms speak up…

Today, we unveil a table of all of the firms that have already matched the new salary scale, the markets where those matches were made, whether bonuses were offered on top of raises, and the profits per partner (PPP) at those firms for your viewing pleasure. We will be updating this table on a daily basis, sometimes multiple times, as news on raises unfolds. If you see any information here that is incorrect or needs further clarification, let us know.

Remember, we are covering this trend extensively, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salary) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Milbank”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept confidential.

# Millennials – Lazy And Entitled – Tired Of It!

Everyone knows that millennials are lazy and entitled – it is common knowledge!

I really hate it when people say that kind of thing. It is just the same sort of stereotyping that you hear about races, religions, and other groups of people. Stereotypes, as we all know so well, don’t just insult people; they are worse than that because they start a harmful cycle of a self-fulfilling prophecy in a negative direction.

It is the opposite of the wise Dale Carnegie’s advice – given close to 100 years ago in his amazing book, [How to Win Friends and Influence People](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1508569754/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1508569754&linkCode=as2&tag=dealbreaker-20&linkId=V4RF2XZ7VCJ4ULPO) (affiliate link). He says:

“Give a person a fine reputation to live up to.”

Negative stereotypes do the exact opposite.

So for some reason, some people – who I assume are from my amazingly wonderful baby boomer generation — have labeled millennials as lazy and entitled. I have one word to say about that:

“Fiddlesticks.”

We all do our best not to fall into traps laid by others and make our own decisions and determinations. As for myself, I am confident in saying that I have personally interacted with a great number of millennials, both in the workplace and in my personal life. Some are indeed lazy and entitled, and some are super-hardworking people who want to set the world on fire. But I don’t see any reason to believe the dispersion between lazy and entitled versus super-hardworking is any different from my (truly extraordinarily wonderful and amazing) baby boomer generation.

And – let’s be honest – what did our parents think of us baby boomers when we were growing up? Didn’t we get the odd butt-kicking to get off our lazy asses and mow the lawn?

Bottom line is that millennials are just people like everyone else. There is absolutely no reason to group them in the first place. However, if you feel the need to group them and come up with some stereotypes for millennials, for heaven’s sake please follow Dale Carnegie’s advice and come up with some good things to say.

This is a bit of a rant – and I am sorry for that – however, I really see something needlessly negative going on, and I think we all have enough to think about and worry about without creating needless troubles for ourselves and others.

Finally, I conclude with a recommendation to read Dale Carnegie’s book. It is a treasure. If you don’t believe me, ask Warren Buffett, who (it was reported in a biography of Buffett) read it over 100 times, and he hasn’t done that badly.

- Class of 2022: $15,000 (pro-rated)
- Class of 2021: $20,000
- Class of 2020: $30,000
- Class of 2019: $57,500
- Class of 2018: $75,000
- Class of 2017: $90,000
- Class of 2016: $105,000
- Class of 2015+: $115,000
Associates in good standing will receive their cash on December 30. Congratulations on your bonuses, Linklaters associates!

# Washington-Based International Law Firm Raises Salaries Accordingly

Another firm has matched the Cravath scale, which we probably would have known earlier if it weren’t one of the famously [anti-email](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/biglaw-trend-alert-say-goodbye-to-gmail/) firms. UPDATE (6/23/16 4:59 p.m.): Huh? Apparently after much backlash, the firm didn’t actually ban Gmail. Good to know.

Nah. I’m just kidding… no one emails us from their desktops in the age of smartphones any more.

In any event, we’re happy to report that Steptoe & Johnson LLP has issued associate raises! We’re awaiting confirmation on which offices are implicated in the raise — Steptoe is in D.C., New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Palo Alto, and Phoenix — but at least the biggest market lawyers are seeing the boost. UPDATE (6/23/16 4:54 p.m.): Phoenix is on a different scale, but they are apparently getting some smaller raise too.

Steptoe operates a little differently than most firms. Rather than issuing raises strictly by Class, Steptoe works a little [more like Baker Botts](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/saturday-morning-special-another-firm-raises-compensation-but-do-they-beat-the-market/), with multiple “tiers” of seniority. But unlike Baker Botts — who topped out at $305K — Steptoe is topping out at the more mainstream $315K. So we can call this a “Cravath match” even though the structure is a little unorthodox.

The raise is, like most of these raises, effective on July 1 and includes the summer associates.

Now, the real question is: will [Steptoe & Johnson](http://www.steptoe-johnson.com) match the [Steptoe & Johnson](http://www.steptoe.com) scale?[1]

Remember, when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”).

# David Boies Isn't Worried About Recent Scrutiny

David Boies

I do think that many clients’ perspectives are different and more sophisticated than the public narratives. They understand what lawyers do.

— David Boies, in a [recent interview](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-12-07/the-superstar-lawyer-tied-to-harvey-weinstein-and-charlie-rose-isn-t-panicked) with Bloomberg, commenting that he doesn’t believe his recent spate of [bad publicity](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/david-boies/) will hurt the firm. The firm’s general counsel, Nick Gravante Jr., also went on to say the chance of losing a major client’s business over the allegations is “zero percent.” I suppose Boies Schiller is large enough that the [New York Times’s legal work](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/new-york-times-fires-david-boies-over-the-whole-grave-betrayal-thing/) and a [chance to challenge Citizens United](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/david-boies-loses-more-work-over-weinstein-debacle/) isn’t big league enough to count in Gravante’s book.

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Tells Partners Not To Interrupt Associate Vacations With Work Demands
## Do partners at your Biglaw firm respect associates' vacations and time off?

Biglaw associates know all too well that their vacations and time off may be derailed by partner requests to complete client work. But with a relatively hot lateral market and a new focus on attorney health and wellness, things can change very quickly when lawyers are able to vote with their feet.

Take, for example, what’s happening at Mayer Brown’s London outpost. As first reported by [RollOnFriday](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/mayer-brown-orders-partners-not-ruin-lawyers-holidays), the office’s managing partner, Dominic Griffiths, has instructed partners not to impede upon associates’ vacations with new assignments and work demands. Specifically, Griffiths told partners “there is a presumption that holidays will not be cancelled or interrupted unless there is a genuine emergency which cannot be resolved without the input of the individual concerned.” Here’s more from ROF:

Griffiths [said] he reinforced his reminder with a message to fee earners, telling then that an interruption of their annual leave “only ever happens where there is a genuine emergency which cannot be resolved without your input”. …

[A] spokesperson for Mayer Brown said Griffiths was “simply reiterating the importance of people having a real break from work whilst on holiday, which is largely followed already, and letting the associates know that a work/life balance is one of his priorities”.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Griffiths went on to tell ROF, “I believe it is incumbent upon us that client matters are always appropriately covered whilst our lawyers take well deserved breaks in the ordinary course.”

Vacations matter at Mayer Brown, but what about at your Biglaw firm? Please let us know if partners are considerate of associates’ time off, or if they continue to pile on the work regardless of whether or not attorneys are on the clock.

# Victory Laps, Pleading Guilty, The Economy, And Watergate
## Those who remember the Great Recession will also remember what a toll it took on the legal profession.

A lawyer crowed about defending a wrongful death case. In the abstract, there’s nothing wrong about being proud about winning a case. That’s what we do. Unfortunately for him, his celebratory remarks ended up on social media. That drew objections to the remarks from other lawyers, and so, now the lawyer is [eating that crow](https://enewspaper.latimes.com/desktop/latimes/default.aspx?token=42e23962a5d74614be16bae3d62d13e7&utm_id=58114&sfmc_id=304074&edid=a61e54e0-b9b0-4e80-995a-41ef74e668e8).

The death certificate and the coroner’s report said that the decedent had died from a combination of sepsis and an incorrectly placed feeding tube, but the lawyer for the physician who had inserted the tube argued to the jury to ignore the death certificate and ignore the coroner’s findings. He claimed that other hospital staff had contributed to the death, there were other causes, and the case was a “cash grab.”

When the video hit social media, a backlash ensued. Did the lawyer trick the jury into telling it to disregard the evidence? We tell juries all the time to disregard evidence in favor of other evidence, but here, [the evidence of the cause of death](https://mobile.twitter.com/TheTorthub/status/1526761105657417734) was unchallenged.  What do you think about this lawyer’s post-judgment behavior? Is this just another example of the “win at any cost” mentality that permeates our profession (and the larger world)?

Unanswered questions for me: was the physician the only one sued? Hard to imagine. What about the hospital itself and “other medical staff” that the defense attorney claimed bore responsibility? Regardless, the victory lap that this lawyer took, which went viral, was not a good look for the profession. Yes, he apologized (would he really have done so if the video had remained private?) but the damage had been done. Another hit to lawyer reputations. The public doesn’t understand that litigation, unless settled, is a zero-sum game: one side wins, the other loses. (Do we tell the clients that? I wonder.) I am sure that there are many other similar victory laps, both for plaintiff and defense, but the moral here is to keep them sub rosa.

Michael Avenatti has [changed his mind](https://apnews.com/article/california-santa-ana-michael-avenatti-government-and-politics-260b50d89fff090ab818e61036786512) (even lawyers do that) and now wants to plead guilty to charges in the pending retrial of his case in Orange County, in which he stands accused of, among other things, multiple counts of embezzlement of client funds. However, it’s unclear as to what charges he would plead to and whether the government would agree.

Do you think that the several years of employees being able to negotiate working conditions in the COVID-19 world will come to a screeching halt? Now that we are officially in bear market land, it’s anyone’s guess as to whether those advantages will continue. Are layoffs a harbinger?

One firm that had intended to merge now finds itself in the unhappy position of having to [lay off staff, including lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/law-firm-lays-off-10-of-all-timekeepers-due-to-decrease-in-demand/). The layoffs are a 10% whack of the workforce. If there is indeed an oversupply of lawyers and an undersupply of work, and that is to be determined, some rethinking may well be looming. Unfortunately, history does have a way of repeating itself, and those who remember the Great Recession will also remember what a toll it took on the legal profession: the dearth of hiring, especially new admittees, and lots of layoffs.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In the past decade, since the end of the Great Recession, lawyer population has increased by [more than six percent](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/yup-the-number-of-lawyers-in-the-country-is-only-going-up/2/). Will the bear market be able to keep lawyers busy and billing? Or will clients and lawyers be looking for spare change under the sofa cushions?

As an old lady lawyer, I remember the [Watergate hearings in 1973](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal) and watched them gavel to gavel as I awaited starting law school that fall. I was glued to the television, which, aside from movie screens, was the only screen we had back then.

I remember Sam Ervin, the senior senator from North Carolina, the chair of the select Senate committee holding hearings to investigate Watergate. Ervin’s bushy eyebrows, his “country lawyer” demeanor, along with his pocket copy of the U.S. Constitution that he always had by his side, remain [indelible images](https://video.search.yahoo.com/yhs/search;_ylt=Awr.ziXThapiskcBQa42nIlQ?p=senator+sam+ervin+watergate&hsimp=yhs-1&hspart=iba&type=yzpr_9600_CHW_US&param1=WGtbxNcgXOCxgl6lCYo66g%3D%3D&param2=9dUI1n2R0BLDxNuWfiP4aSFOTltNdSPoIx38%2BUf%2FiXrvPdoGmStdlfwLFZYDvqkAJrWWk4yNReCLnBD%2FqPsDZd7olTZcV8HMx1G%2Fk786sE2Tis1g8dJd8zxVWs%2BbKztBnq1TfqUiqPYK9pXifXmJFyorDuCsYXJE71Y6G5tfejAsA0Lsu%2BhSnWhyvR8yxg3FZCgtpQdgsgtFBnqC22qw1kTymId7s0QOsIR%2Bw2n%2F3dM6gJP6oiGzPK8bOuVj20XrIYfdXMbi80m4ClgQPq0IseWOEe45FnO9KbLuWSk332SygCKS8dH%2BJdJ3HNL9yvwn0We11Bs2SoLjgoiAVizuWQ%3D%3D&param3=NwVEMR%2FzKcG52XsVBYEh2%2B7y7tP1R8GKaAIj3YL4xdcsiwgo%2BWEenOKOsmHPG3e8jIvYdjiny1tsf8Kj9W8%2BWlxz2G2CDKLjrAgrDuj%2F80aDj1%2BlX3f96wnQ2vw6i5%2BobvQdqHpM%2B5oK9V7KzQ3c%2F9Hm%2BMBVaFK7ELh37Ou4AhYAB03xoQ8hu8L0JoE%2BuEZXzqOO0qv1FkhOm5cAopUJXEQ7fqInKFX%2FzjWHn%2BsB%2BIBRubOh419AENjo4JkxnJbapBt%2BLZ6b%2FhewdYl5YlUKilrsF3ZPokOsZj%2FYJfZLM37RbUT9XE9N6HMLzFNp04DNXeL6VybWzbVvF0zYXeKRM1jeeSDDwQddAYHY5kxaiCrLGA4q4MCI6z4AqEZ2Lmswsey0lauogxrWIq%2BEDQhn7o5S7kAVpZrLl%2B8UX7Czilpi6LSG%2F7EUDKS5jnsgco77tob2gKvOQOB%2B7B5AYnb7sXv2uuUwWyPImhtGvmE3QcXv9iwXn75ZIW8HA8nKw0Y8aK4Roe5uymw3dBJVFxrJySl5fuigiOvEt0Oz%2FGseBhI%3D&param4=68T1ArA0cLrF%2FboU2XqSKL457KVaDWChmxwFAGC3MO0%3D&fr=yhs-iba-1&fr2=p%3As%2Cv%3Ai%2Cm%3Apivot#id=9&vid=fc7e3635954ed98e680a693773aa598e&action=view).  His “country lawyer” façade hid a mind of breathtaking sharpness and made me even more convinced that I had made the right choice to go to law school.

I remember a young John Dean, testifying that he told President Nixon and his two henchmen, Bob Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, that there was a “cancer on the presidency.”

I remember Alexander Butterfield, whose testimony drove the stake into the heart of the Nixon presidency: the existence of Oval Office tape recordings that proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Nixon was at the heart of a both a conspiracy and a coverup.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

I remember Judge John Sirica, who ruled that the tapes had to be turned over to the Committee, that there was no executive privilege that attached, and I remember the Burger Supreme Court that upheld unanimously Sirica’s decision. Convictions of a number of lawyers in the Nixon administration led to the almost instant institution of an ethics portion of the general bar exam, at least here in California.

Although Watergate grew out of a third-rate burglary, it gave rise to a constitutional crisis in a nation already racked by war, assassinations, racism, inflation, and other traumas. We have been living in an age of trauma ever since. Almost 50 years after Watergate, what and who will we remember from the House January 6 Committee hearings about the events of January 6, 2021?

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

# Difficult Do-Overs

Patent cases take a long time to resolve, especially where there is no easy pathway to settlement for nonmonetary considerations and a lot of damages in play. There is at least one prominent example we can look at, the long-running (since 2016!) dispute between Caltech and Broadcom/Apple. I first wrote about the case on these [pages](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/02/billion-dollar-bonanzas/) way back in February 2020, where I reported on the “huge [verdict](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2020/01/30/Jury-orders-Apple-chip-maker-to-pay-11B-for-violating-Caltech-patent/6981580387151/) in Caltech’s favor of over $1 billion, based on Apple and Broadcom’s infringement of five claims from three Caltech patents.” In that column, I focused on the outsized impact that large verdicts have on the entire patent ecosystem, particularly now, where many big-ticket patent litigations are being supported by third-party funding in some form. In fact, I predicted that Caltech’s verdict would “serve to increase the appetite for funders and firms to get behind university enforcement campaigns.” While there has definitely been an uptick on that front since I made that prediction, developments in the Caltech case itself are what I would like to focus on for purposes of this column.

In the immediate aftermath of Caltech’s verdict, there was little doubt that the Federal Circuit, absent a post-trial settlement, would have its say on some of the damages approaches adopted by the jury. In fact, I, and others, flagged the fact that the jury’s awarding of damages “against both Apple and Broadcom” could be considered “inconsistent with the hypothetical negotiation construct for patent cases and is incompatible with the idea of patent exhaustion.” I also pointed to the robust $1.40/unit royalty rate that Caltech had convinced the jury to award as ripe for reconsideration on appeal. An appeal that was decided earlier this year, as was [well-covered](https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2022/02/07/cafc-orders-new-trial-damages-clarifies-ipr-estoppel-rule-caltechs-appeal-1-billion-win-apple-broadcom/id=145429/) in the IP media. Billion-dollar patent verdicts are rare, but rarer still are billion-dollar patent verdicts that stand up on appeal.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
While the Federal Circuit’s [decision](https://cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions-orders/20-2222.OPINION.2-4-2022_1903268.pdf) was a wide-ranging one that hit on a number of important patent litigation issues — while also featuring a heavyweight oral argument between two of the leading IP appellate lawyers in Quinn’s Kathleen Sullivan and Wilmer’s Bill Lee — the key decision point for my purposes was the panel’s vacatur of the jury’s damages award. In particular, the panel found that the jury’s damages award was fatally flawed, since it rested on “Caltech’s two-tier damages theory” whereby “Broadcom and Apple would have been willing to engage in separate negotiations leading to vastly different royalty rates for the same chips.” That approach was deemed by the panel as “legally unsupportable” where there was no evidence “to suggest that Broadcom and Apple would have been willing to negotiate in this artificial way rather than to more conventionally negotiate a single license at a single rate for the same chips.” Put another way, patent owners must pick their (hypothetical) licensing counterparty and live with that choice — with no double-dipping up and down the supply chain, even if certain downstream sales are carved out, which Caltech did with respect to Broadcom’s sales to Apple as a Broadcom customer. Despite that effort, the Federal Circuit deemed it time for a do-over on damages.

The Federal Circuit’s mandate to the district court was issued in May of this year. Since then, the parties and the trial judge have had a series of scheduling conferences regarding the scope of expert discovery that will be allowed under remand, as well as with respect to the contours of the damages retrial called for by the Federal Circuit. As can be expected in a hotly contested case, there has also been some motion practice for the trial judge to sort through post-remand. In the latest decision, released late last week, Judge Wu of the Central District of California denied Apple and Broadcom’s pending motion to reopen discovery leading up to the damages retrial — even though the defendants contended that such discovery “might eliminate all pre-suit damages” at issue in the case. At bottom, Wu concluded that the defendants had not been diligent about pursuing discovery on the issue raised in the motion pretrial, which precluded them from pursuing their suggested post-trial discovery.

As the basis of their request, defendants sought discovery into sublicense rights granted to Intellectual Ventures, followed by a sublicense grant to Microsoft therefrom, based on an earlier license between Caltech and an entity called Cellular Elements. There was no dispute that Caltech had disclosed the license during the pretrial discovery phase. What defendants claimed, however, is that Caltech’s later licensing approach to Microsoft “tipped them off to a new potential marking defense” that would let them off the hook for presuit damages. Wu was not receptive to that suggestion, finding fault with the level of diligence shown by the defendants on the issue during the regular fact discovery period. As such, he denied the motion and ordered the parties to file a joint scheduling report this week setting forward how the case would progress to the damages retrial that he is charged with overseeing.

Ultimately, this case is a good reminder of just how complicated big-ticket patent litigation can be — and how even the biggest of cases morph over time. Even for parties with unlimited resources, it can be impossible to twist every discovery thread that presents itself, even as it relates to an issue as critical as damages. Part of the reason for that is structural, to the extent that damages issues in patent cases often develop more slowly than disputes on the merits with respect to infringement and validity. In practice, parties are often very reliant on their damages experts in terms of weighing how to approach damages discovery, which can make it difficult to weigh in real-time what fact discovery is most worthy of attention with respect to damages issues. Moreover, you can have a situation like the one here, where it was post-discovery behavior by Caltech, namely, raising infringement allegations against Microsoft, that gave rise to the need for more discovery into a previously disclosed license. As the defendants here learned, while damages discovery and raising winning damages discovery at trial can be tough, getting a full shot at a do-over can be even tougher. In even the biggest patent cases, demonstrating diligence is paramount, even when the case is on its second go-around for trial.

One of the many memorable scenes in Apocalypse Now involves helicopter gunmen sitting on their helmets to protect their groin from incoming fire. That’s a lesson this lawyer could have used to set his mind at ease.

As the sole JAG officer for a Naval Special Warfare (SEAL) unit in Afghanistan, I had to do a lot of traveling for my job as an attorney.

My most memorable trip occurred when I was ordered to be the legal support for a criminal investigation at a base far away from where I was stationed.

Paired with my colleague the investigator, another officer who was not an attorney, we spent hours waiting for a helicopter flight. Long after the sun had set over the mountains surrounding our base, we got the call that a bird was inbound.

Normally I was used to flying in Blackhawks around Afghanistan, but on this night we were greeted by a massive, twin-blade CH-47 Chinook. We had to lean forward as we walked across the gravel tarmac to fight against the backwash from the engines but once we made it on board, it was eerily still.

The huge main cabin had canvas and nylon benches along the walls with only 2 round bubble windows on each side. In the near-darkness, I could see only two other passengers who were seated across from us. From their appearance, they looked like Tier-1 operators. I was jealous because they were apparently allowed to grow beards.

We took off very quickly and as I got settled in, I had a chance to look around more. My colleague was strapped in, seated to my left. At the end of the bench stood two gunmen next to the cockpit entrance, one on each side of the helicopter. They manned what looked like M240 machine guns, swaying them from side to side as we zipped along in the darkness.

After about 10 minutes, my colleague started trying to yell something to me, but over the roar of the blades it sounded like gibberish. Something along the lines of “BEST LIAR!! THEY BEST LIAR!!!”

I shrugged at him and just laughed, leaning back in my straps as I started to feel drowsy. It was after midnight and it had been a long day.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Suddenly, without warning, to my left, I heard a sound: “THUMPTHUMPTHUMPTHUMP!!!”

The gunmen were firing away with their weapons, blasting at something below us. My immediate thought was, “HOLYFUCKINGSHIT,” repeatedly.

My heart was jackhammering and I could feel adrenaline racing through my body.

I know it sounds like a cliche, but it really is true, when you think you might be about to die, your life really does flash before your eyes. Or at least, mine did.

Once Reflection Time was over, I forced myself to breathe deliberately and calm down. I tried to access the situation. My primary weapon was an M4 with an effective range of about 300m. With my shooting skills and no scope at night, I dropped that down to about 100m. I figured we were flying at least 1000 feet off the ground. That meant that even under optimal conditions I was useless. So no ability to help with the fight.

My next thought was self-preservation. Considering where we were, an attack would come from below us.

And since my body armor offered no protection from the waist down…I freaked out.

I was going to potentially die from being shot in the dick??? Or my ass??

This was a nightmare scenario I’d never even contemplated during combat training or the numerous rocket attacks we’d faced back at my base.

For what seemed like an eternity, but was probably about 25 minutes, I kept trying to figure out how to protect my groin area from being shot. To take my mind off myself and my own problems I scanned the cabin. The operators were sound asleep.

But my colleague looked miserable. His face was all scrunched up in agony. Poor guy, I thought, he’s got a beautiful family back home that he must be realizing he could be abandoning tonight. I didn’t even have a girlfriend (got dumped during combat training) to miss me. For a few moments I forgot about my own fears and felt terrible for my buddy.

Eventually the gunmen stopped firing and miraculously we landed safely. There was movement all around us but me and my investigator just sat there strapped in our seats.

Finally, when the blades and the engine noise died down, I turned to the man who could have been the last person to ever speak to me in my life, and I asked him: “how the hell did THAT happen?!”

He laughed…oh, you liked the show? He asked me.

“What show??” I responded.

You know, the TEST FIRE! He yelled, laughing harder now. He explained that he’d tried to tell me this when we took off.

I looked at him incredulously. “But you looked even more miserable and freaked out than me?!”

“Oh, ya, I know,” he nodded in agreement. “I was sitting right under the damn heater for the whole cabin and my fucking nuts were on fire! It felt like someone was trying to shoot me in my ass!” He exclaimed.

What a coincidence.

Never Go Anywhere With David Boies

This one is a doozy involving legal giants David Boies, Randy Mastro and Bob Baron. This harrowing journey through a blizzard dates back to the Boies’s Cravath days and teaches us never to be the most junior associate at Cravath.

It was in the middle of winter and David and his associates had to attend a hearing somewhere on the West Coast. When the hearing concluded, they went to the airport and got on a plane back to NY. However, during the flight, the weather had worsened and closed down the NYC airports, so the flight was diverted to Hartford. So David instructed the first year associate to go rent a car in order to return to NYC (at Cravath, the junior most person always had to pay for everything). They all get into the car, but the associate driving (I don’t recall whether it was Bob or Randy), wasn’t driving fast enough (it was a blinding snowstorm at that point), so David tells them, “I’ll drive, I know how to drive in snow”. David then takes off speeding down the Merritt Parkway. Well, the snow got worse and worse. At one point, David loses control of the car, it goes into a spin and smacks its right side into a guardrail. Luckily, no one was hurt. They get out, inspect the damage, but note that the car is still drivable. David tells everyone, the car’s still drivable, let’s get back to New York. They drive for some distance, still in a horrible storm and David loses control of the car again. This time it is the left side of the car that is smashed so badly that the doors can’t open. Again, no one is badly injured. David climbs out the right side of the car. They go to the other side, inspect the damage, but note that the car is still drivable. David says, “We still need to get back to the office. Let’s go.” They climb back into the car, and this time they make it back to Manhattan driving more slowly (David had to drive slowly, one of the fenders was dragging and the engine was making a terrible noise). They pull up to One Chase Manhattan Plaza (Cravath’s home at the time), with the rental car smashed on both sides, one set of doors not working, the fender dragging on the pavement and engine wheezing. David climbs out of the car, turns to the first year associate, hands him the car keys, and says, “Great, we made it! Here, go turn in the rental car.” and walks into the office. As I said before, the rule at Cravath back then was junior most lawyer pays for everything.

Lawyers Are Blood-suckers

This guy seems to think he has a phobia of leeches. In reality we call that, “a perfectly rational response.”

I took a trip to Brisbane Australia in the early 90’s.

I ran across some friendly people who were going to build a chapel in a neighboring state (New South Wales). Jumping at a chance to visit another location in Australia, I agreed to help them move some building materials to their site in the woods.

The location was quite rustic – in the woods with no utilities. Arriving there after a recent rain, the fairly tall grass was wet and we worked together to load the materials from the vehicle to the site. While helping them, I felt something strange in my boots. On a break, I took off my boot(s) to discover leeches. I was somewhat upset and never before experienced leeches. They painlessly bite, but it is decidedly not painless removing them, leaving streaks of blood dripping down my calf(s).

I discovered the strange repulsive feeling that I had a phobia for this new experience and persuaded the group to leave as soon as possible to the pre-arranged lodging. I felt sorry, but was not expecting a phobia for leeches.

It’s Time For A New Job

I struggled with whether or not to include this one since it’s obviously fictitious, but it’s an entertaining romp so I figured, why not?

Over the years, my boss has taken me on several vacations to reward my hard work. Every one of these vacations resulted in personal calamity, ultimately leaving me disabled.  

It all started with Disney World. I had been reading a lot of Schopenhauer and embracing his philosophy, the whole idea that life is just a prison sentence. My boss believed that a trip to “The Most Magical Place On Earth” would somehow brighten my perspective on life and encourage greater productivity in the workplace. Although I had no interest in Mickey Mouse, I accepted her invitation. Besides, what could go wrong, I thought. After walking for hours through Magic Kingdom in the murderous heat, my boss said, “Enough of this shit. Let’s go see the real Florida.” “Okay, sure,” I said, and off we went, deep into the Everglades with “Captain Bucktooth” as our guide. We zigzagged on an airboat through miles of swampland and eventually came to rest next to a cluster of mangroves. The sun unleashed a deluge of gold into the water and everything seemed peaceful and harmonious. Birds chirped and insects droned in the nearby sawgrass. As I leaned over the edge of the airboat and dangled pieces of bread just over the surface of the water, feeding a swarm of fish, an alligator shot up and bit off several fingers from each of my hands. Captain Bucktooth raced back to land with such speed that the wind ripped off my tear-away athletic pants. My boss applied pressure to my open wounds with a towel and sang the lullabies that I had favored as a child.

Then came Japan, six months later. My boss had been desperately trying to get me out of the office. “You haven’t stepped outside since the alligator accident,” she’d remind me. She knew that I had grown fond of Pokémon and the idiosyncrasies of Japanese pop culture, and she used that against me. I finally succumbed to her incessant offers to visit Tokyo, although I must admit that I was secretly excited for the trip. The first several days were everything I wanted, but the frantic movements and sounds of the city, with its endless layers of lights and unapologetic bravado, became exhausting and made me crave isolation and calm. As my boss underwent colonic hydrotherapy at the hotel spa, I followed a trail into a forest adjacent to a rural town and sat against the base of a primordial tree where I listened quietly for any whispers of wisdom that the tree wished to impart. Just then, it opened its enormous mouth and said, “Run, you fool.” A loud buzz ripped through the silence and a cloud of Asian giant hornets engulfed me, each insect about the size of my thumb with a stinger that spanned a quarter of an inch. They preferred my face and probably would have crawled through my eyes and devoured my brain had I not ran like hell. Their venom contained a neurotoxin that dissolved large swaths of my skin. I wear a mask to this day.

We weren’t even supposed to visit Peru.

We weren’t even supposed to go there because a client had just requested that we oversee a complex cross-border transaction, but my boss insisted. “It will be good for you,” she claimed, “a needed break.” Before we went, I did some research and discovered that Peru was a hotbed of activity vis-à-vis the illegal organ trade. “Stop being so paranoid,” my boss said. “We’re going to stay at the Ritz Carlton. No one will steal your organs.” Of course, two days after we arrived, I suddenly experienced an intense and unbearable craving for macadamia nuts and took half a dozen or so wrong turns as I walked around in search of a grocery store. Then, I awoke in a bathtub full of ice in a dark room of an abandoned building. My captors were thoughtful enough to have stitched me back together after they removed one of my kidneys. I wandered naked in the streets until a nice man, who may or may not have been Jesus, drove me to the hospital. Eventually, my boss found me and my health improved enough to come back to the firm.  

Due to this chain of mutilating vacations, I developed a phobia of leaving my office, a phobia that plagues me to this day. I can’t step outside without collapsing and messing myself from fear. I spend most of my time working at my desk, surrounded by Schopenhauer books and Pokémon toys, lonely and friendless, with missing fingers, a missing kidney, and a distorted face that hides behind a hockey mask. On top of all that, I didn’t make partner this year.   

I’m really fucking regretting my decision to go to law school.

The Massage

I’ve edited this one for length, but the set up is that this is taken from an actual email sent by a lawyer in 2011, describing a massage in Bangladesh after a round of interviews.

For context, the author is a woman, so we’re not going into “happy ending” territory on this one, but it’s no less awkward.

I arrive at the health club at exactly 5 p.m.  The facility is of adequate quality.  There are a few treadmills, an exercise bike, and a room full of yoga mats.  The man at the desk directs me towards the back.   There is a narrow door labeled “massage room.”  The room is completely bare except for a clock on the wall, a massage table covered in towels (rather than a sheet), and  small table against the wall.  On the table are two bottles.  The first is Johnson’s Baby Oil.  The second is Imported Spanish Olive Oil.  I hear the man at the desk yelling for the masseuse.  After a few minutes of yelling back and forth, she arrives.  She is the stoutest person I have ever seen.  Her dimensions are approximately 4×4.  “4×4” (as I will call her) had very large hands, which made me hopeful for the massage despite my surroundings.  “4×4” walks in, closes the door, and locks it.  She looks at me and says, “Take off your clothes.”  I’m a little thrown-off by the door locking, but I take off my clothes as instructed.  She stands there as I undress, grunts her approval/disapproval of my physique, and then tells me to get on the table.  
 
There is no music.
There is no dimming of the lights.
It’s just me, “4×4”, and the selection of oils.
 
“4×4” drapes a towel over my top half, indicating that she will begin with the legs.  I am face down when the oiling begins.  “4×4” does not pour the oil in her hands to warm it up.  Instead, she holds the bottle over me and just pours it out.  The lack of a baby-fresh scent lets me know that she has chosen the spanish olive oil.  The massage is painful.  It’s as if “4×4” has no hands, only elbows and knuckles.  I wince and ask her to use less pressure.  She responds, “the pressure is fine.  relax.”  I attempt to relax.  Eventually my legs go numb with the pain.  Because “4×4” is so short, she has to stand on a small foot stool in order to massage my back.  I tell her about my shoulder, and she directs her elbows and knuckles to that area.  She keeps grunting, wiping her brow, and saying “whew.”  I wish she would take it easier on us both.
 
After about twenty minutes, she tells me to turn over.  I comply.  At this point things get weird.  The towel is moved to cover only my lower half.  There is pouring of oil.  And then she begins massaging my abdomen.  This is strange and uncomfortable.  I must have made a face, because she looks at me and says “good for digestion.”  After a few minutes, I start to black out because I’ve been sucking in my stomach and not breathing during this part of the massage.  Apparently I’m still concerned with what she thinks.   I give up and start breathing normally.   This was premature because after she finishes my stomach, she heades North.  I won’t go into further detail, but it was as awkward as you might imagine.
 
Finally, my 50 minutes are up.  Not surprisingly, “4×4” remains in the room while I put my clothes back on.  Before I leave, she looks at my sternly and says “don’t shower.  oil good for skin.”  I’m somewhat afraid that she will know if I shower too early, so I’m writing this email all oiled up.  I smell like tapas.

Thanks to everyone who sent in travel stories. We’ll keep this poll open until Friday, February 10 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern.

Thanks to the rise of mail-in ballots due to the pandemic, Election 2020 votes are still being counted. That being the case, Election Day has now turned into Election Week, and it may soon turn into Election Month thanks to the various lawsuits that have already been filed (and the lawsuits that are assuredly yet to be filed) by President Donald Trump’s campaign.

Trump has already claimed victory without securing the necessary electoral votes to do so, conspiracy theories peddled by Trump and his supporters about purported election fraud abound, Joe Biden’s voter turnout is ever increasing as the count continues, and the true winner of the election has yet to be declared. Sleepless nights waiting on results have given way to unproductive days and billable hours lost. This is getting exhausting, and one Biglaw firm thinks it’s found a way to lessen the burden that employees are facing in the run up to the final election results.

Sources tell us that Steve Humke, the chief managing partner of Am Law 200 firm Ice Miller, sent out a firmwide email yesterday afternoon about the state of not just the election, but the state of everyone’s feelings. “In a political contest with such different candidates, it’s inevitable that the outcome leaves many of us with strong feelings. Whether those are feelings of satisfaction, disappointment or uncertainty, it’s likely that those feelings will remain for some time,” he writes. This is what Humke has proposed as a way people can deal with all of their election-related feelings:

Some members of our Ice Miller team certainly feel the lack of resolution more acutely, viewing the future with doubt and even fear. It will take time to overcome the divisions that were exposed in this campaign. It is important to give each other the space to work through these feelings. In particular, before discussing election results with co-workers, consider whether they are ready to do so. And, remember to demonstrate respect both to those in conversation and those around you; speak from your own experiences (and not for others or any group); and give yourself and others the permission to avoid or leave any such conversation at any time, without guilt or attribution. So, please reach out and support each other.

(Flip to the next page to read the email in full.)

One of our sources likened this plan to a form of “election don’t ask, don’t tell.” But really, it seems like it’s just a way to remain civil with others at work and express care for those who need it right now. Just because the election is almost over doesn’t mean that political strife will immediately stop — if anything, things are only going to get worse for a time. Ice Miller is giving its employees an avenue to express their beliefs and work through their feelings, if they so choose, and that’s not a bad thing.

Perhaps the better question to be asked here is why an email like this needed to be sent out in the first place. This election is bigger than your own ego. Be kind.

# $180,000 For First-Years, ??? For Everyone Else

The new trend for firms late to the associate compensation game seems to be raising first-year salaries to the much vaunted $180,000, and leaving the experienced associates holding an empty bag.

Yesterday evening, Kilpatrick Townsend announced they are raising the firm’s starting salary to $180,000 for associates in their California, Denver, New York City, and Washington, D.C. offices. (First-years in Atlanta will be at $155,000 or $160,000 depending on practice area.)

More experienced associates, “will also receive salary adjustments depending on the location, experience level and performance of the associate will also receive salary adjustments depending on the location, experience level and performance of the associate.” Which is pretty much just a giant question mark and a prayer that the firm won’t actually screw them. At least the raises are effective today, which is nice.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
UPDATE 12:40pm: Apparently associates at KTS have even more reasons to be annoyed:

You’re missing the fact that NC, Seattle, and Dallas got completely screwed as they are receiving no raises…

Seattle and NC (which has 3 offices) are at 135 for non patent and 160 for patent… So a 3rd year associate in NC/Seattle is making less than a first year in Atlanta.

Even Alston bumped all non patent to 155 which seems like who KTS was trying to mimic.

So patent attorneys got screwed but are only 20k under (which is ridiculous since the firm has traditionally awarded patent attorneys), non patent in NC/Seattle has virtually no reason to stick around as they are making a solid 50k under market and senior associates (where raises are happening at all) are left with questions…even though they supposedly got a raise staring today.

We are covering this story as market conditions develop, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

(Read the firm’s full email on the next page.)

# Ropes Raids Continue
## A month of partner defections at Ropes & Gray continues with two more Boston laterals.

Ropes & Gray is reeling from partner defections galore and the big winner might be Kirkland & Ellis.

In March, Ropes announced that it was [spinning off around 100 lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/ropes-gray-splitting-with-around-100-lawyers-and-staffers/) into a new firm handling its patent prosecution work. While wrapped in the usual vagaries, the move was likely brought on by the fact that patent prosecution doesn’t bring in the margins needed to support Biglaw overhead.

Since then, there’s been something of a feeding frenzy on poor Ropes & Gray. The London office [lost two partners this month](http://www.legalweek.com/sites/legalweek/2017/06/06/ropes-london-finance-duo-leave-for-king-spalding/). Last week, another in New York [left for Foley & Lardner](http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/id=1202790327451/On-the-Move). And now, Am Law Daily reports that Goodwin Procter and Kirkland & Ellis nabbed a partner each from Ropes this week:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Jason Serlenga, a private equity expert who made partner at Ropes & Gray on Nov. 1, 2015, is poised to join Kirkland’s new office in Boston’s Back Bay neighborhood. Marc Lazar, co-head of Ropes & Gray’s real estate investments and transactions group, has joined Goodwin Procter’s real estate industry group as a partner in the city.

The loss of Serlenga may be another blow in the battle between Ropes and Kirkland for Bain Capital’s big bucks. While Bain’s long been a Ropes client, Kirkland has muscled in on some high-profile deals already this year and adding a partner who worked on Bain deals for Ropes is another shot in the arm for Kirkland.

While all these defections right in a row certainly aren’t welcome news for Ropes & Gray, let’s not jump to conclusions about the long-term health of the firm. It’s way too early to… ugh… throw them a rope.

# Biglaw Partner Learns The Hard Way: Don't Talk Smack About Your Firm's Clients

Welp, this was a hell of an oopsie moment. In one sense, it is nice to see that even Biglaw partners have them — and in very public ways. But that’s cold comfort to the client who found themselves high and dry after a partner screwed up.

Here are the details: Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman partner [Todd Canni ](https://www.pillsburylaw.com/en/lawyers/todd-canni.html)represents Continental Service Group, which lost its bid for a contract with the federal government to collect overdue student loans. Canni was upset that his client missed out on the opportunity to harass deadbeats to Performant Financial Corp. (who has ties to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos), so he gave this statement [to the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2018/01/11/education-dept-awards-debt-collection-contract-to-company-with-ties-to-devos/):

“Given the fact that Performant was not a highly rated [company] and, in fact, was rated fairly low … the agency will be under intense scrutiny and will need to explain how suddenly these ratings changed so significantly to allow Performant to leap frog over so many other qualified [companies].”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
There was just one teeny tiny problem with Canni’s statement: Performant is also a Pillsbury client.

D’oh.



In federal claims court, Performant contested Pillsbury’s ongoing representation of Continental Service Group in their challenge to the Education Department’s contract award due to the conflict of interest the dual representation presents. Federal Claims Judge Thomas C. Wheeler [agreed with Performant](https://ecf.cofc.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2018cv0204-163-0), disqualifying Pillsbury from repping Continental Service:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“The court is of the opinion that Pillsbury is not permitted to continue such representation due to the troubling course of events—and their resulting consequences—that took place throughout this bid protest.”

And whether or not Canni was aware of the other Pillsbury client was irrelevant to the judge’s decision:

“Regardless of whether Mr. Canni was aware of Pillsbury’s conflict of interest at the time he made his disparaging comments about Performant, his comments have created a breach of the duty of loyalty that cannot be cured,” Wheeler wrote. “By speaking ill of Performant—a contemporaneous Pillsbury client—to the Washington Post, Mr. Canni has created a situation where he has stunted Pillsbury’s ability to effectively and zealously advocate on ConServe’s behalf.”

As[ reported by Law.com](https://www.law.com/2018/04/02/pillsbury-partners-disparaging-remarks-about-firms-client-breached-loyalty-judge-says/), Pillsbury argued it performed a conflict check once Performant was awarded the Education Department’s contract — deemed a “corrective action” by the agency. But Performant’s 2012 name change meant the conflict was not tripped by their system:

After Performant moved to disqualify Pillsbury from the case, the firm said that it had, in fact, run an updated conflicts check following the Education Department’s “corrective action” in January. That check returned a “NO CONFLICT” result because Performant had previously gone by “Diversified Collection Services Inc.” and the system had not been updated with the company’s new name.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The real twist of irony is that Pillsbury is the very firm that advised Performant about the name change — a fact that was not lost on Judge Wheeler:

“The court understands that conflict systems are not perfect, but the irony here is that Pillsbury was the very law firm that advised Performant on its name change in 2012,” Wheeler wrote. “At the very least, Pillsbury should have either updated its conflicts system in 2012 to reflect the name change or run an additional conflicts search for ‘Diversified Collection Services Inc.’ knowing that the name change had taken place.”

Wheeler continued: “To claim that Pillsbury should be in the clear because it received a ‘NO CONFLICT’ result simply does not hold water, especially given Pillsbury’s knowledge of and advisement on Performant’s name change.”

Let this be a lesson to all lawyers out there — before you go to the press to talk sh*t about a company, make sure that company isn’t on the firm’s Christmas card list.

# Latham & Watkins Fighting To Stay On Aunt Becky's Case Amid Conflicts Concerns

The Varsity Blues scandal has already [sunk a Biglaw managing partner](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/willkie-farr-ditches-gordon-caplan-nabbed-in-varsity-blues-scandal/) and may end up sinking a whole law firm’s role in the case based on the most recent flurry of documents in the Lori Loughlin and Mossimo Giannulli criminal case.

When you have [over 2500 attorneys](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/yet-another-biglaw-firm-ranking-for-those-that-like-to-count/), there’s bound to be a conflict or two. That’s what prosecutors claim is afoot with [Latham & Watkins](https://www.lw.com), which are representing Loughlin and Giannulli in their admissions bribery case.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
At issue are reports that USC, the school where little Aunt Becky got in, then allegedly, illicitly, and promptly declared that she wasn’t going to go to class, is threatening to sue Loughlin and Giannulli for undermining their academic reputation. Entirely unrelated, USC has tried [and failed](https://www.latimes.com/sports/usc/la-sp-usc-assistant-football-resign-ncaa-violations-20190701-story.html) to make it a whole 24 hours without sticking its reputation into the business end of a meat grinder.

Regardless of whether or not USC had a reputation to compromise, the threat of a lawsuit has got prosecutors on the move because Latham & Watkins has also represented USC and [the government smells a potential conflict](https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900077838/lori-loughlin-mossimo-giannulli-usc-lawsuit-college-admissions-scandal.html).

Latham, for its part, [doesn’t see a problem](https://theblast.com/c/lori-loughlin-mossimo-giannulli-criminal-charges-baseless):

They argue, “USC is not a party to this case, and its status as an alleged victim does not automatically trigger a conflict of interest requiring Latham’s withdrawal. Latham will avoid any direct adversity with USC by relying on co-counsel to handle any cross-examination of USC witnesses and any restitution proceeding in which USC’s financial interests are directly at stake.”

That’s all well and good, but is Latham really able to do its best work if it can’t cross-examine the USC witnesses? Presumably that’s going to be some key testimony.

For now, everyone on the defense side is comfortable with this arrangement. But if USC files suit or some USC witness testimony takes a weird turn, things could get messier than a Varsity Blues kid’s SAT math section.

The Biglaw austerity measures are slowly making the way up the chain to the top of the Biglaw landscape. We’ve [now](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/norton-rose-fulbright-lays-off-associates-cuts-salaries-amid-covid-19-upheaval/) seen [multiple](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/reed-smith-salary-cuts/) firms [that make](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/baker-mckenzie-salary-cuts/) a [billion dollars+](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/even-a-billion-dollars-in-revenue-cant-stop-covid-19-layoffs/) in gross revenue implement cost-cutting moves. The latest Biglaw firm in the [billion-dollar club](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/09/biglaws-billion-dollar-club-keeps-growing) to announce salary cuts in K&L Gates, the firm that is 37 on the Am Law 200 ranking with $1,007,615,000 in 2018 gross revenue.

So what is happening at K&L Gates? Equity partners are taking a 20 percent reduction in scheduled advances and firm leaders are taking even larger reductions. Income partners, associates, and allied professionals/staff are taking a 15 percent reduction in their salary provided they don’t go below a $75,000 floor (with some regional variations). As the firmwide email notes ([available on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/k-l-gates-cuts/2/)), “All personnel will be considered for discretionary bonuses for extraordinary performances or contributions, as many are working very hard through this period.”

# Law Firms Need To Stop Suing Associates For Not Hitting Their Billable Hours
## It's up to the firm to help associates succeed, and these lawsuits are really missing the mark.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

It is a partner’s job to bring in work. It is an associate’s job to do the level of work appropriate to their class year. It is extremely atypical for associates’ performance issues to be addressed via litigation.

There are two main reasons that an associate doesn’t have enough work to do: (1) they are being frozen out and should be looking for another job or (2) client demand is down. The latter is the more prevalent scenario by a mile. And nothing about it is on the associate to rectify.

— [Kate Reder Sheikh](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/kate-reder-sheikh?byconsultantorauthor=kate-reder-sheikh), a partner in the Associate Practice Group at Major, Lindsey & Africa, in a recent [op-ed published by Law.com](https://www.law.com/2023/10/24/when-demand-slows-its-on-law-firms-to-ensure-their-associates-succeed/), concerning the recent trend of law firms filing suit against former associates to recoup losses sustained for [falling short on billable hours](https://www.law.com/2023/10/13/law-com-litigation-trendspotter-lawsuits-target-associates-for-not-being-partners/).

# Silver Circle Firm Enters The Bonus Game, But Special Bonuses Seem To Be Missing
## Unfortunately, this is a Baker McKenzie match, not a Cravath match.

Biglaw bonus season is getting into full swing, and even Magic Circle firms with U.S. offices have gotten on board. Thus far, [Clifford Chance](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/magic-circle-firm-hands-out-bonuses-to-make-thanksgiving-truly-magical/) and [Freshfields](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/freshfields-holiday-bonuses/) have announced market year-end bonuses for their associates, and both firms have announced that they’d also be offering associates the prevailing special bonus rate of up to $40,000 on top of their regular bonuses. Allen & Overy and Linklaters have yet to enter the bonus scene, but a [Silver Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Circle_(law_firms)) firm has decided to step into the bonus frenzy in their absence.

Ashurst, a global firm with 27 offices in 15 countries and about 1,600 lawyers, has matched the [Baker McKenzie bonus scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/) for its U.S. associates. Why aren’t we calling this a Cravath match? Because just like Baker, Ashurst isn’t including any special bonuses with its year-end bonuses (yet). Here’s the bonus scale for U.S. associates:

Don’t get too excited about the firm’s relatively low billable hours requirement of 1900 hours. That’s what’s required for associates to receive just a fraction of this year’s bonus pool. Check out Ashurst’s tiered hours requirements for bonus eligibility:



Sources say the firm hasn’t offered any extraordinary performance bonuses for those who have billed more than 2200 hours, and they’re unsure if the firm will offer the special bonuses that have been matched by Clifford Chance and Freshfields.

Congratulations to Ashurst associates on their year-end bonus haul if they’ve billed enough to get it in full. Hopefully the firm will borrow some magic from its U.K. Biglaw brethren to summon those special bonus bucks.

Earlier this month, with worries about the COVID-19 pandemic increasing as law schools closed their doors and law firms employed remote workforces, we wondered if this year’s [summer associate programs would go forward](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/could-coronavirus-play-a-hand-in-biglaw-firms-canceling-summer-associate-programs/) as regularly scheduled. Would the upcoming summer programs possibly be postponed or canceled outright?

At the time, some seemed confident that everything would be “just fine,” but now that some areas of the country are in lockdown mode, others seem to be having changes of heart. Rather than doing away with programs completely, delayed start dates and even remote work now seem like they could be real possibilities.

“Many firms we advise are now talking about the possibility of pushing back their start dates,” said Zeughauser Group consultant Kent Zimmermann. “All plan to hire some associates out of their summer classes. They don’t want to get behind on their talent pipeline or taint their firms in the minds of law school leaders and students, which happened to some firms after 08.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Firms like Boies Schiller, Caplin & Drysdale, Covington & Burling, Fried Frank, and Paul Weiss are planning to go forward with their summer programs — with some keeping remote work at top of mind. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2020/03/26/some-firms-press-on-with-summers-while-others-wait-and-see/) has additional details:

For Nick Gravante and Natasha Harrison, managing partners at Boies Schiller Flexner, the decision to keep the firm’s summer associate program was a quick one. … “If we have to work at home because that’s where lawyers are working when summer associates start arriving in mid-May, then we will incorporate the summers into our work-from-home routine.” …

At Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, chairman Brad Karp said Thursday that the firm still hadn’t decided whether to change its summer associate program. But he noted that delaying summer associate programs beyond their usual mid-May starting point could dovetail with the decision by most law schools to delay their on-campus interviews from about August 2020 until early 2021, freeing up students later in the summer.

Still other firms haven’t quite decided what they’ll be doing with their summer programs, which is worrisome for law students who thought their career plans were all set. Nathan Peart, a managing director at recruiting firm Major, Lindsey & Africa’s associate practice group, said, “In the next two weeks, I think that’s when we’ll get more clarity on these things.”

While we genuinely hope that things will work out, things could indeed look different in a few weeks if people don’t stay in their homes and practice proper social distancing procedures. Please stay inside and wash your hands so we can work to contain the coronavirus and stop the legal market from being driven further into chaos.

[For some reason](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/anthony-kennedy-is-retiring/), Biglaw raises that dropped yesterday afternoon didn’t receive the immediate Above the Law attention that they normally would. Weird.

Anyway, lost in that shuffle, are these raises out of Paul Hastings, matching the market across the United States. That includes offices in their Los Angeles headquarters, as well as New York, D.C., Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, San Diego, San Francisco, Palo Alto, Century City, and Orange County.

The memo from the firm’s Global Talent Development co-chairs [Teri O’Brien](http://www.paulhastings.com/professionals/details/teriobrien) and [Melanie Rupert](http://www.paulhastings.com/professionals/details/melanierupert) also outlines summer bonuses in line with the rest of the top of the market, to be distributed to attorneys who’ve met their annualized billable hours targets, with an opportunity to catch up by the end of the year.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The list of firms that haven’t moved remains longer than one would expect for such a modest raise, but with this move, that list is getting shorter all the time.

As is the list of reasons why an associate wouldn’t take the first opportunity to move to a market with a cheaper cost of living.

(Check out the memo on the next page.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Biglaw Firm With Billable Hours Bonus Eligibility Requirement Refuses To Comment On Billable Hours Bonus Eligibility Requirement
## Do you have to record 2300 billable hours to be eligible for full Cravath bonuses at this firm or not?

When reached for comment, representatives of Norton Rose, which absorbed New York-based Chadbourne & Parke earlier this year, referred to “inaccuracies” in the [Above the Law report](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/this-firm-wont-give-you-anywhere-near-a-full-bonus-if-you-dont-meet-your-hours-requirements/) but did not name specific errors. The firm did not respond when asked whether associates must record 2,300 billable hours to be eligible for the market bonuses.

— An excerpt from an article written by Christine Simmons of the American Lawyer, focusing on the [“billable hours catch”](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/newyorklawjournal/2017/11/29/bonuses-come-with-billable-hours-catch-at-some-law-firms/) that’s shrinking bonus payouts at some law firms.

# The Need To Succeed
## Succession planning is a task that many, if not all, leaders find joyless but necessary.

We all worry about failing: failing our clients, our employers, our employees, our friends, our families, and, of course, bringing up the rear, ourselves. But most of us are lucky enough that our failures are not splashed all over the news, social media, or whatever other source. In most cases, our failures are pretty much private, limited to only a few people on a need-to-know basis. So, imagine what it must be like when a failure is public, and not just a little failure, but a jumbo-sized one. One of the most recent and public ones being the sacking of Disney CEO Bob Chapek and replacing him with the former CEO, Bob Iger.

The print edition headline in the Wall Street Journal story said it best: “Bob Iger is back to fix his big failure at Disney.” He’s going to [have to hustle to develop a successor](https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/20/media/disney-bob-iger-ceo/index.html) to lead the company as the board of directors gave him two years, not a long time, given the years he spent as Disney CEO and had road tested possible successors. Iger had recommended Chapek and the board concurred.

Succession planning is a task that many, if not all, leaders find joyless but necessary. There’s competition, jockeying, and figuring out whether to promote from within or look for fresh talent outside the firm or organization. There’s no right answer. Many staff feel that hiring from within signals confidence in the current organization and those who are capable to lead it. Collateral damage from that approach is that many talented people who are passed over take a hike and go elsewhere. Other staff feels that hiring from within is “same old, same old,” and that the organization needs fresh ideas and new leadership, regardless of how painful the transitions may be. Chapek was essentially a Disney “lifer,” and his time as CEO was short-lived, due, at least in part, to his purported mishandling of several highly visible situations.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
So, what’s a law firm or in-house general counsel to do? How to approach succession planning? What’s the best way to ensure both a smooth transition and that those who remain continue to feel that they matter?

What are some of [the obstacles to succession planning](https://www.attorneyatwork.com/law-firm-succession-plan/)? How to avoid the ostrich in the sand approach? Think about these:

The first is fear. It can be tricky (and a potential legal issue, e.g., the Age Discrimination in Employment Act) when you ask senior lawyers about retirement plans. No one likes to think that they are getting too old to practice, but the question should be asked. It’s impossible to plan otherwise. No surprises, please, especially departure surprises with the client’s book of business trailing behind. Who starts that conversation and when?

Next: “too busy to plan.” If succession planning interferes with billable hours, do you think that anyone will be willing to take the time out from busy practices to do what needs to be done? That’s why it’s important to take the nonbillable time to do just that. The job of a leadership team (“there’s no ‘I’ in team”) is to lead.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
A corollary to “too busy to plan” is “too selfish to plan.” It’s “all about me,” and so being involved in discussions about what may be best going forward is not something some partners care anything about. And if they don’t like the succession plan, they’ll leave. So much for firm loyalty. (Is that now an oxymoron?)

Focus on client needs and expectations. Who best can lead the firm or the in-house department going forward while servicing current needs and anticipating future ones?

If it’s too hard to say the words “succession planning,” would it make sense to include it as part of strategic planning? Everyone, whether in a firm or in-house, has a personal stake in that.

Using outside consultants? Opinions vary widely. While some think that consultants walk on water, others could cheerfully drown them all. The point is to start thinking about all of this now. The last thing anyone wants is to fill a gaping hole in leadership prompted by an untimely diagnosis or death. Then what?

And now here’s an epic leadership fail. Samuel Bankman-Fried, aka SBF, he of the apology road tour, is now officially in his world of hurt as he sits in a Bahamian jail, facing a criminal indictment from the US Attorney’s Office in New York’s Southern District charging him with [multiple criminal counts](https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/ftx-sam-bankman-fried). How many lawyers previously suggested that he stifle himself? He couldn’t do it. SBF may well be this decade’s poster boy for Ponzi schemes, although the decade has just begun.

One lesson that a criminal procedure class teaches is that a confession is not sufficient to prove the elements of the crime. The cop-out can only be used to prove identification, the “I did it” moment that everyone used to wait for on television. SBF has apologized for what happened, although he didn’t say he knew what happened. What kind of defense(s) will he use? The “just a kid taken advantage of by others” probably won’t play. [FTX is probably only the first](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/gibson-dunn-plays-too-big-to-fail-argument-for-their-crypto-client/) of the cryptocurrency dominoes to fall. They won’t be too big to fail.
