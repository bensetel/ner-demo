# Lawyers Sometimes Cannot Trust Other Attorneys To Complete Legal Tasks
## Lawyers, like everyone else, sometimes do not take the same ownership over cases that might not be their own.

If you want something done right, do it yourself. So goes the old saying. It is of course sometimes difficult for people to trust that other people will complete tasks to the same standard that they themselves would. Attorneys, in particular, often need to rely on other lawyers when they work in the same firm or if they serve the same client while working at different shops. Nevertheless, lawyers should be wary of trusting other attorneys, and they should double check the work of pretty much every lawyer they work with on a project.

Numerous times in my career, I wanted to rely on the work of another lawyer, and I suffered negative consequences. For instance, earlier in my career, I was local counsel for a client that was based in another part of the country. This client’s work was handled by outside counsel that was located close to where the client was headquartered. I figured that since the client’s regular outside counsel did tons of work for the client, they would know best how to manage that client’s legal affairs.

Right before I filed papers for the client, I decided on a lark to go through corporate records to see if the client was being named appropriately in the papers. To my surprise, the phrasing that was used by the client’s normal outside counsel was wrong. Indeed, the exact naming of the client was incorrect! Perhaps more importantly, how this other counsel was describing the client as a successor in interest was not correct. Maybe in other jurisdictions this would have been fine, but in a jurisdiction in which I practice, naming the client incorrectly would have been a big deal and could have led to technical issues down the road.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Sometimes, lawyers cannot rely on other counsel because things are just different in various areas of the country, and local counsel needs to be vigilant about the papers. For instance, one time, I was handling a case as local counsel for a firm that was based in a different area of the country. The local counsel told me that they would draft a motion and have it ready for me in a neatly tied bow. I was very excited about this since I was busy and could use the help from this counsel in completing tasks for our mutual client.

Far too close to the deadline, I first opened the document containing the motion and realized that it would need a ton of work. Some of the issues seemingly related to how things differed from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but other issues were caused by simple sloppiness. I incorrectly thought that I could rely on these other lawyers more than I could, and I needed to spend an incredible amount of time under pressure to get the work done on time.

Sometimes, you cannot even trust lawyers who work at the same firm as you. Lawyers, like everyone else, do not take the same ownership over cases that might not be their own, or attorneys just might not be as focused as you to care about a given legal matter. For instance, one time, another associate at a firm I was working at went to a court conference for one of my cases since I had a conflict and the court conference was going to be a pretty basic appearance. The matter was stayed for years due to a bankruptcy, so at every prior conference, the parties would just say that the case was stayed, and the conference would be over. The associate told me when she returned to the office that the case was stayed due to a bankruptcy, which is what I expected would occur at the conference. I then conveyed to the client that the case was still stayed and that there likely would not be work on this matter for a while.

However, I learned weeks later that the case was not stayed anymore, and this was conveyed at the conference. Apparently, the associate who attended the court conference just checked in with the clerk, saw that the case was still stayed, and then the associate left. The associate did not stay at the conference long enough to see the other attorneys on the case and learn about any updates on the matter. Accordingly, I had to tell the client that the case had not been stayed, which caused some tension between the client and our firm. If I had called one of the attorneys on the case rather than rely on the associate who went to the court conference for me, I might have avoided some issues.

All told, there are certain situations in which you can trust other lawyers to complete legal tasks to your satisfaction. But for a variety of reasons, attorneys should not always trust other lawyers and should double check another lawyer’s work.

# Are You In Or Out? Deciding If The Time Is Right To Go In-House
## Look before you leap!

Are you an associate at a crossroads in your legal career at a law firm — and contemplating going in-house?

You’re not alone. We’ve talked to countless associates who want a change of scenery but aren’t sure in which direction to head. They may be tired of the long law firm hours and desire more of a work-life balance. Or they may want more opportunities to work one-on-one with clients on big matters — instead of feeling like just another cog in the wheel.

Here’s the thing: Although some think it’s the utopia of the legal field, the in-house setting may not be the answer.  Firstly, this move will not necessarily remedy what’s ailing you now at your current firm. What’s more, when you switch too early in your career, you could be setting yourself up for difficulties down the road.

Rather, finding the right law firm and building your portfolio in private practice for a few more years can set you up for greater longevity at an in-house career should you choose to take that path eventually.

The Grass Isn’t Always Greener

When considering an in-house move, it’s imperative to understand what this role entails and if it’s truly for you. Undoubtedly, a great in-house position can offer greater responsibility, easier prioritization of projects, and a break from billable hour quotas. There’s no pressure to be a rainmaker and no need to juggle a multitude of (external) clients with different personalities and competing demands.

However, there are other challenges and considerations when pondering the move in-house:

- You’ll more than likely make less money — for the same amount of effort. Few attorneys who leave their law firms make more as in-house counsel. How will you feel when you’re working just as hard as you were at your firm, but making far less?
- In-house lawyers tend to be more vulnerable. In a firm, lawyers are what make the business go ‘round; they are its lifeblood. Conversely, in-house legal departments are there to provide support — not generate revenue. As a result, your department may be the first to face layoffs if the company hits hard times — or worse, goes out of business. Working in-house could potentially put you in an unstable career situation.
- You’ll face new, different pressures. Law firms tend to strive for perfection in all that they do, and they take the time to get it right. But in a corporate environment, faster turnarounds are the norm. You’re expected to come up with great advice quickly. Consider whether you thrive under tight timeframes — or if you buckle under pressure.
- You might get bored. A firm may have 20 different clients, giving you the opportunity to constantly switch gears and keep your workload interesting. As an in-house counsel, you only have one client: your employer. The sameness of daily tasks can be off-putting and demotivating for some.
- The hours aren’t as predictable or flexible as you think. Many delve into the corporate legal environment expecting a consistent 9 to 5 schedule, with the flexibility to leave early for doctor’s appointments and baseball games. However, “face time” can be a real requirement and leaving for personal matters often necessitates documenting time off. Also, a company’s needs can be unpredictable and last-minute projects that involve late nights and weekends are not unusual. What’s more, if the company is a large multinational — or in crisis — you could be expected to travel at the drop of a hat.
No Turning Back

There’s another more compelling reason to reconsider going in-house as an associate, one that trumps everything discussed above: Becoming an in-house counsel before you have solid law firm experience under your belt (at least four to five years) could make it virtually impossible for you to ever return to a firm position again.

Here’s the reason why: Your first few years at a firm are geared toward making you an excellent attorney. You’re expected to hit the ground running within a certain practice group and continue cultivating a specialty. Over time, you gain increased responsibility, develop more relationships and even acquire managerial skills that allow you to oversee younger attorneys and legal staff. You also build prowess in handling myriad clients and scenarios.

In a corporate environment, it’s probable that you’ll be developing more of a generalist skillset — you’ll become an attorney who knows something about everything but is an expert in nothing. Keep in mind that a broad set of skills won’t bode too well if you’re ever trying to market yourself to a law firm again. Going for an in-house role causes you to prematurely veer off the law firm growth and development track. If you decide to go back to the firm environment, the skills you had acquired in an in-house position are not likely to align with the demands of the new firm. It’s a much better strategy to wait until you’ve hit the “ceiling” at a firm and cannot progress any further in your career. With more experience under your belt and — even better — partner status, you could more easily transition into a more lucrative role at a company.

Look Before Your Leap

If an in-house gig is on your future radar, there are things you can do now to prepare yourself for a successful transition while you remain in the law firm setting:

- Start focusing on business development for your firm. Relationships are key in the legal field; leveraging the connections you’ve cultivated over time cannot only reflect well and potentially produce business at your firm, it can give you a solid “in” to a company once you’re ready to move in-house.
- Work on honing your emotional intelligence (EQ) skills through coaching. EQ is more essential in a corporate environment where you will be engaging in meetings and team building and interacting with department members and stakeholders.
- Talk to recruiters as well as to peers who are working as lawyers in different environments. Not all firms are created equal. Do your research and find one that speaks to who you are as an attorney and as an individual.
Don’t be quick to assume that all lawyers in-house are deliriously happy while firm lawyers are suffering miserably. From culture to how matters are staffed, there are many factors that go into a work environment, regardless of whether it’s a firm or a company. And the fact is there are many law firms out there that could remedy the pains you’re feeling at your current firm without necessitating a move to the corporate setting. What matters most is finding an organization that’s a good fit for your interests, strengths, and personality, along with work that you love.

# Biglaw Firm Kicks Off Holiday Weekend With Raises For Associates
## Exciting news, but is this a full Cravath match?

The Biglaw raise race began way back in January, and almost six months later, some firms are first making their own salary announcements. It might have taken a while longer for this firm to get with the program but at least they know how to start a holiday weekend off on the right foot.

Yesterday afternoon, BakerHostetler — a firm that was ranked at No. 59 in the Am Law 100, after bringing in $836,048,000 gross revenue in 2021 — informed associates that starting salaries would be increased across all markets, effective July 1 on a go-forward basis. Here’s an excerpt from the memo that was sent by firm chairman [Paul M. Schmidt](https://www.bakerlaw.com/PaulMSchmidt) (available in full on the next page):

Annual starting salaries in our major markets will increase to $215,000 consistent with the associate starting salaries adopted recently by many Am Law 100 firms and our peer firms. Associate starting salaries in our other markets will increase to $200,000. Further information about these and other salary adjustments will be sent by your Office Managing Partner or Partner-In-Charge in the coming days.

We’ll note here that BakerHostetler is one of the only Biglaw firms that hasn’t provided a full lockstep salary table for associates in its announcement. For the time being, we’ll have to assume that all other class years at the firm will be receiving commensurate raises, but cannot yet affirmatively state that this is a full Cravath match.

Will salaries at the firm go up to $415,000 in its major market offices? Hopefully associates will find out soon. Congratulations, and just remember: any raise is better than no raise!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from BakerHostetler.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

Marc Kasowitz (Photo by Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images)

Marc Kasowitz has not struggled with alcoholism. He has not come into the office intoxicated, attorneys have not had to go across the street to the restaurant during the workday to consult Kasowitz on work matters, as he held court, drinking and eating, as the story reports our responding, he never had a drink during the day at the Palm outside of lunch and dinner and never handled firm business while at the restaurant.

[M]uch of what they [ProPublica] reported is false and defamatory.

# A $700 Million Loss Puts A Law Firm On The Ropes

The bigger they are, the harder they fall.

If you go to as many panel discussions about the future of law as we do, you’ve heard countless times about [Slater & Gordon](https://www.slatergordon.com.au/homepage). This giant Australian law firm, with [more than 2,500 employees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slater_and_Gordon_Lawyers), generates tons of buzz due to its status as the world’s first publicly traded law firm. In light of regulatory developments in different jurisdictions that are loosening up the rules against non-lawyers owning law firms, industry observers have looked to Slater & Gordon as a model for the law firm of tomorrow.

For a time, while it enjoyed growing revenue and a surging stock price, Slater & Gordon was a great success story. But now the biggest firm Down Under is in danger of going under, as reported by the [ABA Journal](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/slater_and_gordon_could_be_on_the_brink_after_reporting_huge_losses_in_the_):

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)

The first law firm to go public may be on the verge of collapse after reporting a loss of nearly $700 million during the second half of 2015….

Australia-based firm Slater and Gordon must present a plan to several banks in Australia by the end of April; otherwise the firm could face a deadline as early as March 2017 to repay its debt. John Skippen, Slater and Gordon’s chairman, apologized to shareholders during an earnings call to go over the firm’s financial performance. Skippen also revealed that he and chief executive Andrew Grech both considered resigning, but opted against it, citing a need for stability.

Why is this huge firm in such huge trouble? Being a public company meant access to more capital, which meant more… opportunity to waste capital on ill-fated acquisitions:

According to the [Herald Sun](http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/law-firm-slater-and-gordon-on-the-ropes/news-story/3492001731f1783ee7586872b5eac3de), the firm’s financial woes are serious. In December, the firm took a AU$876.4 million (approximately $676 million) write-down during the second half of 2015 with the vast majority of it being related to a slowdown in business in the United Kingdom. This was in stark contrast with the second half of 2014, when the firm reported an AU$49.3 million profit. A major part of the firm’s problems stem from its April 2015 [purchase of U.K.-based insurance claims processor Quindell’s legal services arm](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/slater_gordon_makes_947m_offer_to_acquire_top_uk_personal_injury_law_firm) for a whopping AU$1.3 billion ($928 million) in the hopes of cashing in on the lucrative car accident market. New proposed laws in the U.K. designed to crack down on fraudulent claims has caused a huge slowdown in business for the firm. According to the Herald Sun, the firm’s stock has taken a nosedive of nearly 40 percent after a trading suspension was lifted.

So it was a classic case of overexpansion — which can, of course, happen even with non-publicly traded firms (boy Dewey know of some examples). But the temptation to be reckless might be greater when you’re playing with other people’s money.

# Eversheds Sutherland Joins KWM To Create Global Referral Alliance
## It's not a merger, but this money isn't going to make itself.

Eversheds Sutherland may have the urge to merge, but the firm isn’t willing to go that far just yet. Instead, the global firm is making waves with its decision to enter into a “cooperation agreement” with China’s King & Wood Mallesons. While this isn’t a merger per se, the new arrangement will tie up the firms’ more than 6,000 and billions of dollars of revenue under the same referral umbrella.

The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/07/20/eversheds-sutherland-seals-alliance-with-asias-kwm-405-125794/) has additional details on what, exactly, will occur under this plan:

Under the referral arrangement, KWM China will refer all future matters requiring legal advice in the U.K., Europe, Middle East, Africa and South America to Eversheds Sutherland International, while Eversheds’ clients requiring China advice will be referred to KWM.

The cooperation agreement gives Eversheds access to the lucrative Chinese market, which is currently closed off to foreign firms due to strict regulations.

As part of this arrangement, KWM will cease operations in the U.K., Europe and the Middle East by the end of October 2024, with all of those employees invited to join a local Eversheds offices.

Here are [statements](https://www.eversheds-sutherland.com/lists/shownews.html?News=king_and_wood_mallesons_(china)_and_eversheds_sutherland_(international)_launch_formal_cooperation_agreement5328&country=cn) from Wang Junfeng, global chairman of KWM, and Lee Ranson, chief executive of Eversheds Sutherland International, on the new about the alliance:

Junfeng: “We are delighted to have reached this agreement with Eversheds Sutherland (International) after having successfully worked together on a number of important client matters over the last year. Demand for international legal services has increased and diversified at pace, and Eversheds Sutherland (International) is an ideal fit for our clients with its extensive worldwide network. Both firms share a commitment to quality, efficiency and providing the highest levels of client service. This arrangement is an exciting development in the international legal market, bringing elevated, global service offerings and new opportunities.”

Ranson: “We are excited to be entering into these arrangements with the leading firm in China. Our clients have increasingly complex needs for PRC legal advice in China, and this new arrangement creates the platform to deliver a solution of the very highest calibre as well adding strength to our European and Middle East businesses. Working together on certain client development opportunities will also create opportunities for us to generate significant new work across the globe.”

Notably, the agreement does not include the Eversheds U.S. practice. Best of luck to the two firms as they begin this new journey together.

# World's Highest-Grossing Law Firm Announces Gigantic Partner Class
## With almost 150 new partners, how many of them will enter the firm’s equity ranks?

There’s no denying that Kirkland & Ellis is one the nation’s greatest law firms. Not only does the firm offer a compelling combination of prestige and profitability, but now it’s shattering the market on partners.

Earlier this week, the firm announced its largest-ever partner class of 141, up from 2017’s class of 97 and 2018’s class of 122.

But how many of these new partners will enter the firm’s equity ranks? Last year, the firm had 430 equity partners and 566 nonequity partners. [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2019/10/02/kirkland-announces-partner-mega-class-with-141-promotions/) has some information on the firm’s tiered-partnership structure:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The firm is also known for an “up or out” approach to partnership, which means large-scale promotions to its partnership don’t translate into a top-heavy structure.

Back in 2012 The American Lawyer found that about 20% of Kirkland’s income partners became equity partners after they finished a roughly [four-year eligibility requirement](https://www.law.com/almID/1202575852183/). A more recent look at promotions at Kirkland from 2013 to 2017 found that only about 43% of the attorneys promoted during that period [were still at the firm](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2017/10/09/what-happens-to-kirklands-legions-of-income-partners/) by the end of it, although the percentages varied widely from class to class.

As far as diversity is concerned, Kirkland’s new partnership class (seen [here](https://www.kirkland.com/news/press-release/2019/10/kirkland-announces-new-partners)), is looking mighty male and mighty white. Forty-six of the firm’s new partners are women, and minorities seem to be disturbingly underrepresented. You’d think that with a group this large, a little more attention would have been paid here.

It’s important for firms to know that these subjects don’t go unnoticed. Diversity and inclusion matter — to a firm’s current lawyers, to potential recruits, and perhaps most importantly, to clients.

# Lawyers’ Mental Health Remains In Crisis, But Awareness Is Growing

It’s hardly news to say that the collective mental health of the legal profession is under severe strain. The results of the recent ALM Intelligence 2022 Mental Health and Substance Abuse Survey confirm what has long been true: the situation remains grave.

On the other hand, there is some indication, both in the annual ALM survey data and elsewhere, that law firms are taking mental health concerns more seriously than in the past.

The 2022 ALM survey was administered to more than 3400 respondents working at law firms of all sizes. The survey pool was global, but 79% of respondents were based in the United States. Respondents were 52% female and 48% male, with less than 1% identifying as transgender or other gender. Eighty-five percent of respondents were White (non-Hispanic), 5% Hispanic or Latino, 4% Asian, 3% Black, and 3% Other/Multiracial.

Broadly experienced negative mental health impact

The proportion of respondents who agree that mental health problems and substance abuse are at a “crisis level” in the legal industry has grown each year since 2019, reaching 44% in the most recent survey. On the question of whether mental health problems and substance abuse are worse in the legal industry than in other industries, 55% of respondents said yes, 36% don’t know, and only 9% said no.

Thirty-five percent of respondents said they personally feel depressed, and two-thirds reported having anxiety. Three-quarters reported that the profession has had a negative effect on their mental health over time. Sixty-four percent reported that their personal relationships have suffered as a result of being a member of the legal profession. Nineteen percent answered yes to the question: “In your professional legal career, have you contemplated suicide?”

When asked to select factors that negatively impact their mental well-being, 72% of respondents selected “always on call/can’t disconnect,” 59% selected “billable hour pressures,” 57% pointed to “client demands,” and 55% selected “lack of sleep.”

Rising awareness of the problem

Even though the overall data are undeniably bleak, the survey does include some indications of progress. The proportion of respondents who agreed that their “workplace is a safe environment to raise concerns about mental health and substance abuse” has risen from 40% in 2019 to 45% in 2022. Still far too low, but at least moving in the right direction. The survey also indicates that more firms are taking tangible action to provide more comprehensive mental health support: in 2022, 61% of attorney respondents reported that their firm offered an Employee Assistance Program including assistance for mental health or substance abuse, up from 54% in 2019.

In addition, the survey suggests that COVID-related mental health pressures are starting to improve. Sixty-one percent of respondents reported that the COVID pandemic had made their mental health worse, but this was down from 70% in 2021.

Mental health and return to office

Although some aspects of the survey might seem like “more of the same,” the section on Remote Work Environment is particularly timely, given that the profession remains in a tug of war over a return to the office. In a set of questions introduced for the first time in this survey, ALM asked respondents about the effect of “hybrid or remote work environments” on various elements of their professional and personal lives. The results are less than conclusive.

There was something approaching consensus on a few points. For example, 76% of respondents reported that remote work had decreased the quality of interpersonal relationships with colleagues and 62% said it had increased the quality of home-based personal relationships. 59% reported that remote work had increased their quality of life.

But the reported mental health effects were much less clear. Thirty-eight percent of respondents stated that remote work increased mental health, whereas 35% said it decreased mental health, and 27% reported no impact. On the question of whether hybrid or remote working environments increase or decrease the likelihood of professional burnout, 25% said increase, 33% said decrease, 25% answered “stay the same,” and 17% didn’t know.

Unfortunately, the published survey includes no breakdown of how these responses intersect with demographics, which is perhaps a missed opportunity.

For those who found that remote work flexibility relieved stress levels, the prospect of being forced to return to old ways of working inspires real anxiety. It will be interesting to observe over the coming months and years how the widespread desire of firm leadership to encourage (or enforce) return to office will interact with increased awareness of a responsibility to address mental health challenges.

# Boies Schiller Adds Bankruptcy Talent To New Look Firm
## The reorientation of the firm continues.

After months of trying to read the future of Boies Schiller based on the lawyers who’ve decided to depart the firm, we now get a look at what Boies Schiller will become based on who they’re adding. This morning, the firm announced that it’s adding Lawrence Brandman, the former head of bankruptcy at Lehman Brothers Holdings, and Neil Pigott, a senior UK bankruptcy lawyer, as partners.

This tracks the idea that BSF is trending toward gathering expertise to address the big ticket issues of the moment. The global economy is in shambles, and while that’s driven a lot of firms to stockpile bankruptcy talent, these hires are unique.

Brandman was the guy at Lehman Brothers Holdings responsible for resolving the disputes that evolved from the unwinding of its derivatives book after the financial crisis. If a firm is looking to bring in practical experience in dealing with truly cataclysmic restructurings, it’s hard to imagine a person bringing more practical expertise in dealing with a financial apocalypse to the table. Before his time at Lehman Brothers, Brandman spent nine years as Managing Director at Goldman Sachs and worked at CSFB before that.

Pigott, meanwhile, is a former counsel at BSF who decamped to serve as Executive Director in distressed special situations for Nomura International PLC. Pigott also has worked as an Executive Director at Morgan Stanley for nine years.

From the press release:

“Boies Schiller’s reputation in special situations and finance litigation is second-to-none, and respected across the market. I am thrilled to be joining their peerless team at this incredibly significant time,” Pigott said. “As a litigator with a transactional and investor background my experience will combine well with the team’s well known ability to find novel and creative approaches to provide value to clients,” he said.

Boies Schiller has lost a lot of lawyers over the last few months. With the firm [losing the bulk of its California presence](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/everyone-seems-to-be-overreacting-to-these-boies-schiller-departures/) and then losing its [highest profile Washington team to Paul Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/paul-weiss-bolsters-technology-practice-bringing-on-dunn-and-isaacson/), most commentary about Boies Schiller kicks off with a lament about how the firm must be “blindsided” by everything. That angle never seemed to make much sense to me.

A lot of people wonder if I’m just being doggedly contrarian. Perhaps. But it’s also that BSF told us that the firm would be changing a lot and, frankly, I’d harbored some questions for a while about the long-term sustainability of the BSF confederacy. Was it aiming to establish itself as another large Biglaw player? That didn’t jive with some parts of the firm’s outlook. Was it aiming to offer more high-stakes services in select practice areas? That didn’t jive with the other parts of the firm. The idea that BSF was going to change in big ways and that the faces of BSF 1.0 wouldn’t necessarily be the faces of BSF 2.0 just didn’t surprise me. And some of those departures would, by necessity, be people we’d all consider huge parts of the firm as we’d come to know it. No one is blessed with the crystal ball required to know if this specific strategy ultimately ends up best for the firm, but the point is that any serious strategic rethink of the firm was going to involve changes and so big departures don’t shock me. And I certainly don’t need to come up with theories about Harvey Weinstein to explain why people are moving around.

Indeed, as the firm adds to its bankruptcy practice, word comes that it will see the departure of Bob Cooper from the DC commercial litigation team. This is going to be par for the course with BSF for the next several months. Let’s just wait to see where everyone is when the dust settles.

# Top 20 Biglaw Firm Changes Its Bonus Structure To Better Compete In Associate Talent War
## Woohoo! Great news!

The war for associate talent at Biglaw firms continues to rage on in our post-pandemic world. Firms have been changing their compensation schemes left and right to bring uniform pay to offices across the country, and now one top firm is changing its bonus structure to make it rain on all associates.

Norton Rose Fulbright — a firm that came in 13th place in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking, having brought in $1,877,933,000 gross revenue in 2020 — recently announced that it would be standardizing its bonus regime across the country. Here’s an excerpt from an NRF memo that we received:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Considering that Norton Rose is one of the top-performing firms in the country, it’s exciting that they’ve finally decided to share the wealth through bonuses with all associates across all offices. (This is just for year-end bonuses; if you recall, the firm announced [payments on a “regional scale”](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/nrf-special-bonus-2021/?rf=1) for its special bonuses in some of its smaller market offices, and associates were really upset about it.)

What do associates have to say about the firm’s move to offer a uniform bonus scale? They’re pleased, but still seem relatively pissed:

NRF is finally standardizing bonus thresholds across the country (but still not rectifying that smaller offices are being paid a smaller off-market special bonus). That’s nice and all but if they are actually “committed to attracting and retaining top talent through competitive compensation programs” then all US offices need to be on the same salary scale, not the nonsense they have in place now.

We’re just observers here, but since the firm seems to be paying attention to what’s going on with regard to nationwide compensation and the associate talent pipeline, now would be a great time to make its pay scale uniform across all offices too.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)

# Biglaw Firm Does Away With Gendered Language
## Important step for inclusion.

Clifford Chance is making an important move to challenge gender assumptions. It may seem like a small thing, but, as r[eported by Legal Cheek](https://www.legalcheek.com/2020/12/clifford-chance-ditches-dear-sirs-and-chairman-in-inclusivity-push/), the firm is modifying its correspondence templates, ditching “Dear Sirs,” and telling attorneys to avoid gender specific pronouns and adjectives (i.e., she/her/hers) and words that assume a role is associated with a particular gender, such as “chairman.”

They aren’t the first firm to pay attention to the ways language shapes normative assumptions about gender. Four years ago, [Freshfields adjusted their templates](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/morning-docket-09-16-16/) to do away with gendered language, and Quinn Emanuel also made the [gender neutral jump](https://www.legalcheek.com/2020/02/quinn-emanuel-follows-freshfields-in-ditching-dear-sirs-from-lawyers-emails/) in February.

The firm says that gender neutral language is a way to call into question our unconscious biases and that not everyone identifies as either male or female:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“We are continuously collaborating with our clients to see how we can better advance our commitment to inclusion,” Clifford Chance’s global director of inclusion Tiernan Brady said. “The words and language we use matter greatly. They send a signal of our values and can have both a positive and negative impact on others and on our culture.”

“Removing gendered language from our communications is a subtle but impactful way of demonstrating what we stand for, and I’m delighted to see these steps taken in our firm.”

Good for them! Let’s hope even more firms get on board.

# Biglaw Associates Continue To Be Incredibly Stressed, Overworked
## Their long hours are leading to depression and other mental health issues.

Being a lawyer is the most stressful yet boring job in the world. I’d never recommend it to anyone. Ever.

— an answer given in response to Legal Week’s job satisfaction survey by a female associate at an international Biglaw firm. The survey of 248 corporate lawyers concluded that [44 percent of the United Kingdom’s top attorneys struggled depression and stress](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/09/10/stress-and-depression-rife-as-almost-one-in-two-lawyers-experience-work-related-mental-illness-405-44081/) due to their work, with more than half of female respondents saying those mental health issues applied to them. Nearly half (47 percent) of male associates claimed to work more than 50 hours each week, while more than a third (34 percent) of female associates said they worked more than 50 houes each week. “The better you perform the more in demand you are from clients and internally. This means more hours,” said one male associate. “It feels like success at work directly leads to a worsening home life and work/life balance. The worst lawyers in our firm have the best lifestyle.”

Last year, as part of my book tour for [Supreme Ambitions](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1627220461/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1627220461&linkCode=as2&tag=dealbreaker-20&linkId=TJDXVETDE3PDEYAO) (affiliate link), I participated in a great [event](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/04/thanks-to-the-ninth-circuit-for-a-supreme-event/) at the Pasadena courthouse of the Ninth Circuit. I joined two other lawyer-writers, [Robert Rotstein](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/an-entertainment-lawyer-and-a-novelist-an-interview-with-robert-rotstein/?rf=1) and [Jonathan Shapiro](http://www.artoftellingstories.com/about/), to talk about lawyering in fact and fiction. (You can watch the panel on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2xRdM6le50), starting around the 2:26:00 mark.)

Jonathan Shapiro — the author of two books, [Deadly Force: A Lizzie Scott Novel](http://amzn.to/2eboSkb) and [Lawyers, Liars, and the Art of Storytelling](http://amzn.to/2eGMNZI) (affiliate links) — stole the show. I like to think that all three of us were interesting and entertaining, but Shapiro was hilarious. He had lots of great stories based on 14 years writing and producing television shows like The Blacklist, Life, Boston Legal, and The Practice.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

And now Shapiro can add another credit to his [IMDb page](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1236705/): Amazon’s new legal drama [Goliath](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/goliath/), which he co-created with longtime collaborator David E. Kelley. Writing in these pages, our resident culture critic Harry Graff [praised the show](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/standard-of-review-amazons-goliath-is-half-of-a-very-good-show/) as “very entertaining,” giving special props to star Billy Bob Thornton for his “excellent” performance.

I recently caught up with Jonathan Shapiro to discuss the show. Here’s a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation.

DL: Congratulations on Goliath, and on all the great buzz the show has been generating. For our readers who have been too busy billing hours to keep abreast of cultural developments, can you give us a quick sense of what the show is about?

JS: David E. Kelley and I wanted to do a show about American law in the 21st century, looking at the state of play, the motivations of those involved in the adversarial system, the pressure they are under and how it affects them, and what it says about us as a country. Kelley and I are old lawyers who love the law and our brothers and sisters in the profession. We wanted to take a look at what’s different today compared to when we both got out of law school. There’s a lot of great new shows looking at criminal cases. We wanted to explore character issues through a complex civil case involving the industrial-military complex.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
DL: Lawyers and law students sometimes turn up their noses at legal television shows and movies because the Hollywood version of the profession often bears no resemblance to the real thing. But you, as a former federal prosecutor and of counsel at Kirkland & Ellis, have some real “street cred” as a lawyer as well as a writer. How realistic would he you say Goliath is?

JS: We’re not handing out CLE credit. It’s a show, not a documentary. The goal is to be entertaining and compelling, but our hope is that what we write also provokes and illuminates. Lawyers and law students are absolutely right that we do have to compress and take some liberties, including casting amazing actors to portray lawyers and judges. But we do our best to keep it as real and accurate as possible. Art is a lie that tells the truth, as the saying goes. I think we capture the truth of Biglaw today and what it demands and takes from the people involved. Kelley and I have written a number of law shows together, and we’ve always tried to be true to both the spirit and the letter of the law.


Jonathan Shapiro

DL: You’ve said in [prior](https://bol.bna.com/new-amazon-show-asks-if-big-law-is-too-big/) [interviews](http://www.tvinsider.com/article/101170/goliath-boss-jonathan-shapiro-on-the-legal-potboilers-twists-and-turns/) that the law firm depicted in Goliath is not Kirkland & Ellis. But did your time at K&E, or other experiences in your legal career, inform your work on the show?

To paraphrase Tolstoy, all happy law firms are alike; each unhappy law firm is unhappy in its own way. Cooper & McBride is an unhappy firm, unhappy in its own way, reflecting the wounds of its leadership. Our show is not an American Lawyer profile, but I do think it accurately portrays darker aspects of Biglaw’s relationship with its clients. Kirkland & Ellis is, as far as I could see, a happy firm, like other happy firms. But it was interesting to return to practice. The size and scope of Biglaw, with billion-dollar firms, with their obvious advantages over smaller outfits, technological advances, the availability of Big Data, how rare trials have become… it all informed what we did.

DL: Here at Above the Law, we love celebrities, but our “celebrities” tend to be lawyers and judges. Your show features a number of bona fide Hollywood actors, including Billy Bob Thornton, William Hurt, and Maria Bello. Any fun tidbits you can share with us about these stars or the experience of working with them?

JS: Maria went to Villanova, cares deeply about politics, knows more about Philadelphia than anyone I’ve ever met, and should run for office there one day. Talked to William about Body Heat and the art of playing a lawyer who thinks he’s smarter than he is. He’s a Juilliard-trained actor whose commitment to his craft is impressive. As for Billy Bob, the raves he’s gotten for the show describe him perfectly: one called him “the redneck Bogart,” another called him the “Olivier of Arkansas.” He’s an autodidact, a genius, a superb conversationalist, and knows more about film history, 1970s television, and baseball trivia than any man alive. I could talk to all three of them for hours.

DL: So the show became available on Amazon earlier this month — and I suspect some people have already binge-watched all the episodes. Now that viewers and critics are starting to chime in, can you share some of your favorite responses to the show so far?

Judge Alex Kozinski, who [plays Judge Alex Kozinski](http://www.trialinsider.com/?p=6512), has been kind enough to share a slew of well-deserved and glowing reviews for his performance. People literally stop me in the street to say how much they love the show. This includes a neighbor who almost ran me down in her car yesterday to say so. The reviews have been terrific, which is gratifying, but even the few that weren’t great offered some laughs — such as the one that said the show is based in Florida (God forbid).

Amazon’s reach is amazing. I’ve heard from folks who love it in England, Africa, but especially Indiana… oh, how they love the show in Indiana.

DL: And many other places as well. Congrats again, and we look forward to the next season!

# Federal Judge Benchslaps Biglaw Partners -- And Issues A Warning For The Future

There’s little Above the Law likes better than a good ol’ fashioned benchslap. When a judge goes out of their way to rebuke lawyers in their courtroom, well, it can be awfully fun. And that only goes double when Biglaw partners are the center of it all.

The case is a patent dispute between Finjan Inc. and Juniper Networks Inc. Back in January, Judge William Alsup of the Northern District of California called it an “exceptional case” saying Finjan presented a damages case “fiasco” that the 2018 trial “wasted a great deal of everyone’s time and energy,” and made “unforced errors” leading up to a second trial.

This week, Judge Alsup awarded Juniper $5.9 million in fees, as recommended by a special master. Though this might seem like a big award, Juniper also sought sanctions. That was just not in the cards. BUT Judge Alsup did see fit for call out Finjan — and their former Biglaw Kramer Levin attorneys — for their behavior during the case. And issued a warning for future cases, as [reported by ](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/07/27/alsup-names-shames-counsel-while-awarding-5-9-million-in-attorneys-fees/)Law.com:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In [a nine-page order issued Monday](https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/documents/403/57732/Finjan-v.-Juniper.Alsup-order-awarding-fees.pdf), Alsup found that Finjan’s conduct—while at times “vociferous and belligerent”—did not cross the line to willfully false statements or other egregious conduct that can give rise to Section 1927 sanctions.

But, he wrote, “In no way does this order vindicate attorneys James R. Hannah, Lisa Kobialka, and Paul J. Andre. Their conduct was improper and frustrated the fairness of the proceedings. Judges in the future should take this into account when dealing with them in future cases.”

Kramer Levin offered the following statement: “We stand by the work our partners did on this matter, and we strongly disagree with the criticism.”

But, um, yikes, not words you want to read.

# Advising Corporate Procurement Teams In The Age Of AI
## Go on, ask your procurement team how many AI-driven software products the company buys from third-party vendors without consulting the legal team.

Ah, there’s nothing quite like the queasy blend of frustration and panic you get as in-house counsel when you discover the company has long engaged in a practice that could subject the company to various legal, compliance, ethical, and reputational risks.

Want to see what I mean? Simply ask your procurement team how many AI-driven software products the company buys from third-party vendors without consulting the legal team.

Unfortunately, as AI adoption increases, it may become an all-too-familiar feeling for in-house legal leaders. Procurement teams must become more aware of potential AI-related risks and take the appropriate measures to mitigate them. Here are practical tips on how you can advise procurement teams in the age of AI:

Ask The Right Questions To Prevent Legal Liabilities

AI-driven products and services can lead to various legal risks, including data privacy, intellectual property, and liability issues. But if procurement team members don’t know what to look for, they don’t know what to ask. That’s why it’s essential to ensure that your procurement team:

- understands how each vendor collects, uses, and stores your data
- confirms that vendors comply with applicable data privacy laws and regulations and any others specific to your industry
- verifies that the vendor properly attained the rights to algorithms, software code, and other intellectual property and also complies with any open-source licensing requirements
- asks vendors whether their models were trained with any protected content
- negotiates indemnification provisions in contracts to guard against liability issues if products malfunction or cause harm to users
- asks vendors how they address ethical concerns such as bias in algorithms and fairness in AI-based decision making
- requires vendors to demonstrate transparency and accountability in their development and deployment of AI products and services.
Consider developing a due diligence checklist with specific questions about AI-related legal risks for the procurement team to evaluate potential vendors. Ongoing training on liability issues, data privacy laws, intellectual property rights, and other relevant topics is another helpful tool to ensure your procurement team remains well-versed in the relevant issues and risks.

Build Relationships That Help The Business Thrive

Your role is crucial in protecting your company from all angles. As much as thinking about the risks and temporarily halting progress can make us cringe, it can also be the difference between a business success and a legal nightmare. 

If you haven’t already, schedule a meeting with your procurement team to discuss AI product and service provision concerns. Working with business stakeholders to foster a culture of responsible AI management while encouraging the exploration of new technologies can reduce the number of legal issues that take you by surprise going forward. 

What else do companies need to be thinking about regarding AI?

Does your procurement team have a way to ensure that vendors comply with the required standards?

# The Rise Of 'Midyear Reviews' That Could Leave Associates Jobless

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

[Midyear reviews are] potentially a signal that more people will be let go. Some people are getting hand-picked for reviews. It may be earnest, and nothing may come of it. But in some cases, it may be a signal of bad things to come.

Performance reviews may have been happening in name only in 2021 because everyone was treading water. There could be some catch up there, but I haven’t heard associates feel that way. Performance reviews have been a format for stealth layoffs.

— [Kate Reder Sheikh](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/kate-reder-sheikh), a partner and legal recruiter at Major, Lindsey & Africa, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/06/27/goodwin-performance-reviews-lead-to-cuts-as-mid-year-reviews-increase/) on the sudden rash of “performance reviews” (i.e., stealth layoffs) that have been plaguing associates across Biglaw firms.

# It's Not A True Match, But Associates At This Firm Are Still Pumped About Their Raises
## Hooray for more money!

We’re a week past the date when associates across the Biglaw landscape saw their salaries climb to fantastic new heights thanks to Milbank and Davis Polk. But there are still firms that have yet to raise salaries, and these days, each one that throws its hat into the ring seems to have an interesting interpretation of the new pay scale.

For example, let’s take a look at what Loeb & Loeb is doing. The firm, ranked at No. 99 in the most recent Am Law 100, with $385,271,000 gross revenue in 2020, announced its new salary scale yesterday. While it’s a match for first-and second-years, every other class year (or tier, in Loeb parlance) is a few thousand to tens of thousands of dollars away from a true match. This is what the salary tiers at the firm will look like, effective August 1 (with the Davis Polk scale noted parenthetically):

T1: $205,000 ($205,000)
T2: $215,000 ($215,000)
T3: $230,000 ($240,000)
T4: $245,000 ($275,000)
T5: $260,000 ($305,000)
T6: $275,000 ($330,000)
T7: $290,000 ($350,000)
T8: $300,000 ($365,000)

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Kenneth Florin, the firm’s chair, states in his memo (available on the next page) that they’ll also be reviewing the bonus structure to remain competitive in the market. “Our intent is to have a total compensation system that is both consistent and fair as well as meaningfully rewards our most productive associates,” he notes.

The new salary scale will apply to associates in all of the firm’s offices (New York, DC, Chicago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles) save for Nashville, where salaries will be discussed separately. Despite the fact that these aren’t exact matches for the prevailing market rate, associates still seem positively thrilled. After all, a raise is a raise is a raise. Congratulations!

(Flip to the next page to see the memo from Loeb & Loeb.)

We depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Law firms are being forced to adapt at an unprecedented pace to the unfolding global pandemic. Traditionally, firms were deliberate and late to respond to change, whether it be technological innovation or shifting market conditions. Today, however, law firms have no choice but to reprioritize and reconfigure their workflows and client relationships due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Further, there is a heightened imperative to honestly communicate and manage the expectations of the firms’ partnership and staff.

We want to get a sense of how associates are perceiving their firms’ responses to our current circumstances.  In partnership with our friends at [Major Lindsey & Africa](http://bit.ly/2FRifVC), we are fielding a [brief survey ](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_agWFzgYjzphrYHP)that looks to gain insight into such topics as:

- Communications transparency;
- Technological resources;
- Preferred methods of communication; and
- Long-term effects on the profession.

# Top Biglaw Firm Removed From Notorious Hackers' Website 1 Day Ahead Of Ransomware Deadline
## LockBit threatened to publish the Biglaw firm's data unless it negotiated a price by November 28, and now the firm has been removed from hackers' site on the dark web. What could this mean?

Earlier this month, in the wake of the firm’s [approval of its merger](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/ao-shearman-merger-approved-poised-to-become-third-largest-firm-in-the-world/) with Shearman & Sterling, Allen & Overy found itself the [victim of a cyberattack](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/allen-overy-hit-by-ransomware-cyber-attack/) involving confidential data taken from its storage servers. The notorious ransomware group LockBit was the behind the attack, and the hackers threatened to publish the data it took from the firm on November 28, unless A&O “negotiated” — that is, unless the leading law firm was willing to pay up, and the price could be pretty steep.

With just a day left before A&O’s deadline, the law firm has been removed from LockBit’s ransom site on the dark web. What could be the meaning of this? [Law.com International](https://www.law.com/2023/11/27/allen-overy-removed-from-ransomware-website-1-day-before-deadline-397-79404/) has scant details:

A&O has now been taken off this website along with the reference to the November 28 deadline, [a] person [with knowledge of the situation] said, although it is unclear what the significance of this is. It could mean the firm has paid a ransom or it could mean negotiations are ongoing, the person added.

A&O declined to comment beyond its original statement.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“As a matter of priority, we are assessing exactly what data has been impacted, and we are informing affected clients,” an A&O spokesperson previously said of the cybersecurity incident. “We appreciate that this is an important matter for our clients and we take this very seriously.”

Is Allen & Overy now negotiating with the hackers, or did the firm pay the requested ransom, which could have been up to $76 million? We suppose we’ll never know (until someone digs into A&O’s financials).

# Quinn Emanuel Announces Bonus Scale With Bigger Bonuses For Big Billers

Quinn Emanuel announced — and paid out — associate bonuses last week. And if you were one of the associates who billed between 2100 and 2399 hours this year, you received a bonus equal to the market rate established by Cravath last month.

But the really good news is for those who billed at least 2400 hours. Depending on what billable threshold they meet, they are eligible for bonuses in excess of the market rate. Senior associates billing over 2700 hours are seeing an additional $35,000. Not a bad thank you for a busy year.

Here is the firm’s complete bonus matrix:

# Biglaw And The Dreaded Stealth Layoff: It's Happening Again
## What you need to know about the mysterious method Biglaw firms use to get rid of lawyers.

With news of law firm [hiring freezes](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/hiring-freezes-and-stealth-layoffs-hit-top-50-biglaw-firms/) and [outright layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/law-firm-lays-off-10-of-all-timekeepers-due-to-decrease-in-demand/) at top Biglaw firms, we knew it wouldn’t be long until another sign of the financial times emerged. It was just yesterday that we learned of one top firm’s decision to [defer the start date for its incoming associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/gunderson-deferred-associate-start-dates/) due to demand slowing down “significantly.”

Now that deferrals are upon us, we have to wonder: Is this the canary in Biglaw’s coal mine?

Top Am Law firms may yet implement additional austerity measures when it comes to controlling their attorney headcounts, but they know just how bad the publicity is when they choose to conduct layoffs en masse. No Biglaw firm wants their brand name to become a layoff-related verb (this happened to Latham when the firm [laid off 440 people](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/06/how-did-latham-become-the-poster-child-for-layoffs/) in February 2009). The way to avoid all the negativity is through the sneak attack of stealth layoffs.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Stealth layoffs are the disturbingly popular method used by Biglaw firms to cull the associate (and partner) herd. For those who might be hearing the term for the first time, stealth layoffs allow firms to cut headcount without confirming that there were any financially based layoffs. Firm frequently couch the reductions in performance review terms that coincidentally happen in the midst of a downturn — whether economic- or demand-related — often making those let go doubt their lawyering skills. By their secretive nature, they can be challenging to confirm in specific numbers, but insiders slowly find out something is amiss.

So, are Biglaw firms using stealth layoffs right now? Based on some of the tips we’ve received, we certainly think so. Firms are using these stealth layoffs as a way to save face and cut costs at the same time, and we’ll likely be seeing many more of these in the future.

Help us help you. Please keep Above the Law in mind when attorneys are suddenly let go and the firm insists there’ve been no layoffs.

If your firm or organization is reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs) or text us (646-820-8477).

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

# Biglaw Partners Need To Remember Their Humanity When Conducting Interviews
## Maybe a mom with cancer shouldn't be a deal breaker... just spitballing here.

Biglaw interviewing can be absolutely horrifying. But the good news is, no matter how bad an interview goes, there’s probably someone else with an equally awful story. Don’t believe me? Listen to Above the Law readers. [We asked](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/all-the-things-that-can-go-wrong-during-on-campus-interviews/) for interview horror stories, and y’all delivered! (Yes, please, keep ’em coming!)

This latest tale is an example of how out-of-touch Biglaw partners can be. Because when someone tells you they’ve been dealing with a parent with cancer it’s not the time to write them off as a candidate because of slipping grades (that were solid enough for a callback, BTW)

From a reader:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
There was a callback interview before 2L. The big partner is grilling my transcript, which was straight A’s in autumn of 1L and a little worse in the fall, from a T14 school.

“Why were your grades so BAD in the spring?”
“My mother was diagnosed with cancer in April and I was driving home on weekends.”

It’s fairly important to note how obvious at this point it is I won’t be getting an offer.

So we keep talking and he asks why I want to be a lawyer. And I tell a pretty wholesome story about reading my father’s lawbooks and getting hooked on ideas like precedent and caselaw after having learned about the Supreme Court at a ninth-grader-goes-to-a-college-in-the-summer type program.

“Oh. Your Dad’s a lawyer? Which shop?”
“Oh he’s self employed. Owns his own firm. Solo general practitioner.”

At which point the partner audibly scoffs and makes like a coughy noise.

“Well I’ve never heard of him!”
“You must not spend very much time at the courthouse.”

Perhaps it’s the submitter that is the real winner here: my guess is working for that partner is a nightmare.

Have a terrible tale to tell about an interview gone awry? Please send it our way [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Interview%20Stories), subject line “Interview Stories.” We’ll read all the submissions and share our favorites in these pages.

(And remember, as we’ve previously [explained](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/interview-horror-stories-what-was-she-thinking-er-drinking/), “The ‘horror’ in ‘interview horror stories’ is loosely defined. Stories that are somewhat embarrassing or mildly amusing will suffice.”)

# Associate Bonus Watch: Now These Are Some Sterling Bonuses
## Change could be coming to the partnership ranks, but it's business as usual for associate bonuses.

Shearman & Sterling, that is. Today the firm announced that it’s matching the [Cravath bonus scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2016-associate-bonuses/).

These are interesting times for [Shearman & Sterling](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/shearman-sterling-llp/). As we discussed earlier this year, some [significant changes](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/biglaw-partners-on-the-hot-seat-firms-are-demoting-partners-hand-over-fist/) could be coming to the [partnership ranks](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/this-biglaw-firm-may-demote-partners-to-boost-profits/).

But when it comes to associates, it’s business as usual at Shearman, meaning a market match. The firm matched the Cravath scale [in 2015](http://www.law360.com/articles/736005/shearman-sterling-falls-in-line-with-cravath-bonus), and in 2014, it [sweetened](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/associate-bonus-watch-10-leading-law-firms-whos-naughty-and-whos-nice/) its [original bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/associate-bonus-watch-10-leading-law-firms-whos-naughty-and-whos-nice/) after Davis Polk one-upped Simpson. So this announcement isn’t a surprise, but it’s still good news. The bonuses will be paid on January 13, 2017.

Our standard reminder: when your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. You can also text us if you prefer, at 646-820-8477.

If you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post.

# Evaluating AI’s Impact Through Feedback: What Are Your Goals?
## Use the feedback to design improved user experiences that instill trust.

Each day, I encounter lawyers who embrace AI with a can-do attitude, and they confidently manage any surprises. I also meet lawyers hindered by fear, and they struggle with the unknown and find uncertainty daunting. Your mindset shapes your perception, which is why evaluating AI’s impact to manage any unintended consequences will instill confidence in your ability to lead and oversee AI projects. 

The main goal of evaluating AI’s impact is to enhance transparency, fairness, and accountability in its deployment. One approach (of many) relies on stakeholder feedback that provides insights into others’ experiences and viewpoints, allowing you to better understand how your company’s use of AI impacts others. Functional goals for a feedback-driven approach to evaluating AI’s impact include:

Unearth Biases

Biases can hide in data, algorithms, decision layers, and other AI system components. Negative feedback from customers, employees, and others may reveal that biases exist. 

Analyzing instances where people feel an AI system mistreated or discriminated against them helps you locate where biases occur. Then, you can make adjustments so AI systems comply with anti-discrimination laws and foster an inclusive environment where all are treated equitably.

Cultivate Public Trust

Three out of four organizations are implementing or considering bans on ChatGPT and other Generative AI applications in the workplace, with 57% citing risk to corporate reputation as a primary reason, according to a [BlackBerry survey](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2023/08/why-companies-ban-chatgpt-ai) of 2,000 IT decision-makers across the globe.

Asking users whether AI systems meet their needs and expectations tells you a lot about their trust levels. Gaps between the AI system’s intended functionality and the actual user experience should stand out. Input on system accuracy, reliability, and usability helps you target areas for improvement.

Use the feedback to design improved user experiences that instill trust. Address pain points and incorporate user suggestions. This demonstrates your commitment to listening to users’ voices and incorporating their perspectives into improving AI systems.

Boost Employee Engagement And Retention

Has AI effectively taken over mundane tasks that lead to employee burnout and dissatisfaction? Ask if employees can now focus on more meaningful and challenging work as a result. 

This type of feedback can also reveal gaps in employees’ ability to collaborate and share knowledge. For example, employees may say it’s too time-consuming to access up-to-date information. To enhance team performance, you may adopt AI-powered chatbots that provide instant access to real-time data and answer common questions. 

What Goals Have You Set For Your AI Journey? 

Effective AI systems help bridge communication gaps, boost efficiency, and create a more cohesive and productive work environment. Collecting and analyzing feedback is an iterative process that supports continuous improvements to better align AI technologies with stakeholder needs and build public trust. Look for satisfied clients, high retention rates, and positive feedback to indicate success. 

While you can’t always predict where your AI journey will lead, taking proactive measures to clarify your objectives helps keep you on the right track. A positive mindset will help you navigate the inevitable bumps in the road.

What steps are you taking to ensure your AI implementations are successful? Do you have a plan to gather feedback and measure the impact of your AI initiatives?

Cleta Mitchell (image from the old Foley & Lardner site)

Lord save us from the scourge of young people voting!

That was the message Trumpland lawyer Cleta Mitchell [delivered](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/04/20/cleta-mitchell-voting-college-students/) to a roomful of Republican donors in Nashville last weekend, urging them to fight against the liberals who cheat by making it easier for young people to vote.

“What are these college campus locations?” she scoffed on audio obtained by independent journalist Lauren Windsor. “What is this young people effort that they do? They basically put the polling place next to the student dorm so they just have to roll out of bed, vote, and go back to bed.”

Haw, haw, get it? See, the kids are lazy, and that means it’s “cheating” to put the polling station some place they can walk to. So weird that young voters favor Democrats by [wide margins](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2023/02/27/younger-voters-are-poised-to-upend-american-politics/)!

EXCLUSIVE AUDIO: Trump coup attorney Cleta Mitchell wants to ""combat"" voting on college campuses, citing North Carolina and Wisconsin, and says that when Republicans win the state Senate in Virginia, they can eliminate 45 days of early voting and same day voter registration.

Mitchell, a [former partner](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/cleta-mitchell-out-at-foley-lardner-after-troubling-donald-trump-call/) at Foley & Lardner, was shown the door by the firm in 2021 after the Washington Post published a recording of her on the perfect, perfect phone call where Trump pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have, because we won the state.”

They did not, in fact, win the state, although Mitchell made sure to namecheck Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams, while warning that she was coming into North Carolina — which comes perilously close to saying the quiet part out loud. But Mitchell wasn’t focused on that particular subgroup last weekend, although she did call for “oversight” of Fulton County’s election apparatus. Instead she was there to discuss ways the GOP could ensure  “A Level Playing Field for 2024.” And by “level” she means “maximally advantageous for Republican constituencies.”

After being defenestrated from Biglaw, Mitchell found a soft landing at the Conservative Partnership Institute alongside other MAGA faithful such as Mark Meadows. The CPI helped launch Mitchell’s current project, the Election Integrity Network, an organization which scaremongers about non-existent voting fraud as a reason to suppress the vote, and they’re not particularly subtle about it. Why would making it easier for students to exercise their franchise contribute to vote fraud? What possible correlation could there be between so-called “election integrity” and allowing 17-year-olds to pre-register to vote before their 18th birthdays?

Nonetheless, Mitchell protests that the EIN’s work “is NOT about winning campaigns,” as if that needed clarification. A party whose main platform seems to be throwing a hissy fit because Anheuser-Busch was nice to a trans person one time is clearly not trying to win over an age cohort which is broadly supportive of LGBTQ rights. Plus there’s that whole abortion thing.

But Mitchell has a plan to win elections without appealing to anyone under 35. It involves curtailing voting on campuses in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Also, something about … Alaska?

Because if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em. Or barring that, make sure they can’t vote.

# Associate Bonus Watch: Cravath Announces Its 2017 Associate Bonuses!
## Lawyers get exciting holiday news!

UPDATE: Other firms are already following suit! [Follow all the action here](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/bonuses/).

It’s that time of the year again. Once more, associates gather around their computers to fervently press refresh on the Above the Law main page (or subscribe to the [ATL Bonus Alert newsletter](https://info.abovethelaw.com/atl-bonus-and-salary-alert-signup)!) to see if they’re going to be getting some good news or a proverbial lump of coal from the partners.

Bonus season is upon us and as usual, the legal industry’s lord and master Cravath, Swaine & Moore has set the tone for the season by announcing the first round of bonuses that every other top-tier Biglaw firm will dutifully follow… and every firm that doesn’t will be bracing for recruiting season.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Well, let’s see what [the folks at Cravath are getting this year](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2017-associate-bonuses/2/):

Class of 2017 — $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2016 — $15,000
Class of 2015 — $25,000
Class of 2014 — $50,000
Class of 2013 — $65,000
Class of 2012 — $80,000
Class of 2011 — $90,000
Class of 2010 — $100,000
Class of 2009 — $100,000

For those keeping score, this is the same bonus scheme we saw in [2016](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2016-associate-bonuses/) and [2015](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2015-associate-bonuses/) (both from Cravath), and in [2014](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/associate-bonus-watch-davis-polk-beats-simpson/) (from Davis Polk curb-stomping [Simpson’s effort to set the market](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/bonus-season-comes-early-and-its-not-cravath/)). Meet the new bonus, same as the old bonus.

This means a Cravath first-year will earn $195,000 and eighth-years will earn $415,000. Not a bad haul in an economy that looks to be slowing. The tale of 2017 in the legal market is the continuing decline in demand for legal services overall. The elite firms can continue raising rates to compensate because there’s still some elasticity for their brand-name services… but just how long can that hold? Technology allows clients to [move more in-house](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/new-study-gcs-have-brought-the-majority-of-work-in-house/), small firms and boutiques are [earning more client trust](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/10/general-counsel-increasingly-dumping-the-top-biglaw-firms/), and when clients reach the end of the rope they’ve given the Am Law 50 (or maybe even 25) to charge higher and higher rates, the elite firms might find themselves in the quagmire that afflicts the rest of the Am Law 200.

But enough depressing news for today! Let’s worry about all that for your 2018 bonuses. Get out there and celebrate this bonus today. [Buy yourself something nice](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/the-lawyer-holiday-gift-guide-the-best-gifts-for-the-attorney-in-your-life/).

What do you think about these bonuses? Feel free to let us know [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus), text (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). We might update this story by quoting your comments — anonymously, of course — if they’re insightful or amusing. You can also vote in the reader poll below.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources anonymous — and that includes our sources for bonus stories. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. You can also text us if you prefer, at 646-820-8477. Thanks for your help.

My reaction to the Cravath bonus announcement is:

- Blowing rails off the bust of the firm's founder.
- As pleased as an objectively reasonable person would be.
- Meh.
- Life is full of disappointments. This is another one.
- Sorry, I didn't hear you, I'm on the phone with my recruiter right now.

# The Latest In Biglaw Austerity: Yet Another Am Law 100 Firm Cutting Salaries
## Lawyers at the firm will have their paycheck cut.

Hey, all you cool cats and kittens! How was your weekend? I sure hope it was relaxing and you were able to put a pin in all of the bad news the pandemic has brought to your door. But whether you had a great holiday weekend or if you (understandably) couldn’t put the creeping horror to bed for the weekend, more Biglaw austerity news is sure to ruin your Monday morning vibe.

The latest firm to enact cost-cutting measures is Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton. The Biglaw firm notched $450,324,000 in 2018 gross revenue, making it 7[8th in the 2019 Am Law 200 ranking](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=171&name=Kilpatrick-Townsend-%26-Stockton-LLP). But as we’ve repeatedly seen during the COVID-19 economic downturn, no amount of previous success can really insulate you from cash flow concerns during the pandemic.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
So what, exactly, is going down at Kilpatrik? The firm is cutting partner draws by 10 percent. Associates and all non-partner salaried employees (with an exception for secretaries) are seeing a 5 percent pay cut. Secretaries are moving to a “0.8 FTE but will not be subject to the firmwide 5% salary reductions.” Staff who cannot work remotely have been furloughed.

The firm [reportedly](https://www.law.com/2020/04/12/kilpatrick-cuts-pay-for-lawyers-and-staff-as-firm-anticipates-revenue-decline/) had the following to say about the “proactive” cost-cutting measures:

“We have decided to take some proactive steps to adjust our expenses that we feel are prudent under these circumstances,” Kilpatrick said in the statement. “On the financial front, we are a fiscally conservative firm that is well-positioned to work our way through this challenging time.”

Kilpatrick is making the cash-conserving pay reductions after a healthy fiscal performance in 2019 that the 640-lawyer firm said extended through the first quarter of this year. “We had a very strong first quarter and were running at full speed before the pandemic,” it said in the statement.

“We, like most if not all law firms, anticipate that our revenues will decrease as a result of the economic turmoil that the COVID-19 global health crisis is causing. Our goal is to find the best way to build a bridge over the anticipated economic downturn and come out strong on the other side,” the firm’s statement said.

The good news, such as it is, is that the firm has established a hardship fund where employees who need additional assistance during the global pandemic can apply for moneys. A reduced-hours schedule is also available for “anyone having challenges working a full schedule in a remote-working environment.”

# Faced With High-Profile Partner Defections, Firm Revamps Its Compensation Structure
## Former partners spill some tea about the move.

I guess lockstep compensation just ain’t what it used to be…

The Magic Circle firm of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer was a real holdout when it came to lockstep partner compensation, but after a series of high profile [partner defections](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/biglaw-firm-gets-busy-shedding-finance-partners/?rf=1), they’ve rethought their process. Earlier this month the firm [voted on a new comp model](http://www.legalweek.com/sites/legalweek/2017/11/14/freshfields-partners-vote-in-extended-single-lockstep-ladder-to-boost-pay-for-star-performers/), which will allow top performers to earn up to six times more than those in the bottom:

[The new model] will see all partners joining the lockstep at 12 points, with a new top of lockstep rising to 60 points.

The core ladder will run from 12 points to 40 points, with everything above this only applying to star performers and those in competitive markets such as New York. Elsewhere, partners will climb to various points on the ladder depending on factors such as geography and practice group.

There will be three gates in the system where the firm will be able to either pause partners’ progress or stop them from climbing higher. In theory, the firm will also be able to move partners down the lockstep from a gateway position, something it was previously unable to do. Only the very top performers will be able to clear the third gate to reach the new 60-point plateau.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Of course U.S. Biglaw firms are usually on a merit system for partner compensation (hence the [importance of a portable book of business](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/bad-news-for-junior-partners-with-no-book-of-business-you-dont-have-many-options/?rf=1)), and several other Magic Circle firms have also moved away from the lockstep model. But it is big news for Freshfields to make the switch. In 2015, during the election for firm management the team of Ed Braham, Stephan Eilers and Chris Pugh (Pugh stepped down from his role in July) ran on a platform of [maintaining the lockstep model](http://www.legalweek.com/sites/annaward/2015/07/01/lockstep-is-fundamental-to-us-freshfields-new-management-team-outlines-its-plans/). Law.com [has a piece](https://www.law.com/sites/legalweek/2017/11/22/its-a-big-call-partners-size-up-freshfields-radical-lockstep-overhaul/) with current and former Freshfields partners spilling tea on the recent change:

A former partner says: “The Braham-Pugh ticket was: ‘steady as she goes; we are not going to change anything.’”

But that wasn’t to be. In addition to losing partners, they also posted [a poor financial performance](http://www.legalweek.com/sites/legalweek/2017/07/03/freshfields-slips-behind-linklaters-by-revenue-and-pep-following-challenging-2016-17/), falling behind competitors in both revenue and profitability. So the change seemed necessary:

One magic circle partner says: “You only really change things that you care passionately about when you feel vulnerable; they have had a tough 18 months and lost a couple of stars.”

One former partner says: “All their talk of increasing profitability per point [without changing lockstep] was pie in the sky.”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And there’s lots of concern and hand wringing about the long term impact of the move — both in terms of firm morale and the lateral partner market:

One magic circle partner says: “The lockstep purists will argue that this could unsettle the home base, and I think there is something in that. Introducing a difference between stars and very good people in London – people who have grown up as complete equals in remuneration and status terms – is remarkably difficult.

“It isn’t the case that it is a small band of brothers at the top in terms of performance – it is shades of grey, and it changes. Some people are very good for two years and then not so good the next year.”

A former partner adds: “It is a big step, and one that will no doubt cause a lot of angst and heartache”. Another predicts: “I am sure there will be some CVs in the market in due course.”

We’ll just have to wait and see if the move is hailed as one that benefitted the partnership…

# Some Biglaw Firms Won't Be Able To Handle Increasing Associate Compensation

We are likely to see three types of firms. Those that continue to keep up with [the associate pay] scale. Those that just decide to get off the merry-go-round. And those that fall into the middle — they’ll try to keep up with the scale, but they just won’t be able to.

— William Josten, manager for enterprise legal content at the Thomson Reuters Institute, offering his thoughts on [how the ever-increasing compensation scale will play out](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/attorney-recruitment-fears-temper-law-firms-bullish-outlook-2021-11-16/) among Biglaw firms. In a new survey released by Thomson Reuters and Georgetown Law’s Center on Ethics and the Legal Profession, associate salary increases were listed as a high (29%) or medium (46%) risk to profitability by respondents.

We are the lowest numbers in the legal profession in terms of law firms and partnerships, and yes, the impact when Black women lawyers are supported and actually trusted by leadership and their peers is profound.

— [Paula Edgar](http://www.paulaedgar.com/about-2/), founding board member of The Black BigLaw Pipeline, Inc. and former president of the Metropolitan Black Bar Association in New York, commenting on the need for [Biglaw firms to start focusing on Black women attorneys](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/will-the-law-firm-diversity-push-falter-as-protests-fade) in their diversity and inclusion efforts.

# The Glass Ceiling Report: Law Firms 'Fundamentally Struggle' To Support Women
## But the future is female at some firms (at least when it comes to who's in charge).

No news is good news, right? Not when it comes to women’s progress in the legal profession — not at all.

Despite the fact that women lawyers across the country have led movements for gender equality and equal pay, gender parity within the law is still a “distant goal.” Women continue to be underrepresented in private practice, especially when it comes to attaining leadership roles. In fact, in the last year at the average law firm, from associate to equity partner, women’s representation has increased by no more than a percentage point, a statistic that’s been depressingly static for years.

There are now more women in law school than ever before, but men still lead the pack when it comes to private practice, making up about two-thirds of attorneys in this sector of the legal profession with gender-discrimination suits still being continuously filed by women. What’s more (but more accurately, much less) is that within those private practice firms, only 22.2 percent of equity partners are women.

This was all before the pandemic, when law firms were “fundamentally struggl[ing] to support the rise of women in their workforce, at all levels.” We shudder to think what this data will look like next year.

How can progress for women in the law be made when the odds seem to be stacked against them? Some law firms are leading the way, and thanks to Law360’s annual [Glass Ceiling Report](https://www.law360.com/articles/1316430/glass-ceiling-report-how-does-your-firm-measure-up-), we now know which ones are the best for women.

Law360 surveyed more than 300 U.S. firms, or vereins with a U.S. component, about the demographics of their lawyer workforce as of December 31, 2019. Firms were then grouped into tiers based on U.S. attorney headcount, and ranked by the percentage of female attorneys and female equity partners at the firm.

In the biggest of Biglaw category, those with 601+ attorneys, the top 5 firms are:

There may yet be good news ahead for women in the law, because at several firms, the future is female (at least when it comes to who’s in charge):

There have been some recent bright spots in the past year, however. The legal industry kicked off 2020 with a series of announcements that women had been appointed to lead U.S. and global law firms.

In the first few months of 2020, at least seven law firms announced that women had become their top leaders.

Women also made up 40% of attorneys promoted to partner, equity or nonequity, in 2019 according to survey data collected by Law360. This suggests firms will have increasing opportunities to shift the gender balance in leadership roles in future years, as long as they can retain that talent in the partnership ranks.

Congratulations to all of the women who were promoted to partner this year, and especially to the women who were chosen to lead some of the largest law firms in the world. Kudos to all Biglaw firms that do more than just pay lip service to gender parity and actually follow through to make these important and necessary changes.

## The gunner phenomenon is not limited to law schools.

Most legal professionals understand what a “gunner” is in the context of law schools. A gunner is a student who sits in the front of the class, brown-noses to the professors, and does everything they can to succeed academically, usually rubbing it in the faces of their colleagues that the gunner is doing well in class and in securing job offers. If all attorneys think back to their law school experience, they can probably picture one or two people (or more) who meet this description. However, from my own experience, gunners exist in law firms as well, although they manifest themselves in different ways.

One of the biggest habits of gunners at law firms is that they respond to emails at all time of the day and night and seem to be sending emails at odd hours to prove that they are working around the clock. We all know people who send emails at crazy hours when they really do not need to either because a matter is not emergent or can be handled at a more reasonable hour. Such gunners violate the boundaries of work-life balance in order to stand out before management.

I remember one time, a boss of my colleagues and myself sent several attorneys an email over the weekend about whether we liked a CLE we had attended the past week. There was absolutely no reason to respond to the email immediately. However, an attorney I knew was a gunner responded to the boss about five minutes after the email was sent, and it was somewhat clear that this person just responded immediately to show they were working on the weekend. Such actions can disturb the work-life balance without providing any benefits to a firm or its attorneys.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Another big sign of a law firm gunner is brown-nosing: praising their boss, usually to seek advancement. (I’ll let you google why its called brown-nosing if you do not know.) Of course, brown-nosing is part of the repertoire of law school gunners, but law firm gunners often take this tactic to the next level.

While law school gunners seek higher grades and recommendations, law firm gunners might seek promotions, raises, and other incentives from brown-nosing. Law firm gunners are more likely to brown-nose in private since there are few public opportunities to employ this tactic, but it happens in public from time to time. I remember one time, a shop I was working at had a law firm meeting about a new document-management system. A well-known law firm gunner with whom I worked called the boss “Mr. So and So,” which was weird since everyone was on a first-name basis at that shop and said how good this manager was at handling documents and filing them appropriately. Based on the body language of most people in the room, people were repulsed by this brown-nosing, and I am not sure how impactful it was at guaranteeing this person a promotion or other advancement in his career.

The habit of law school gunners to broadcast their accomplishments is also alive and well among most law firm gunners. While it is healthy and positive for people to advertise successes they have on behalf of clients, many law firm gunners broadcast successes that really do not matter to people outside of the firm and are not the type of accomplishments that other people might broadcast. For instance, law firm gunners might brag about being selected for a certain team or project, even though this is not really indicative of any quality of the gunner. Law firm gunners need the affirmation that used to be filled with law school grades and easily assessed accomplishments, and they might not have such easily assessable successes at a law firm to brag about.

Just like law school gunners might experience drawbacks to their actions, so too might gunning at a law firm create barriers to succeeding at a shop. The legal profession is extremely social, and how people perceive you can be a substantial factor in hiring and promotion decisions. People do not really like gunners. Of course, some bosses might appreciate the praise and brown-nosing a gunner might confer on a manager, but many people think that gunners are annoying and perhaps underhanded. This might make it less likely that a gunner will be chosen for certain teams or assigned certain kinds of work, which can have an impact on a lawyer’s career at a firm and after they leave a shop. As a result, law firm gunners should operate at their own risk since the activities of a gunner can have a number of negative consequences.

All told, the gunner phenomenon is not limited to law schools, and many of the same tactics that are employed by law firm gunners are also employed by gunners once they graduate and begin working for law firms. However, gunners should operate at their own risk since their activities could actually hurt their career ambitions.

[Last summer,](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/former-biglaw-attorney-accused-of-injecting-blood-into-supermarket-food/) an attorney who previously worked at a trio of Biglaw firms — Allen & Overy, Herbert Smith Freehills, and Milbank — and had since opened his own legal consultancy business was arrested and charged with contaminating or interfering with goods and assault after allegedly injecting a syringe of blood into various food items at three different supermarkets in London.

In the bizarre incident, Leoaai Elghareeb, 37, was accused of bringing a bucket full of syringes filled with his blood into three supermarkets. Video surveillance caught him injecting food with the blood. Elghareeb also threw the syringes and eggs at customers and staff at the stores. In the cleanup of the incident, 21 blood-filled syringes were found, and food totaling ~£467,000 was thrown out.

Now a jury at Isleworth Crown Court has found him not guilty by reason of insanity. The prosecution did not dispute the diagnosis, as [reported by ](https://www.legalcheek.com/2022/05/solicitor-who-injected-food-with-blood-found-not-guilty-due-to-insanity/)Legal Cheek:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Dr Bradley Hillier, a consultant psychiatrist, gave evidence that Elghareeb was suffering from psychosis when he went on his supermarket rampage.

Jurors heard Elghareeb had strong suicidal episodes and tried to hang himself, having suffered mental health problems over the previous 12 years. He believed he was being controlled by government spies and likened his experience to the character played by Jim Carrey in The Truman Show, who lived in a world that was not real.

The solicitor, who ran a legal consultancy business, began to abuse crystal meth as part of his “work hard and play hard lifestyle”, the court heard.

In an earlier trial, a jury was discharged when they could not reach a verdict.

# Where In Biglaw Are Midlevel Associates The Happiest? (2020)
## Despite the pandemic pay cuts, midlevels are still satisfied at these firms.

Making it to midlevel associate in Biglaw isn’t easy — especially during a pandemic. First you have to break into Biglaw in the first place (which can be quite difficult, especially if you didn’t go to a top law school or earn top grades). Then you have to survive the high stress and long hours. Finally, you need to endure and somehow persevere through these uncertain times despite the salary cuts, furloughs, and layoffs (depending on your firm).

But if you do make it to midlevel status, it’s arguably more difficult than ever thanks to COVID-19. The American Lawyer just released its [midlevel associates survey](https://www.law.com/2020/08/24/as-they-navigate-the-pandemic-midlevel-associates-say-law-firm-transparency-is-paramount/), and respondents are understandably concerned about transparency, accountability, and work-life balance. Despite these concerns,  midlevels are happy with how their firms have managed the coronavirus crisis. Per [Am Law’s Samantha Stokes](https://www.law.com/2020/08/24/as-they-navigate-the-pandemic-midlevel-associates-say-law-firm-transparency-is-paramount/):

Early-career attorneys are increasingly satisfied with the openness of firm leadership, how firms communicate about making the partnership, and the opportunity to build relationships with partners, according to [The American Lawyer’s 2020 Midlevel Associates Survey](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/08/24/the-2020-midlevel-associates-survey-the-rankings/). In the pandemic era, transparency in these areas has once again led associates to feel more satisfied with their firms overall than ever: The average composite satisfaction score for all 73 participating firms in 2020 was 4.32 on a five-point scale, an increase from last year’s average of 4.29.

Asked to rate their firms in several categories, associates gave higher marks than they have in the past, most notably when it comes to “management openness,” where firms had the greatest improvement, rising to 4.26 from 4.07 last year.

Midlevel associates were asked how satisfied they are with their firm on a variety of different questions: compensation and benefits; training and guidance; relations with partners and other associates; interest in and satisfaction level with the work; the firm’s policy on billable hours; and management’s openness about firm strategies and partnership chances. In the face of the pandemic, leadership across another of Biglaw firms scored major points with their openness. “Some associates are telling me that even when firms are communicating bad news, they’re still glad the firms shared it and aren’t aren’t trying to hide anything,” said Stephanie Biderman, a managing director with Major, Lindsey & Africa’s associate practice group. “It may not be the news they wanted to hear, but they’re still happy to feel included in the conversation.”

As far as work-life balance is concerned, millennial midlevels are really feeling the pressure. In fact, the term “work-life balance” was mentioned more than 200 times among the 4,100 respondents to Am Law’s 2020 survey. While some were pleased with how their firms were “good about making sure that people are mindful of their mental health,” others stressed (literally) that firms really only care about money, not mental health, with one associate poetically describing the situation like so:

Management rewards those who make the most money for the owners of the firm by working the longest hours (and who thereby accumulate the most stress and neglect their mental health, relationships, physical health, etc.). Firms qua firms are agnostic as to associates’ mental health—if it is neglected, it results in lessened productivity as manifested in burnout, but if it is prioritized, it also results in fewer hours billed (through a more advantageous work-life balance, etc.) and fewer profits. On balance, the system rewards flirtation with burnout and the accompanying depression and anxiety.

That having been said, let’s get down to the rankings. The full list is available [here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/08/24/the-2020-midlevel-associates-survey-the-rankings/), but these are the firms that make the top 25 in terms of midlevel satisfaction:

“Summer school get to losing students / But the CPD getting new recruitment / Our summer don’t get no shine no more.” – [Chance the Rapper](http://genius.com/9143656)

Last week, the American Lawyer released its latest [Diversity Scorecard](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202757858000) survey. As we’ve [explained before](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/07/the-best-law-firms-for-diversity-2013/), the Am Law rankings focus exclusively on the percentage of minority lawyers and partners at a firm, in terms of racial and ethnic minorities.

Once again, there’s not a lot of movement at the top. As David Lat [noted last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/the-best-law-firms-for-diversity-2016/?rf=1), “You can’t change a law firm’s demographics overnight, which explains why firms with high ranks for diversity tend to keep those high ranks. In other words, law firms need to renew their commitment to diversity year after year; diversity problems don’t lend themselves to quick fixes.”

Congratulations to the top five firms in Am Law’s 2016 Diversity Scorecard:

1. White & Case
2. Fragomen
3. Wilson Sonsini
4. Wood Smith
5. Fenwick & West

It is no surprise that White & Case remains the top-ranking firm for diversity for the third consecutive year, and the other firms on this list are all quite familiar to the top of the Diversity Scorecard as well. At least 25 percent of attorneys in each of the firms on this top five list are minorities.

As for the rest of the Am Law 200 and NLJ 250, minority lawyers stood at 15.02 percent in 2015, slightly higher than a year earlier. The percentage of partners who were minority lawyers also rose a bit, to 8.22 percent from 7.7 percent last year, according to the Am Law survey.

Since 2002, more than 20 percent of law school graduates have been minorities, according to the [American Bar Association](https://www.law360.com/companies/american-bar-association). At the top law schools that traditionally feed recruits to elite law firms, the percentage of minority students hovers around 30 percent, with some top-tier law schools closing in on 40 percent, as noted by [Law 360](https://www.law360.com/legalindustry/articles/794900/us-law-firms-fail-to-move-needle-on-racial-diversity). But despite a [decades-old pipeline of minority grads](http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/minority_women_are_disappearing_from_biglaw_and_heres_why/), there remains a disproportionately low number of minorities who stay in Biglaw, and even fewer who advance to the highest ranks. As Am Law’s MP McQueen notes:

Evidence that the so-called leaky pipeline of minority lawyers starts early can be seen in NALP survey results showing that racial and ethnic minorities accounted for a much higher share of summer associates: 31.16 percent. And since 2000, the percentage of minority law school graduates has ranged from 20 percent to more than 26 percent, according to the American Bar Association, NALP says. But those numbers are not reflected in the percentage of minority lawyers among Big Law associates. NALP executive director James Leipold says, ‘We continue to see women and minorities leave [law firms] at disproportionately high rates.’

NALP’s [2005 report](http://fpd.gsfc.nasa.gov/diversity/Resignation_Revelations.pdf) on attrition revealed “that 42 percent of male associates of color leave their law firms within 28 months. Within 55 months, 78 percent have left…. while minority female attorneys have the highest attrition rate, at 41 percent within 28 months and 81 percent within 55 months.”

In 2010, the ABA highlighted a study that revealed [25 percent of law firms](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/about_25_of_law_firms_are_to_blame_for_high_minority_attrition_numbers_stud) are to blame for high minority attrition numbers. [Above the Law](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/11/diversity-issues-to-consider-before-you-accept-your-offer/) also covered these findings. In this year’s ABA cover story, [“Minority Women are Disappearing from BigLaw and Here’s Why,”](http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/minority_women_are_disappearing_from_biglaw_and_heres_why/) Liane Jackson wrote that 85 percent of minority female attorneys in the U.S. will quit large firms within seven years of starting their practice.

This year’s [Vault/MCCA Law Firm Diversity Survey](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/high-minority-attrition-rates-continue-to-plague-large-law-firms/) has also confirmed that diversification of law firms is moving at a snail’s pace – minority lawyers now represent 15 percent of attorneys at surveyed firms, compared to 13.8 percent in 2007.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The Diversity Survey revealed that the hiring of African-American attorneys and law students has actually declined as their attrition has increased, resulting in law firms employing fewer black lawyers than they did eight years ago. And lawyers of color continue to leave their firms at a [disproportionate rate](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/high-minority-attrition-rates-continue-to-plague-large-law-firms/), according to the Diversity Survey.

To address the status quo, firms will need to [examine](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/10/wheres-the-diversity-in-the-new-york-city-legal-market/) their past diversity and inclusion initiatives, current situation, and recruiting strategy. It is important to remember that if a firm’s culture [isn’t consistent](https://www.bountyjobs.com/blog/2015/11/17/3-ways-youre-hurting-your-diversity-and-inclusion-program/) with its recruiting initiatives, it will [continue to suffer](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/high-minority-attrition-rates-continue-to-plague-large-law-firms/) from the corroding pipeline problem.

Does your law firm have any plans to [resolve the issues](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/10/4-ways-law-firms-can-lean-in/) that corrode the pipeline to partnership?

# Biglaw Office Shut Down After COVID Outbreak
## Two COVID outbreaks, technically.

The process of reopening Biglaw offices is bound to be a slow one filled with many stops and starts. Just ask Squire Patton Boggs. The international law firm had to shut down its Manchester office after lawyers tested positive for COVID-19.

[According to RollOnFriday](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-infected-trainees-close-down-squire-patton-boggs-office), the office was “evacuated after two separate outbreaks of Covid.” Apparently there were two separate attorneys who took COVID tests over the weekend, and were at the office when they got the positive results. Which led to closing the office ASAP:

“Neither individual experienced symptoms while in the office”, emphasised a spokesperson for SPB, adding that the lawyers have not returned to the office while they self-isolate.

The results let to the immediate closure of the office on Monday “out of an abundance of caution” and a deep clean. It re-opened on Wednesday.

Though the office is now reopened, according to a spokesperson it “remains, as it was previously, at limited capacity,” and employees at the office are “doing so on a managed, voluntary basis and in accordance with the health and safety protocols put in place by the firm.”

One of the attorneys who tested positive was reportedly working on a corporate deal when the test result came in. The entire team was immediately sent home, and, as RollOnFriday notes, they had to depend on the kindness of another Biglaw firm to get everything done:

An insider claimed the associates “had to rely on another law firm”, DLA Piper, “to help run the rest of the deal for them”, which “meant a couple of all nighters for the DLAP bods”. Clearly the Blitz Spirit is alive and well, brings a tear to the eye so it does.

We’d like to believe this is the last hiccup in the re-opening of Biglaw, but, it probably won’t be.

# Law Firms Should Provide Student Loan Assistance To Their Associates
## Offering relief from student loans would allow large law firms to project a much gentler image.

It seems that many of the nation’s top law firms are in an arms race to recruit the best talent possible.  This website has widely discussed how firms compete when offering salaries, bonuses, and other compensation so that the brightest mind will want to work at these shops.  In addition, many law firms offer a dizzying array of perks such as free meals, rides home, and other benefits that put some Silicon Valley employers to shame.  However, not many law firms offer attorneys any benefits when it comes to student loans.

The idea of employers offering student debt relief is not new.  Indeed, I have read numerous articles about financial services companies offering programs through which employers can provide student debt relief.  It seems obvious that law firms would have more reasons than most other employers to offer student loan assistance.  Of course, [attorneys borrow massive amount of student debt](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/law-school-debt/) so that they have the credentials necessary to work at law firms.  As a result, law firms should provide student debt relief, since these shops are benefiting from attorneys who borrow money to finance their educations.   All told, I think that many law firms should seriously consider providing student loan assistance to their associates for a number of reasons.

First, offering student debt relief as a perk of employment would help many law firms, since this benefit would assist these shops in recruiting talented lawyers.  Many of the nation’s top law firms are already trying to “one up” each other over compensation and benefits.  Providing student loan assistance would be one additional benefit a firm could offer that competitors would not immediately provide.  In addition, paying for student debt relief offers tax benefits that employers cannot realize if they just increase compensation.  Providing student debt assistance would allow law firms to attract top talent without some of the drawbacks of simply raising salaries.

In addition, offering student debt relief would enable employees to work even harder at their jobs.  As I have discussed at length on my own website, [I worked thousands of hours at side-hustles](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/introducing-side-hustles/) and stressed out in unbelievable ways due to my student loans.  I would be lying if I said that my student debt did not have a negative impact on my job performance, [since taking care of my student loans took attention away from my job](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/balance-side-hustles-main-job/).  However, if my student loans were partially or totally paid for by my employer, I would be able to focus my full attention on my job.  Also, my gratitude for this assistance would compel me to bring more energy and dedication to my work as an attorney.

Moreover, providing student debt relief to employees would be a great public relations move for many law firms.  Most big firms are viewed as “law factories” that work associates to the bone and do not care about attorneys other than the amount of hours they bill annually.  However, offering relief from student loans would allow law firms to project a gentler image that may be very appealing to prospective clients and business partners.  Indeed, many of the reasons law firms promote pro bono and charitable causes could also be used to justify student loan assistance.  Whereas simply raising compensation conveys an image of excess, offering student debt relief can have positive effects on the reputation of a law firm.  As such, law firms could easily justify a student loan assistance program, since it would make good business sense to have such a benefit.

Of course, there are a number of arguments against law firms offering student debt relief.  Some might argue that student loans keep associates working at some of the bigger law firms, since employment at these shops is the only way many attorneys can be free of student debt.  This might be true, but if this were the case, ever-increasing compensation would also enable attorneys to leave firms, and this hasn’t stopped the top firms from increasing salaries.  Others might think it is unfair to offer student debt relief to employees when some associates might not have student loans.  However, the vast majority of attorneys do have student loans, and a balance can be struck between offering student debt assistance and being fair to attorneys who are debt-free.

Furthermore, some might argue that it is not the responsibility of employers to help attorneys with their student loans.  However, law firms offer all kinds of perks that are only tangentially related to the work of employees.  Indeed, many shops offer disability coverage, 401(k) matches, and other benefits.  Student debt relief could be such an additional perk, and it can be argued that repaying student loans is more connected to an attorney’s work than some of these other benefits.

I would be remiss if I did not mention that some law firms do currently offer attorneys assistance with student loans.  This is a great start, and these firms should be commended.  However, student debt assistance should be more widely considered by law firms for all of the reasons noted above.  Not only would offering student debt relief be beneficial to law firms, it would be the right thing to do as well.

# Biglaw Mega Firm Expanding (Again) In Northern California

For the third time in three years, Squire Patton Boggs is looking to pick up additional lawyers in NoCal. As they have with [Carroll, Burdick & McDonough](http://www.law.com/americanlawyer/almID/1202750322923/), and[ Fernando & Partners](http://www.law.com/therecorder/almID/1202777212038/squire-patton-boggs-snags-silicon-valley-ip-boutique/) in the recent past, the firm is now adding the lawyers from Singularity, a Redwood City, California-based intellectual property boutique as [reported by](https://www.law.com/2018/08/13/squire-patton-boggs-acquires-silicon-valley-based-ip-boutique/) Law.com.

Singularity was founded by a trio of IP partners, Frank Bernstein, Vidya Bhakar and Ronald Lemieux, and represent a wide variety of technology clients. The boutique will be winding down operations, as its partners will be moving to Squire Patton Boggs or have already found in-house positions.

It may not be a big surprise that Singularity decided to move to Squire Patton Boggs, two of the founding partners (Bhakar and Lemieux) worked there (or, more accurately, legacy firms of the current iteration) in the past:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“We choose Squire for a couple of reasons. One was familiarity, I was a former partner here,“ said Singularity managing partner Lemieux, who led the Palo Alto-based IP and litigation practice at Squire Sanders from 2000 to 2005, almost a decade before the [firm merged](http://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/almID/1202656684269/) with Patton Boggs to [form its current iteration](http://www.law.com/americanlawyer/almID/1202660207505/The-Story-Behind-the-Squire-SandersPatton-Boggs-TieUp/). “We have many good friends here, but it is also because Squire is well-situated for exactly what our clients need.”

And that familiarity is also playing well on the Squire side of the combination:

In a statement, Linda Pfatteicher, managing partner of the San Francisco and Palo Alto offices at Squire Patton Boggs, said the firm looked forward to “working again with our former colleagues Ron and Vid and to welcome Frank. Their commitment to collaboration, cross-selling and a client-and-firm-first attitude match the values and culture that are central to our firm.”

For Squire Patton Boggs, the acquisition is part of a larger effort to expand their IP litigation practice:

# Cravath Opens Its Second U.S. Office After More Than 200 Years
## The firm is adopting the nation's capital as the home of its second U.S. office.

Cravath Swaine & Moore — the New York City Biglaw firm that often controls associate salary and bonus scales writ large — has maintained a single office in the U.S. since its founding in 1819. That all changes now.

Earlier today, the firm announced that it would be opening its second U.S. office in Washington, D.C. Per the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/06/06/cravath-launches-in-washington-adding-partners-from-fdic-and-sec/), the following former government attorneys will be joining the firm as partners to take the lead this fall in D.C.: Jelena McWilliams, former chair of the FDIC; Elad Roisman, former commissioner and acting chair of the SEC; and Jennifer Leete, former associate director in the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. McWilliams will serve as the managing partner of the firm’s D.C. office.

Faize Saeed, the firm’s presiding partner, released the following [statement](https://www.cravath.com/news/cravath-to-open-in-washington-dc-former-leadership-of-fdic-and-sec-to-join-as-partners.html):

“Our clients face an increasingly complex and active regulatory environment, and our move today enhances our ability to provide the most creative advice in addressing their most challenging matters,” said Faiza J. Saeed, Cravath’s Presiding Partner. “With nearly half a century of combined public service, Jelena, Elad and Jennifer will bring exceptional regulatory experience, legal acumen and leadership on critical issues. We are thrilled to welcome them to Cravath.”

Cravath has been making major moves in the last six months or so. First, it [increased its bonus scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/first-mover-on-bonus/) for the first time in years, much to associates’ delight. Next, the firm announced that it would be [abandoning its pure lockstep model](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/cravath-announces-major-change-to-partnership-model/) for partnership compensation in favor of a modified system. Lastly, it [set a higher associate salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cravath-raises-22/) that the majority of Biglaw firms quickly adopted.

Now, the firm is opening another U.S. office for the first time in more than 200 years. What’s going on here? The rest of Biglaw is usually keeping up with the Cravathians, but it looks like competition is driving even the most prestigious of firms to do things that are out of character.

“Building the Washington, D.C., office for a firm as venerable as Cravath—its second U.S. office in over 200 years—is an opportunity of a lifetime,” McWilliams said in a statement.

Congratulations to everyone at Cravath!

# Biglaw Firm Matches Cravath Salary Scale -- But Only For Associates Who Bill More
## Want more money? Bill, baby, bill!

With Biglaw firm after Biglaw firm announcing raises, re-raises, and second re-raises since January, we always suspected there would come a time when a firm would find a way to “match” the prevailing salary scale without really matching, at least not for all associates. To that end, we recently discovered that a leading firm is matching the Cravath compensation scale, but only for associates who are willing to bill, baby, bill.

Please note the UPDATE below.

Earlier this week, Fish & Richardson, a firm ranked at #87 in the most recent Am Law 100, announced that it would be raising salaries for associates — but with one little catch that could be worth thousands of dollars (or more).

If associates at Fish want to earn Cravath-level salaries, they’ll need to move to a 2000-hour annual billable target. The firm’s current yearly minimum is 1900 hours. Associates must select their hours target track by March 28.

This is what the new salary scale looks like at the firm:



Because the firm took a little while to come up with this new compensation plan, the 2000-hour target is being prorated to 1975 hours this year.

Associates who do not boost their hours will remain on the old salary scale. However, even if associates select the lower hours track and somehow wind up hitting 2000 hours, the firm will true-up their salaries.

UPDATE: Here’s some additional information that we received from a source:

On an associate-wide call, it was explained to us that F&R was also raising the salary for those who continue on the 1900 billing track.  The salary will be prorated from the 2000 hr/Cravath scale.  So, for example, if an A7 stays on the 1900 hr track, they will make 95% (1900/2000) of the Cravath scale, i.e., $380K, which amounts to a raise of $30K.  Also, F&R will not only true-up you at the end of the year if you’re on the 1900 hr track and end up billing 2000 hr, but they will true-up for each hour billed over 1900.  So, for example, if an A7 on the 1900 hr track bills 1950, they will get a true-up that is halfway between the 1900 hr and 2000 hr/Cravath scale.

If we’re looking at this through a work-life balance lens, Fish is being quite considerate by allowing associates to choose their annual hours target. If we take off those rose-colored glasses, we’re forced to look at this with a raised brow, because dozens of other firms have raised their salaries without simultaneously raising associates’ billable hours requirements.

Fish associates will see their raises reflected in their first April paychecks, retroactive to January 1. Congratulations to all associates at the firm who are willing to work more to get more money.

# 5 Things About The 2022 Legal Industry No One Is Talking About
## The overlooked nuggets from the latest Citi report.

Citi Private Bank and Hildebrandt Consulting LLC put out the [annual Client Advisory report](https://www.privatebank.citibank.com/insights/citi-hildebrandt-client-advisory) yesterday and covered a lot of ground (growth was up!) and made some predictions (growth won’t stay up!). The growth and the accompanying explosion in associate compensation as an expense this year are what most folks are buzzing about, but there’s more buried in this report.

So here are five takeaways for lawyers and the rest of the industry to consider going into next year.

1) It Continues To Suck To Be In The Am Law Second Hundred

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
There’s absolutely nothing wrong with being an Am Law second hundred firm. Clients will get excellent legal representation from these firms, especially those with a regional focus.

But the problem that comes up year over year is that the second hundred find themselves constantly crushed between nimble, high-end boutiques and traditional Biglaw monoliths. If a client has a matter, they can get great service from a small firm with lower overhead or take zero chances with the board by sending the work to an established name. It’s why we see these [mergers taking second hundred firms into new first hundred firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/biglaw-merger-lands-new-am-law-100-firm-in-our-stockings/).

To the right is demand by segment comparing the first nine months of 2019 — when life was normal — to the first nine months of 2021. That’s the only segment to see a majority decrease in demand.

The second hundred, like most folks, did well during the pandemic. According to the report, “Am Law Second Hundred firms saw 2.5% demand growth and 10.7% revenue growth. While this demand growth trails the performance of larger firms, we would note that this is a stronger result than recent years, with a majority of firms reporting growth.”

It’s not great when the best thing they can say about your year was “could’ve been worse!”

And the overall trend as shown in this graph suggests this segment is going to go back to getting the short end of the stick on demand.

We get it, everyone wants M&A right now. But look at L&E over there in the corner.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Walgreens [stole $4.5 million](https://twitter.com/DanPriceSeattle/status/1465537942965960707) from its workers [JUST LAST YEAR](https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/employment-labor/walgreens-employee-class-action-lawsuit-reaches-4-5m-settlement/). A [Starbucks just unionized](https://apnews.com/article/starbucks-union-vote-buffalo-c7dc3c2ec8b838e9f4ed641f54fc9035). Labor attorneys have work cut out for them everywhere. But the work is fee capped in some jurisdictions and that makes it hard for some firms to make headway in this field. Top firms have a hard time nuking their own billing schedule to get in on this work. Which is actually good for second hundred firms, by the way! Still, it’s a rough road.

3) Legal Secretaries Are Screwed

Throughout my career I was blessed with great legal secretaries. There used to be schools designed for the sole purpose of training folks — at the time exclusively women — to take dictation, touchtype at high speed, handle billing, screen calls, and keep on top of schedules. But as technology advanced, the staff role has given way to just discounting the time the associate spends making copies.



Good heavens that’s a stat! 93 percent of those polled are going to cut secretaries or keep them as is. And don’t get to sentimental over that 10 percent… firms who would otherwise let go their secretaries hold on when they have a good economy and the money to spend. Staff layoffs hit every time the economy takes a dip and when it does, that 10 percent are going to join the other 83.

Which is tragic since firms should be making these cuts during economic booms instead of busts to allow secretaries to find new jobs, but no one listens to my HR opinions.

4) Firms Are Getting Out Of Debt And Into Partner Buy-Ins

While the economy boomed, firms didn’t know that was going to happen. So they spent the pandemic weaning themselves off bank-provided credit and relying more on partner capital contributions.

We have also seen the industry raise the ratio of partner paid-in capital to net fixed assets in anticipation of continuing investments in office space, technology and practice expansion. Fixed asset spending by the industry was rising until 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic introduced a pause. We now see many firms examining their capital spending plans for the next three to five years to determine how much capital they need to raise for the firm they intend to be.

Hey, maybe firms will be more eager to bring on equity partners if only for the cash.

5) China Will Kill Us All

Who’d have thought [building ghost cities to juice GDP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbDeS_mXMnM) would backfire?

International firms rely on China for a large chunk of revenue and… that’s not looking great:

China is likely to see an economic correction as well, falling from a projected 8% growth in 2021 to a forecast of 4.5%, given Beijing’s need to manage its struggling domestic real estate giant Evergrande6 and the situation’s potential spillover effect.

This is a long time coming, of course. And the clampdown on Hong Kong is only making it worse.

Conclusion

But, yeah, there was growth and firms are paying associates more. Maybe I should’ve made the whole story about that.

# Greenwashing Lawsuits Won't Be Going Out Of Style Any Time Soon In The Fashion & Cosmetics World

The fashion and cosmetics industries are increasingly embroiled in litigation that used to be the province of less glamorous products — cookware, fast-food packaging, and firefighting foam, among other quotidian targets. Such cases concern the use of per- and polyflouroalkyl substances (PFAS). These are the “forever chemicals” we’re reading more about lately. Plaintiffs are using new theories, and even new state laws, to bring suits against fashion and cosmetics companies over the use of forever chemicals.

Consumers are also dodging the steep burden of proving injury from the chemicals themselves by suing, instead, under false advertising theories. These suits allege “greenwashing” — that defendants’ ads and packaging have covered up the presence of forever chemicals in their products, and/or have touted environmental and personal safety properties that plaintiffs urge are false and misleading.

PFAS were originally introduced into commercial products such as non-stick cookware, water-resistant coatings, food packaging, firefighting foams, cosmetics, and textiles for their unique properties which make them highly resistant to heat, water, and oil.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Beginning in the 1990s, the first PFAS-related lawsuits were filed against DuPont, a manufacturer of Teflon, linking PFAS pollution from the company’s plant in Parkersburg, West Virginia, to diseases including cancer. Despite its alleged knowledge of the hazards associated with PFAS and its contamination of the Parkersburg water supply, DuPont purportedly failed to warn the community. After denying any wrongdoing, DuPont ultimately settled about 3,550 personal injury claims arising from PFAS for a total of $671 million.

As studies and regulations on PFAS continue to progress, a wave of lawsuits has emerged targeting companies that sell PFAS-contaminated products, including cosmetics, feminine products, fast food packaging, and clothing, among others. These legal actions highlight the growing concern over PFAS exposure and the responsibility of companies to ensure the safety and transparency of their products.

Many of these lawsuits take the form of class-action claims based on false advertising. False advertising claims can be much easier to prove than product injury claims, although the damages would tend to be lower. Depending on the law alleged and the jurisdiction, such claims typically require a showing that plaintiffs would not have bought products containing PFAS at the prices they paid if they had not been misled about the true nature of these products. In some jurisdictions, however, if the claims are literally false and found to have been made willfully or in bad faith, there can even be a presumption of material deception.

I note that federal unfair competition and false advertising claims under the Lanham Act are not available to consumers. Such false advertising claims are typically brought by a company that engages in truthful advertising against one that does not. For example, in 2006, Vermont Pure sued its competitor, Nestlé, under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act alleging that Nestlé made false or misleading advertisements about the source and purity of its water. The case ultimately settled.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Two notable cases, involving Shiseido and CoverGirl, exemplify this trend towards false advertisement claims. In these separate instances, plaintiffs have accused Shiseido of misleadingly promoting its cosmetics as “clean” and “natural,” while CoverGirl has faced allegations of marketing its products as “safe for use” and “sustainable,” despite the presence of PFAS in their ingredients. However, both of these cases ultimately faced dismissal for lack of Article III standing. The Southern District of California, addressing the CoverGirl case, and the Southern District of New York, addressing the Shiseido case, found that the plaintiffs failed to sufficiently allege that they suffered a concrete economic injury arising from their purchase of the contaminated product.

The newest wave of PFAS studies have been asserted by plaintiffs to support that popular active wear brands sell products that tested positive for the presence of PFAS, including yoga pants and sports bras from Lululemon. A study conducted in 2022 by Toxic-Free Future, an organization focused on environmental health research and advocacy, even found that nearly 75% of products labeled as water- or stain-resistant tested positive for the presence of PFAS.

In October 2022, a class-action lawsuit was brought against Recreational Equipment Inc., commonly known as REI, for marketing waterproof clothing as “environmentally friendly” and “sustainable” despite containing toxic PFAS. While continuing its efforts to dismiss the lawsuit, REI announced that it will ban PFAS in all textile products and cookware from its suppliers.

Just last month, the Ecological Alliance filed a lawsuit against Nike and Dick’s Sporting Goods alleging that the defendants failed to warn citizens of California, in violation of Proposition 65, of the presence of PFAS in the defendants’ Jordan duffle bags. Proposition 65, officially known as the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, requires businesses to inform citizens about exposures to 900 listed chemicals, including PFAS.

While no federal regulations have been enacted to protect against PFAS in consumer products, states have been stepping up to the plate. In 2021, state legislatures considered at least 196 bills seeking to ban the use of PFAS on a list of products. Consumer protection-minded states such as New York and California have enacted legislature that prohibits the manufacture, distribution, or sale within the state of any new textile articles containing regulated PFAS by 2025.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Greenwashing lawsuits encompass more than just litigation involving PFAS. H&M recently faced a class-action lawsuit where the plaintiffs alleged that H&M deceived its customers by advertising these products as a “conscious choice” and “environmentally friendly” but use materials that are not sustainable. In a decision that came out last month, the court held in favor of H&M, reasoning that “no reasonable consumer would understand [H&M’s] representations to mean that the Conscious clothing line is inherently ‘sustainable’ or that H&M’s clothing is ‘environmentally friendly’ when neither of those representations were ever made.” The court explained that the “only reasonable reading of H&M’s advertisements is that the Conscious collection uses materials that are more sustainable than its regular materials.”

The public, and therefore state legislatures, are increasingly focused on health risks associated with PFAS exposure. Regulations are proliferating mandating companies to provide accurate information about the safety and environmental impact of their products. We can expect this to result in more lawsuits against a growing breadth of companies that sell products incorporating “forever chemicals,” and against companies that make false or misleading claims of product and environmental safety. We can predict that “clean” companies will file Lanham Act suits against competitors who overstate their own environmental and safety features. To date, there has not been a bombshell mega-damages award or settlement figure in the fashion or cosmetics industry arising from use or advertising of forever chemicals. Staying alert to the evolving legal landscape can reduce a company’s risk of inadvertently tripping that “forever” grenade.

# Can Biglaw Go From Hoopty To Hot Rod?
## What Cloudlaw can teach Biglaw.

“It’s very hard to convince a bunch of millionaires that their business model is broken.” In one sentence, Marc Taylor of Taylor English sums up the biggest challenge facing Biglaw in the face of the changing legal market. Traditional approaches have worked so well for so long, why change now?

The answer is necessity. Firms that don’t adapt face a long-term existential threat on multiple fronts, including the virtual law or cloud-based revolution that I’ve been writing about these past weeks. Leaders of these new firms tend to frown on the “virtual” nomenclature — noting there’s nothing “virtual” about their firms — so we’ll embrace the Cloudlaw label. Cloudlaw is fundamentally about reimagining the legal practice from the ground up. By slashing overhead, leaning heavily into technology solutions, and pushing more revenue to the partnership, Cloudlaw firms are taking ever-increasing bites out of Biglaw’s market share. They’re taking the classic boutique model and attempting to grow it into a world-beating phenomenon.

The brick-and-mortar legal industry isn’t going to go down without a fight. I strongly suspect we’re going to see traditional firms attempting to steal Cloudlaw’s innovations and graft them onto their own practices. [Telecommuting](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/another-biglaw-firm-jumps-on-the-telecommuting-bandwagon/) is already making its way into Biglaw more and more. As the benefits of a distributed practice become more apparent, and as Cloudlaw’s shadow continues to loom larger, the race will be on to adopt Cloudlaw techniques in the traditional Biglaw world.

Our Own Worst Enemies, Revisited

However, as much as I expect Biglaw to want to take on the benefits of virtual practices, I don’t expect it to be easy. Lawyers are notoriously averse to change. [In recent surveys](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/a-crisis-of-confidence-in-law-firms/), a full 90 percent of clients gave their law firms a “low” rating when it came to innovating their legal service model, and nearly 70 percent of law firm owners surveyed said their partners were the biggest force resisting change. It’s all too easy to [shoot down innovation](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/the-culture-card-in-law-firms/) in the name of preserving some firm culture or tradition, when the real motivating factor is fear of the unknown.

Take for example the largely [production-based](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/law-potion-9/), eat-what-you-kill compensation models that functionally all Cloudlaw firms seem to have adopted. This sort of structure seems essential to the Cloudlaw model, but why would a senior partner at a Biglaw firm want to change course as they’re finally getting their time on top? Their secretarial support is great, their offices have the best views. Why give those up in the name of overhead reduction? Plus, they’ve built up their equity in the partnership over years. Someone who put in decades of paying dues and supporting the lifestyles of the partnership above them, is going to want their turn on top.

As we’ve established time and again in this column, though, the good times are already over. By all appearances, the legal market peaked before the mid-2000s, hasn’t recovered all that well since the Great Recession, and seems poised for another crash if the economy dips again. It’s change or die time.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Overcoming Inertia

There are fundamental mismatches in how Biglaw and Cloudlaw were designed. I’ve [previously](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/sedgwick-death-by-billable-hours/) compared Biglaw to a Rolls Royce. It’s big, fuel-hungry, and oozing with excess, but with a reputation built on decades of high-end performance. Cloudlaw is more like a Tesla. It’s sleek, hip, new, tech-driven, but also has less of a track record and plenty of skeptics ready for it to fail. While both vehicles have the same essential function and shape, they were designed in different times, and address different needs and desires. Mixing and matching their parts could breed success, or it could quickly get weird and ugly. You could theoretically retrofit a Rolls Royce to take a Tesla powertrain, but would it really be worth it? Or would you just end up with a strange combo, a Frankenstein’s vehicle, that tries to be everything and just ends up not really doing anything well?

This isn’t just a metaphor. It’s already happened. As electric car manufacturers started making progress toward marketing full-electric cars, the established fossil-fuel automakers tried to incorporate electric options into their existing vehicles. Some attempts, like the Prius, were successful. Others, like countless [plug-in hybrids](https://www.cars.com/articles/whats-the-difference-between-a-hybrid-and-a-plug-in-hybrid-1420700064361/), got poor reviews for having limited range and being slow — they just don’t seem to do anything well. You can’t slap a Duracell to the bottom of your Model-T and compete with cars designed to be all-electric from the ground up.

The New Breed

The future of brick-and-mortar firms may look a lot like Taylor English, whose founder I quoted at the top of this article. This Atlanta-based firm seems to have found a productive approach to straddling both worlds. Taylor English started out like the [classic boutique firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/virtual-is-the-new-boutique/) built out of dissatisfaction with the strictures of Biglaw. It was founded in 2005, before most of the technical innovations behind Cloudlaw existed, but it already had a Cloudlaw-like ethos embedded in its culture. Compensation was heavily production-based, with big percentages of revenue kicked back to the partner who generated the work. Rates were largely set by the attorneys charging them. Technology was prized, and innovation was key.

Given that its values were already aligned with the Cloudlaw concept, it’s little wonder that Taylor English has flourished in adopting Cloudlaw principles with a brick-and-mortar bedrock. The firm maintains a central office in Atlanta, but new attorneys are offered the opportunity to work remotely, with the overhead savings being passed on to them. Attorneys looking to climb the ranks into equity partnership are encouraged to start establishing a physical presence in the building, since that physical proximity is considered key to developing firm culture (and facilitating cross-sales).

By allowing attorneys to work from home, Taylor English keeps the cost of growth down. Attorneys it chooses to bring in can be incorporated for very little cash outlay as they build their books of business. That low barrier to growth is fundamental to Cloudlaw. Once those books are built, though, it expands its brick-and-mortar presence to facilitate the culture, internal marketing, and community presence advantages that Biglaw has long relied on.

These modern, tech-oriented values married to a traditional practice structure are working well, at least in metropolitan Atlanta. This kind of hybrid model may be the answer that Biglaw firms outside the Am Law 25 need to stay relevant in the modern legal economy. Getting there is going to require some deep soul-searching, and possibly a deconstruction of the basic culture and assumptions underlying many of these firms. It’s not going to be easy, but easy and necessary rarely overlap.

Those willing to question their fundamentals have a shot at staying in the race. Those who don’t are just biding their time until they run out of gas.

# After Last Year's Bonus Bonanza, Biglaw Associates Aren't Expecting Anything Special This Bonus Season
## No special bonuses means less overall compensation for associates. Who's going to fix this?

It’s October 19, and with Halloween nearly upon us, that means bonus season is right around the corner. In years past, Biglaw firms were all about treats, offering pandemic-related special bonuses amid a white-hot lateral market. But here in 2022, some firms are handing out tricks — like $0 in summer bonuses and even layoffs — thanks to a lull in demand for legal services. Associates seem especially anxious about their year-end bonuses. In fact, the thousand-plus respondents to our annual bonus season survey don’t think 2022’s overall bonus compensation will reach anywhere near the heights that last year’s did.

As a little reminder — as if you really needed one — this is what last year’s [Cravath bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/first-mover-on-bonus/) looked like, and this was on top of the [Davis Polk special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/davis-polk-bonuses-21/) (which ranged from $4,000 to $23,000):

- Class of 2021 – $15,000 (pro-rated)
- Class of 2020 – $20,000
- Class of 2019 – $30,000
- Class of 2018 – $57,500
- Class of 2017 – $75,000
- Class of 2016 – $90,000
- Class of 2015 – $105,000
- Class of 2014 – $115,000
This was the first time in years that Cravath had increased the size of its bonuses across all class years. Everyone saw more money, and the most senior associates in Biglaw received $115,000 instead of the usual $100,000. All the Cravath cash plus DPW dollars made for a bountiful Biglaw payday. In short, it was a great year for bonuses. With all of that background, let’s turn to this year’s bonuses.

Considering current economic conditions, what will 2022 bonuses look like?



The majority of associates surveyed (71%) said they don’t expect any change from 2021 bonuses. A minority (8%) expect them to be higher, while 20% believe they will be lower. Biglaw firms better not disappoint when it comes to bonus payouts this year, because we can’t even imagine the state of uproar it would cause among associates.

Will any other money be headed associates’ way? Our survey respondents seem pretty pessimistic when it comes to bonuses on top of bonuses in 2022.

Considering current economic conditions, do you think any additional special bonuses will be offered?



Few associates (8%) expect to see any special bonuses this year. The vast majority of respondents (88%) said they do not believe any additional special bonuses will be offered. Will Davis Polk — or really, any other firm that wants to make a very good name for itself — swoop in to save what would otherwise be a bonus season where associates receive less cash compensation than last year? We suppose we shall see.

For those of you who are wondering when your bank accounts will be a little more flush, here’s a list of the dates when year-end market bonuses hit Biglaw since 2006, the very first year Above the Law started publishing bonus news. Take a look:

- 2021: November 22 ([Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/first-mover-on-bonus/))
- 2020: November 11 ([Baker McKenzie](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/))
- 2019: November 7 ([Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/breaking-biglaw-bonuses-are-here/))

For the past few years, bonus announcements had been made in early to mid-November until Cravath stretched the timeline by a smidge in 2021. Let’s see when our respondents think this year’s first bonus will be announced.

When do you think 2022 bonuses will be announced?



Nearly two-thirds (65%) of respondents believe that bonuses won’t be announced until the fourth week of November or later. Last year, the same proportion (65%) predicted bonuses would be announced before the week of Thanksgiving. This (sort of) lines up with past precedent set by Cravath — if we assume that Cravath will be the first firm on bonuses this year, that is.

Cravath tends to stick to a schedule as far as these things are concerned, and the firm tends to announce its bonus news on either the last Monday in November or the first Monday in the first week of December. But with other firms in the mix — especially firms like Davis Polk and Milbank — it’s really hard to say what will happen. There may be no rhyme nor reason when it comes to this year’s big bonus announcements.

While associates are busy counting down the hours until Bonus Day, they’re likely even busier counting up the hours they’re on track to bill in 2022 to meet bonus eligibility targets. Just how much are associates billing in our “post”-pandemic world? The answer is: not nearly as much as they billed last year, by any stretch of the imagination. Here are the full survey results:

How many hours are you on track to bill in 2022?



The largest group of associates (22%) said they are on track to bill between 2000 and 2099 hours. That’s comparable to last year’s numbers for the same billable hour range (21%). Overall, however, associates report billing fewer hours than last year. While 42% of respondents this year said they are on track to bill 2100 hours or more, in 2021, more than 60% said the same. And whereas last year 19% of associates said they were on track to record fewer than 2000 hours, this year the figure has almost doubled to 37%. Yikes. Maybe this is why associates are so worried about the prospect of layoffs.

But why sour the mood with talk of layoffs? Biglaw associates can soon look forward to their bank accounts being stuffed like the Thanksgiving turkeys they’ll gobble down at the end of next month.

# Beyond Biglaw: Matching Talent To Mission
## As we approach the dog days of August, it's a good time to take stock of personal and firm progress so far in 2016.

As we approach the dog days of August, it’s a good time to take stock of personal and firm progress so far in 2016. Of course, readers of this column know that I am a cheerleader for taking stock as frequently as possible (as long as the process is not too distracting, and is performed with an aim towards shaping future performance based on lessons learned from the past). The more critical your role is at your firm, the more likely that you will be asked to evaluate both your performance and that of others on a more frequent basis. With August’s slower rhythms, however, almost everyone will have a chance to unwind and actually think about where they are career-wise, no matter how senior or junior they are.

When it comes to frequency, a good rule of thumb is that an associate should probably take a look at how their career is unfolding at least every six months. There are at least two parts to the analysis. First, the associate needs to consider how well they are performing relative to their personal career “mission” — that is, how their personal progress towards their career goals is going. Second, the associate needs to evaluate, from the perspective of an army private, how well the firm is performing relative to its mission. The smarter and more attuned the associate, the more granular their analysis will be. But at minimum, associates should not let a year, or even two, go by without stopping their legal research and drafting efforts long enough to pay a little attention to their own progress.

For partners, and in particular your average partner (whose main job it is to bill hours and originate client work), I believe that every three months is a good timeframe for analyzing personal and firm performance. Most well-run law firms will expect their partners to prepare business plans broken up into quarters, and at smaller shops, it is normal for the entire partnership to meet on at least a quarterly basis. In addition to the considerations that I discussed above as part of an associate’s review, partners also need to spend time considering how their marketing efforts are going, and what the firm expects from them in the near-term performance wise. Of course, in today’s environment, it feels like the average partner (especially in Biglaw) is being forced into thinking about their practice in a way more akin to small-firm partners — where the first priority is short-term performance to pay the bills, followed by the luxury of longer-term thinking.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The timeframe is even more compressed for firm leaders, which encompasses anyone with administrative roles at larger law firms (such as a practice group leader), or your average partner at a smaller law firm. These partners are better thought as the actual (or at least equivalent to) business owners, and the health of the business, as well as the contribution of the key personnel, requires analysis on at least a monthly basis. In addition to all the issues that regular partners and associates need to think on, firm leaders must also make sure that the firm is being run in a financially responsible way, and that the administrative staff is performing as needed — in other words, addressing on a monthly basis whether the household budget in order.

Even more difficult, however, is the challenge of firm leadership to set, or as time goes by, reorient, the firm’s mission. Some firms point to their culture as emblematic of the firm’s mission, others to their performance, and yet others to their values. No matter how a firm defines its mission, which is not an easy task in this competitive industry marked by lawyer lateral movement and at times fickle clients, leadership also needs to pay attention to whether the current mix of talent at the firm is equipped to carry out the mission. We are not talking about aimless firms here but ones where the objectives are clear-cut, and the firm is in a position to brutally address whether the talent on hand needs cultivation, replacement, or supplementation in the form of new bodies.

A great articulation of what I am referring to comes from Earnie Stewart, the former soccer star who played for both the U.S. National Team and numerous famous soccer clubs in the world’s top leagues. Stewart is now an executive in Major League Soccer, having won some renown for his management skills while at the helm of a number of foreign clubs. In a recent [podcast](http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/271730668-meninblazers-men-in-blazers-070116-mls-pod-special-with-earnie-stewart.mp3), he described the challenge of starting an executive position in a new league, and in particular for a club that had been in last place during the prior season. For him, there were two immediate steps that needed attention from the get-go. First, that the club define its mission, ideally one that was compatible with the spirit of its home city and ambition. Second, that the analysis then immediately turn towards evaluation of whether the club’s talent is prepared to meet that mission.

We can talk another time about the similarities between club soccer and the law firm world. For now, it is enough for us to realize that strong firms, and strong firm leaders, know how important it is to have a current, vibrant mission for the firm, and the talent to see that mission through. Whether the mission is set as a result of new leadership, or just a fresh take based on the firm’s current market position, a realistic mission is a necessary element of law firms of all sizes.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Ultimately, each one of us can only hope that our firm’s talent meets the firm’s mission — and that our personal talent contributes to the successful performance of the firm’s mission as well. At smaller firms, it is absolutely essential that everyone understand the firm’s mission, and the importance of finding the right talent to meet that mission can’t be overstated. As the dog days approach, they bring with them a prime opportunity to consider how matching talent to mission can contribute to future success.

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm To Merge With Prominent Litigation Boutique

When Fairfax Associates predicted that there would be [“robust” merger activity](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/law-firm-merger-activity-expected-to-increase-thanks-to-recession-fears/) during 2022’s fourth quarter, they weren’t joking. Earlier this week, global giant Dentons announced a [historic combination](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/worlds-biggest-law-firm-gobbles-up-indian-firm-gets-even-bigger-in-historic-move/) with Indian firm Link Legal, and now Am Law top 50 firm Morrison & Foerster is getting in on the action by announcing a tie-up with Durie Tangri.

Here are some details from the firm’s [press release](https://www.mofo.com/resources/news/221012-durie-tangri-to-join-morrison-foerster):

Durie Tangri’s lawyers will further strengthen Morrison Foerster’s intellectual property (IP), complex civil litigation, and trial capabilities and its leading position at the cutting-edge of technology and life sciences. Thirty-six Durie Tangri lawyers are anticipated to join Morrison Foerster, including 12 partners.

“We are thrilled to welcome the Durie Tangri team to Morrison Foerster,” said Eric McCrath, chair of Morrison Foerster. “Their stellar IP, complex civil litigation and trial law capabilities will add significant strength and talent to our ranks on the West Coast. Our shared commitment to serving clients on the forefront of technology and life sciences, while staying true to our values, in particular our commitment to diversity and inclusion, make this the perfect match for our firm.”

“Providing access to Morrison Foerster’s global platform will be transformational for our lawyers’ ability to grow their practices and is a natural next step in our evolution,” said Daralyn Durie. “Morrison Foerster’s deep roots in the Bay Area, continued tradition of leadership in the tech and life sciences sectors, coupled with its well-respected bench of IP lawyers, and premier litigation department all make MoFo the ideal fit for us. We look forward to carrying on its tradition of trial excellence.” Ragesh K. Tangri added: “We are proud of what we have built and achieved in the last several years at Durie Tangri. We look forward to bringing our next generation of diverse trial talent and shared values to the firm, and focusing on developing the best trial teams for clients across MoFo’s global platform and scale.”

In an interview with [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/morrison-foerster-absorbs-california-litigation-firm-durie-tangri-2022-10-12/), McCrath said, “This is actually a dating process that occurred rather quickly.” After a whirlwind legal romance, the two firms went straight from dating to marriage. In a separate interview with [The Recorder](https://www.law.com/therecorder/2022/10/12/morrison-foerster-to-merge-with-durie-tangri/), Durie said that joining forces with MoFo would allow the boutique’s younger lawyers to “spread their wings and grow.” Aww, merger partners love it when you whisper sweet nothings like this.

MoFo will officially welcome Durie Tangri’s lawyers to the firm, effective Jan. 1, 2023. Congratulations and well wishes on a successful merger!

# New Report Explains That No Matter How Objectionable You Thought Jones Day Was, It's Worse
## It's not just what they do, it's how they do it.

It’s not exactly news to point out that Jones Day operates like a cartoonishly evil law firm stereotype. From [shady deals to gerrymander the South](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/gop-lawyer-slams-trump-for-undermining-election-confidence-despite-long-career-of-undermining-election-confidence/) to [disingenuous assaults on voting rights](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/yesterday-was-the-day-america-learned-what-weve-known-about-jones-day-all-along/) to… some [interesting discrimination claims](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/no-you-cant-motivate-paralegals-by-pointing-prop-guns-at-them-is-a-sentence-i-unfortunately-have-to-write/), the firm revels in its dastardly reputation. Wait, go back to that discrimination allegation… pointing guns at paralegals?!?! Obviously that’s not been tested in court yet, but it’s telling that given the firm, we all responded with “that seems entirely plausible.”

Before the Lincoln Project became toxic, it joined other, better organizations like MeidasTouch in trying to [organize a boycott of the institution](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/protests-and-boycotts-come-to-jones-days-doorstep/). [Internal strife rose](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/oh-to-be-a-fly-on-the-wall-at-jones-day-as-dissension-at-the-firm-grows/) and the firm’s reputation among clients [took a tumble](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/the-best-biglaw-firms-in-the-world-according-to-corporate-clients-2021/), but one suspects that clients have started to return as the temperature cooled.

Honestly, I don’t understand how any transactional lawyer with a straightforward line of business allows this drama to unfold around them when it’s so much easier to work almost anywhere else.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But no matter how sharp the cringe you feel any time Jones Day is mentioned, it’s sobering to see everything detailed in one omnibus work. The [Revolving Door Project](https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/) and [People’s Parity Project](https://www.peoplesparity.org/) just released the second report in their ongoing [Biglaw Revolving Door Series](https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/biglaw-revolving-door-series/), tackling [Jones Day](https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jones-Day-Report-Final.pdf) this time around and it’s a doozy.

Jones Day has worked hard to gain a reputation as a BigLaw firm who will take on anyone as a client— representing Big [Tobacco](https://www.jonesday.com/en/practices/experience/2019/03/rj-reynolds-wins-complete-defense-verdict-in-massa), Big [Oil](https://www.jonesday.com/en/practices/experience/2012/06/chevron-defends-against-allegations-of-environmental-damage-from-oil-seeps-off-coast-of-brazil), and Big [Tech](https://www.zdnet.com/article/conflict-of-interest-in-ftcs-doubleclick-hearing/), and even the Bin Laden [family](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/business/jones-day-trump-election-lawsuits.html). Internally, the firm is rife with allegations of [racist behavior](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/lawsuit-alleges-jones-day-doctored-firm-picture-to-make-attorney-look-more-caucasian/?rf=1) and [gender discrimination](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/law-firms-accused-a-2019-roundup-of-controversies). Employees liken Jones Day to a “[fraternity](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/200m-suit-says-women-lawyers-at-jones-day-have-to-be-part-of-fraternity-culture-to-get-ahead)” displaying an “endemic culture of sexual [inappropriateness](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/jones-day-election/).” Externally, they are one of the most notoriously anti-union BigLaw firms, at one point taking on the moniker of the “[go-to](https://www.cjr.org/analysis/jones-day-unions-slate-strike.php) for media executives facing union drives.”

The anti-labor work the firm’s been doing both in the [epic McDonald’s case](https://money.cnn.com/2018/01/11/news/economy/mcdonalds-nlrb-joint-employer/index.html) and with its efforts to ratf**k the [good people over at Slate](https://wwd.com/business-news/media/slate-media-editorial-staff-union-deal-1202965162/) is egregious, but the way they dodged investigations into both Wal-Mart and Jones Day involvement in “pervasive obstruction” [with help from allies in the Trump administration](https://www.propublica.org/article/walmart-was-almost-charged-criminally-over-opioids-trump-appointees-killed-the-indictment) that (temporarily relocated) firm personnel were running really is the chef’s kiss on why an organization like the Revolving Door Project exists.

And that’s the real focus of this report. Because everyone knows what Jones Day does, but they don’t necessarily get how pernicious the firm is. Because we can quibble about where to draw the line on dispassionately advocating for distasteful clients, but that idealistic talk can’t extend to cover lawyers turning around and entering the political branches to enforce these advocacies as policy.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Everyone knows Don McGahn jumped from a firm collecting millions from Trump’s campaigns to running the legal strategy of the White House — which, more than once arguably morphed into acting as Trump’s personal attorney on the taxpayers’ dime — to immediately returning to the firm to collect the spoils. A move that the firm already pulled on a smaller scale when Kevyn Orr became the unelected czar of Detroit, sent big bucks to Jones Day, and [then returned to the firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/jones-day-responds-to-critics-with-standard-petulant-hissy-fit/?rf=1).

But it was more than just McGahn. Noel Francisco and Eric Dreiband also moved back to find their office seats still warm. Just about the only way these lawyers avoided returning to Jones Day was by landing on the federal bench, like [ABA non-qualified Kathryn Mizelle](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/shocking-no-one-aba-thinks-biglaw-associate-not-ready-for-federal-bench/). The report includes a full table of lawyer connections.

And it wasn’t just the Trump administration. Obama also hired a number of Jones Day lawyers like Karen Hewitt:

In one of the most egregious examples, former U.S. Attorney Karen Hewitt, who served under George W. Bush and Barack Obama, [became](https://www.law.com/texaslawyer/2020/10/23/former-u-s-attorney-sues-doj-for-walmart-over-opioid-policies/) the lead counsel in Jones Day’s suit against the Department of Justice for holding Walmart accountable for opioid sales. Hewitt, who [attended](https://www.propublica.org/article/walmart-was-almost-charged-criminally-over-opioids-trump-appointees-killed-the-indictment) conferences for U.S. Attorneys and met with Trump’s Attorney General William Barr while the litigation was ongoing, leveraged her connections within the DOJ to better represent a corporation that contributed to the U.S. opioid epidemic.

Biden placed Jones Day partner Shirlethia Franklin on his transition team, raising eyebrows that another effort to stock the new administration with Jones Day staff was in the offing.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
That’s what makes Jones Day so much more troubling than just a firm advancing retrograde positions in court, it’s a firm that relies on its cross-pollination within the government as part of its brand. “Listen clients, we have all the old senior DOJ staff, we have all the old agency staff, we have all the clerks… and what’s more we have all the folks who are about to senior DOJ staff, and agency staff, and clerks so get on their good side early!” They’re not the only firm to do this, but they’ve become inordinately good at it.

To be completely honest, I’m not opposed to some level of recruiting from private sector lawyers. Some areas of an administration are sufficiently specialized that lawyers practicing at the top of the field are well-suited for the gig. But when that cross-over becomes no more than a sabbatical from Biglaw clients, there are gross ethical implications. Whether the right reform is a time bar on returning to private practice or a ban on returning to the same employer or what is a deeper discussion but it absolutely cannot be the case where resigning to take a government post is a resignation in name only.

# The Imperative Of Identifying Use Cases In Legal Tech: A Guiding Light For Innovation In The Age Of AI
## In the quest to integrate AI and legal technology into legal practice, use cases are not just important but indispensable.

As the legal profession grapples with the digital revolution, the spotlight increasingly falls on artificial intelligence (AI) and legal technology. These tools promise to redefine the contours of legal practice, from automating routine tasks to offering predictive insights. Yet, amidst this technological fervor, a fundamental principle remains paramount: identifying and clearly defining use cases. This principle serves as both a compass and a keystone in successfully integrating technology within the legal sector.

Why Use Cases Matter

Use cases are not just theoretical constructs; they bridge technological potential and practical utility. They articulate how technology can solve specific problems, streamline processes, and enhance decision-making. In the legal domain, where the stakes involve justice, rights, and responsibilities, the clarity and relevance of use cases become even more critical.

Understanding the Legal Landscape

The legal industry is uniquely complex, governed by both the letter and the spirit of the law. This complexity demands that legal tech solutions are innovative and intuitively aligned with legal workflows, ethical standards, and client needs. Here, use cases play a crucial role in guiding the development and implementation of technology that respects and enhances the nuances of legal practice.

Crafting Effective Use Cases in Legal Tech

To harness the full potential of AI and legal technology, stakeholders must engage in a deliberate process of crafting use cases that resonate with the realities of legal work. This process involves several key steps:

- Deep Dive into Legal Workflows
Understanding the intricacies of legal workflows is the first step in identifying areas where technology can make a meaningful impact. This requires a granular analysis of daily tasks, client interactions, and case management procedures, looking for bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and opportunities for enhancement.

- Engagement with Legal Professionals
Technology should serve the needs of its users. Engaging with legal professionals to gather insights, feedback, and aspirations ensures that use cases are grounded in real-world needs and challenges. This collaboration fosters a sense of ownership and receptivity among legal practitioners, which is critical to successfully adopting new technologies.

- Prioritize Client-Centric Solutions
At the heart of legal practice is the client. Use cases should, therefore, prioritize solutions that improve client outcomes, accessibility, and satisfaction. This includes everything from simplifying legal processes for clients to providing more transparent and communicative channels.

- Iterative Refinement and Validation
Use cases are not set in stone; they evolve. An iterative process of refinement and validation, incorporating pilot projects, feedback loops, and performance metrics, ensures that use cases remain relevant and effective in addressing the dynamic needs of legal practice.

The Strategic Value of Use Cases

Identifying use cases is more than an exercise in technological planning; it’s a strategic endeavor that can determine the success or failure of legal tech initiatives. Well-defined use cases:

- Drive Focused Innovation: By highlighting specific needs and challenges, use cases ensure that technological development is purposeful and targeted.
- Facilitate Stakeholder Buy-in: Clear, compelling use cases can demystify technology for legal professionals, fostering an environment of enthusiasm and support for digital initiatives.
- Enhance Client Service: By centering on improvements in client service, use cases ensure that technology contributes to the core mission of legal practice.
Looking Forward: The Role of Use Cases in Shaping Legal Tech

As the legal profession continues to navigate the waters of digital transformation, the importance of use cases stands as a beacon guiding the journey. They are the litmus test for the practical value of technology, ensuring that innovations not only dazzle with potential but also deliver tangible benefits. In the quest to integrate AI and legal technology into legal practice, use cases are not just important but indispensable.

The future of legal tech is not about technology for technology’s sake. It’s about thoughtful, purpose-driven innovation that enhances the practice of law, improves client outcomes, and upholds the principles of justice. Use cases are the roadmap for this future, charting a course for technology that is meaningful, impactful, and aligned with the noble pursuit of law.

The Trump administration’s attack on the result of the 2020 presidential election has once again placed the national focus on the legal profession.

It’s a familiar pattern: Since 2016, public interest and civil rights work has taken on increasing significance, as lawyers challenged the White House in varied areas. Then, in 2020, the coronavirus outbreak created historic demand for a number of critical legal services.

We want to get a sense of how you think the industry performed in rising to these and other challenges — and how these efforts may be shaping the perception of lawyers and law firms.

# Federal Investigators Are Seeking Biglaw Bills As Part Of Probe
## Yeah, Biglaw bills are usually a lot more detailed than that.

The city of Atlanta’s contracting process has been under scrutiny for a while. In fact, it’s been the subject of a widespread federal investigation that has netted five pleas and an additional two indictments. Now the [Atlanta Journal-Constitution is reporting](https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/federal-corruption-probe-reaches-into-atlanta-law-department/N13SZqMZafzIIg9rXr4OnO/) that the investigation has a new line of inquiry, and exactly how the Biglaw firm of Paul Hastings got paid is a big part of it.

According to reports, federal prosecutors are seeking documents related to work Paul Hastings has done on behalf of the city. The probe is also looking at what if any financial relationship exists between former Atlanta City Attorney Cathy Hampton and the Biglaw firm. As it turns out four of the firm’s invoices were flat rates with only a “legal research” notation. Oh, and the firm’s engagement letter — a requirement under Atlanta guidelines — can’t be found:

Four of the bills sought by prosecutors were $25,000 flat-rate invoices for work described only as “Legal Research” invoices. Experts told the AJC the invoices raised questions partly because the city could not produce an agreement, known as an engagement letter, that details the scope of the work to be executed by private attorneys, a requirement under city guidelines.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Those aren’t the only vague invoices at issue. As the AJC reports:

In an arrangement legal experts called unusual, the city paid the firm $2.2 million for vague, unspecified legal work described in invoices as “litigation consultation” and “legal research.”Two of the invoices from 2017 sought by prosecutors contain payments totaling $100,000 for “outside professional services.” The invoices don’t identify who the firm hired or the nature of the services, a lack of specificity that is odd for a large international law firm, according to Peter Henning, a law professor at Wayne State University in Detroit.
“It always comes back to the old Watergate line: Follow the money,” said Henning, who specializes in white collar criminal cases. “You need to find out where did the funding come from and was it properly approved. If it wasn’t, there are a variety of federal statutes that could have been violated.”

Yeah, Biglaw bills are usually a lot more detailed than that.

And that isn’t the only investigation Paul Hastings’ bills to the city of Atlanta has spurred. The Federal Aviation Administration is also looking into whether airport revenue was used to pay legal fees. FAA rules prohibit the use of airport revenue for anything but operations and capital expenses. The FAA has launched an audit of seven years worth of Atlanta airport financial records, and millions of dollars of federal grant money for the airport could be on the line.

# Most Firms Don't Advocate Cultural Genocide Pro Bono, But This Biglaw Firm Will!
## Firm with deep anti-Native rights practice brings assault on Indian Child Welfare Act to SCOTUS free of charge.

No one labors under the illusion that every representation is going to be as morally pure as driven snow. But if you’re going to find yourself defending a client’s right to smother poor people for sport, the least you can do is get paid for it. Student debt doesn’t pay itself!

So when Gibson Dunn takes on a case challenging the Indian Child Welfare Act — a statute designed to remediate the horrific legacy of colonial assault upon native culture — you’re forgiven for assuming the firm is planning to make a mint. But you’d be wrong! Gibson Dunn is arguing this case pro bono.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 emerged as a response to over a century of cultural genocide initiatives on the part of the United States government aimed at eradicating Native peoples through family separation and assimilation efforts putting children through torturous boarding schools. ICWA puts a priority on placing Native children with their families or tribal members. The United Nations has even been asked [to consider ICWA as a model for combatting cultural genocide](https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/The%20Indian%20Child%20Welfare%20Act.v3.pdf). It’s basically the absolute least the United States could do for communities that are still, in fact, sovereign nations.

Three non-Native families are challenging this law at the Supreme Court after seeking custody of Native children. Gibson Dunn would certainly hope the public focuses on their specific clients, a decently off couple who provided foster care for a child in need and ultimately sought to adopt him. This set off a battle when the court ruled that the child be placed with a Navajo couple, but ultimately Gibson’s clients successfully adopted the child.

In fact, two of the families have adopted the children in question and in the case of the one family who didn’t, the child was placed with its grandmother which… seems to be the right result regardless of ICWA. You might wonder why Gibson’s case is still happening given these facts. The Navajo agree, writing in their brief:

Petitioners seek only prospective relief but have no actual or redressable injuries. They are also improperly attempting to bypass state court systems—the courts in which ICWA cases are actually litigated—and to concoct a sprawling, abstract federal facial challenge to the statute.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Because, like most Supreme Court cases, the matter isn’t really about the welfare of any individual litigant. The case is just an invitation to a general broadside against race-conscious legislation, asking the justices to deem ICWA an impermissible race-based preference to toss aside [right next to affirmative action](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/supreme-court-reminded-that-harvards-real-diversity-problem-is-the-lack-of-smart-conservatives/).

And that’s [where the money behind these suits comes in](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2022/11/supreme-court-indian-child-welfare-act-native-sovereignty-icwa-tribes/). Per Mother Jones:

In all three lawsuits, non-Native foster parents wanted to adopt Native children; two of the three were ultimately successful in doing so. But the foster parents—along with the attorneys general for three states, with the backing of deep-pocketed right-wing groups like the Goldwater Institute and the Bradley Foundation—are suing the federal government and five tribes on the grounds that ICWA represents race-based discrimination and an overly intrusive federal government.

Remember when I [recently praised the Goldwater Institute](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/state-denies-admission-for-ny-licensed-lawyer-to-strike-a-blow-for-what-exactly/) but cautioned that I’m generally not on their side? This is why. As Mother Jones notes, the right-wing groups throwing money toward this case have deep ties to fossil fuel companies — an industry that generally challenges tribal sovereignty at every juncture. Tribes can’t stop companies from poisoning the water if they don’t have rights!

Although, that doesn’t totally explain how Gibson Dunn got mixed up doing this case for free. To resolve that mystery, you need to know a little bit more about Gibson Dunn’s niche anti-Natives practice:

Then there’s Gibson Dunn, the law firm which has been representing the Brackeens pro bono. The firm has represented plaintiffs in several cases that take issue with laws specific to Native communities; Matthew McGill, the lawyer representing the Brackeens, also serves as counsel for a casino company in a federal case arguing that the Washington law limiting sports wagering to tribal entities is discriminatory. Gibson Dunn is known for representing Chevron in the decade-long lawsuit brought by indigenous communities in Ecuador, as well as the corporation behind the Dakota Access Pipeline.

Chevron and casino companies. Taking a financial loss litigating a family law case is a small investment toward advancing the interests of the rest of the firm’s clients in diminishing the last, tenuous pockets of tribal sovereignty. And that might be a business decision the firm likes, but make no mistake that it is a business decision. All the “everyone deserves a lawyer” rhetoric doesn’t play here — the firm is taking on a pro bono case for a family with seemingly no injuries as part of a broad attack on tribal rights.

So unless John Roberts decides to slink out of the case on standing, expect  another 5-4 decision eroding Native rights.

At least Gorsuch’s dissent is going to be straight fire.

On-campus recruiting is underway at law schools around the country and that means the monumental decision of which firm to start your career at is weighing heavily on the minds of lots of law students right now.

Figuring out which Biglaw firm to join is an important decision. Not only does it impact the kind of work you get to do, it gives your career a particular trajectory, and can have a massive influence on your sense of well-being and mental health. But how do you know which firm is right for you?

Some folks will tell you to rely on your gut instinct, and that’s important — of course it is! But the interview process — no matter how thorough — is designed to only give you a small window into a firm, and a favorable one at that. Think about it, no firm has the ill-tempered partner conducting interviews. So, you try to delve into mountains of data about firms, but digging through everything to make sure you make an apples-to-apples comparison can be difficult. LOTS of firms say they pay market bonuses, but a firm that only ponies up market bonuses at 2,100 hours is very different than one with no hours requirement.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
So, to help you sort through all that data, Above the Law has the 2022 version of the[ Law Firm Transparency Directory](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firm-transparency/), powered by Leopard Data Solutions. We give you easy access to the intel you really need to make these incredibly important decisions. Yes, the basic info is there like the salary deets, bonus numbers with hours requirements, and head count. But so is some deep stuff, like average length of attorney tenure, promotion rate, the caregiver leave available, a full list of benefits, the legal superstars at the firm, whether the firm has a mandatory arbitration clause, and — of course — some selected Above the Law coverage to get a real sense of what life at the firm is like. The directory is currently populated with the top 100 Biglaw firms, but we’re growing the list.

Plus, you can select a limited number of firms (like, for instance, the two firms you have offers from) and create a personalized direct comparison between them. It really is the ideal way to compare and contrast the Biglaw firms where you’re considering starting your career.

You’ll notice[ Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) is already here, natch, and yup that’s [Debevoise](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/debevoise-and-plimpton-matches-cravath/) over there. [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) and[ Simpson Thacher](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/) got here a little early, but really if it wasn’t for them, there’d be no party at all. Now that you’re here, certainly even more firms will show up for Salary War 2018 — The Party Of The Decade.

Yes, it is true — Paul Weiss just announced they are increasing associate compensation to the levels set earlier this week by Cravath and giving the special summer bonuses that Simpson made all the rage with their announcement last week. You can read the full memo from the firm on the next page, but the most important info — the cold, hard cash associates are taking home — is as follows:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
This, of course, brings Paul Weiss to the top of the compensation game –though they’re early to match the standard set by others, they aren’t leading the charge. Given the [profitability of the firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/the-billion-dollar-biglaw-firms-that-have-not-raised-associate-salaries/) — top in Biglaw according to the most recent Am Law numbers — it isn’t surprising that they matched the top numbers.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

# Lawsuit Alleges Biglaw Counsel Attempted To Rape Paralegal
## UPDATE- the firm issued a statement saying this morning they terminated the attorney alleged to have sexually assaulted the plaintiff.

A shocking complaint has been filed in the Southern District of New York against Biglaw firm Fox Rothschild and counsel at the firm, [Ian W. Siminoff](https://www.foxrothschild.com/ian-w-siminoff/). A former paralegal, Stephanie Jones, alleges claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, New York State Human Rights Law and the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination. The complaint details escalating instances of sexual assault and harassment over a three year period.

The complaint alleges Siminoff repeatedly subjected Jones to physical touching, fondling her breasts and vagina:

On one occasion, while in Siminoff’s office, he closed the door and fondled Ms. Jones’s breasts. Ms. Jones pushed him off, told him to stop and left his office.

Siminoff’s attacks on Ms. Jones extended beyond the breast fondling attack in his office. He would stop by Ms. Jones’s desk and attempt to fondle her breasts and her body through her clothes.

On one occasion, when both were at the coffee machine, Siminoff put his hands under Ms. Jones’ dress and grabbed at her vagina.

Ms. Jones never touched Siminoff. Rather, she kept him at arm’s length to the extent she could.

According to the complaint, these physical assaults escalated to attempted rape:

In January 2015, after 5:30 p.m., during the work week, Ms. Jones found herself nearly alone on the 4th floor of the NJ office with Siminoff. During this encounter, Siminoff pushed Ms. Jones into a deserted bathroom and tried to have sexual intercourse with her.

Ms. Jones fought off Siminoff’s sexual assault.

In addition to the physical assaults, the complaint also details the sexual harassment Jones was allegedly subjected to. [The complaint](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/fox-rothschild-lawsuit-sexual-assault/2/) has over six pages of inappropriate texts that Siminoff sent to Jones. Some of what he allegedly texted Jones includes:

- “Don’t mind me, I’m just laying here at 3 am thinking about kissing your breasts.”
- “I’d like to pour that glass of wine on your naked body. As I see it, it trickles down your breasts, in between them, to in between your legs.”
- “I’m doing what I usually do when I think of you.”
- “Dreams about you last night. I always cum when I think of you!”
- “Let me know if you want to know how I did you in my dream, too”
- “I suppose there is the possibility, mind you, just a possibility, that kissing could lead to me doing you from behind?”
- “Three different images, one after the other: 1) you spitting my cum into my ex’es hair; 2) you inserting veggies into her ass; and 3) you fucking Andy while I was sleeping”

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Siminoff also allegedly sent Jones pictures of his genitals. The complaint says that when Jones would block Siminoff from sending her texts, he would harass her until she relented.

The complaint also alleges that when Jones complained to the Office Administrator that Siminoff made her uncomfortable and was inappropriate, she was denied her request to no longer work with Siminoff. The complaint further alleges she was told if she was unhappy at the firm there were “plenty of other places to work.”

Tyrone A. Blackburn, attorney for the plaintiff, had this comment about the lawsuit:

“The discrimination, harassment and intimidation apparently rampant at Fox Rothschild epitomize precisely the hallmarks of sexual abuse that the #MeToo movement has chronicled and seeks to combat. That Ms. Jones suffered not just the indignity of harassing behavior but also her employer’s failure to act when she reported it is as appalling as it is illegal.”

UPDATE: Tom Paradise, General Counsel at Fox Rothschild provided the following statement:

We are disturbed by the details alleged in the complaint filed today in the Southern District of New York. The attorney who was named a defendant in the suit was terminated this morning from Fox Rothschild.

The filing omits facts and contains inaccuracies. We believe once brought to light, those facts will demonstrate that Fox Rothschild takes any reporting of harassment as serious and conducts thorough investigations of such reported allegations, as noted in our Harassment-Free Workplace Policy.

At no time prior to Ms. Jones’ termination from the firm did she report any incidents of harassment by Ian Siminoff as detailed in her complaint.

# Associate Raises Sealed With A Kiss!
## Another raise on a busy day for announcements.

Look, there aren’t any good puns to use off of Seward. Riffing on Alaska being Seward’s Folly seems very obscure for a story like this one. And something about Han Solo making the KISSEL run in less than 12 parsecs? I don’t even know how we’d work that in. So you’re getting a sealed with a kiss take and you’re going to like it.

Anyway, Seward & Kissel doesn’t play the Am Law 100 game so we don’t have those numbers to share, but it’s letting its compensation do the talking when it comes to reporting the health of the firm. They’re doing just fine.

As of July 1, associates will be making the now-prevailing market scale. The [full memo is available here](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-Associate-Base-Compensation.pdf), but here are the salary figures:

From Pilot and Above The Law  


The memo informs associates that there will be bonus structure updates “in the near future” so there’s more news to come out of this firm! Congrats.

Please help us help you when it comes to salary news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Salary) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Salary”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Salary & Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# The 2022 Litigation Finance Survey Report
## A majority of lawyers surveyed said litigation finance has become more relevant to their practice.

Every year since 2017, Lake Whillans and Above the Law have asked in-house counsel and law firm attorneys to share their perspectives on third-party litigation funding. The most recent survey results underscore the extent to which litigation finance has become an established feature of the industry landscape as a means of managing risk and reducing pressure on a company’s legal budget.

Three years ago, we witnessed a watershed in the field’s development, when the percentage of attorneys who had firsthand experience with litigation finance jumped nearly 30 points, from 41 percent to 70 percent. Since then, the proportion of respondents reporting direct experience with litigation funding has remained above 60 percent. 

This year, more than 90 percent of these respondents said they would use litigation finance again. And nearly 70 percent of all respondents said that litigation finance has become more relevant to their practice in the last year. As one attorney explained, “Companies are looking for creative ways to cut costs and hedge litigation expense and risks.”

[Check out the full report on our survey findings here](https://lakewhillans.com/research/2022-litigation-finance-survey-report/).

Even though President Trump’s legal options for undoing the election results are rapidly dwindling — seriously, he’s basically down to a Third Circuit appeal on whether he can amend his complaint or a loophole in whatever Faustian deal he signed to get elected in the first place — the impacts on the legal profession will live beyond his term in office. The lawyers involved in the various election litigations have just gotten blasted from all sides.

District court Judge Matthew Brann [wrote ](https://electionlawblog.org/wp-content/uploads/gov.uscourts.pamd_.127057.202.0_1-1.pdf)a blistering indictment of the lack of evidence and coherent legal arguments in the Pennsylvania case that will long live in the [annals of benchslaps](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/benchslap/):

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

One might expect that when seeking such a startling outcome, a plaintiff would come formidably armed with compelling legal arguments and factual proof of rampant corruption, such that this Court would have no option but to regrettably grant the proposed injunctive relief despite the impact it would have on such a large group of citizens. That has not happened.

And the Biglaw firms that lent their credibility to the affair, like [Jones Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/jones-day/) and, for a time, [Porter Wright](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/another-biglaw-firm-withdraws-from-election-litigation-no-not-jones-day/) and [Snell & Wilmer](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/biglaw-firm-withdraws-from-election-litigation-before-they-get-jones-day-ed/), have been rightly [criticized](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/you-have-to-watch-the-opening-salvo-in-the-anti-jones-day-ad-campaign/) (and [picketed](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/protests-and-boycotts-come-to-jones-days-doorstep/)) both [internally](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/even-jones-day-lawyers-are-giving-trumps-election-lawsuits-some-serious-side-eye/) and by [observers](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/jones-day-to-prepare-for-a-bad-pr-campaign-the-likes-of-which-theyve-never-seen-before/). Though the feeling that these representations were outside of the legal norm was prevalent, it was largely anecdotal.  Now, we have some good old numbers to match that sense.

Fishbowl, a workplace social network for verified employees, [conducted a survey](https://www.fishbowlapp.com/insights/2020/11/16/fishbowl-survey-75-percent-of-lawyers-would-not-defend-trump/) of 4,546 verified law professionals in the U.S. on their app. They asked a simple, yes/no question: “Would you support your firm if it represented the Trump campaign as it files lawsuits challenging the outcome of the election in several states?”

An overwhelming number — 74.92 percent — answered no. Fishbowl also broke out the results by location, and the place with the highest percentage of “no” answers was Washington, D.C., with 97.44 percent. That was followed by Massachusetts (81.92 percent) and Maryland (81.25 percent). And even the places with the highest percentage of “yes” answers, still, on balance, were resoundingly against the idea of standing behind your firm as it litigates on behalf of the Trump campaign (64.41 percent of lawyers in North Carolina said “no” to the question, which corresponds to the highest “yes” answers).

Now the really interesting data:

Out of the 103 Jones Day law professionals who answered the Fishbowl survey question, only 22.3% (23 in total) responded with Yes, almost 3 points lower than the overall survey average.

I told you[ folks there aren’t happy](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/oh-to-be-a-fly-on-the-wall-at-jones-day-as-dissension-at-the-firm-grows/). And I guess when the situation isn’t a mere hypothetical, there’s a bit more clarity.

In-house counsel know law firms better than the firms know themselves. They know which firms are reliable. They know which firms are getting by on reputation and which firms to bet on when the company is at stake.

ATL is putting together a list of the best outside counsel based on the perspective of in-house counsel. Please take this [1-minute survey](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0livDRSCGGHHHlX) here and tell us which outside firms you use, why they’re great (or not), and how you learned about them.

You know better than anybody who to call when you need a job done.

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Does An About Face On COVID-19 Austerity Measures, And Makes Associates Whole With Special Payments
## The firm seems to have made it through the worst of their COVID austerity measures.

Whew, it’s been a real roller coaster over at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.

COVID-19 has made the whole world topsy turvey, but it’s been especially volatile at Bryan Cave. First they assured their employees that the firm [would be able to get by](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-biglaw-firms-rolling-out-good-news-for-now/?rf=1) without making associate or staff salary cuts, furloughs, or layoffs. But then then did they exact opposite, [cutting salaries for all employees](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-50-bclp-salary-cuts/) making over $40,000 by 15 percent, conducting [associate and staff layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/am-law-50-firm-to-lay-off-lawyers-and-staff-close-office/), and even [closing an office](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/am-law-50-firm-to-lay-off-lawyers-and-staff-close-office/). Then things seems to turn a corner for the firm when BCLP [reduced its pay cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/biglaw-firms-do-an-about-face-on-pay-cuts/) to 7.5 percent, and then [completely rolling back](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/am-law-50-firm-completely-reverses-its-pay-cuts-announces-some-bonus-news/) those compensation cuts.

Now the firm has announced supplemental payments (in the next practicable pay period) equaling the amount employees’ pay was docked. That’s a great way to signal the end of COVID austerity. You can read the full announcement from the firm [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/bclp-retroactive-pay/2/)

# The Ex-Skadden Associate Jailed As Part Of The Mueller Probe Can't Be A Lawyer Anymore

Alex van der Zwaan (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)

Last year, [Alex van der Zwaan](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/alex-van-der-zwaan/?rf=1), a former associate at the London office of Skadden Arps, [pleaded guilty](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/former-skadden-associate-who-pleaded-guilty-in-mueller-probe-begs-for-no-jail-time/) to charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller. He’d worked on the controversial report written by the firm justifying the prosecution of former Russian-aligned Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych’s political rivals, and was indicted for lying to investigators in the Russia probe about his communications with former Trump campaign aide Rick Gates. He served 30 days in jail and was fined $20,000. Though that wasn’t the end of his punishment.

His lawyers already acknowledged that van der Zwaan’s career as a lawyer was functionally over when he pleaded guilty to a felony saying his “professional life has been destroyed” as part of their sentencing memo in the case. And now comes the final nail in his career as an attorney.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As[ reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/07/11/ex-skadden-associate-struck-off-by-sdt-for-lying-in-mueller-probe-292-49577/) Law.com, van der Zwaan’s law license was taken away by the U.K.’s Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal (SDT), and he was ordered to pay costs totaling $3,878. The outcome was part of an agreed upon deal, and van der Zwaan has accepted responsibility for his actions:

An SDT document published Thursday said: “The respondent accepts full responsibility, admits that he is solely responsible for his conduct, and is remorseful and has demonstrated a high degree of insight.”

Van der Zwaan had been an associate at Skadden for 10 years before he got caught up in the Mueller probe and was fired from the Biglaw giant in 2017.

# 'Do Them Your F**king Self,' Departing Associate Tells Partner

Departure memos that make the pages of Above the Law rarely find a [satisfied](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/lawyer-writes-epic-departure-memo-actually-seems-happy/), [happy](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/03/departure-memo-of-the-day-a-love-letter-to-a-biglaw-firm/) associate on the other end of the keyboard. More often, we profile memos happily [napalming the bridges](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/10/contract-attorney-rips-biglaw-supervisor-in-farewell-email/) behind their author.

This message falls in the latter category. We don’t have a lot of details to share about this one — we weren’t told the firm involved — but our tipster claims that this was sent on Friday to a partner by a departing associate and the exiting lawyer felt the need to copy the managing partner, the human resources department, the other associates, and the paralegals on the message for the sake of completeness.

Seems as though there may be some raw feelings there. Right now, I just feel bad for “scratched out replacement lawyer” because she’s walking into a hornet’s nest. Maybe we’ll get to see her departure memo soon enough.

Ed. Note: As the decade comes to a close, Above the Law presents you a special [Trivia Question of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/) series in remembrance of the Biglaw firms we lost in the 2010s.

What now defunct Biglaw firm was founded in 1891 in Boston and grew to have nine offices around the U.S. as well as five international offices?

Hint: Though the firm survived the 2009 recession, tensions from mergers (and major litigation drying up) are largely credited with leading to the firm’s 2014 dissolution. The immediate preceding event? When 750 attorneys (226 of which were partners) left the firm for Morgan Lewis & Bockius.

# Why You Should Consider Boston Now
## You’ll have the chance to be part of building a firm’s practice at a time of real growth and innovation.

Boston is a growing and dynamic legal market. Lateral hiring — among new offices and the more established Boston offices — is stronger than ever. If you have a background in tech or the life sciences or if you’re a talented corporate lawyer with any background, you will likely find opportunities in Boston you will not find elsewhere: opportunities that combine sophisticated and cutting-edge work, market or above-market pay, a collegial culture, and clear pathways for advancement.

New players on the Boston scene

In recent years, numerous international firms have opened new offices in Boston, including Kirkland, Sidley, Wilson Sonsini, Morrison & Foerster, Orrick, and White & Case. All of these firms are hoping to carve out a significant share of the market with respect to Boston’s core industries: tech, biotech, health care, and other life sciences-related businesses.

Sophisticated work, top clients

High-profile clients offer challenging and cutting-edge work. Clients of the Boston offices include Pfizer, Raytheon, Staples, Biogen, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Timberland, Gillette, Dunkin Donuts, General Electric, State Street Bank, New Balance, Liberty Mutual, Bain Capital, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Keurig Green Mountain, HubSpot, and of course the best sports team in the world, the Boston Red Sox.

Top practices

The new Boston offices and the established Boston firms are all looking to expand their corporate practices. Most in demand are private equity lawyers — PE M&A, PE finance, and fund formation. Emerging companies and venture capital work is also booming, as well as technology transactions. For intellectual property lawyers with a hard sciences background, there are numerous opportunities. Real estate lawyers have been consistently in demand in recent years. Even capital markets, a traditionally NY-based practice, is gaining ground in Boston.

Salaries and cost of living

Most of the top Boston offices pay New York market salaries, i.e., first-years start at $190,000. Some of these firms have bonus schemes that will put you above market pay when you bill over the hours target. Pair that with a 5.05 percent state income tax and no city tax (compared to a combined state and city tax rate above 10 percent for most New York associates). Furthermore, every dollar goes further in Boston. [NALP statistics](https://www.nalp.org/class_of_2016_buying_power_index) from 2018 show that $116,820 will buy you in Boston what $180,000 will buy you in New York City.

Pathways to Partnership

Making partner at a major law firm is always difficult and never guaranteed. However, joining a new office or an established office at the start of a growth phase can often give you a leg up when it comes time for advancement decisions. No matter how impressive your legal skills, firms won’t promote unless there’s a business case. Where practices and client bases are growing as they are now in Boston, that business case is more certain.


Hiring Trends

Needing ties to Boston to find a job in Boston or to succeed in that job is a thing of the past. Of course firms will want some assurance that you won’t just leave after your first winter in Beantown. But they also recognize that bringing in associates with training from other major markets, especially New York, only adds to a firm’s ability to handle the most sophisticated work. They encourage the idea that Boston is no longer just a market for associates “moving home”; Boston has become a destination for lawyers looking to advance their careers.

Despite high standards for hiring, Boston firms are often more flexible than New York firms when it comes to more superficial factors. For example, they will often consider associates outside the traditionally coveted 3-5 years’ experience range, and they will be more willing to relocate associates even without the local bar.

***

This is an exciting time to work in Boston. Whether you join a new firm to the Boston market or an established Boston firm, you’ll have the chance to be part of building the firm’s practice at a time of real growth and innovation.

It’s important to work with a recruiter who is knowledgeable about the specific market. Lateral Link is unique in that each recruiter specializes in one or just a few markets where we have practiced ourselves and/or where we are on the ground to build relationships with the firms’ key players. I work closely with a wide range of Boston firms. I can help you navigate the lateral hiring trends and can help answer questions such as:

- How important is it that I have the Massachusetts before starting my search?
- When in my career and when in the calendar year is the ideal time to move to or within Boston?
- Would a particular lateral move bring me closer to my ultimate career goals?
- Which Boston firms will be most interested in a candidate with a profile and skill set such as mine?
- Which Boston firms will allow me to broaden/focus my practice?
Please reach out to me at agordon@laterallink.com to learn more about the best Boston opportunities for your specific skills and experience.

# Biglaw Firm Closes Offices After Employee Dies, Enacts Work-From-Home Policy
## What is your firm doing to protect lawyers and staff from COVID-19?

We have some incredibly sad news from Bellevue, Washington, where an executive legal assistant at Davis Wright Tremaine, has died from unknown causes. According to a statement from Jeff Gray, the firm’s managing partner, Lisa Carney was 60 years old and had been with the firm for more than 16 years. Carney reportedly left the office on Tuesday because she had flu-like symptoms, worked from home on Wednesday, and was found dead in her home on Thursday morning.

Perhaps believing that this was too close to the epicenter of the coronavirus breakout in the area, DWT has rolled out a plan to protect its employees. Here’s an excerpt from Gray’s statement on Carney’s unexpected passing (available in full on the next page):

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Since we do not yet know the cause of her death, in the interest of the health and well-being of all our employees, we are closing our Bellevue and Seattle offices until further notice and have asked everyone in those offices to work remotely. In addition, we have asked those in the Bellevue office to self-quarantine according to the CDC’s guidelines during that time.

While carefully navigating the death of an employee that could be related to coronavirus, the firm is also dealing with another office that was possibly exposed:

Yesterday, we were also told of a confirmed case of an individual, not from our firm but in the building where our Portland office is located, who has tested positive for COVID-19. Therefore, we have also decided to close our Portland office and have asked everyone in that office to work remotely today while it is deep cleaned.

Because of all of these unfortunate things happening at once, DWT has decided to offer all its employees work-from-home capabilities:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
We are instructing our employees in all our other offices to work remotely if possible, starting Monday, March 16. We are continuing to carefully monitor this situation across the firm and are prepared to implement additional measures to ensure safety.

We here at Above the Law would like to extend our sincere condolence to Lisa Carney’s friends, family, and colleagues, and thank Davis Wright Tremaine for its delicate handling of the situation so that all employees are protected from harm.

UPDATE (3/16/20): Here’s some additional information on Lisa Carney’s death from Jeff Gray, managing partner of Davis Wright Tremaine:

We’ve received confirmation from Washington state health authorities that our colleague Lisa Carney passed away from an underlying health condition unrelated to COVID-19 and tested negative for the virus. We continue to ask all attorneys and staff to work remotely across all firm offices, including Seattle, Portland and Bellevue, for the foreseeable future. We’re all still grieving this loss to our community and are making arrangements to celebrate Lisa’s life and service to the firm. We’re grateful for our firm’s continued commitment to each other and our clients and for the outpouring of support from the entire legal community over the past few days.

Biglaw watchers are probably exhausted from hearing about the [intense lateral market](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/the-biglaw-lateral-market-is-fire-right-now/). It’s a [recurrent theme](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/biglaw-job-offers-without-interviews-what-hath-the-hot-lateral-market-wrought/) that has [ripple effects](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2022-associate-salary-increase/) throughout the industry. Given that backdrop, it probably isn’t surprising that we now have on our hands the largest lateral move in 20 years (outside of a firm merger context).

A whopping 43 attorneys are moving from Stroock & Stroock & Lavan to Paul Hastings — essentially transplanting the entire restructuring team from one firm to another. Involved in the move are 18 partners and 25 associates and counsel who will arrive at Paul Hastings over the course of April. Law.com [has the details](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2022/03/31/in-unicorn-deal-paul-hastings-lures-43-lawyer-restructuring-team-from-stroock/):

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Kristopher Hansen leads the team moving from Stroock to Paul Hastings, and heads up the advance group arriving next week. Also arriving ahead of the full team are Alex Cota, Daniel Fliman, Brett Lawrence, Jayme Goldstein, Jon Canfield, Matt Schwartz, Erez Gilad, Frank Merola, Allison Miller and Sayan Bhattacharyya.

All the new arrivals will be based in New York except Merola, who is located in Los Angeles.

Hansen, who was Stroock’s financial restructuring group practice leader, will be co-chair of Paul Hastings’ restructuring practice, serving aside existing chair Luc Despins. Cota led Stroock’s specialty finance business unit, Fliman led its impact litigation unit, and Lawrence led distressed M&A.

Paul Hastings chair-elect Frank Lopez pointed to the unique nature of the move, saying it’s “one of those unicorn situations that happens once in a decade in the legal market.”

“It is an elite team of restructuring special situations lawyers coming together with the great foundation we already have in restructuring,” said Lopez, noting that while the combination of the teams would be “incredible in any market,” the timing seemed particularly good as macroeconomic indicators—such as rising interest rates, inflation and geopolitical turmoil—point to a climate that could lead to “distress.”

And the new co-chair seems pretty pleased with his new Biglaw home:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“What was so attractive for us about Paul Hastings was their absolute powerhouse reputation in areas such as specialty lending, structured products, private equity and other important financial services areas. From a marketplace perspective, being able to link up with a team with their level of eliteness is really exciting—and we think it will be groundbreaking,” said Hansen, noting that Paul Hastings already had a “robust” restructuring practice with a significant presence in key restricting areas like official committees and debtor-side clients, as well as a global footprint reaching the U.K., France, Germany and Latin and South America. “From day one, we are going to be literally the number one or two practice in the creditor side of the restructuring market, and then grow from there.”

Not that he’s willing to badtalk his old firm:

Hansen called Stroock a “wonderful firm” with “amazing practices” in real estate, litigation, insurance- and financial-related services, and intellectual property.

“The sky’s the limit for them because those practices are growing and thriving at the firm,” he said. “They’ve also got a great and growing footprint in LA, Miami, D.C. and New York, and they have been an absolutely wonderful firm to work for and be part of for the last 28 years.”

And Stroock has been busy capitalizing on the hot lateral market themselves — adding 20 lateral partners over the last year and a half. Stroock co-chair Jeff Keitelman said the firm is pursuing its “midsize approach” saying, “Obviously we’re personally sad to see the group go. They are a talented and accomplished team who’ve made solid contributions to our firm over many year. We understand that they want a larger platform and all that goes with it. This is simply an instance of interests diverging. It’s a respectful and congenial parting of the ways, and we wish them well.”

# On ‘The Business Case’: A Succinct Explanation Of Why Your Firm Will Need Black Attorneys, Eventually
## Reasons why your firm must meaningfully fix issues that serve as impediments to the full cultivation and promotion of Black legal talent.

Juneteenth: A Prelude

With the historic occasion of many Biglaw firms designating today, Friday June 19th (also known as Juneteenth, Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, or Jubilee), as firm-wide holidays, I would like to begin by speaking to this moment.

Juneteenth commemorates the day enslaved Texan-Americans received the news that they had been free citizens for two years. And in 2020, a large portion of corporate America is acknowledging Juneteenth and encouraging employees to take time to reflect. Understanding America’s untaught history and doing the emotional labor to pursue racial healing are integral to our society moving forward. And racial healing work is not just for White people. If a system is dysfunctional, no one can move through it unscathed. We all have work to do.

While I am encouraged by what I see, there are some who posit that much of this activity from corporate America is “performative” in nature and there are few sincere intentions to move the needle on racial justice issues. I disagree and continue to remain cautiously optimistic. It seems that America has finally begun to reach an inflection point with many agreeing that it is no longer tenable for the status quo to remain the same.

I think the Juneteenth celebrations are indicia that we are moving closer to The Moment, a concept I describe in detail below. And it is my hope that readers of this column will do their part to practice courage, boldness, and further advance the cause of justice and equality for all.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
This is an article I should not have to write. But recognizing that there are now, and will continue to be in the future, certain individuals in influential positions who will fail to understand and embrace beneficent concepts like “diversity” and “inclusion” for their virtue, I thought it would be worthwhile to explain the case for Black attorneys (and generally all minorities) in your Biglaw firm from a perspective that is somewhat motivational to every American. Yes, the financial incentive, or as Diversity & Inclusion professionals the world over have summarized, “the business case.”

I hope you can understand the reticence within my heart as I write today, for what human being could possibly be eager to undertake the task of attempting to convince others she is worthy of equal treatment and opportunity by pointing to the economic benefits to be gained by others?

Returning to the matter at hand, what is meant when people refer to “the business case” for diversity? The pitch typically goes like this: in order to generate the best ideas (and therefore, create the most cutting-edge work product for your clients), you will need to generate diversity of thought. And diversity of thought is created by (i) gathering a group of people who have had different life experiences and (ii) asking them to engage one another in discussions on any given topic. Diversity leads to more unique solutions, because as people with different perspectives wrestle with ideas, they challenge one another, strengthening the value of their collective output. This is a straightforward argument supported by a number of studies: collective diversity of thought outweighs groupthink.

I tend to find the traditional presentation of the business case unconvincing. After all, the current diversity numbers in Biglaw firms are awful and yet, financially, no firm seems to be facing any negative impacts as a direct result. If the traditional case were truly compelling, there would be a sense of urgency striking the industry and we would have already seen changes in numbers and lasting solutions. Yet, we see institutional clients continue to re-engage their favorite firms: cases are tried, deals are closed, fees are collected, and the world keeps turning. We must only conclude from the current state of things that the general quality of work being done in the marketplace is sufficient, and the ingenuity being lost because four out of five voices in the room are White men from your city’s nearest affluent suburb is immaterial to your client’s bottom line.

Today in 2020, it remains somewhat acceptable that there are law firms operating with no Black attorneys or a handful of juniors and few to no equity partners, and people will point to a plethora of reasons. Most frequently we hear about the “pipeline issue” — as though it is an impossibility for every firm to follow the few pioneers who have begun recruiting from Howard University and other predominantly Black law schools. Sadly, I suspect, depending on the results of the upcoming presidential election, the status quo may remain somewhat acceptable for about four more years. But, after that, and depending on how the Republic fares, I believe there will be an even stronger and more undeniable push towards racial equity.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
There is a tide in America which has ebbed and flowed since the country’s inception. And in recent years, certainly following recent events, this tide is beginning to rise faster — the undercurrent of the tide’s waves calling forth justice, equity, and equality is becoming stronger and stronger. Race relations between Black and White America are coming to a head; and soon, a loud crescendo will burst. This moment will be “The Moment,” and once it arrives, it will no longer be possible for individuals and organizations to remain silent and complicit bystanders regarding issues of social importance. There will be a painful clarity revealing where everyone stands; indeed, where everyone has stood all along.

And when The Moment comes, your firm may have a crisis, because it will no longer be socially acceptable to operate corporate America generally, and Biglaw firms specifically, as bastions of wealth that are playgrounds for certain types of people only.

Millennial and Gen Z generations differ from those who came before us.

We live our values loudly and let them seep into every aspect of our existence. Even financial analysts have cautioned that businesses must change their operations, because our generations focus on consumption and spending as an ethical concern, in a way that differs from our predecessors. It is not enough to simply post on social media that you care about the environment or #blacklivesmatter, because we conduct our due diligence. We are checking companies’ carbon footprints and looking at the photos of their executive leadership. And, if your firm is currently verbalizing a commitment to any sort of social or ethical value, you should have your proverbial “house in order,” lest we discover you have attempted to take advantage of critical social causes in order to seem “on-trend” and relevant to national discourse.

Remember, we are the generation that invented “cancel culture” (a phenomenon which capitalizes on social media to destroy a company or individual’s reputation in record speed). If a company does something that offends the senses of the majority, for better or worse, that company will likely “be canceled,” and we will stop any and all forms of support. It does not matter if your business has been wildly successful for decades, with cancel culture, no company is ever “too big to fail.”

Consider what happened to Starbucks in the past few weeks. Initially, on June 4th, Starbucks tweeted: “Black lives matter. We are committed to being a part of change.” But, in its next breath, the company advised employees not to wear any clothing echoing the same sentiment (citing such clothing as a violation of company policy). Uproar ensued, calls to boycott were made, and in a sudden change of heart, less than a week later, Starbucks announced it was distributing 250,000 Starbucks-branded t-shirts to its employees with slogans such as “Black Lives Matter” and “It’s not a moment, It’s a movement.” This is the power of Millennials and Gen Z. Organizations may continue to maintain racist, sexist, and overall “good ole boy” establishments, but we will not stand idly by and there will be consequences: diminished reputation and lower revenues.

I urge firm partners and leaders to be thoughtful in your approach as you respond to this current moment spotlighting the continued devaluation of Black lives in all areas of American society. Because when The Moment arrives (and rest assured, it will come), there will be a number of firms that have kept their commitments to racial equity. Indeed, I am well aware of a number of Biglaw firms that are making tireless efforts to identify structural problems and develop impactful solutions. But, there will also be firms that are revealed to have offered only empty platitudes. You will not want to be in the latter group, because we are watching. We are keeping tabs. And we will not forget. And when The Moment comes and it is socially unacceptable to lack decent representation of all people groups at your firm (in your partnership and at the helm of your firm leadership committees), you are going to flounder to find fresh minority talent.

The tide in America is flowing towards equality for all, and some of the more progressive states like California have already begun to provide a sample of what can be expected as the country continues to progress. For instance, [as of December 31, 2019](https://www.sos.ca.gov/business-programs/women-boards/), public companies with principal executive offices in California are required to have at least one woman director on the company’s board.  Additionally, earlier this year, [Goldman Sachs announced](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/01/23/goldman-sachs-ceo-says-it-wont-take-companies-public-without-diverse-board-member/) that it will no longer take companies public if they do not have at least one woman or diverse board member. It is evident that America will continue moving forward; there is no other option.

To be clear, my comments today are not a message that everyone needs to hear. There are many leaders in Biglaw institutions who have been committed to the principles of diversity and equality, and in this current season, they are leaning in more than ever before. To these allies and supporters, I offer a heartfelt acknowledgement and thank you, and I look forward to continuing to partner with you as we all do the ongoing and necessary work.

However, to those whose ears may still be refusing to hear. Please, hear me plainly — you need to identify the institutional issues that exist within your law firm as an impediment to the full cultivation and promotion of Black legal talent, and then you need to fix them in a meaningful way.  Failure to do so will be detrimental to the long-term viability of your firm’s reputation, and ultimately, its financial success. This is the real business case and how much time you have to get this right is still to be determined. But when The Moment comes, there will be no more room for apology statements and promises to do more moving forward. We are watching. We are keeping tabs. And we will not forget.

A round of applause for Kasowitz (and its bonuses).

After our Friday afternoon story about goings-on at [Kasowitz Benson](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/whats-going-on-at-kasowitz-benson/), we received an impressive amount of responses from readers coming to the defense of the firm. It sounds like things are going very well at KBTF these days — and lawyers at the firm want the world to know.

Let’s start with the bonuses. They were paid at the end of January, mostly at the market aka [Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2015-associate-bonuses/), with a few top performers getting above market and a few underperformers getting below market. Most folks are happy:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
- “[O]ur bonuses were full market, pretty much across the board (90%+ of associates who made previously-disclosed target got full market), and some even got an above-market bump. Everyone I know is pretty busy, and things seem pretty good.”
- “I was ecstatic to receive an above-market bonus. Working on substantive matters directly with partners. Everyone is incredibly busy and morale is pretty high – certainly no panic around here.”
- “I can confirm some associates got ‘above market’ bonuses. We’re not talking Wachtell, but above market is above market. Personally I was really happy with what I ended up receiving considering the hours I billed in 2015…. I am aware of some people not being happy with theirs, but what they received is in line with their billing. Hypothetically speaking, should anyone really complain about billing 1800 and still taking home more than $250k? Not in my opinion…”
The improved bonuses were actually part of a broader effort at the firm to improve associate life:

The firm has worked really hard over the last year to improve associate morale and listen to and address complaints, including revamping the bonus criteria (and making it more transparent), getting rid of the salary increase hold-back, replacing everyone’s computers, and starting an associates’ committee. I believe associates are very happy with their compensation this year. I certainly am. The firm is busy and is a great place to work.

New computers and an associates’ committee are nice, but getting rid of the pay raise hold-back is nicer. Kasowitz used to “raise” salaries in January, but not start paying the higher salaries until July — meaning that anyone who lateraled in the first half of the year left money on the table. That unfortunate policy is now history (thanks in part to the [light we shed on it](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/05/which-law-firm-is-cynically-screwing-over-its-associates/), we understand; you’re welcome, Kasowitz associates).

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
These reforms seem to be succeeding:

[T]he people who are here now are really happy to be here. At Kasowitz, we’ve always been able to seek out the type of work we want, there’s a lot of camaraderie, a LOT more opportunity for substantive work than other shops, and a lot of pride about the kind of work we do. It feels like lately management has also been hyperaware of making sure we know we can have a say, are happy, and not overworked.

As for the layoffs that took place [last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/03/nationwide-layoff-watch-sweeping-job-cuts-for-superior-legal-minds/) and the [year before](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/02/nationwide-layoff-watch-more-about-the-kasowitz-casualties/), some at Kasowitz believe that the firm has “right-sized” itself and that no more cuts are in the offing. As one source said, the prior cuts occurred due to “[t]he changing nature of the legal business, not having an up and out policy, and a record of not conducting layoffs (even of underperforming associates) during the years when other firms were laying people off left and right.” With the fat trimmed, the firm is positioned well for the future.

That brings us to the bigger picture: how are things going at Kasowitz, and how will the firm be affected by the move of Robin Cohen’s sizable insurance recovery group to McKool Smith? Our Friday story quoted a tipster characterizing it as a major loss, but other sources disagreed. For example:

[T]the Insurance Recovery Group was extremely well-regarded — some of my best friends at the firm, and in life, are a part of that group. It is disappointing to see them go and we will miss them. While I do not know the facts precipitating Robin Cohen’s departure, I do not believe it to be a significant blow to the firm’s viability…. [T]o suggest that the sky is falling constitutes extreme hyperbole.

A second tipster threw a little shade in Cohen’s direction:

Her group’s focus is certainly not the focus of the firm in general, and if we end up being smaller firm overall because we’re more concentrated in general commercial litigation and securities litigation, for example, then so be it. Also, rumor has it that her group (which is sizable with all its associates) was a bit in the red of late, despite its widespread recognition. So firm-wise financially speaking, it’s not going to be a negative as far as I know. Definitely don’t mean to bad mouth them, though. It’s obviously a well respected group. I don’t think it means much in the grand scheme of the firm.

A third Kasowitz defender was the harshest towards Cohen:

Whoever told you [Cohen’s] group was ‘their best and most well regarded group’ was stroking you off. Cohen never delivered the practice she said she was bringing to the firm; her group never made money for the firm but was a substantial net taker; and she was despised as a prima donna. Kasowitz didn’t lose her, they pushed her out. She is now trying to do to McKool what she did at Kasowitz. Promise a lot of business in exchange for a large guarantee. Unless something changes dramatically, McKool will end up losing a lot of money on this gambit.

Another source at the firm, however, pushed back — persuasively, in my view — on these claims. First, given the way that Kasowitz Benson is run — i.e., it’s [King Marc’s court](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/whats-going-on-at-kasowitz-benson/?rf=1) — overpaying partners doesn’t really happen, because Marc Kasowitz himself determines everyone’s pay (and no guarantee controls Cohen’s comp at this time, considering that she arrived at the firm six years ago).

Second, Cohen and her colleagues weren’t “pushed out”; to the contrary, Marc Kasowitz invoked the 90-day-notice provision of the partnership agreement against them, presumably so KBTF can enjoy the group’s revenue for a few more months. Kasowitz rarely holds departing partners to the 90-day requirement; he did when [Doug Lumish left for Latham & Watkins](http://www.law360.com/articles/438224/latham-snags-four-kasowitz-ip-litigators-in-ny-calif), but it’s hard to recall any other instance. (We understand that Kasowitz Benson and Robin Cohen’s group are in the process of negotiating an earlier departure, as is typical in such situations.)

Other Kasowitz lawyers came to Cohen’s defense as well, like this associate:

Marc Kasowitz sat the associates down in a conference room late last week and unconvincingly tried to spin the insurance group leaving as a good thing. It was uncomfortable because people by then had heard that Marc was holding the insurance group for 90 days and would not let them leave to go to McKool. Although the question was on a lot or associates’ minds, no one was going to risk asking him why he won’t let the group leave if this is supposedly such a good thing for the firm. Meanwhile, many associates are wondering what happens long term to the firm. Robin Cohen was viewed as a steadying force in the firm and the person that a lot of people believed would lead KBTF into being a more democratic place, and certainly the best (if not only) partner who had both the book of business and the charisma to step in as the leader of the firm should the situation present itself.

And here are some pro-Cohen thoughts from a partner who has been at Kasowitz for more than a decade:

Marc Kasowitz’s statement in your recent article referring to Robin Cohen’s departure as a “separation” that is going to “better position the firm” seems like an attempt at damage control. Since Robin and her group arrived six years ago, her influence and leadership skills have extended beyond her practice group. She has helped the firm focus on business goals, and worked closely with other leaders in the firm to get ahead of important strategic issues that the firm faced. There’s a reason she inspires a lot of respect and loyalty among the people who work for her, and highly-regarded firms have sought to bring her into their own practices. You don’t often find all of those qualities in one person, and she is going to be difficult to replace.

Indeed. Cohen was on Kasowitz’s management committee — the only woman on the committee, by the way — and one of the top rainmakers at the firm (after Marc Kasowitz himself).

What does Robin Cohen herself have to say? We contacted her, and she issued this statement:

We are very excited about the move to McKool Smith. However, Kasowitz Benson is a great firm and we have many wonderful friends there. The basis for my move is because of a business conflict and the need to be able to bring suit against the insurance industry in an unfettered manner. Speculation that the move is due to anything else is simply false. Our insurance coverage practice is more robust and diverse than it has ever been, in part due to the support and generosity of Marc Kasowitz during my entire six years with the firm. I look forward to collaborating with Kasowitz Benson in the future and have nothing but the utmost respect for Marc.

Bottom line: everything’s fine. Cohen and Kasowitz are parting on good terms, and even if her departure is a loss, Kasowitz will continue to thrive. As one happy associate told us, “We’re still a unique, talented firm, and a fun one at that. I’ve been here for some time now, and I wouldn’t think of moving to any other big NYC firm, much to the recruiters’ chagrin.”

We thank our many KBTF sources for coming forward with this wealth of information. If you have information you’d like to share with us, whether about Kasowitz or any other major law firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Biglaw%20News) or text us (646-820-8477). Some sources complained about our not covering the good news of the Kasowitz bonuses back in January, but we didn’t cover them for one simple reason: nobody told us. We don’t have ESP; we’re only as good as our sources. If you want us to cover news about your firm, whether good or bad, you need to tell us about it, ideally as soon as it happens. Thanks.

[I]t’s coming — and there’s a lot of work to be done.

The demand for restructuring and bankruptcy partners is as dynamic as it’s been in the last 25 years. Firms in the past waited until a wave hit to look for a lifeboat. Now, the sense that they need to have people in place before the storm hits is much more acute.

— [Jon Lindsey](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/jon-lindsey), founder of legal recruiting firm [Major, Lindsey & Africa](https://www.mlaglobal.com), commenting on the fact that law firms have cited [growing their bankruptcy practices as their greatest priority](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/10/29/its-coming-looming-recession-keeps-bankruptcy-partners-on-the-move/), and that lateral movement in this area has reached a fever pitch that’s likely to peak in the next year.

Amy Caton

For the first time ever, women now make up the [majority of U.S. law firm associates](https://www.nalp.org/uploads/Research/2022NALPReportonDiversity_Final.pdf), at 50.31%. While women have made great strides at the partnership level, they still make up just 27.76% of [all partners](https://www.nalp.org/uploads/Research/2022NALPReportonDiversity_Final.pdf), and only 27% of all [practice group leaders](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/resources/business-law-today/2023-november/see-her-hear-her-historical-evolution-women-in-law/#:~:text=In%202020%20women%20made%20up,percent%20of%20practice%20group%20leaders.). Biglaw firms are taking steps to remedy this situation, and women lawyers at the top of their game are being promoted to leadership positions within their firms.

I recently had the pleasure of chatting with [Amy Caton](https://www.kramerlevin.com/en/people/amy-caton.html?tab=profile), who was recently named co-chair of the bankruptcy and restructuring practice at Kramer Levin, to get her thoughts on the matter. Here is a write-up of our lively conversation on bankruptcy and restructuring, and how young lawyers — and women in particular — can get ahead in what was once considered a male-dominated practice area.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Staci Zaretsky (SZ): Congratulations on your promotion! I know that not many top bankruptcy practices are led by women. How does that make you feel as a leader in field?

Amy Caton (AC): Thank you! The restructuring field has made a lot of progress on recognizing that women are talented restructuring lawyers.  To generalize, many women are excellent negotiators because we have high EQ, which is really important in obtaining information, understanding your opponents’ soft points and where they have room to move, and crafting creative deals.  In restructuring, you have to be tough and ready to litigate, but almost all of the top practitioners are known for their skill in negotiation and deals.

When I was a young associate 20-25 years ago, I was often the only woman in the room.  Not anymore — and in fact, I have had deals where most of the lead partners were women.  For other top bankruptcy practices headed by women, you have Jones Day ([Heather Lennox](https://www.jonesday.com/en/lawyers/l/heather-lennox?tab=overview)), Willkie ([Rachel Strickland](https://www.willkie.com/professionals/s/strickland-rachel-c) as co-head), and DLA Piper ([Rachel Albanese](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/people/e/rachel-ehrlich-albanese)), as well as several other talented female partners leading restructurings — including my partner, [Rachael Ringer](https://www.kramerlevin.com/en/people/rachael-ringer.html?tab=profile).

SZ: You’ve worked in bankruptcy and restructuring for decades. Can you please tell me a little bit about why you enjoy working in this practice area?

AC: I feel fortunate to love what I do.  If I had been a pure litigator or corporate lawyer, I doubt I would still be a lawyer anymore. But being a restructuring lawyer, I do both deal work and litigation, and learn about businesses and what makes our economy tick.  I learn something new — not just about the law, but about the world — almost every day.  These days, I’m particularly interested in electric utilities and new green energy technologies, and the way these companies have to be restructured and repurposed to deal with the changing climate and new technologies.  And I love municipal restructurings.

In my job, I am intellectually stimulated and have the privilege of working with repeat clients I really like, and whom I understand.  And I feel like we are accomplishing something together when we negotiate a new deal or win a case.  It really doesn’t get much better.

SZ: What advice do you have for women who hope to excel in this area of law?

AC: For all newer bankruptcy lawyers, my first piece of advice is to read the financial news and some of the great, entertaining financial literature out there — Barbarians at the Gate was my first.  If you are working on an airline bankruptcy case, for example, try to understand how an airline operates, who the important stakeholders and creditors are, how it sets pricing, who its competitors are.  If you find all of that interesting, it’s a great field to work in.  And ask for opportunities to present in meetings or in court.

For women in particular, my advice is: only say “sorry” when you truly need to apologize.  Project confidence even if you don’t feel it. Don’t try to yell over people, but make it clear that you won’t be interrupted, and finish your point — forcefully. Women are conditioned from a young age to please people and make other people feel comfortable – it actually makes us great associates.  But many of us have to train ourselves to take up all of the space that we deserve.  You need to be comfortable taking that space to be a great advocate for your clients.  That took me a few years to realize as a senior associate, but once you learn that, you will become an extremely effective and powerful lawyer.

# Successful IP Associate Checklist: Depth (Part II)
## While acquiring deep experience is never easy and often fraught with setbacks and mistakes along the way, there is no substitute for actually getting that experience.

Last week’s [column](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/09/successful-ip-associate-checklist-breadth-part-i/) focused on the importance of acquiring broad experience as an IP associate.  This week, it is important that we consider the value of also getting deep experience as early and often as possible as an IP associate. This may seem an ambitious goal, particularly for IP associates who may not feel like control over their careers is fully theirs yet. But with the right ambition, coupled with a willingness to learn, it is possible for IP associates to accumulate both broad and deep experience. It will take some time, however, say at least eight-to-10 years of practice for most. Step one is realizing there are no shortcuts, particularly when it comes to earning deep experience. It helps as well to have some guidance, which I hope this column can provide in at least a small measure.

For even the best IP associate, getting broad and deep experience will not be easy. It could even require moving firms if the mix of matters one is assigned to is too restrictive or superficial. But an ambitious, proactive IP associate can and should be able to get the experience they need, as well as the experience they want, if their goal is a long and satisfying career practicing IP law. Whether their future job is in-house, or as a law firm partner, or as something else is irrelevant. Building your foundation as broadly and deeply as possible — in terms of your technical legal skills, your understanding of legal economics, as well as your marketing skills — is essential to longevity and satisfaction in your career. Since we have already addressed the elements of acquiring breadth of experience as a young (experience-wise) lawyer, we can now focus on what deep experience means for IP lawyers. Because knowing what you need to do is the first step towards doing it.

In some ways, acquiring deep experience can be easier than acquiring broad experience — particularly in a law firm setting. Especially for IP lawyers, who tend to focus on one area of IP practice, sometimes even from the earliest days of their career. Say you are a young trademark associate, working for a firm that does trademark prosecution and enforcement for large multinational clients. There is a good chance you will be spending the overwhelming majority of your time exercising responsibility over the paralegals and more junior lawyers responsible for maintaining the trademark dockets of the firm’s key clients. In addition, you may also be the primary interface between the more junior members of the prosecution team and the relationship partner.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In that scenario, there is a good chance you will be doing a lot of the same types of things on a daily basis. Your practice would be focused on docket management, responses to office actions, supervising new trademark filings, and perhaps occasionally drafting cease-and-desist letters or co-existence and other trademark-related agreements. By doing so, you will be acquiring deep experience in the area of trademark prosecution — which is a good thing. To fully reach the depths of experience in that area as much as possible, however, you should be looking at the delta between your experience and that of the senior lawyers you work with. Where is there is a gap between your experience and theirs? That is precisely the area of depth you should be striving to achieve — and the types of experiences you should be aiming to acquire.

Let’s make things concrete, using our trademark prosecution associate as an example. At a certain point, any young lawyer will get comfortable with a certain task, provided they are given enough chances to produce a similar work product. Let’s say our associate is at the stage where they have sent out a dozen cease-and-desist letters to infringers of the client’s trademarks. Or 10 takedown notices to Amazon, seeking to remove infringing listings. At that point of that associate’s career, we may be able to say that they have acquired deep experience in those specific aspects of a trademark practice.

The trick, however, is not to get complacent about your depth of experience. Ever. That same trademark associate may be sending out cease-and-desist letters. But are they the ones negotiating with opposing counsel when the response letter comes in? Or are they handing the matter off to a more experienced lawyer at that point? If the latter is true, then in order to acquire deeper experience, our trademark associate must find a way to get a chance to negotiate with opposing counsel at some point. 

The trick, therefore, is to focus on what more senior lawyers are doing that you are not yet doing. And if you are the most experienced lawyer at a particular level at your firm, you should be looking at lawyers outside your firm to see what you should be doing to get deeper experience. It never ends. But that is part of what makes IP law so interesting and fulfilling. There is always something to learn, at least if you have the humility to realize that more learning is something that can benefit you.

Ultimately, IP associates who thoughtfully compare their experience levels with their more senior colleagues — and find ways to position themselves to close the experience gap — are much more likely to acquire deep experience in the areas of IP practice they find themselves focusing on. While acquiring deep experience is never easy and often fraught with setbacks and mistakes along the way, there is no substitute for actually getting that experience if the goal is to know what you are doing as a 40-year-old lawyer. Because no IP lawyer wants to end up well into their career with limited and superficial experience. So aim wide and aim deep, so that your hard work early on pays off later.

# International Firm Brings Its U.S. Associates Up To The New Market
## Another Magic Circle firm makes the move.

After its Magic Circle counterpart, Freshfields, [raised salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/magic-circle-firm-matches-cravath-scale/) to the Cravath scale yesterday, [Clifford Chance](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/clifford-chance/) took the leap and joined the ranks of [“MoneyLaw”](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/what-firms-miss-the-moneylaw-cut/) this afternoon.

In [a memo](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/international-firm-brings-its-u-s-associates-up-to-the-new-market/2/) sent by Regional Managing Partner [Evan Cohen](https://www.cliffordchance.com/people_and_places/people/partners/us/evan_cohen.html), the firm adopted the now-familiar [Cravath pay scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) (but with the class of 2007 and more senior getting $325K; the Cravath scale stops at class of 2008). No word on what counsel will get; if someone hears, let us know.

Summer associates are also seeing the bump to the tune of $7500/semi-monthly [Duh. I wrote month in the first version]. Some tipsters have asked if this amounts to beating the market when some other firms are paying summers $3500/week paid out every two weeks. Our sense is that this isn’t actually beating the market, but a factor of paying out every two weeks versus semi-monthly. Assuming firms are issuing paychecks on Fridays, July could have three pay periods. Divvying up the money semi-monthly might look like an increase over a bi-weekly dole out, but it probably isn’t.

Clifford Chance associates are happy. You know who isn’t? Allen & Overy associates:

A&O associates are a bit worried given the firm’s very long delay during the last round of raises.

Yep. You know what they say, “if your Allen & Overys aren’t productive, it’s time to consider adopting a new firm.”

Meanwhile, congrats to Clifford Chance.

It’s now mid May, and the weather is getting warmer. Everyone is making their last-ditch efforts to slim down for summer — even law firms. As you may have already heard, [DLA Piper](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/dla-piper/) is planning to cut up to 200 jobs from its workforce, predominantly among business support professionals in the U.K.

Citing a “proposed number of redundancies,” the positions constitute 18 percent of the firm’s total U.K. business support staff of 1,100. The firm will decide how many jobs will be eliminated by the end of July, and the layoffs will likely take place between October 2016 and the end of 2017. According to a report in [Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/dla-piper-to-cut-up-to-200-uk-support-jobs/), the downsizing is expected to affect various support jobs, including those in IT, finance, HR, marketing, and business development, as well as some secretarial teams. The majority of these jobs will likely be moved to the firm’s back-office operations center in Warsaw. Andrew Darwin, DLA Piper’s chief operating officer, said it was a [“difficult day.”](https://bol.bna.com/a-difficult-day-at-dla-piper-as-firm-plots-200-layoffs/)

Here is [Darwin’s statement](https://bol.bna.com/dla-piper-to-cut-up-to-200-uk-support-jobs/) on the impending layoffs. The “period of consultation” he refers to below may well be a race for the survival of the fittest to keep their jobs:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The firm has grown rapidly over the past decade and many of our systems and processes reflect the history of the firm rather than its future. It is a key part of our strategy to modernize our business service functions in order to operate more effectively on a global basis and improve the quality, consistency and efficiency of the way we deliver our services to our clients.

Following a comprehensive review of the firm’s operations, and the successful pilot of a global shared services centre in Warsaw, we have begun a period of consultation in the UK that will consider the possible reduction in size of our IT, Finance, HR, Marketing & BD, and Secretarial teams. Until the consultation is completed, we will not be making any final decisions, and we will be actively supporting our people during this process.

This is a breakdown of where [DLA Piper’s layoffs](https://bol.bna.com/where-dla-pipers-layoffs-in-the-u-k-are-expected-to-hit/) are expected to hit:

Birmingham – 12%
Northwest (Manchester & Liverpool) – 16%
Yorkshire (Leeds & Sheffield) – 44%
Edinburgh – 3%
London – 25%

HR – 9%
Marketing – 10%
Finance – 32%
IT – 21%
Secretarial – 28%

According to a comment given by a firm spokesperson to the [Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/top-stories/id=1202757391286/DLA-Piper-Says-UK-Layoffs-Wont-Spread-to-US?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=6), “DLA Piper’s U.S. operations would not be included in the restructuring.” According to our sources, however, this is an inaccurate statement. Although these are supposedly the firm’s first major cuts since 2014, people tell us that the firm has been consistently laying off a “very high number” of associates, counsel, and even partners — including [John Altorelli](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/john-j-altorelli/), the onetime co-chair of the firm’s U.S. finance practice, who is also a former Dewey & LeBoeuf partner who was [driven into bankruptcy](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/dewey-know-a-third-former-partner-driven-into-personal-bankruptcy/) — for the past four months. (Altorelli’s [bio page](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/people/a/altorelli-john-j/) on the DLA Piper website now reverts to a “Page Not Found.”) We have reached out to DLA Piper for comment, but have not yet received a response.

# More Biglaw Firms Set To Fully Reopen Their Offices In January 2022
## The new year is looking like it's going to be full of newly repopulated law firm offices.

One by one, Biglaw firms are announcing their “post”-pandemic office return plans, and many are now settling on January 2022 for their reopenings en masse.

We’ll start off today’s coverage with news from Gibson Dunn & Crutcher. The firm originally had plans to welcome employees back to the office on September 13, granting them the [autonomy to work remotely](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/top-biglaw-firm-will-allow-associates-to-control-their-own-office-schedules-work-remotely-whenever-appropriate/) “whenever it is appropriate,” because such flexibility is needed for lawyers to have “full, well-rounded, happy lives.” The firm later postponed that reopening date until October, and then pushed back its October plans for an unspecified date in the future.

Earlier this week, Gibson Dunn announced that future date would be January 10, 2022. Managing partner Barbara Becker confirmed these plans with the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/10/20/gibson-dunn-sets-january-date-for-u-s-office-reopenings/), noting the firm would proceed as scheduled, barring “unforeseen circumstances.” Many attorneys have already returned to the office, and certain practice groups have arranged specific weekdays when they’ll meet in person.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Kramer Levin, which originally had plans to [return to the office in late September](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/kramer-levin-reopening/), will now be reopening its doors in full, starting on January 4, 2022. Before then, the firm will have a “reorientation” period, where lawyers and staff will work from the office at least one day a week. The firm’s first reorientation period will be November 1 through November 12. Here’s a relevant excerpt from the firm’s memo:

Our goal in reorientation is to support your return to the office and ensure that everyone is fully operational on January 4, 2022. We also hope that during this time you will reconnect with colleagues and meet new colleagues that joined the firm since March 2020.

Please be reminded that to come into the office, you [must be fully vaccinated](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/even-biglaw-firms-that-wont-be-open-until-2022-are-requiring-all-employees-to-be-vaccinated/) and have uploaded proof of vaccination in the Eden Health app. If you have any questions about vaccinations, please contact [redacted].

For Biglaw firms that have been forced to postpone their reopening plans, it sure looks like the new year is going to be full of excitement (mixed with the anxiety that some may feel about returning to the office in a whole new world).

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm 'FINALLY' Hands Out Raises To Associates
## Good things -- like money -- come to those who wait.

It’s mid-May, and yes, some Biglaw firms are still awarding their associates with raises. As it turns out, some firms — even firms that are in the Am Law Top 50 — just took a little longer to figure things out than others.

To that end, Foley & Lardner, a firm that took home $1,024,834,000 gross revenue in 2021, putting it in 48th place in the most recent Am Law 100, just surprised associates with news of a cash influx. “FINALLY,” one source at the firm told Above the Law. Unfortunately, associates will have to keep waiting to see the money because these “mid-year adjustments” won’t be effective until August.

Here’s what the new salary scale looks like at the firm.



While it’s not an exact match of the Cravath scale, it’s pretty darned close (and the Class of 2020 will actually earn $5,000 more at Foley than at Cravath).

August can’t come soon enough for associates. Congratulations!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Foley & Lardner.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Gordon Caplan

Last month, 40 people were charged in a $25 million college entrance exam cheating scandal, including actresses Felicity Huffman of Desperate Housewives and Lori Loughlin of Full House. Rich parents worried about their children’s ability to get into elite colleges and universities allegedly paid money to have their kids recruited as athletes (regardless of their athletic abilities) or assisted on admissions exams.

Also caught up in the scandal was Willkie Farr’s now-suspended co-chairman, [Gordon Caplan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Caplan), who paid $75,000 to college coaches turned government cooperating witnesses in a scheme to have someone else [take an admissions exam for his daughter](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/willkie-farr-chair-caught-in-college-admissions-scandal/). Today, Caplan announced that he will be pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.

According to a statement from Caplan’s lawyers, he says he takes “full and sole responsibility” for his actions. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2019/04/05/ex-willkie-co-chair-gordon-caplan-to-plead-guilty-in-college-cheating-case/) has the rest of the details:

“I apologize not only to my family, friends, colleagues and the legal Bar, but also to students everywhere who have been accepted to college through their own hard work,” the statement said. “I want to make clear that my daughter, whom I love more than anything in the world, is a high school junior and has not yet applied to college, much less been accepted by any school. She had no knowledge whatsoever about my actions, has been devastated to learn what I did and has been hurt the most by it.

“My immediate goal is to focus on making amends for my actions to try to win back the trust and respect of my daughter, my family, and my community,” the statement continued. “The remorse and shame that I feel is more than I can convey.”

Caplan faces up to 20 years in prison.

# Is All Hope Lost For Biglaw Special Bonuses This Summer?
## Not to be a overly negative, but things really aren't looking good.

Today is August 18. It’s been nearly three full business weeks since we publicized what we believed were the [first special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/biglaw-firm-announces-summer-special-bonuses/) to be handed out to associates this summer. Since then, we’ve heard nothing but crickets. The firm’s announcement has been more or less ignored.

Biglaw firms have played this waiting game before when it comes to bonuses, but this is getting to be a bit much. Where is Milbank? What about Davis Polk? There’s nothing like Cravath’s seal of approval to kick off bonus matches, but the firm has thus far remained silent.

Let’s face it: with a grim-looking [Q2 Law Firm Financial Index](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/second-quarter-was-even-worse-for-law-firms/) and profits per partner having taken a double-digit plunge according to the latest report from Wells Fargo, Biglaw firms seem to be running scared from the concept of special bonuses. As we’ve previously documented, associates who continue to work around the clock are [really upset](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/show-them-the-money-where-are-the-summer-bonuses-for-associates/), and they have every right to be.

Littler Mendelson, on the other hand, shared the wealth with its associates, no matter the forecast of the looming recession. It’s true that salaries at the firm are highly individualized (i.e., they may not be paying top comp), so there was a little more wiggle room to hand out these bonuses in the first place. But it’s not as if the bonuses were as big as those that were handed out by Biglaw in the past — we’re talking about bonuses that averaged about $10,000. Surely Biglaw firms can handle bonuses of this size… right? In a statement given to [Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/1517143/littler-to-hand-attys-summer-special-bonuses), Erin Webber, the firm’s managing director and president, had this to say:

“With the substantial increase in business demand, we recognize that many of our attorneys are working harder than ever this year. We feel it is important to recognize their dedication to meeting client needs and their commitment to providing excellent work product and client service in this first half of the year. At Littler, we are intently focused on further elevating our strategies for developing and attracting talent. Awarding such special recognition bonuses is just one way to show our gratitude for the hard work and exceptional contributions of our team members.”

It must be nice to feel appreciated. Associates fondly recall the special bonuses of 2020 and 2021, but in 2022, they’ve been left waiting and wanting.

Is all hope lost for special bonuses this summer? We certainly don’t want to rain on associates’ parade, but with all of the news of economic doom and gloom, it seems less and less likely to occur. We’d really love it, of course, if another firm shocked the market with special bonuses — and so would associates — but this is taking way too long to inspire our confidence.

# Will Doug Emhoff Leave His Job As DLA Piper Partner To Become Unpaid 'Second Gentleman'?

I think it would be nuts for him to stay at the firm. She [Kamala Harris] would consistently be faced with the allegation that people are hiring the firm to get something out of the administration.

— [Richard Painter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Painter), a former White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, offering his thoughts on whether [Doug Emhoff](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/people/e/emhoff-douglas-c/), husband of Vice President-elect [Kamala Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris), should remain at DLA Piper during his wife’s time in office. Painted suggested that while Emhoff could take a salary from the firm without sharing in any of its profits, the optics would still be poor. Emhoff took a [temporary leave of absence](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/biglaw-partner-takes-leave-to-join-his-wife-kamala-harris-on-campaign-trail/) from the Biglaw firm in August, but representatives from neither the firm nor the Biden campaign have [advised](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/harriss-lawyer-husband-faces-ethics-quandary-as-second-spouse) on what Emhoff plans to do.

“I’m working on myself, by myself, for myself.”
— Harvey Specter, [Suits](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/suits/)

When I was 17, I played golf almost every day, and one day during a round an extremely successful businessman at the club told me that if I wanted to be any kind of success I should take an MBA. At that stage, I had already signed up to read law and I was coming from a family where no-one had been to university before me. My father had done well in business without any qualifications (other than a pilot’s licence that he worked day and night for in his late 40s), so I started life with the misguided preconception that you either hustled business without qualifications or you got qualified in something very technical and didn’t need to get a formal business education.

I now look back at my decision to take an LLM and think to myself, what information do I use from my LLM in my day job? I am searching for the longer term value of it. I am seeking its return on investment. It would be wrong to say it has been without value, because it undoubtedly helped me get my first legal job, but I don’t think I attribute much more to it than that. It made me look good on paper.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
On the premise that one day my career would progress to legal counsel in a business environment or partnership in a law firm, my year on the LLM would almost certainly have been better spent doing an MBA and honing my mind to focus on business strategy, management techniques, accounting matters, and leadership skills.

We currently find ourselves in a place where digital disruption and artificial intelligence is rapidly changing the way we are all practicing the law, and they will continue to do so. Law firms have to adapt quickly to a technological revolution and equip themselves for a new horizon. Some legal functions are set to become entirely automated, but that’s not to say that lawyers will become extinct. Lawyers may just end up with more time to focus on other aspects of their wider business. There will be more time to think about how the application of our knowledge can be better deployed to meet the needs of our clients.

I know for sure that, as a partner in a law firm, I never have enough time to do all of the things I would like to do to develop the business. I could do so much more if I were freed from some of the more monotonous processes that I face each week. The wave of change is exciting; it is not something for lawyers to be scared of, but it does shift the balance of skills that lawyers are required to have in order to advance their careers.

Instead of time spent on jobs like updating documents for changes in law, there will be extra time for strategising on how to win new business, more time for investment into training people to outstrip the competition, and additional time to spend with clients.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
It won’t be easy to rewire lawyers, who are traditional creatures by culture, but if law firms and businesses employing lawyers want to succeed, they will need to re-tool the profession for the brave new world ahead.

I am a fan of rewriting the rules of entry into the legal profession. Undergraduate law degrees, in my opinion, should be taught in two years, with a business skills course bolted onto the third year, and the UK’s legal practice course should incorporate more of an apprenticeship-based approach to teaching by allowing students to sit within the non-legal functions of businesses and law firms during the course, to understand the practical challenges faced in a broader commercial context.

That sort of bold reinvention of the profession’s foundations won’t happen fast enough for the young hopefuls studying law now, though. Those people need to be dynamic and make smart choices about their educational needs based on the direction of the tides. Those choices are not made easy by the intellectual snobbery in the profession, which will, in some quarters, be resistant to a shift of balance away from the raw acquisition of legal knowledge.

Acquisition of legal knowledge is fundamental, but is it is simply one of three pillars of equal weighting in legal business. Those pillars are:

1) Acquiring knowledge (both in a classroom and in an office/courtroom);
2) Applying knowledge to achieve the optimal outcome; and
3) Packaging legal knowledge and application of legal knowledge to sell to clients.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
All of three pillars apply to in-house lawyers in the same way as they apply to private practice lawyers. I hear complaints all the time that companies with in-house counsel often exclude their lawyers from discussions, negotiations and disputes that they should be party to because the lawyers at hand are not commercial enough in their application of knowledge and their packaging of their service to the business. All lawyers, as a business-facing resource and service function, need to be wired to solution-driven thinking, and business skills training could help bridge gaps between the inclination of lawyers to identify risks without properly quantifying them or seeking ways to mitigate them.

Some law firms in the UK have already dabbled with adding MBAs and MBA components to their graduate intake training programmes, and others are experimenting with “earn whilst you learn” approaches to becoming a solicitor, but it has not universally caught on. There is also a debate over when in a lawyer’s career the MBA skills are best acquired. I would argue that a greater degree of business skills training is required at entry level, but more importantly, I think all partners in law firms should be required to complete MBAs to improve the management functions of firms.

Lawyers must become better business people, but as Harvey Specter in Suits says, “the only place success comes before work is in the dictionary”.

The loss of attorneys to suicide presents an [ongoing challenge to the legal industry](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/lawyer-suicides-are-becoming-all-too-frequent/). Not just because it’s a loss that forces lawyers to consider the impact the stress of the profession places on people and the strain it can cause to someone’s established support group, but because it forces attorneys to confront the aftermath of tragic loss, often without a sense of the vocabulary for it.

Moreover, the distributed management style of law firms, where practice groups and individual partners often dictate the management of their teams shielded or at least quasi-shielded from direct oversight. Presenting a uniform and informed response is uniquely difficult when firms structure themselves, to some extent, as a collection of self-contained fiefdoms.

Sheppard Mullin recently lost an associate and provided this statement:

It is with heavy hearts we confirm that one of our New York associates, [], passed away on February 4.  [] joined the firm almost three years ago and quickly became a positive influence in the office and across the firm.  She was a terrific attorney, a true firm citizen and a wonderful person, showing so much passion for her work and colleagues alike.  She was much loved by those who knew and worked with her and will be greatly missed.  The entire Sheppard Mullin community sends our deepest sympathies to []’s family and her friends.

[Ed. note: The firm statement identifies the associate and the original article included the statement verbatim. At the request of her family we’ve redacted this.]

As the firm reels from that loss, the firm’s second such loss in the span of a year, a conversation on the Fishbowl boards focused on a troubling response from an unnamed partner:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Asking lawyers to suck it up and work harder after the firm experiences a trauma like this represents a cultural breakdown. It also highlights how management from silos all but guarantees someone will approach the situation without appreciating that everyone is going to deal with this differently.

When I first read this exchange, my take mirrored that of the following poster: that the partner wasn’t aiming to be malicious and shrug off the issue, but was exhorting younger associates to pick up the slack of the deceased’s senior colleagues — implying that grief would or should be isolated to the lawyer’s peer group.



Which is ridiculous. Close friends and colleagues will deal with this grief hard, but when someone is lost like this, all lawyers in the firm are going to see some of their own experiences in the event. Their feelings are no less valid just because they’re billing at a lower rate.

As the original poster replied:



That went from well-meaning but misguided to inappropriate very quickly. Though it does go back to lacking the vocabulary to address tragedy in the confines of a law firm. There’s just no method of communicating that someone needs to help cover for someone else without chastising them over their billables. Even if the logic was not “you need to bill more” but “I see you have extra bandwidth,” it still takes a stressful situation and adds a layer of surveillance with a dash of “you’re just a cog” messaging.

In any event, firms need to build the emotional bollards to guide everyone through this. Which the firm is taking steps toward offering aid to help everyone through the trauma:

Supporting our people during this tragedy is a priority.  As a firm and as an industry, we must confront and openly discuss mental health.  Across the firm, we have had many candid conversations about mental health – and we will continue to do so.  By sharing our personal stories and by listening to those around us, we can better understand how to help others in our work and personal families.  We have many resources at Sheppard Mullin dedicated to mental health and well-being, including counseling offered through Lyra Health and Wellness, a Sheppard Mullin-sponsored benefit that provides personalized mental and emotional healthcare for all partners, employees and their dependents. The firm’s “Help Starts Here Team” provides employees a safe first point of contact if they or someone they know is struggling. We also continue to work with mental health mentor and speaker Cameron Stout as an ongoing resources to help facilitate these discussions and help us identify even more ways we can support our attorneys and staff.

Offering support for people who think they need it is a huge part of coping, but ensuring that managers know how to manage matters too. Without all the distributed nodes of leadership in the firm recognizing the gravity of what’s happened and appreciating how it will reverberate through different corners of the firm, the recovery will get compromised.

This goes beyond this firm and this tragedy as well. Corporate America offers management training worked out with scientific (or at least quasi-scientific) efficiency because they want to know their managers can manage. Law firms, traditionally, take good lawyers and let them wing it as managers. It works for some people and it fails for many more. Realizing that partners are managers would resolve a lot of law firm problems. And it could go a long way to helping firms avoid the toxicity, callousness, and obliviousness that can crop up in the aftermath of a loss.

# The Burning Desire To Be A Conduit
## In scary economic times, it's more important than ever to be a lawyer, not a conduit.

I know, I know:  You want to be a conduit. It’s so easy; you don’t have to do anything. You just mindlessly pass along information, giving it no thought.  You can’t possibly be wrong about anything, because you’ve never expressed an opinion about anything. And you get paid as though you’re a lawyer! What could be better than that?

In-house, being a conduit looks like this:

“I’ve attached Bigg & Mediocre’s fee proposal.  What do you think?”

(Being a lawyer would require effort: “In the attached fee proposal, Bigg & Mediocre proposes X.  That proposal does not make sense for three reasons:  A, B, and C. Instead of what Bigg & Mediocre has proposed, we should suggest….”)

Alternatively, you could be a conduit like this:

“You said that this case would turn on the definition of the term ‘Event’ in the insurance policy. I’ve therefore attached the insurance policy for you to review.”

(Being a lawyer would require effort: “You said that this case would turn on the definition of the term ‘Event’ in the insurance policy. On page 7, the attached policy defines ‘Event’ as …. This means that we’re able to argue A, B, and C.”)

Or maybe you could be a conduit like this:

“I’ve opened the new matter that you sent to me. What expense reserve do you propose?”

(Being a lawyer would require effort: “I’ve opened the new matter that you sent to me. The case is silly, but Bigg & Mediocre is an expensive firm. Are you comfortable with an expense reserve of $X?”)

At law firms, you can also be a conduit:

“We just received 4,000 pages of documents from the plaintiff. I’ve attached them for your information.”

(Being a lawyer would require effort: “We just received 4,000 pages of documents from the plaintiff. There are three key admissions in the documents. At page P140 (third line), you’ll see that the plaintiff admitted ….”)

You can also be a conduit at a law firm like this:

“You asked me to research Topic A. I’ve attached copies of two cases for you to read.”

Being a lawyer, of course, would require effort.

Turn this over in your mind: When a novel coronavirus hits, and times are tough, and the firm is deciding who to lay off, who will get laid off first — the conduit or the lawyer?

Or consider this: When a firm is deciding who should be invited to enter the partnership and who should be discarded, who do you suppose will receive the invitation — the conduit or the lawyer?

I’m just sayin’.
