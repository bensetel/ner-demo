# Top Biglaw Firm Looking Forward To Associates Spending 'Meaningful Time' In The Office
## Associates are worried there's not enough flexibility.

What legal industry observers are learning by watching Biglaw firms roll out their office reopening plans, is that different firms are prioritizing different things. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett — a firm ranked 14th on the Am Law 100 with  $1,844,627,000 in gross revenue last year — has a reopening plan, and as their announcement makes clear, they “continue to believe it’s important for our attorneys to spend meaningful time in the office.”

But what does that actually mean? According to the firm, “no one will be asked to be in the office before September 13th, 2021.” So folks at least have the summer to ramp themselves up to office life. According to the firm’s announcement, “the ultimate goal that attorneys be in the office 3-4 days a week on average during this next phase.” While we applaud the end of a 5-day in the office week, tipsters on the ground still feel that doesn’t offer enough flexibility.

Disappointed. Seems like STB does not want to give any flexibility. I’d rather go elsewhere given my hours and the cold unpleasant nature of our office. Also, STB associates don’t sit with their practice groups and don’t casually mingle with their neighbors so there’s no value in being in the office. It seems STB is just going old school and will hemorrhage even more associates. Every Friday is a departure memo dump.

The firm also said they “strongly encourage” everyone to get vaccinated, and expect most employees will be vaxxed come September.

STB also noted that more specific guidance will be forthcoming, and will adhere to CDC protocols.

# Why Work/Life Balance Is So Hard To Find
## Here’s an obvious observation: your employer is never going to tell you it’s time for you to have a bit of downtime.

Here’s an obvious observation: your employer is never going to tell you it’s time for you to have a bit of downtime. Your to-do list will never magically be completely checked off so that you can have rest and relaxation. If you do not own and take control over your own time, your own schedule, your day will become more filled with other people’s priorities. In other words, [work/life balance](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/three-words-that-should-be-banned-work-life-balance/) (a term that I despise) is only possible if you make it a priority and put in consistent effort into achieving it.

My invitation is the same as the instructions that you get when you get on an airplane: Secure your own oxygen mask before assisting others.

I regularly meet lawyers who are either (a) experiencing burnout or (b) on the verge of burnout. They’ll vigorously defend their completely unrealistic to-do list and overscheduled, overcommitted schedule and say that the solution is to work harder. Yet, at the same time, they’ll bemoan the complete lack of “work/life balance.”

This is simply nonsensical. There is a limitation on the number of hours your brain can engage in the demands of lawyering. [Most research](https://www.fastcompany.com/3022074/leadership-now/why-carving-out-5-hours-everyday-for-difficult-work-can-lead-to-greatness) indicates that the average person can perform up to three to five hours of [“deep work.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/how-to-train-your-brain-to-do-more-deep-work/) We all have had the experience where you’ve been working on the same motion for 12 hours straight, and you just know the work you’re producing isn’t your best. In other words, there’s a point of diminishing returns.

In fact, working [more than 50 hours](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2014/12/working-hours) diminishes your output so much that you might as well not work those hours at all. In fact, according to a recent [Inc. article](http://www.inc.com/travis-bradberry/the-perfect-amount-of-time-to-work-each-day.html?cid=sf01001&sr_share=twitter) from Dr. Travis Bradberry, “The eight-hour workday was created during the industrial revolution in an effort to cut down on the number of hours of manual labor that workers were forced to endure on the factory floor.” But this approach to work, which was invented over 200 years ago, is no longer working and isn’t helping us. In fact, it’s holding us back:

The brain naturally functions in spurts of high energy (roughly an hour) followed by spurts of low energy (15 to 20 minutes). — Dr. Travis Bradberry

These are difficult realities to accept. So, the question is, knowing that each of us has our own limitations on maximum output, how do we focus our attention on the work that is most important? And how does that jive with the need for downtime? In other words, how do we cultivate any semblance of “balance,” or my preferred term of “work/life integration?”

###Schedule Short Restful Moments
Schedule short (5 – 15 minutes) of breaks throughout your day and add it to your calendar. I use a meditation app called [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/), and it will automatically add reminders into my calendar. You may need to be strategic about how you describe these moments in your calendar, depending on your employer.

During these brief restful moments, the idea isn’t to try to force yourself to relax, but rather to pause and take inventory of your physical, mental, and emotional states. Are you feeling agitated? tired? cranky? hungry? happy? Until you can pay attention and notice what state you are in, you can’t begin to make changes.

###Plan out your day — first thing!

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Most of us start our day by checking the Inbox and spend all day long trying to stay on top of the Inbox. This may sometimes be necessary when there’s an important settlement negotiation, or other things that require that level of constant attention. However, most of the time, the Inbox serves as a distraction and pulls away from [engaging in deep work](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/how-to-train-your-brain-to-do-more-deep-work/).

If your habitual behavior is to check your email constantly throughout your day, it’s difficult to take control over your own schedule.

I suggest starting the day by taking 10 minutes to look at both long- and short-term projects. Those important projects that will require sustained attention and effort. Figure out how to fill your schedule with those big items first, then schedule time for the “busy work.”

###Get your smartphone out of the bedroom!
This is perhaps the one small change I’ve made in my life that has paid off in huge ways. I moved the iPhone from my nightstand to the kitchen counter. This has improved my life for the better in at least a few different ways.

- I don’t fall asleep checking email, and the iPhone doesn’t serve as a distraction as I’m shifting into sleep mode.
- If I happen to get up in the middle of the night, the temptation isn’t there to grab the phone and get sucked into the vortex.
- I don’t check my email as soon as I open my eyes in the morning.
###Create your own downtime rituals
Aside from my suggestions above, find both small and large ways of unplugging from work on a regular basis. This may mean you have a completely digital-free zone from Friday at 7:00 p.m. until Saturday at 12:00 p.m. (for example). It may mean you go on vacations where you limit your access from the office. It may mean you go home at 5:30 everyday to have dinner with your kids then log back into work later.

Find your own rituals that work for you. Don’t be prescriptive about it. Come up with a list of possible ideas, test it out for one to two weeks. Modify, reiterate, refine, and do it all over again. Be flexible. Have fun on your journey in finding your own sense of work/life integration!

Mary Jo White

Back in the aughts, with absolutely no fanfare, Urban Meyer was [reigning over a criminal operation](http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2010-09-17/sports/os-florida-gators-arrests-list-20100915_1_frankie-hammond-second-degree-misdemeanor-charge-misdemeanor-possession) that would make the Corleone family blush. Aaron Hernandez literally killed people. But Urban recruited Jesus’s hero Tim Tebow so no one seemed to care.

Some of Florida’s arrests were trumped up, but taken as a whole, the entire Florida affair highlighted Meyer’s superhuman ability to look away as people who helped him win games got pinched again and again and faced absolutely no consequences over it. That streak of skating by as everyone around him fell on the wrong side of the law appeared to have finally reached its end recently. After Meyer lied about his knowledge of a longtime assistant’s domestic abuse and everyone saw the messages to prove he’d been covering for his assistant for years, the [school hired former SEC chief Mary Jo White](https://legaltalknetwork.com/podcasts/thinking-like-a-lawyer/2018/08/ohio-state-football-a-quick-primer-on-internal-investigations/) to investigate Meyer’s organization and ultimately led to a three-game suspension when almost everyone expected him to be fired outright.

The number three is significant. The team’s first two games are against cupcakes that the Buckeyes will destroy handily, but the third game is a Top 25 matchup with TCU. So it’s not nothing.

But Debevoise’s report is a disgrace. It actually [takes the stance](http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/24450632/ohio-state-summary-findings-casts-doubt-coach-urban-meyer) that Meyer was informed about the abuse at almost every step of the way and that he not only didn’t do anything, he asked people for help covering it up:

Investigators also found that upon learning about accusations made by Courtney Smith in an Aug. 1 report from college football reporter Brett McMurphy, Meyer and a fellow football staffer discussed how to adjust the settings on Meyer’s phone so that text messages more than a year old would be deleted. When investigators examined Meyer’s phone, they did not find any message more than a year old but said they were unable to tell when Meyer adjusted the settings on his phone to get rid of older messages.

How is that not terminally damning? Over and over again the report says that investigators concluded that Meyer had knowledge and yet just as frequently the report puts forward ridiculous excuses for Meyer. None quite so astounding as White’s response to Meyer’s steadfast public denial that he had any knowledge of his assistant’s behavior when, as White’s report notes, he did.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“While those denials were plainly not accurate, Coach Meyer did not, in our view, deliberately lie,” lead investigator Mary Jo White said. “… Coach Meyer impressed us with his sincere commitment to the ‘respect for women’ core value that he espouses and tries to instill in his players.”

Truth is not truth, people! He was “confused” the report says. Oh.

And White was apparently impressed by his commitment to the “respect for women”? When her report is also concluding he knew about abuse for years and continued to employ the guy and went so far as to ask about how he could doctor his phones to cover up what he knew? What, exactly, is the impressive part?

Football coaches shouldn’t necessarily be in [the serious business of adjudicating wrongdoing](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/former-baylor-coach-rips-pepper-hamilton-calls-out-ken-starr/) but they also can’t be allowed to sit on their hands in the face of overwhelming troubles. White had an opportunity to send a message that these allegations are serious and that no one is above the law. Instead we got… not really much.

A former Ohio State president once quipped, “I’m just hoping that the coach doesn’t dismiss me.” The coach at that point was ultimately fired for multiple violations over tattoos. Apparently even with Debevoise & Plimpton on the case “beating your wife” is still not as important as “free tattoos” in this country.

Biglaw firms have been matching new compensation schemes left and right since January, so associates at firms that have been silent on salaries this whole entire time are getting pretty antsy. Where’s the money, you mofos? Well, at one firm that literally goes by MoFo, the money has finally arrived.

Morrison & Foerster — a firm that’s colloquially known as MoFo — announced a Cravath match yesterday afternoon, and associates are pretty pumped. This is what the new salary scale looks like at the firm:



MoFo associates will see their raises reflected in their paychecks on March 31, retroactive to January 1. Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Morrison & Foerster.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Stephen Curry (by dddd via Wikimedia Commons)

We’re well into summer associate season, and we’ve heard nary a peep about summers embarrassing themselves in epic fashion. No jumping off peers, no mooning fellow attorneys, no slapping senior associates, no hitting on partner spouses — all actually true stories from summers past. Just responsibility and diligence so far.

Millennials really are the worst.

Perhaps we’ll just have to highlight the firms who offer honestly awesome summer associate experiences for their people. Enter Wilson Sonsini, who set up a surprise visit for its summers from NBA Champ Steph Curry. You know, no big deal.

We just had the summer associate event of the century at Wilson Sonsini this past Friday. Our client, Steph Curry of the Golden State Warriors came to the firm as a surprise to celebrate their championship win two weeks ago. He mingled with associates and summer associates and took a bunch of photos after speaking to a crowd. Totally insane!



Curry is a WSGR client, having notably worked with them on [his startup Slyce](https://www.geekwire.com/2016/slyce/), a marketing automation and analytics platform for brand ambassadors that he co-founded.

In New York, you require critical mass and this is a very good step in the right direction. But it’s definitely not the end of our growth plan for New York.

— [Miguel Zaldivar](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/miguel-zaldivar), CEO of Hogan Lovells, in comments given to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/hogan-chief-looks-to-grow-new-york-office-after-raiding-stroock) on the firm’s hiring of nearly 70 partners and associates from Manhattan-based Stroock & Stroock & Lavan before the ailing firm [decided to close its doors](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/stroock-to-dissolve-close-its-doors-after-nearly-150-years-in-business/). For the most part, the [Stroock partners joining Hogan](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/hogan-lovells-to-welcome-nearly-30-partners-from-stroock-ahead-of-the-firms-dissolution/) are located in New York.

# Why I Became A Lawyer
## Helping others is a wonderful way to spend your career.

I was the eldest son of the managing partner of a midsize accounting firm founded by my grandfather in 1907. During the 1930s, it was one of the largest accounting firms and was supposed to merge with an accounting firm of equal size that is now part of the Big Four. To make matters worse, I was born on March 15, so it was assumed by everyone in the family that I was destined to take over the accounting firm.

For my 10th birthday, I was provided with a copy of the Internal Revenue Code and instructed to memorize it. My grandfather emphasized to me that accountants serve a vital function as they are the doctors for business. You can always hire people the do the mechanical and mathematical functions, but a real accountant understands and analyzes the numbers to advise the client. In addition to the general auditing, the firm was recognized for its tax work involving sophisticated business and personal transactions. The more this was discussed, the more I realized that the primary service providers for business transactions were almost always the attorneys, not the accountants.

While I was in high school, a family friend thought that I would be interested in law school and gave me some briefs to read concerning a case he was arguing to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. After reading the decision below, which was not favorable to his client, his brief, the opposition brief and reply brief, he asked for my thoughts on what he should emphasize at the argument.

I found it fascinating to read the story behind the case, how the district court viewed the plaintiff’s case and how each of the lawyers approached the appeal. I did not know how lucky I was that I was reading papers prepared by exceptional lawyers. They provided a meaningful service to their clients, and I could see that a decision by the Second Circuit could impact many other businesses and people in the future. I also understood that there was an alternative to becoming an accountant.

As the oldest grandchild, one of my responsibilities was to spend time with my grandfather on weekends. He was probably the most brilliant person I have ever known, and he was a very successful accountant, even though he became blind in his early 20s. He was a dairy farmer, but because his retina was detached and there was no cure at that time, he and his wife decided to enroll at the City College of New York to become accountants. He used an abacus, but more importantly, he had the gift of listening to numbers for various items on the balance sheet, the income statement and the cash flow statement and then advising clients on what they needed to do to improve their businesses. For his first four years he — along with my grandmother, who also became an accountant — worked for one of the very large accounting firms. He then decided to open his own firm near Wall Street and was very successful. I loved hearing the stories of how he helped businesses become more profitable and successful.

Rather than going to the Wharton School of Business, where my father was an active alumnus, I chose Cornell University because I wanted a liberal arts education. I had no idea what I really wanted to do for a living. During the summers, I sold Fuller Brushes door to door. One of my territories was in the slums of White Plains. I saw the plight of many of the tenants who were living in rat-infested housing. I started to research ways in which I could help them, including going to the building department to look at property records. Luckily, one of the employees at the building department was a friend of our family, and he directed me to where and what to look for and how I could help these people.

In my junior year, all I knew was that I did not want to become an accountant and stopped by the law school to find out if going to law school would defer my military obligation to serve as an officer in the U.S. Army. While I was asking questions and trying to obtain information about law school, the associate dean asked if I would like an interview. We discussed what I was looking for in life and why I did not want to go into the family accounting firm. At the end of the interview, I asked where I could obtain the application to apply to Cornell Law School. His response was that I had just had my interview and if my grades were as represented, Cornell had a special program that the first year of law school would also be my senior year. A few days later, Dean Penney called and stated that my grades were actually two percentage points higher than what I told him. He asked me why I understated my grade average. My answer was that I was not sure of my exact average. If I told him a number, and he found out that I had understated the number, that was much better than overstating my grades. His response was that was a sign of being a careful, thoughtful, and successful lawyer; I could begin Cornell Law next September.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Being a lawyer is a service profession. You have to generally like people and want to help them make their businesses or lives more successful. In the Army, although I could have been a full-time lawyer in the Judge Advocate Generals Corps, that would require a four-year commitment. As an infantry officer, I only had a two-year commitment. I chose the latter. And after I reported to duty, I learned that if a soldier is accused of an offense, that soldier had the right to choose anyone to defend him.

My personnel file said that I graduated from an Ivy League and law school. People in my unit started asking me to defend them, but I had the option of deciding which cases I wanted to handle. I only took those cases which I thought were interesting, and I learned to be a trial lawyer on the job with no guidance. But I was happy providing this type of service in some unique cases, such as representing someone accused of mass murder and a sergeant who was caught in a homosexual act two months before he would be eligible for a full pension. Although I intended to be a tax lawyer for a Wall Street firm, the idea of defending someone, especially successfully, was very satisfying.

After law school, I became an associate in a midsize New York law firm, working primarily in the tax law department. At 29, my father became quite ill, and I was asked to take over the tax department and manage the firm until he recuperated. The firm had the entire 42nd floor of 20 Exchange Pl., except for a corner office that was sublet to a securities lawyer.

I was very frustrated because at the end of the day, I could not quantify any meaningful accomplishments. Saving a business hundreds of thousands of tax dollars or a wealthy woman $50,000 in taxes left me unsatisfied. Listening to the lawyer who was bringing companies public and the sense of accomplishment he realized in creating new businesses sounded much more appealing. After talking it over with my wife, we moved to Washington D.C., where I was employed as an attorney/analyst with the Division of Corporation Finance of the SEC and acting tax counsel to the division. I never looked back. After all these years, I still enjoy providing legal services to help businesses and individuals. Every night, I feel that I have accomplished something to help someone else.

# Hottest Law Firms On Social Media
## Law firms aren't as afraid of social media as you might think.

The title may sound like an oxymoron, but some Biglaw heavy-hitters have plunged into the social media world and are [actually pretty good at it](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/11/19/dla-piper-leads-big-law-in-social-media-as-more-firms-shun-facebook-report/). While DLA Piper may not be delivering Kim Kardashian worthy takes on Instagram, they have built a cottage following [showing off firm culture](https://www.instagram.com/dlapiper/) with shots of attorneys receiving awards and performing volunteer work. It’s a forward-thinking marketing push that might not seem obvious for Biglaw.

Good2bSocial [releases an annual scorecard](https://legalmarketing.good2bsocial.com/2019-social-law-firm-index) for law firm social media efforts and this year DLA Piper secured the top spot, with White & Case, Norton Rose Fulbright, Baker McKenzie and Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe close behind.

[Good2bSocial founder and CEO Guy] Alvarez also said that although adoption rates are high, law firms often lag behind other professional service industries, particularly the Big Four, when it comes to effective usage.

“A lot of firms are still using social media as sort of a one-way content marketing tool,” he said. “The ones that struggle are just putting up promotional content. Social media is meant to engage and be social.”

No kidding.

Still, law firms simply being on social media is a development worthy of praise.

That lag in “effective usage” is why the solid Instagram presence among firms is a little surprising. To the extent firms play in the social media world, one might assume they’d just now be dipping into Facebook since that’s appropriately played out for law firms to think it’s cool. But in reality, Facebook is already on the outs with the more savvy firms:

On the flip side, “I was surprised at how much and how quickly firm usage of Facebook has declined,” Alvarez said. “Cambridge Analytica and privacy issues helped move that along. We saw some decline last year, but this year was a huge drop. Some firms have given up on Facebook completely.”

A few Am Law ranked firms are even engaging with YouTube for recruiting, which is such a natural use of the platform that it’s surprising that only 13 percent of firms are using it.

Unsurprisingly, LinkedIn boasts a strong law firm presence as it’s appropriately boring for the law firm environment, but paid LinkedIn accounts are narrowly outnumbered by Instagram with 31 percent of firms owning an Instagram account. Marketing teams in these global firms must be pretty plugged in.

A perusal of firm pages have found a woeful shortage of dank memes, but whatever they’re doing must work for them.

# I'm Starting To Think George Conway Might Not Like Donald Trump

George T. Conway III

George Conway’s continued social media assault upon the current president remains the single greatest thing on Twitter that doesn’t involve hurling cheese at babies. For almost two years, the Wachtell counsel has fired up the Twitter machines to call out the White House for all manner of policy missteps and acts of gross dishonesty, earning himself quite the loyal following of almost 370K.

That many of his public postings rip Trump as a liar despite the fact that Conway’s own wife composes and repeats most of those same lies drives a lot of the fascination with George’s tweets. Moreover, how does the infamously petty Trump keep Kellyanne around when every day brings another devastating rebuke from her husband?

He actually ended up doing this. What a lying piece of garbage. [#SummaCumLiar](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SummaCumLiar?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)[https://t.co/TkJzyGkrx4](https://t.co/TkJzyGkrx4)

Have we ever seen this degree of brazen, pathological mendacity in American public life? One day he makes a harmless slip of the tongue, something any mentally balanced person would laugh off.

But one lie on any subject is never enough for Donald Trump. So he next tells a different lie. Yes, I omitted a word, but to save time. A ridiculous assertion, of course—he really said “Tim Apple” instead of “Tim Cook of Apple” to save **a third of a second**?

— George Conway (@gtconway3d) [March 14, 2019](https://twitter.com/gtconway3d/status/1105986211720716294?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

ridiculous because it was irrelevant to the charges at hand—not that there was no proof of collusion, just that whether there was or wasn’t was irrelevant to the proceedings at hand. And yet he lies again—a blatant lie—about what the judge said in open court.

# Cravath Lays Out '3.5 Day/Week' Remote Working Model
## We may be seeing a consensus emerge.

As firms transition back to the post-pandemic reality we’ve seen 4-day work from the office proposals, 3-day models, and firms willfully oblivious to the potential recruiting nightmare of making everyone come back in full time. Which model would dominate the emerging post-pandemic Biglaw world? The answer may have just gotten a little clearer.

Cravath, the firm the legal world traditionally looks to for everything from bonuses to basic organization, has now spoken when it comes to remote work models. Befitting a firm that always endeavors to lead rather than follow, it’s got an innovative approach that still matches the mood of the moment.

We think the right balance is up to six business days of remote work each month. We expect and trust that professionals of the caliber of our people can determine how that should translate into their weekly routine when we are back in the office. Just as in the past, sometimes a week can be more flexible, and other times inflexible—all depending on client and group/team needs, In the spirit of being part of a high-functioning team, flexibility is an opportunity to benefit from the convenience or efficiency of working remotely while maintaining the nexus of the workplace for all of us.

Cravath managed to resolve the 3- and 4-day debate by going with “3.5.” Because 6 days a month is, roughly, a 3-day in office week for half the month and a 4-day week for the other half. But it also comes with the level of flexibility that attorneys require. Models that try to set which specific days attorneys will and won’t be in the office are just going to end in frustration.

On the other hand, too much flexibility may well provide no flexibility at all. A sufficiently busy lawyer may find that “up to 6 days” means “0 days” some months. The push and pull of flexibility and predictability will define the first few months of the new normal.

The memo from managing partner Faiza Saeed hits all the marks in the remote work debate, noting the power of the firm’s tech infrastructure allowing everyone to provide elite work product from home, while also recognizing that years of in-office interaction provided the roots of the seamless transition to remote. With a model allowing attorneys to forge their own schedules balancing time in and out of the office, Cravath thinks it’s got the perfect solution.

Another big reveal in the memo is the decision to go with business casual attire for in-office appearances:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
When we come back, and adjust to having to dress for the office (and perhaps wear something on our feet other than flip-flops), office attire will be business casual. Of course, where making a court appearance, the rules of attire will remain formal business, and when meeting with clients, judgment should be guided by the etiquette the client follows.

Cravath targets an office reopening of October 18.

# Biglaw Firms Continue To Roll Out Vaccine Mandates, Delay Reopenings
## Thanks to the Delta variant, Biglaw firms are quickly changing their plans.

The Delta variant of COVID-19 is spreading like wildfire across the United States and the globe, and day by day, Biglaw firms are taking extra precautions to keep their attorneys, staff, and their families. Vaccination mandates are now becoming commonplace, and many firms are now pushing back their proposed reopening dates in light of the latest news on the coronavirus crisis.

Thus far, the firms that have made vaccination a requirement for those returning to the office include [Akin Gump](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-will-require-employees-to-be-vaccinated-some-push-back-reopening-dates/?rf=1), [Arent Fox](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/top-20-biglaw-firm-wont-make-lawyers-return-to-office-in-2021-but-vaccines-will-be-required/), [Clifford Chance](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/elite-firm-will-require-vaccination-but-other-reopening-policies-are-very-flexible/), [Crowell & Moring](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-will-require-employees-to-be-vaccinated-some-push-back-reopening-dates/?rf=1), [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Davis Wright Tremaine](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/the-first-biglaw-firm-to-announce-a-covid-19-vaccination-plan/), [Dickinson Wright](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Fenwick & West](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Fried Frank](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Goodwin](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-will-require-employees-to-be-vaccinated-some-push-back-reopening-dates/?rf=1), [Hanson Bridgett](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Hueston Hennigan](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Lowenstein Sandler](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/lowenstein-covid-vaccine/), [McDermott Will & Emery](https://abovethelaw.com/company/social-meteor/), [Mintz](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/unvaccinated-lawyers-will-not-be-allowed-to-enter-this-biglaw-firm/), [Norton Rose Fulbright](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/vaccine-mandates-are-trending-across-biglaw-firms/?rf=1), [Patterson Belknap](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/vaccine-mandates-are-trending-across-biglaw-firms/?rf=1), [Paul Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/paul-weiss-vaccine/), [Reed Smith](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Ropes & Gray](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/top-biglaw-firms-chair-beseeches-lawyers-staff-to-get-vaccinated/?rf=1), [Sanford Heisler](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/this-firm-will-require-lawyers-staff-to-be-vaccinated-before-returning-to-work-or-else/), [Schiff Hardin](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Simpson Thacher](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-delay-openings-lay-down-strong-vaccination-policies/?rf=1), [Weil Gotshal](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/weil-reopening/), [Wilson Sonsini](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/wsgr-delays-opening-delta/), and [Winston & Strawn](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-delay-openings-lay-down-strong-vaccination-policies/?rf=1).

Now, we can add another five firms to the list. Debevoise & Plimpton, Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath, Cozen O’Connor, Seyfarth Shaw, and Stroock & Stroock & Lavan have all recently added vaccination mandates to their safety protocols, and some of them will be delaying their full reopenings due to the Delta variant.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Debevoise [announced last Thursday](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/08/05/debevoise-joins-other-big-law-firms-in-requiring-vaccinations-targets-october-return/) that all employees must be vaccinated to return to the office, beginning on September 30. Presiding partner Michael Blair noted in a memo that “[t]his requirement, which is strongly recommended by our medical advisors, will lessen the likelihood of community spread at the office, and the potential for a vaccinated individual to bring the virus home to family members who may be ineligible for a vaccine or have a pre-existing health condition.” Unlike other firms, Debevoise didn’t have to push back its full reopening date, because this is the first time we’re heard anything about their plans. Starting on October 11, the firm will require lawyers (and “some professional staff”) to work from the office one to two days each week, and starting on November 8, they will be required to work at least two-thirds of their time from the office.

Thanks to the new COVID surge, Faegre Drinker will be [putting off the start](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/08/06/big-laws-big-return-delayed-at-more-firms-as-leaders-stiffen-vaccine-rules/) of its hybrid work schedule, originally planned to begin on September 7. Now, the firm will start its new work model on October 4. On top of pushing back its reopening, the firm will now require vaccinations for anyone returning to the office. This new policy took effect on August 9.

Cozen O’Connor will be [delaying its full reopening](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/08/06/big-laws-big-return-delayed-at-more-firms-as-leaders-stiffen-vaccine-rules/) as well as the start of its hybrid work policy until September 20 (about two weeks after their original plans were supposed to commence on September 8). The firm will also be requiring all personnel to be vaccinated against COVID-19 after available vaccines receive full FDA approval. Until then, unvaccinated employees will be able to work remotely.

Seyfarth Shaw has a [new vaccination mandate](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/08/06/big-laws-big-return-delayed-at-more-firms-as-leaders-stiffen-vaccine-rules/), and per Pete Miller, the firm’s chair and managing partner, “[O]ur number one priority has always been the health and safety of our people. The development of multiple vaccinations was a turning point in the battle against COVID-19 and, as the Delta variant gains a foothold, these vaccines remain the best way to protect each other.” Now, anyone entering the firm’s offices must be fully vaccinated or show proof of a negative COVID-19 test, and unvaccinated personnel must test negative on a weekly basis. The firm’s reopening date is now September 27, as opposed to September 13, as was planned.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Stroock & Stroock & Lavan announced late last week that going forward, the firm will require anyone who intends to enter its offices to be [fully vaccinated](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/08/06/big-laws-big-return-delayed-at-more-firms-as-leaders-stiffen-vaccine-rules/). The firm will offer paid leave for those who take the time to get vaccinated, as well as an additional four hours of personal time off for those who show proof of their vaccination. All employees must work from the office at least three days a week upon its full reopening on October 4.

Will your firm be changing its plans when it comes to vaccination for attorneys and staff thanks to the Delta variant? Please let us know.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to the office.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Some experts were recently discussing corporate structures, and they mentioned that the typical executive has eight to 10 direct reports.  This was no surprise; it’s how corporations operate.

But the experts then mentioned that executives who are “player/coaches” should have only four to six direct reports.  “Player/coaches” are those who, like lawyers, are expected both to manage other people and also to advise a business or otherwise — how should I put this? — actually do work.

That’s just my old “law firm lawyer” showing through, I guess.

In a law firm, there’s “work” — getting stuff done on behalf of a paying client — and there’s “wasting time” — everything else.  That’s silly, of course, because law firms must do many things beyond billable work.  Firms must recruit new lawyers, train junior lawyers, develop business, handle pro [bono](//0) cases, and the like.  But law firms often pay only lip service — and not money — to those who deign to handle non-billable tasks.  At the end of the year, when firms are deciding who gets paid how much, the person who wasted time doing non-billable stuff will generally be punished, and everyone knows it.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
I’m thus still astonished that corporations would think that typical executives could manage 10 people, but lawyers could manage only six because of the “distraction” of the only thing that law firms would consider to be “work.”  It’s a distraction — a distraction — to give advice, negotiate contracts, revise briefs, and do that other stuff.  A manager should spend his time managing, not doing that other stuff.

I mentioned this to a friend at another company, and the friend scoffed at my ignorance:  “You should hear the people at my joint,” the friend said.  “They have no respect for ‘ditch-diggers’ — employees who spend their time doing productive tasks.  Management is king.”

Maybe I’m surprised because of the nature of being a lawyer.  If you’re a trial lawyer, then eventually you — you personally — must know the case.  You’re going to argue it, and put on witnesses, and cross-examine people.  Beyond a certain point, you can’t delegate that to a team; it’s up to you.

So, too, for appellate advocates.  Appellate lawyers can delegate a lot of brief-writing and research and preparation.  But eventually you — you personally — must know the case.  It’s the essence of what you do, and it’s non-delegable.  Eventually, you have to dig a ditch.

The question is whether, at a corporation, most executives have to really know anything.  Can you honestly just manage a gang and then give a speech that the gang wrote for you?  Can you rely on the PowerPoint deck and the speaking notes that the gang prepared for you?  Can you bluff your way through the client meeting based on the bullet points the gang handed you a half-hour before the meeting?

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
That point struck home again when our annual “engagement survey” — essentially measuring job satisfaction — asked whether “your manager takes time to get to know you personally.”

At a law firm, you’d be punished for getting to know folks personally:  “All that clown does is stand around the office chatting with people.  Doesn’t he have any work to do?”

At a corporation, you’re evaluated in part based on whether you took the time to get to know folks personally.  You’re supposed to do this, for heaven’s sake, and it’s held against you if you don’t.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs.

# Biglaw Firm's Move To New Office Means It's Time For Some Buyouts
## Which firm is packing up its things and hoping to send employees packing too?

As we noted back in 2016, several Biglaw firms have opted to pack up and leave their office homes and plant new roots [across town in Hudson Yards](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/the-hot-new-location-for-biglaw/). Milbank Tweed Hadley & McCloy is but one of them. Milbank has spent about 150 years in its current downtown location, but with its decision to invest in new real estate comes the firm’s decision to completely change the way it operates as far as legal support staff is concerned. Buyouts abound with this firm’s move.

Here’s a statement we received from the firm regarding the plan for its secretaries:

In anticipation of the firm’s move to Hudson Yards in 2018, Milbank is transitioning to a team-based legal support staff model, which is in widespread use throughout the industry. To facilitate this change, the firm has offered its legal secretaries in New York a generous voluntary package that includes an incentive payment, severance commensurate with years of service, and paid health benefits. Milbank expects the majority of its legal secretaries will move with the firm to Hudson Yards.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
For those interested in leaving the firm on a voluntary basis, these “generous” packages and added “incentive” payments don’t sound half bad. We wish all of the affected legal professionals at Milbank who decide to take this deal the best of luck should they choose to seek new job opportunities in the legal industry and beyond.

If your firm or organization is closing its doors or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know; this is a subject we cover quite closely.

# Youth And Inexperience Can Be A Resource For Some Lawyers

Many lawyers might believe that young and inexperienced lawyers are at a practical disadvantage when they start their careers. Indeed, law school does little to train students to be practicing attorneys, and individuals starting their legal careers might not have the hands-on knowledge needed to excel in the practice of law. However, in some instances, youth and inexperience can be an invaluable resource, and partners should consider this when tasking young attorneys to complete projects.

Perhaps the biggest advantage of being a young and inexperienced attorney is that people are much more willing to cut a younger lawyer slack than a seasoned attorney who should know better. This is especially important in litigation and other times when advocacy is important to a representation. In many instances, judges and others can have substantial discretion in how they handle matters, and they may be willing to be more flexible with young and inexperienced lawyers who might not know better about how practical matters work in the legal profession.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
For instance, one time early in my legal career, I had to appear at a discovery conference on another attorney’s case. This other attorney hadn’t stayed on top of his files, and he owed substantial discovery to the other side. This other lawyer was nervous that the judge might strike his answer because of discovery deficiencies or at least put language in an order which stated that his answer would be stricken if discovery was not provided within a certain amount of time.

Several attorneys for the defendants, the plaintiff, and I all conferenced the matter in front of the judge. All of us took turns describing the status of our discovery responses and making excuses for why responses were not provided. I looked super young at the time compared to all of these veteran lawyers at the conference and was confused about the status of discovery since this was not my file.

The judge eventually entered an order holding that if all of the defendants except our client did not provide discovery by a set deadline, their answers would be stricken. One of the attorneys asked why my client was excluded from this language in the order, and the judge responded by saying that I was too young to be thrown to the wolves. Incredibly, being only a few years removed from law school helped me since the judge did not want to hold me to the same standard as veteran attorneys who could presumably be held to a higher standard.

In addition, younger and more inexperienced lawyers may also receive more favorable treatment from partners. Law firm partners are much more willing to spend the time and resources to train younger lawyers than to train attorneys who have been practicing for a while. There are many reasons why this may be the case. For one, it might be more comfortable for attorneys to train people who are younger than them since there is an expectation that more senior attorneys who have spent time practicing will train junior lawyers who are less seasoned in the practice of law. In addition, younger lawyers are much more likely to be a blank slate and not come to their jobs with preconceived notions about how legal matters should be handled.

For instance, I once handled mass torts cases in a very seasoned mass tort that required specialized training. It took months of reviewing materials, practical experience, and other effort before I felt comfortable taking on significant responsibilities on this mass torts matter. The firm might not have had the patience to train someone with more experience, and in such situations, lack of experience can be a benefit.

Moreover, youth can be a resource for business development as well. There is often some novelty around youth and inexperience since younger lawyers are more likely to have enthusiasm about the law than people who have practiced law for a significant period of time. Moreover, clients often like to see that lawyers in different stages of their careers are handling a portfolio of work so that there are lawyers in place who are familiar with the client should more senior lawyers retire.

While working at other law firms, I went to several pitches with partners, and I think that my presence at the pitches helped us generate business. Not only could prospective clients see the associate who would be performing the majority of the work on their case, but the energy of having a younger lawyer might have benefited the pitch. As such, law firms should consider bringing younger lawyers to pitches to help originate business.

All told, it can sometimes be difficult for young and more inexperienced lawyers since they may not know much of the practical “nuts and bolts” of practicing law. However, in many situations, being young and inexperienced can be a significant resource for some lawyers.

# Will American Politics Soon Return To Normal?

I admit it: I was wrong.

Politicians always offended me when they showed artificial respect for each other.  On the Senate floor, a Democrat would refer to “the distinguished gentleman from Mississippi,” when the Democrat really was itching to say, “that moronic, low-life, S.O.B.” During debates, politicians would refer to their opponents as “my good friend, with whom I simply disagree on some issues,” when they were really hoping their opponents would be hanged, drawn, and quartered.

I always thought it would be more honest, and better for society, and surely more entertaining, if politicians said what they really thought about each other.

I was wrong.

The gloves have now come off. During the 2016 campaign, Donald Trump showed that you could simply insult your opponents — they had ugly wives; were low-energy; were crooked; whatever — and the public didn’t condemn the insults. Now, it’s a matter of “owning the libs,” or locking your opponents up, or accusing your opponents of pedophilia, or anything else that comes to mind.

I was wrong when I thought that would be an improvement. That’s bad.

When politicians showed a hint of civility to each other, the general public didn’t get quite as worked up by political debates. Once politicians took off their gloves, everyone else felt empowered to take off their gloves, too — and social media gave everyone the chance to express personal insults, completely removed from discussions of policy.

That change may well be permanent. This genie came out of the bottle; I fear we’ll never put him back. The age of insults is here: We’re seeing it in the 2022 primary season, and we’ll see it in the 2022 general elections, and we’ll see it in the 2024 campaign, and, I suspect, we’ll see it on and on into the future.

Campaigns are now a free-for-all: Five percent policy, ninety-five percent name-calling.

So, on the one hand, name-calling — a trend that Trump really started — is here to stay. On the other hand, I suspect that, once Trump is off the scene, the desire to praise Trump to the heavens will end.

I’m not talking about Trump’s personal political power. I’m talking about his legacy. Conservatives still praise Ronald Reagan to the heavens, even though he’s no longer around to endorse candidates. Conservatives loved what Reagan did with the defense budget, taxes, and so on, and they still hold him up as an example of how a great conservative would govern.

The instant Trump is off the political scene — by saying that he won’t run in 2024; running and losing in 2024; illness or death; whatever — the Trump legacy will vanish.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
After all, there is no real Trump policy legacy. I can’t believe that Republicans will remain the party opposed to free trade, in favor of ballooning deficits, and so forth. I’m not sure where the party will go on “America first” versus “NATO’s not such a bad idea, after all.” And there are, of course, some policies — anti-immigrant, economic populism, social conservatism — that may have legs. But there was no platform in 2020, and there’s no Trump policy legacy to persist into the future.

Without a real policy, all that’s left is the Trump personality. That has always had very few admirers, even within the party. Many Republican leaders who supported Trump would distance themselves from his language, saying, for example, “I’m not quite sure I would have used those words,” after some Trumpian outburst. And Republicans are starting to say out loud — and will speak even more forcefully once Trump’s gone — that Trump was a little childish, maintaining that every official who left his administration had always been an idiot, anyway, and that women with whom he’d allegedly had affairs (or worse) were “horseface” or not his “type.”

All the people who loathed Trump in 2016, but adore him now — Ted Cruz, and Lindsey Graham, and on and on — will come to loathe Trump once again in 2025.  “He was never really my type,” they’ll say, “but the only way to influence policy is to stay on good terms with those in power. I had to say all that stuff I didn’t believe, because otherwise I would have lost my influence.”

At that point, only one piece of Trump’s legacy will remain — the degradation of our political discourse.

I’m afraid we’ll all be the worse for that.

# Elite Biglaw Firms Now Offering $500K In Signing Bonuses To Supreme Court Clerks
## Which firms are throwing half a million dollars in bonuses at former SCOTUS clerks?
By [Staci Zaretsky](https://abovethelaw.com/author/staci-zaretsky/)

Just how much is a former Supreme Court clerk worth? How much are Biglaw firms and prestigious boutiques willing to pay to woo associates with supreme intellect and inside insights about how the nation’s highest court operates and how certain justices think? Back in 2021, we [reported](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/elite-biglaw-firms-likely-to-offer-450k-in-signing-bonuses-to-supreme-court-clerks/) that $450,000 was the forecasted rate for signing bonuses for former Supreme Court clerks. Yes, you read that correctly: former SCOTUS clerks were making almost double their Supreme bosses’ salaries in bonus money just for signing on the dotted line, on top of their base salaries and regular bonuses.

Several firms that are considered heavy hitters when it comes to wooing SCOTUS clerks — off hand, we’re talking about firms like Jones Day, Kirkland & Ellis, Gibson Dunn, and Susman Godfrey, just to name a few — have offered big-time bonuses (i.e., $400K+) to their SCOTUS clerk recruits in the past. Fast forward to 2024, where first-year salaries for associates have climbed to $225,000, and high court clerks now cost an even prettier penny.

According to the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/25/supreme-court-clerks-bonuses-law-firms/), firms are opening the coffers wide for associates fresh off a high court clerkship. Here are some of the details:

During the courting process, the city’s top law firms treat this elite group of lawyers to perks like an expensive dinner at the Wharf or Penn Quarter or a trip to a baseball game or spa. The recruitment is so competitive that signing bonuses for Supreme Court law clerks have reached a new high — $500,000, according to a spokeswoman for law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.

Wow! Supreme Court clerks are now worth half a million dollars on a Biglaw market, which is an absolutely mind-blowing amount. Talk about some golden handcuffs! But if that’s the going rate for legal superstars, you can bet that Biglaw firms are going to happily pay for it.

As noted by the Post, Jones Day continues to corner the market on Supreme Court clerks, having hired 22 clerks since October Term 2020, while Gibson Dunn and Kirkland & Ellis follow behind, with 12 clerks and eight clerks each. These firms are shelling out a ton of cash to hire the very best — and it leaves us wondering if other firms are willing to follow in their footsteps.

If you know that your firm is paying $500,000 or more for SCOTUS clerks, [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=SCOTUS%20Clerkship%20Bonuses) (subject line: “SCOTUS Clerkship Bonuses”) or text us (646-820-8477), and we’ll compile a list of every firm that’s paying so generously for supreme talent.

# Am Law 100: What Does It Mean For Those On The Job Hunt?

In case it was not obvious from the flurry of press releases that flooded inboxes earlier this week, on Tuesday, The American Lawyer released the [2019 Am Law 100](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/04/23/the-2019-am-law-100-by-the-numbers/).  This yearly thorough examination and ranking of Biglaw financials provides a chance for many firms to crow about record-breaking revenues while others demur and talk about economic headwinds.  While being at the top of the Am Law 100 is obviously what many, if not all, firms strive for, merely being included can be a tremendous achievement.  Though admittedly, It is rare to see such rejoicing when ranked 87th in anything — the inverse of Ricky Bobby’s famed axiom.



Unlike the more black box nature of law school rankings, the Am Law 100 is rather straightforward, sorting firms based on [gross revenue](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/04/23/the-2019-am-law-100-gross-revenue/) and [profits per equity partner](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/04/23/the-2019-am-law-100-profits-per-equity-partner/) (PEP) while also collecting the data on [revenue and profits per lawyer](https://www.law.com/2019/04/23/what-helps-the-super-rich-maintain-their-success/).  While it is plausible that some manipulation can take place by limiting the number of equity partners, such a practice is unlikely considering the amount of money those non-equity partners would be losing as well as the simple fact that the Am Law 100 lacks the ubiquity of its law school ranking counterparts, where manipulation can be rampant.[[1]](#_ftn1)

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
So how is this relevant for law students or practicing attorneys seeking to make a change?  As I have [previously written](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-fall-recruiting-season-part-i/), when law students gear up for the “Fall” (it really starts in July, if not earlier) interview cycle, researching various employers is a necessary method of not only standing out in an interview but also beginning to determine which employer might be the best destination.  The Am Law 100, and its soon to be released Am Law 200 counterpart, can be part of that research effort, along with a litany of other sources including Above the Law’s own [law firm rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firm-rankings/top-law-firms/).

So, what should one focus on?  Gross revenue gives you a sense of the largest players in the Biglaw game.  As someone who graduated law school in the midst of the Great Recession, I am always wary of the economic cycle, knowing that a down turn will eventually come and it will likely have at least some impact on legal employment.  With revenues over $3 billion, it is hard to believe that Kirkland & Ellis (#1 in Gross Revenue) and Latham & Watkins (#2) are going to be in dire straits during the next recession, though a look at the two firms’ debt levels would assuage any lingering doubts.  It is also doubtful that those members of the three-comma club are going to be fail to pay market salaries or bonuses to their attorneys.


But it is not just overall numbers that are worth examining.  Year-over-year revenue changes can provide a sense as to firms that are flourishing and those that while not necessarily floundering, perhaps should be looked at with a bit more caution by prospective candidates.  The ability of Nelson Mullins to increase their gross revenue by 27.5 percent should make any candidate, be it entry-level of lateral, excited about the future of the firm.  The 7.3 percent revenue drop for Baker Botts, sending it from 50th in the Gross Revenue rankings last year to 58th this time around, could be potentially worrisome.

While Gross Revenue figures can tell you part of the story with regards to economic health and vitality in Biglaw, it does not tell the whole story.  Perhaps a better metric is PEP.  To understand why, think about international economics for a moment.  The simplest way to measure the relative economic strength of various countries is to look at their Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  Not surprisingly, per the [World Bank’s 2017 figures](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.cd?view=map&year_high_desc=true), the countries with the two largest economies are the United States and China.  But those countries are home, respectively, to the thirdlargest and the largest populations in the world.  Having a large economy makes sense if you have a lot of people.  A better metric is GDP per capita. The World Bank shows Germany and India as having the fourth and fifth largest economies in the world, as measured by GDP.  However, India has more than 16 times the population of Germany.  So Germany’s [per capita GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita) is $50,715 while India’s is $7,056.  It is clear which country’s residents have the higher standard of living.

How does this apply to Biglaw?  Well, BakerMcKenzie sits at third in the Gross Revenue rankings, but they also have 4,720 attorneys firm wide.  With that big of a firm, they better have a lot of revenue coming in the door to deal with what has to be remarkably high overhead.  PEP provides us with the Biglaw equivalent of GDP per capita.  When looking at these numbers, the biggest takeaway is the sheer dominance of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.  With a PEP of $6.53 million, the gap between Wachtell and second place Kirkland at $5.037 million is the roughly same as the gap between Kirkland and #12 Latham at $3.452 million.  To borrow an analogy, Wachtell is playing a different sport than the rest of Biglaw, which probably helps explains its famed compensation structure that can see associates rake in bonuses that are 100 percen of their base salary.  Wachtell’s dominance is not limited to PEP; their revenue per lawyer this past year was $3.207 million.  Second place is Sullivan & Cromwell at $1.739 million, while 25th place is Goodwin Proctor at $1.255 million.  The gap between Wachtell and the #2 firm in revenue per lawyer is MORE THAN TRIPLE the gap between #2 and #25.  That’s absurd.  The obvious takeaway is that if you want to make as much money as possible in the practice of law, try to get a job at Wachtell.  Though that’s [easier said than done](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/the-key-to-wachtells-success-how-they-pay-their-partners/).

Outside the revenue figures, the Am Law 100 also contains some [interesting nuggets](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/04/23/the-2019-am-law-100-by-the-numbers/) which can provide some insight, or at least a healthy chuckle.  For example, someone at Fox Rothschild claimed to have billed 4,200 hours last year, which is either what I will call some creative billing or evidence that robots truly have started taking over the associate ranks.  While 4,000+ billable hours is unique and thus not a particularly valuable data point for job seekers, the fact that Fish & Richardson clocked in with the highest billable hours per lawyer at 1,916 is worth knowing.  On the one hand, it is often better to be busy than slow at a law firm if you are concerned about your long-term job security.  On the other hand, 2,000 billable hours is target throughout much of Biglaw for associates to ensure a bonus.  If that’s the average at a firm you are considering, be prepared for a lot of long nights and weekends.

The Am Law 100 provides a valuable service by crunching the numbers and showing readers how various law firms stack up financially, benefiting not only the curious amongst us but also those who seek to make an informed employment decision.

[[1]](#_ftnref1) See, e.g., U.S. News measures law school expenditures not on a per-student basis, but on a per J.D. student basis.  Thus, hypothetically, schools can use non-J.D. students as veritable ATMs, pumping money into the school via tuition, which is then spent by the school, but never counting toward the denominator of the expenditure equation.

# If It Isn’t One Thing, It’s Another

Literally right on the heels of the remote February bar exam comes the announcement that the California bar exam will be [held remotely in July](http://www.calbar.ca.gov/Admissions/Examinations/California-Bar-Examination/July-2021-California-Bar-Exam).   Hopefully, there will be no recurrence of the ridiculous overreach of the October 2020 exam, in which the examiners claimed that a third of the test takers cheated, and it was up to them to prove they didn’t. How easy is it to prove a negative? I’d ask how much further down the rabbit hole of absurdity the bar exam can go, but I don’t want Joe Patrice to answer the question.

I do have a solution to the “what can I bring to the bar exam” question. How about women can only take the bar exam when they’re past menopause? Ridiculous? Of course, this will eliminate all the patronizing state by state proclamations as to what women examinees can or cannot bring with them. Menstrual products? These arbitrary rules set down by bar examiners, should be dumped in the trash, just like every other stupid and discriminatory rule against women. Is it necessary that the ABA weigh in on this issue? It is way beyond the time to drive a stake in the heart of these [stupid and arcane rules](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/tampons-and-pads-shouldnt-be-prohibited-at-bar-exam-aba-house-says?). Just imagine what the male late night TV hosts could do with this story.

And as for the male examinees, they also don’t have a walk in the park at bar exam time.  Is having to pee in a bottle really a good idea, a better idea, than being able to use the restroom and wash hands, which we have all been told to do ad nauseam during this past year? At least peeing into a bottle is better than the lack of choices that women have. Hand wipes and hand sanitizers are probably also a violation of something. People who are going to cheat will find a way to do so, and it’s insulting to most examinees who do the right thing.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
These ridiculous policies are on a par with the “no more lawyer jokes” that the then president of the State Bar of California put forth 30 years or so ago.  Jay Leno, then host of the Tonight Show, mocked him mercilessly. Which is worse: being made fun of or taking the lead in not taking yourself too seriously?  You decide, but I have always thought that it’s better to be in control than not, and isn’t that one reason why all of us overachievers became lawyers?

Do you suffer from Zoom fatigue? I do, especially after I have had three or four Zoom calls in a single day. Fatigued in body and mind, these calls, which were once a novelty are now front and center in everyone’s life. I long for the days of phone calls. Yes, I know that I can turn off the video, but if I am the only one doing so, it feels a little strange. Phone calls are so much simpler and easier … no Power Point deck to look at, no checking out others to see if they are doing the same things I am doing (e.g., reading emails, drafting documents, etc.) I plead nolo.

The author of a paper on Zoom fatigue calls out four things: extended eye contact (do your eyes water?), more effort is needed when nodding and other nonverbal signals, the Hollywood Squares (remember that quiz show?) screen is unnatural, and my personal pet peeve: we can’t move around, which is why I bought a new seat cushion and lumbar back support. Clearly [business expenses](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/zoom-fatigue-why-we-have-it-how-to-fix-it.html). He suggests some easy fixes. Since we don’t know how long WFH will continue or whether it will be back to the office at some point yet to be determined, now is as good a time as any to try them out.

For dinosaur lawyers in the Third Circuit, there may be a glimmer of hope. A 70-year-old orthopedic surgeon, who was sacked after a hospital merger, sued for age discrimination, and alleged, among other things, that his replacements were “significantly younger” and less qualified. The surgeon had several months of surgeries already booked at the time of firing. Naturally, the employer moved to dismiss, but the Third Circuit said, “not so fast.” The court found that the plaintiff had adequately pleaded age discrimination and that the issue of “significantly younger” was [a factual issue](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8669755418737050172&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr) awaiting discovery.

Ageism is still rampant. As a former employment lawyer, I understand the need for succession planning and the need to make room for succeeding generations. However, many dinosaurs still have a lot to contribute, and not just in billable hours. There must be some ways to make room for the older and the younger. Does anyone think that “resistant to change” is code for ageism?

Finally, as we start year two of what has been an unreal world for all of us, we need to take stock of who we are, who we were, and even perhaps who we hope to be.

The past year has shown us many things, among which is that we are not our jobs. Our profession, our jobs, are ways to support ourselves and those we care about, those who need our help, but our identities need to be more than just being lawyers. We are parents, sons and daughters, mentors, friends, volunteers, artists, writers, gamers, and the list goes on and on. We need to make sure that we discern the difference between work and the rest of our lives, and who we are as people, and not just as faces on a Zoom screen.

The last year has thrown a curveball (or a slider or fastball or sinker) into the whole [concept of work-life balance](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/06/style/work-life-balance-tips-pandemic.html?campaign_id=33&emc=edit_sl_20210301&instance_id=27588&nl=smarter-living&regi_id=78061995&segment_id=52544&te=1&user_id=0d22f8d038b2fef3184a5c3bba481c1c). It’s up to us to determine how we hit the pitch or strike out.

She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

# Have Biglaw Firms Pressed ‘Pause’ On Diversity Initiatives Thanks To Anti-DEI Lawsuits?
## Do these lawsuits have Biglaw firms running scared when it comes to diversity?

Not so much this image.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Firms are waiting to see if more lawsuits are filed. There seems to be a pause on many of the efforts firms were engaged in—even efforts that pose no risk. It might be because firm leaders are having to spend a disproportionate amount of time on this.

— Joelle Emerson, co-founder and CEO of DEI consultancy Paradigm, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/09/14/blum-lawsuits-stress-test-law-firms-dei-commitment-execution/) on the waiting game Biglaw firms seem to be playing when it comes to their diversity initiatives. The “pause” Emerson speaks of comes in the wake of [lawsuits filed](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/two-biglaw-firms-sued-over-diversity-initiatives/) by conservative legal activist Edward Blum against Morrison & Foerster and Perkins Coie related to their diversity fellowship programs. MoFo has already [changed the language in its application](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/biglaw-caves-morrison-foerster-changes-diversity-fellowship-criteria-following-lawsuit/), as has Gibson Dunn, even though the latter firm [hadn’t been targeted](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/gibson-dunn-second-biglaw-firm-to-cower-from-threatened-affirmative-action-suit/) by Blum.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs.

For almost two decades, [Kinney Recruiting](https://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/) has been a top international legal recruitment agency and home to some of the most distinguished legal recruiters in the world. With vast market experience and our trademark “no BS” approach, Kinney’s recruiters are favorites among candidates and clients in the legal industry. We are keen to share some of what we have learned with more people, so we have launched [Ask a Legal Recruiter](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/ask-a-legal-recruiter/), an opportunity for our recruiters to answer your questions. Do you want to know more about how legal recruiting works or what lateraling looks like? How about our take on the market? If you have a question, email [askarecruiter@kinneyrecruiting.com](mailto:askarecruiter@kinneyrecruiting.com) and we will get back to you with our take!!

Question: “Would it be weird to take a vacation 3 months after lateraling?”

[Daniel Roark](https://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/recruiters/daniel-roark/): This is a very common situation for lateraling candidates and one where an experienced recruiter will assist their candidates by either backchanneling with a firm’s recruiting department/hiring attorney(s) and/or coaching a candidate on the proper timing and manner for discussing such scheduled items post-start date. Should a candidate discuss their booked trip to Tulum in a first interview? Definitely not. But as the contours of an offer for employment and related timing considerations take shape, discussions of a candidate’s schedule should occur. For example, I just represented a candidate for an in-house position who had a long-planned trip to France scheduled for one month after the client’s suggested start date. During the offer stage, I was able to discuss my candidate’s planned vacation with the client, and we reached an efficient solution where the candidate would start as soon as possible (after providing notice) in order to get moved, situated, and trained prior to departing for his vacation. Issues regarding schedules (planned holidays, weddings, medical issues, life events) are commonplace and generally resolved favorably when dealing with reasonable parties who are willing to compromise on some level.

Question: “How long does the typical hire process take after the offer? Including background check, conflicts, etc.”

[Joshua Shirley](https://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/recruiters/joshua-shirley/): Typically, after a Biglaw offer is made and it is accepted, the process takes about 3 weeks for background checks and conflicts to clear. In some cases, it can be longer for laterals who need to have background checks cleared in other countries. Some firms can complete conflicts in under two weeks. Conflicts can also take longer, think 4-7 weeks, during extremely busy periods of lateral movement in the market. These processes typically go quicker and smoother when you’re working with someone who is experienced in guiding attorneys through them. With Kinney’s collective experience, we’ve seen it all and know what works best and what doesn’t.

Question: “How do I go from Big4 to a law firm?”

[Jack Hopper](https://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/recruiters/jack-p-hopper/): The answer largely depends on what kind of work a candidate wants to do with a law firm. If they want to stay strictly in tax, the transition can be more fluid, although still not easy. If the desire is to join an M&A practice for instance, then gaining tax experience in the M&A context is obviously helpful. It is also important to have realistic expectations. Going from Big4 to Biglaw is very difficult without prior law firm experience, and of course you must have an impeccable academic pedigree as well. Targeting smaller regional firms and boutiques can offer more opportunities, particularly for those candidates with strong academics. This way you can start gaining law firm experience and can move up to Biglaw once you have gained said experience.

[Daniel Roark](https://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/recruiters/daniel-roark/): My esteemed colleague, Jack, has correctly framed some of the challenges in transitioning from Big4 to Biglaw. For candidates who hold Tax LLMs and have accrued some transactional tax experience, this lateral option is the most available. For all, much will depend on the state of the hiring market at the time. In 2020 and 2021 when Am Law 100 firms were luring corporate associates with up to six-figure signing bonuses, we were successful in placing candidates with more non-traditional background (i.e., candidates not practicing Biglaw) in regional or major firm roles. Often these candidates were more junior in their careers and required to take steps back in class year to accommodate such a lateral move. For more senior candidates, the way into a law firm is through provable and portable client relationships. Business Development is critical and if you can help a law firm grow its revenue, your candidacy is viewed with favor.

Ahoy, Kirkland & Ellis!

Huge news in the world of law firm lateral moves: [Kirkland & Ellis](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/kirkland-ellis/), one of Biglaw’s biggest and best names, has hired former U.S. solicitor general Paul Clement, former assistant attorney general Viet Dinh, and all of Clement and Dinh’s colleagues at the elite boutique of [Bancroft PLLC](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/bancroft-pllc/). Wow!

From the [K&E press release](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=230&itemId=12393):

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Kirkland & Ellis LLP is pleased to announce that Paul D. Clement, former U.S. Solicitor General and top U.S. Supreme Court and appellate lawyer, will join the Firm as a partner in the Washington, D.C., office. Mr. Clement is currently a partner of Bancroft PLLC, a top appellate litigation boutique in Washington, D.C., founded by Viet D. Dinh, former U.S. Assistant Attorney General for Legal Policy. Mr. Dinh and all of Bancroft’s 15 other attorneys, including Chris Bartolomucci, Erin Murphy, George Hicks and Jeff Harris, will also join Kirkland with Mr. Clement by Oct. 1, in time for the new Supreme Court Term.

Returning to Biglaw is a homecoming of sorts for Paul Clement. Recall that he was at King & Spalding for a short stint after serving as solicitor general, before he [left for Bancroft](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/04/paul-clement-quits-king-spalding-after-ks-moves-to-drop-doma-defense/) in 2011, amid the controversy surrounding his defense of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).

Clement was said to earn [$5 million a year](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/04/paul-clement-and-king-spalding-defend-doma-at-a-discount/) at King & Spalding. His pay at Kirkland — one of Biglaw’s most lucrative firms, with average profits per partner of $3.6 million, #5 in the [Am Law 100](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/2/) — should be well into the mid-seven figures. As noted in the K&E press release, the 50-year-old Clement “has argued more Supreme Court cases since 2000 than any lawyer in or out of government,” with more than 80 arguments before SCOTUS.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Viet Dinh — the 48-year-old founder and head of Bancroft, a leading litigator and constitutional law expert, and highly sought-after counselor to America’s top corporations, especially on corporate-governance issues — should also get a huge payday. Launched in 2003, Bancroft has thrived over its 13-year-history, so K&E must have made Dinh and his partners an offer that was simply too good to refuse.

Kirkland is hiring all 17 of Bancroft’s attorneys (including young Supreme Court superstar [Erin Murphy](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/09/a-young-superstar-makes-her-supreme-court-debut/)). This shouldn’t be a surprise; Bancroft is Above the Law’s [top firm by law school pedigree](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/top-litigation-firms-by-law-school-pedigree-2015/), and its lawyers boast pretty much every elite credential under the sun. Per the [press release](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=230&itemId=12393):

“The accomplishments of the Bancroft team are amazing, with 120 U.S. Supreme Court arguments, nine Supreme Court clerkships, 17 courts of appeals clerkships, and five Presidential appointments,” added Gene Assaf, a litigation partner and member of Kirkland’s Global Management Executive Committee based in Washington, D.C. “We see immense opportunity in combining forces.”

Note, by the way, that this appears as a technical matter to be a “mass lateral hire” (à la [Morgan Lewis and Bingham](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/morgan-lewis-completes-its-conquest-of-bingham-mccutchen/), or [Andrews Kurth and Kenyon & Kenyon](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/is-a-merger-in-the-cards-for-this-troubled-law-firm/)). In other words, it’s not a “law firm merger” per se, even if the final outcome still involves all of Bancroft’s attorneys getting absorbed into Kirkland.

Congratulations to Kirkland on the incredible influx of tremendous talent, and congratulations to Bancroft lawyers on their impressive new home!

We expect to receive additional details over the next few hours; refresh this post for the latest. If you have information you’d like to share, please feel free to [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Kirkland%20and%20Bancroft) or text us (646-820-8477). Thanks!

UPDATE (2:10 p.m.): Here’s coverage of the news from [Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/kirkland-ellis-acquires-top-scotus-boutique/) and [Law360](http://www.law360.com/articles/838932).

UPDATE (2:45 p.m.): And here’s the story of [Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/09/12/kirkland-acquires-dc-based-boutique-bancroft/?cn=20160912&pt=Newswire&src=EMC-Email&et=editorial&bu=Law.com).

UPDATE (2:55 p.m.): We’re getting positive reactions from our sources at Bancroft, who it seems will all benefit economically from this deal. The senior partners will be paid handsomely, as noted above; the junior partners will have enhanced equity opportunities (making share partner at K&E isn’t easy, but Bancroft has just a handful of equity partners); and Bancroft associates will be paid on the Kirkland pay scale (market salaries and handsome bonuses). Folks are also excited about the synergies between Bancroft’s top-flight appellate and Supreme Court practice and Kirkland’s strong trial practice. We understand that Bancroft support staffers are being invited to join K&E as well.

We hear that the deal came together very quickly, in a matter of weeks. A key player was federal judge turned Kirkland partner [Mark Filip](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=9711), who sits on Kirkland’s Global Management Executive Committee. Filip is quoted in the press release: “I’ve known Paul and Viet for over 25 years, and it’s no surprise how successful and respected they are. We welcome them and their talented team to Kirkland.”

How does Filip know Clement and Dinh? They all overlapped at Harvard Law School — Filip and Clement graduated in 1992, Dinh in 1993 — and Filip and Clement [clerked together for the late Justice Scalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_law_clerks_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States) (October Term 1993). So law students and young lawyers, be nice to your law school classmates and your co-clerks; you never know when those relationships will come in handy.

UPDATE (3:32 p.m.): The response from in-house counsel — i.e., clients — is positive as well. “Quite a snag for Kirkland,” said [Paul Cappuccio](http://www.timewarner.com/company/management/senior-corporate-executives/paul-t-cappuccio), executive vice president and general counsel of Time Warner (and a former K&E partner himself). “Paul is the best. And Kirkland already has [Chris Landau](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=8991), who is also a great appellate advocate, so this is quite a combined team.”

UPDATE (5:05 p.m.): Another noteworthy point: this isn’t just Paul Clement’s return to Biglaw, but to Kirkland & Ellis specifically (where he overlapped with Paul Cappuccio). Clement was [an associate at K&E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Clement) after his SCOTUS clerkship and before he went over to the Senate Judiciary Committee.

UPDATE (6:15 p.m.): Chiming in from the West Coast, former Facebook general counsel and former K&E partner Ted Ullyot, now a [partner at Andreessen Horowitz](https://a16z.com/author/ted-ullyot/), had this to say: “Great move for both Kirkland and Bancroft. Two world-class organizations joining forces.”

UPDATE (9/13/2016, 5:00 p.m.): For more on this news, see my interview with Viet Dinh: [A Closer Look At Kirkland & Ellis’s Pickup Of The Bancroft Lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/a-closer-look-at-kirkland-elliss-pickup-of-the-bancroft-lawyers/).

“Honda: Crashworthiness Jury Instructions Fail in Wake of ‘Tincher.'” Max Mitchell of [The Legal Intelligencer](http://www.thelegalintelligencer.com) has [this report](https://t.co/sHAsMmAQjH) on the case I argued yesterday on behalf of the plaintiffs-appellees before a three-judge panel of the [Pa. Superior Court](http://www.pacourts.us/courts/superior-court/).

You can access online [Honda’s Brief for Appellant](https://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/HondaAppellantBriefFiled.pdf), the [Brief for Plaintiffs-Appellees](https://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/MartinezAppelleesBriefFiled.pdf), [Honda’s Reply Brief for Appellant](https://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/HondaAppellantReplyBrief.pdf), an [amicus brief filed in support of Honda](https://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/PLACAmicusCuriaeBrief.pdf), and an [amicus brief filed in support of plaintiffs-appellees](https://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/PAJAmicusCuriaeBrief.pdf).

As The Legal Intelligencer’s article explains, earlier this year a unanimous three-judge Pa. Superior Court panel issued [an unpublished opinion](http://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Superior/out/J-A31020-15m.pdf) in Cancelleri v. Ford Motor Co. that rejected many of the very same arguments that Honda is making in its current appeal. As [previously noted here](http://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/010716.html#065089), I also served as appellate counsel for the plaintiffs-appellees in Cancelleri.

Pa. Superior Court Judge [Anne E. Lazaru](http://www.pacourts.us/courts/superior-court/superior-court-judges/judge-anne-e-lazarus)s, in her opinion for the unanimous panel in Cancelleri, [explained](http://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Superior/out/J-A31020-15m.pdf#page=6) that “in crashworthiness cases, the jury is required to determine whether the vehicle was defective in design as well as whether an alternative, safer, and practicable design existed at the time of design that could have been used instead,” thereby complying with the [Pa. Supreme Court](http://www.pacourts.us/courts/supreme-court/)‘s [decision](http://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/j-80-2013mo%20-%201020173292832303.pdf) in Tincher v. Omega Flex, Inc., which issued after jury verdicts in favor of the plaintiffs had issued in both Cancelleri and Martinez.

The Pa. Superior Court’s opinion in Cancelleri also [held](http://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Superior/out/J-A31020-15m.pdf#page=6) that Tincher did not mandate the admission of industry or governmental standards evidence at the defendant’s behest. In June 2016, in [an unpublished opinion](http://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Superior/out/J-A33020-15m%20-%201027095997772776.pdf) issued in Webb v. Volvo Cars, a separate three-judge Pa. Superior Court panel reached the same result, [holding](http://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Superior/out/J-A33020-15m%20-%201027095997772776.pdf#page=16) (in an opinion for the panel written by Pa. Superior Court Judge [Victor P. Stabile](http://www.pacourts.us/courts/superior-court/superior-court-judges/judge-victor-p-stabile)) that Tincher did not mandate the admission of industry or governmental standards evidence.

Perhaps also worth noting, earlier this year the trial court in Tincher itself [denied defendant Omega Flex’s renewed motion for post-trial relief](https://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/TincherTrialCtOpinionOnRemand.PDF) on remand from the Pa. Supreme Court, holding that the the Pa. Supreme Court’s ruling did not require a retrial of the case.

# Dershowitz's Motion To Disqualify Boies Schiller Immediately Dumped For Hilarious Reason
## Swing and a miss.

Oops.

Well, that was fast. No sooner did [Alan Dershowitz move to get Boies Schiller removed](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/harvard-law-schools-dershowitz-moves-to-disqualify-boies-schiller-in-sex-trafficking-case/) from the Virginia Guiffre case than the motion dies a fiery — if potentially temporary — death at the stroke of Judge Loretta Preska’s pen.

Apparently, no one on the Harvard Law professor’s side of the table thought to check [Judge Preska’s individual rules](https://freethecourt.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/loretta-a-preska.pdf) (a phenomenon that [seems to be going around](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/plaintiffs-throw-shade-at-jones-day-in-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/?rf=1)), which are quite clear that:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
(a) “For motions other than discovery motions, a pre-motion conference with the court is required before making any motion” and
(b) “Unless prior permission has been granted, memoranda of law in support of and in opposition to motions are limited to 20 pages”

Dershowitz’s filing failed on… both of these counts. Cue the sad trombone.

Undeterred, his attorneys are now asking belatedly for a pre-motion conference to rehash the complaints that Boies Schiller attorneys will be fact witnesses in the case because Dershowitz intends to claim that they’re trying to extort him by representing the plaintiff. Or something like that.

If I were Dershowitz though, I’d be concerned that Judge Preska will allow the motion to go forward without staying the deadline for him to answer or move to dismiss. That’s a deadline that should be coming up and one that he was apparently trying to avoid by bringing this disqualification motion.

# This Biglaw Firm May Demote Partners To Boost Profits
## Which firm is considering shearing the ranks of its equity partners?

Unproductive partners can be a real drain on a Biglaw firm’s profits, and one firm is reportedly searching for a way to take care of its problem in this area. Which firm is considering shearing the ranks of its equity partners?

That would be Shearman & Sterling.

As learned by [Legal Week](http://www.legalweek.com/sites/legalweek/2016/09/20/shearman-sterling-partners-face-profit-share-cut/?slreturn=20160821102329) and confirmed by the [Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202767897489/Shearman-amp-Sterling-Partners-Face-Possible-Demotions?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL), the firm may soon demote some of its equity partners in order to boost its profitability. Shearman global and regional managing partners will likely meet today in New York to discuss the terms of the de-equitizations. It is expected that partners in “less profitable practice areas and regions” will be hit the hardest.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
This is how partners at the firm feel about the situation, according to [Legal Week](http://www.legalweek.com/sites/legalweek/2016/09/20/shearman-sterling-partners-face-profit-share-cut/?slreturn=20160821102329):

“There is a desire within the partnership to make sure that every equity partner is in fact putting in the time and effort and driving the business,” said a current Shearman partner, who requested anonymity in order to speak freely about firm matters.

Another partner said: “It wouldn’t surprise me if Asia or the US were affected by any changes. I don’t think it’s any secret that most firms struggle to make money in Asia unless their partners are on some sort of salaried structure. It’s no secret the firm has struggled with underperforming partners and areas. There are real challenges at the firm.”

Although the firm may be desperate to sack its unproductive partners, Shearman’s partnership agreement requires that a supermajority of 75 percent of equity partners approve a partner’s removal — which is a “major problem for the firm,” per one anonymous partner. If the firm is unable to forcibly remove a partner from equity status, they either can be de-equitized by consent (which we imagine is a rarity), or have their compensation cut by as much as 25 percent annually (yikes!).

Although the firm saw profits per partner fall by 4 percent in 2015, it adopted [Cravath’s new salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-firm-throws-roving-party-to-announce-pay-raises/) in June. Thus far, demand for legal services in 2016 has been flat, per anonymous firm sources. That being said, it won’t be terribly surprising if Shearman & Sterling culls its herd of equity partners in January. Best of luck, partners.

Proskauer Rose will be paying associates according to the following grid:

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg

Now it’s time for us to move to New Zealand.

— Justice [Ruth Bader Ginsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg), recounting something her late husband, tax law scholar [Martin Ginsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_D._Ginsburg), would have said if he’d have been alive to see the day when [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) could [potentially be elected as president](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/11/us/politics/ruth-bader-ginsburg-no-fan-of-donald-trump-critiques-latest-term.html). Justice Ginsburg went on to state: “I can’t imagine what this place would be — I can’t imagine what the country would be — with Donald Trump as our president. For the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be — I don’t even want to contemplate that.” This is the second time that Justice Ginsburg has made [negative public remarks](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/with-the-future-of-scotus-in-mind-justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-shudders-at-the-thought-of-a-trump-presidency/) about the possibility of Trump’s election as president.

President Donald Trump?

In response to Justice Ginsburg’s rather inflammatory comments, Trump said the following in a telephone interview earlier today with the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/13/us/politics/ruth-bader-ginsburg-donald-trump.html): “I think it’s highly inappropriate that a United States Supreme Court judge gets involved in a political campaign, frankly. I think it’s a disgrace to the court and I think she should apologize to the court. I couldn’t believe it when I saw it. That she should be saying that? It’s so beneath the court for her to be making statements like that. It only energizes my base even more. And I would hope that she would get off the court as soon as possible.”

# Adversaries Can Make Great References
## Coworkers and friends? Of course they're going to say positive things about you. But getting an adversary to give you a positive reference? That can be a real feather in your cap.

When people apply for different jobs, or pursue various opportunities within the legal profession, they are generally asked to provide a few references so that potential employers can evaluate the background of a candidate. Most of the time, applicants list coworkers or former bosses who might be able to speak about what it was like to work with the candidate and whether the candidate produced solid work. However, in some instances, it might make sense for applicants to list adversaries in prior legal matters as references since they have a unique perspective on the abilities of a job candidate.

Earlier in my career, I worked with an adversary on an extremely contentious legal matter. The litigation was heated, and numerous motions, discovery demands, and other efforts were expended. I was extremely impressed with my adversary’s work and his ability to prepare documents in a relatively brief time. This adversary forced me to respond at the top of my game and taught me a few things about practicing in a jurisdiction in which I had less experience.

This adversary and I remained on good terms both throughout and after the litigation. I try to maintain solid relationships with adversaries since the legal community is small, and you never know when you might see someone again. Also, the legal profession is difficult enough without people making it harder with bad blood. In any case, after our matter resolved, I heard from my adversary out of the blue one day, asking to use me as a reference for various opportunities he had in the legal profession.

I immediately agreed, and I think I would be a great person for a future employer to speak with about this person’s work product. I have no reason to tell anything other than the truth that this attorney was excellent and kept me on my toes throughout the matter we were both handled. Moreover, a prospective employer can expect that I, as an adversary, would not simply provide nice words that I might convey for a coworker or a friend.

Beyond job opportunities, using adversaries as references can be helpful in other areas of the legal profession. A jurisdiction in which I practice has a coveted certification which comes with a number of benefits. A while back, I perused the application that candidates must submit to be considered for this certification. I was interested to see that the application also asked for adversaries with whom the applicant worked on various legal matters.

Perhaps the folks evaluating people’s credentials know that adversaries might provide the most honest and detailed assessment of someone’s skill such that they should be spoken to when determining if a candidate is worthy of a given credential within the legal profession. It is also possible that those evaluating candidates know that it is easy for applicants to find friends and coworkers who will say nice things about them, but it is far more difficult for an applicant to find adversaries who will reflect positively on their work.

All told, people should be nice to their adversaries, not only because it is the right thing to do in the legal profession, but because adversaries might be called on to comment about the skill and experience of a given practitioner within the legal profession. In a number of situations, adversaries have a unique perspective on a legal practitioner’s skill as well as their character when it comes to practicing law, which may be helpful when being considered for various opportunities.

# How GCs Can Build A Data-Driven Division To Bolster Their Company
## No transformation happens without a careful appraisal of what you have and where you want to go.

Corporate legal departments have traditionally kept their focus on supplying legal expertise to the businesses they support; in-house specialists in litigation, employment, privacy, IP, and HR are common. But in today’s digital and virtual world, it has become equally necessary for legal to address the vast amounts of data in their custody and control. After all, data and technology aren’t just redefining operating budgets — they’re reshaping risk models, security, compliance, and other legal issues that affect a company’s bottom line.

To bring legal divisions up to speed on the data front, general counsels and other legal department leaders might need to perform some magic — implementing a digital transformation to assess, manage, advise, report on, and defend the company’s data position while bringing the department and the business’ strategic technology plans in line with today’s rapidly evolving global business environment. It might not be simple, but it will be effective.

Building up your legal department to make it more data-driven requires four steps:

- Assess your data preparedness and fine-tune your department’s goals.
- Streamline its operations and enhance efficiency.
- Inventory and analyze all data and create data maps to guide the organization through legal matters.
- Build specialized, multidisciplinary in-house data-resource teams to address emerging technology concerns effectively.
Appraise And Analyze

No transformation happens without a careful appraisal of what you have and where you want to go. Mindful of the need to keep evolving, a savvy GC will first assess their department’s level of data preparedness. What have been the standard data-handling practices? What were the most pressing problems, strengths, and risks? Does the department understand the company’s strategic technology plan going forward? Where does the business want to go? How can the department exceed basic legal standards and embrace more rigorous ethical standards to retain public trust in its care of consumer data?

It’s important to weigh each of these questions along with the proliferation of data, escalation of cybersecurity risks, and increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in businesses: All pose challenges for the legal department, which is also tasked with designing legal safeguards to protect sensitive client information and maintain regulatory compliance. Integrating these imperatives with everyday organizational complexities — operating technology, business strategy, personnel management, marketing, accounting, audits — can seem overwhelming. This reason is why the assessment is so critical. Once the assessment is complete, GCs can use all the information collected to form the foundation of the legal department’s digital transformation.

Enhance Efficiency

Armed with a deeper understanding of how the department deals with data and where processes and personnel can be strengthened, GCs should determine concrete steps to elevate efficiency.

Using legal software solutions is one way to help free up staff time. Good technology automates repetitive tasks so your team can more quickly find needed data; it makes labor-intensive processes such as managing contracts much more efficient. Deploying these solutions also allows your organization to aggregate and analyze far more data with greater accuracy and speed than you could before, and make more informed decisions based on that data.

Encouraging legal staff to enroll in professional development and even “apprenticeship” programs in technology and data literacy will also help GCs build a more knowledgeable department and foster a greater understanding of the importance of technology integration and departmental collaboration. If you offer team members training in cybersecurity best practices, data analysis, and legal technology tools, you incorporate new skillsets into the department while also creating more understanding between legal professionals, data scientists, and IT experts — which allows for a more-informed team that can solve problems in new and innovative ways.

Map Your Route To Success

To manage data-related legal and business risks effectively, an up-to-date data map is critical. Legal needs to fully understand the organization’s data landscape so it can identify potential risks and manage data governance using the correct resources for requests, investigations, or litigation. That data map will also help the department ensure compliance; put security measures in place; and design policies to use, store, and protect data. Not only will a data map boost the company’s data transparency, the map will also help legal more efficiently monitor the organization’s data assets.

As GC, you’ll need to inventory all your company’s data: who manages it and how; who has access; what the security protocols are; how unstructured data (data in transit or that’s constantly updated) is quantified; and how personally identifiable information (PII) is stored, shared, and retained. Mapping it out and giving a clear, visual guide to all the organization’s data allows the entire legal department to make the most informed decisions, work more effectively with experts from other departments — and better help the GC protect the company.

Without a map, it’s simply difficult for a legal department to adequately address or respond to legal issues. In effect, it leaves the team with large blind spots that can be devastating to the organization.

Keep It Ethical

The use and misuse of big data analytics, AI, and now generative AI (GenAI) in [legal settings](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2023/05/29/lawyers-getting-tripped-up-by-generative-ai-such-as-chatgpt-but-who-really-is-to-blame-asks-ai-ethics-and-ai-law/?sh=4555bbc53212) has already shown us the importance of ethics in data management. Organizations must be rigorous in developing policies and processes for using these evolving technologies to protect their business operations and reputation. Companies must establish guidelines for employees’ best-practice uses of these technologies and identify appropriate subject matter experts within the company to vet their outcomes. GCs should also ensure that each designated SME understands the potential legal ramifications of any information produced by GenAI, for example, and run the final product through compliance.

To further mitigate risks, the legal team needs to be agile and respond quickly to the dynamic public sentiment that often changes faster than the law. GCs should advocate not just for legal compliance, but sound data practices that resonate with the public at large. By building a legal team with specialized data training — including staff from diverse fields and getting support from other departments — a GC should be able to address the evolving data challenges while also fostering a culture of data ethics within the organization.

As the guardians of regulatory compliance, risk management, and ethical business practices, legal departments have a significant role in shaping their organizations’ data management. By adapting to the evolving digital environment, GCs and their legal departments can champion the strategic use of data, mitigate risks, and promote ethical conduct, reaffirming their value in the eyes of their organizations and society and providing invaluable guidance and leadership in an increasingly digital world.

# Now Live At The Non-Event: Win New Business With A CRM Upgrade! 
## Most lawyers fail to effectively track their leads. But doing so is an easy way to grow a firm’s bottom line. So what gives?

[](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/the-legal-tech-non-event/crm-for-law-firms/)If you’re here reading about legal tech upgrades, congratulations! Your firm is probably running a sustainable operation. 

But do you know how much business you’re missing out on, both from potential clients and from those you already have? 

If you’re like most attorneys, the answer is “no.” That’s because most attorneys pay very little attention to managing leads. 

But law firms that effectively track and follow up with current and potential clients will effectively close more business. 

So what gives? 

The fact is that most lawyers don’t understand how CRM software works. 

Luckily, the Non-Event is here to help. [Visit the latest edition](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/?page_id=20435&preview=true) to quickly get up to speed on how CRM for law firms can grow your business. 

The Premier Spot for Tech-Perplexed Lawyers

For most lawyers, the prospect of a tech conference triggers thoughts of boredom and missed billables. And as a group, attorneys’ tech adoption is often begrudging, at best.

That’s why we’ve launched the ATL Non-Event.

We’re bringing the technology conversation to lawyers directly: in plain English and geared to meet a fully booked schedule.

The Non-Event is conducted in partnership with our affiliate Evolve the Law, as well as Legal Tech Publishing, whose buyers guides are the go-to resource for all purchasers of legal tech.

This month, you’ll hear from:

- Answering Legal
- Filevine
- Lawmatics
- Moxtra
Swag bags, unfortunately, are still a work in progress.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs.

# Elite Firm Will Require Vaccination, But Other Reopening Policies Are Very Flexible
## This is one of the few firms that will require COVID-19 vaccinations for all employees.

One by one, Biglaw firms have announced plans to return to the office, but not many have announced that all associates must be vaccinated. The majority of firms have strongly encouraged vaccination, but firms that are outright mandating vaccination seem to be few and far between. Today, we have news on a firm that’s not only requiring vaccination, but also has a relatively flexible remote work policy as well.

This past Friday, Clifford Chance announced an agile working policy for its American offices, with a return to office-based working to start on September 13. That plan involves up to two remote days each week for both attorneys and business professionals (and time spent with clients outside the office will be considered time in the office). Once or twice a month, all employees will be expected to be in the office on specific days for specific events. The firm’s plan is relatively simple so that employees can “reap the benefits without heavy bureaucracy.” That’s a nice change of pace from what we’ve seen at most firms.

Next comes the firm’s vaccination policy, which is also short and sweet: get vaccinated by September 13 and get ready to provide proof. Similar rules will soon be implemented for clients and non-employees who expect to enter the firm’s U.S. offices.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Sources we’ve heard from at the firm say they’re pleased with the firm’s “very flexible and reasonable” new policies and really “appreciate” the firm’s stance on vaccination against COVID-19.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

Most large law firms publish law blogs by traditional practice groups. There are over 130 employment-law blogs being published by Am Law 200 firms, alone.

The [2017 Report on the State of the Legal Market](http://thomsonreuters.com/en/press-releases/2017/january/2017-report-on-the-state-of-the-legal-market.html) from Georgetown Law and Thomson Reuters Legal Executive Institute, widely labeled as the “Georgetown Report,” signals that publishing blogs focused on general practice areas is misguided.

Niche-focused publications demonstrating subject matter expertise are key.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Why? The erosion of the traditional law firm franchise over the last ten years. Clients are disaggregating work and allocating work to different law firms based on subject matter expertise established, in part, through niche blog publishing.

From the Georgetown Report:

One significant result of this disaggregated approach is that the client’s relationship with its outside counsel may – and often does – shift from a traditional client/trusted advisor relationship to more of an ad hoc, transactional relationship. In the latter model, the outside lawyer becomes less of a counselor with respect to the overall matter and more of a provider of specialized services that the client is unable to provide internally or acquire more effectively elsewhere.

[Fox Rothschild](http://www.foxrothschild.com), which publishes thirty-seven law blogs, is one law firm that recognizes the disaggregation concept in its approach to blogging.

[Mark L. Silow](http://www.foxrothschild.com/mark-l-silow/), firmwide managing partner for Fox Rothschild, recently [told Bloomberg Law](https://bol.bna.com/blogs-generate-business-says-fox-rothschild-mp/) that he’s amazed both by the amount of traffic that the firm’s blogs attract and by the amount of business that they generate. According to Silow, a niche focus is key:

The thing that we encourage, and actually insist on in our bloggers is that they be very focused, that they be very specific. We would never approve of someone who says I am going to write a litigation blog. It has to be much narrower, much more focused.

Why does Silow insist on niche blog publications?

Clients are hiring experts. They are not hiring law firms, they are not hiring generic lawyers, they are hiring experts.

If you can blog today on a decision that came out this morning involving a really specific technical aspect of the law, you have now portrayed yourself as a current expert.

Silow’s thinking closing parallels the findings of the Georgetown Report:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The buzz word is disaggregation, where clients, especially the larger and more sophisticated clients, are no longer saying “Fox Rothschild is my law firm, whatever legal issues I have pick up the phone and call Fox Rothschild.” They have now have litigation counsel for this, they have litigation counsel for that kind of issue. They have tax counsel, real estate counsel, securities counsel, and all kinds of counsel.”

Those who can project and have the real specific expertise are getting more and more work.

There’s little doubt Fox Rothschild is outperforming the majority of large law firms on the blog front. The reason is a proactive and strategic focus. Rather than the tired and old marketing and business development by practice groups with a large number of lawyer bloggers, Fox Rothschild looks to opportunities for growth.

Fox Rothschild’s [blogs](http://www.foxrothschild.com/our-blogs/) can have as many as six or eight bloggers, but a good number have two to three bloggers, with some as few as one. The firm is tapping into the interests and passions of its lawyers in order to establish firm niche expertise.

Fox Rothschild’s business success is in line with the findings of the Georgetown Report:

There are, of course, many reasons that some law firms outperform others – including historic location, practices, and client base – but there are two characteristics that seem to have emerged over the past several years as particularly important in marking firms as likely winners: strategic focus and proactive response to the needs and expectations of clients.

Though there are exceptions, general practice oriented blogs struggle, especially to start. The blogs do not become must-have publications for clients, including in-house counsel. The blogs do not get shared on social media. The blogs do not get cited by reporters, bloggers, or the courts.

As a result, the lawyers’ interest in blogging wanes, and the blog shows it. The firm has wasted an opportunity (and often hundreds of thousands of dollars in collective lawyer time).

Legal blogs present an opportunity for lawyers and law firms to make a name for themselves as subject matter experts. But follow the wisdom of the Georgetown Report and Fox Rothschild. Go niche law blogs.

# Partners Shouldn't Invite Associates To Oral Arguments In Order To Boost Their Egos
## Sometimes, the associates don't learn much about lawyering, aren't billing, and will have a hard time making up for lost time.

Law firm associates usually need to complete many boring legal tasks that partners do not want to handle themselves in the course of their jobs. This usually includes document review, cite checking, legal research, and other projects. Every now and then, an associate might be invited to leave the office and either complete or shadow a legal task that is usually handled by a partner, like attending oral arguments. In certain instances, this can definitely be helpful to the development of an associate, but in other situations, associates do not really gain anything from these experiences.

I am convinced that sometimes when partners invite associates to attend oral arguments, it is not so that an associate can learn about the legal process but because the partner wants an audience for their work. People naturally want others to share in their experiences, especially experiences in which someone is performing and others are spectating and admiring. When I argued my first appeal, it was much better knowing that my brother traveled to the courthouse to watch me submit arguments to the court. However, satisfying the ego of a partner is not a good reason to invite an associate to attend oral argument.

One time, at the beginning of my career, I was invited to attend oral argument by a partner. The oral argument was 50 miles or so away from our office, and since I did not have a car, I would have to take the trains to get there. I would very likely need to spend much more time traveling to the oral argument than actually sitting in court watching the partner present arguments to the court. I politely declined the invitation to attend the oral argument and said that I had too much work to complete in the office. The partner seemed wounded that I declined the invitation, and I wondered if I had made the right decision in avoiding the oral argument.

Another associate who took the partner’s invitation to attend oral argument told me that it was a complete waste of time. She conveyed that she had to navigate the public transit system to arrive at oral argument, and that it had taken her well over an hour each way to arrive at the oral argument and to return to the office afterward. My colleague also conveyed that the partner’s oral argument lasted about five to 10 minutes, and the partner did not really say much. Since the associate was so new at the firm, she did not want to ask for a return ride to the office, so she had to spend a ton of time making her way back. This person told me that the experience was a complete waste for the firm, since the associate did not learn much about lawyering and the associate had not billed anything for much of the day and would have a hard time making up for lost time when she returned to the office.

Another time, I was working on a team of a dozen or so attorneys who all worked on a single appellate brief. The partner who was going to argue the brief invited everyone who was involved in drafting the brief to oral argument so they could see the points they researched being argued firsthand. This was a very interesting experience. It was clear that the partner from the opposing side invited a bunch of associates who worked on their brief to oral argument as well.

As a result, it was really uncomfortable to be in the audience, since our team kept making snide comments about the other side’s points and the associates for the other side kept making snide comments about our points. Moreover, it was clear that we were not going to win that oral argument. The partner in charge did not have such a good mastery of the facts involved in the case, likely since he wanted the honor of arguing the matter himself rather than letting senior associates or junior partners present arguments even though these more junior attorneys had a much more critical role in crafting our arguments.

All of the associates made our way back to the office after the oral argument in a daze knowing that all of our hard work was likely not going to pay off. That very same day, the appellate court issued an order denying our appeal. After work that night, a bunch of the associates hit the bars to drown out the sadness of losing so hard. The only good thing that came of me watching oral arguments that day is learning that a firm should not just let the most senior person present oral arguments but should rather let the attorney most knowledgeable about the matter make points before a court.

All told, taking associates to various legal functions outside of an office can be a good learning experience. However, since associates might not be able to complete work tasks during this time, such excursions should not just serve as an ego boost for partners. and some effort should be made to ensure associates learn something from these experiences.

When attorneys hear the adage, “Don’t work harder, work smarter,” they may grumble over its trite admonition, but every once in a while some technology comes along that can help busy people make these words real.

With Philips SpeechLive, a dictation and speech-to-text application with mobile capability, attorneys can save time by getting a jump on their document preparation.

Mobility

Suppose you are at a hearing, a mediation or client meeting. Afterward, you may want to write a letter, organize your notes, or produce a memorandum about some points of law. You have another meeting in twenty minutes, but given that every bit of your time is valuable, you don’t want to waste it.

[SpeechLive](https://www.speechlive.com/us/) can help. You can open the app on your smartphone and dictate a letter or memo. As soon as you tap “finish,” that dictation is automatically shuttled to a cloud-hosted application, then into a work queue that assigned assistants, typists, and transcriptionists can access simply by logging in, whether they are in the office or working at home. The mobile application and the desktop application are synced. They work together seamlessly.

[](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2022/03/pcl1000_philips-speechlive_laptop-with-sr-recorder-and-app.png)While you are in your next meeting, your assistant can be hard at work turning your document into a professional looking letter or memorandum.

One notable thing about the SpeechLive app is ease of use. Above the Law tested both the mobile and desktop apps and found the interfaces clean and simple. As a result, it takes hardly any time to learn your way around. The app is blessedly free from the clutter of functions you’ll never use.

“We do hear back from our users that it is very intuitive,” said Caroline Cantelon, account manager in business development for SpeechLive.

Once you’ve completed your dictation and before you tap “finish” to enter it into the work queue, you can tap the “I” for information icon at the bottom of the mobile app to enter the proper metadata—title, type of document, and level of priority. You can add anything you like in the comments section, including a case file number, and you can select upon sending which typist or team should be assigned the dictation.

As soon as you tap “finish,” that dictation will show up on the Workflow screen of SpeechLive [see Figure 1].

[](https://f.hubspotusercontent30.net/hubfs/470182/Speech%20Processing%20Content%20Syndication%202022/Speech%20Product%20Review%20Images/Figure%201.png)
Figure 1

The author is listed, the person to whom it is assigned will be notified, and work can commence even if the author is 1,500 hundred miles away at a hearing. No email required. You never have to exit the SpeechLive app to put the work in the queue and direct it to the correct person with all the instructions they need to produce a professional document and enter it properly into your firm’s case management system.

As you can see in Figure 1, the status of a given document is displayed for everyone to see. The categories are listed on the left side of the screen. “Pending” indicates that the work has not yet commenced. Suspended means the work is in progress, but the assigned person might be seeking clarification or had to put the document on hold for some other reason. 

No more having to call your assistant and ask, “How’s that letter coming along?” This makes for happy employees and frees busy attorneys from annoying check-ins. You can choose to filter the Workflow using any one of the categories to give you a nice snapshot of productivity.

Speech-to-Text

Want to help your assistants and transcriptionists pump out those documents with even greater efficiency? Use the speech-to-text function of [SpeechLive](https://www.speechlive.com/us/), either through your desktop computer or on the go with a smartphone. As you dictate into the app, the text appears. You can format in a basic way using a list of commands accessed by tapping an icon at the bottom—commands along the lines of, “Period. New paragraph.”

[](https://f.hubspotusercontent30.net/hubfs/470182/Speech%20Processing%20Content%20Syndication%202022/Speech%20Product%20Review%20Images/sst_desktop_gif.gif)Once you’ve completed your dictation using speech-to-text, you can edit your text however you choose, enter your metadata, and then hit “finish” to place it in the work queue and mark it as a priority document if needed.

If you don’t want to bother with converting your dictation to text as you go, you have the option to simply create an audio file and send it to speech-to-text after you’ve dictated the whole thing. In both cases, the file is synced and routed automatically to the SpeechLive Workflow when the person creating the file taps “finish.”

The staff member to whom you assign your dictation is notified as soon as the speech-to-text file enters the Workflow, at which point they can download it as a Word document.

“They can then pretty it up,” explained Cantelon. “They can format it. They can copy and paste it into letterhead, a contract template, or save it right into the claims or document management system. Whatever they want to do with it.” 

Whether you choose to use speech-to-text from the outset or after the diciation, the audio file is sent as an attachment to the text file. Support staff can listen to the original voice file and edit as required. Pairing the original audio file with the text file is an easy way to reduce mistakes. Although, during testing with a smartphone, Above the Law dictated some straightforward correspondence and observed that the speech-to-text function made few mistakes. Cantelon noted that for best results, speech-to-text users need to speak slowly and enunciate clearly.

Flexibility

Another salient feature of SpeechLive is its flexibility, especially for large firms with a high volume of work and copious amounts of support personnel.

Everything is managed through the browser-based app and anyone who is given administrator status can control who has access to the Workflow. When you’ve created your dictation, it’s easy,  upon sending, to assign files in the work queue to specific typists or assistants. You can determine who receives what piece of work and assign typists to different teams and pools, giving each matter or case its own manageable list of documents. This is better than having the thousands of items normally generated by a sizable law firm show up in the queue as one intimidating, confusing monster list.

As well as dividing the work queue by case or matter, you can direct work to an overflow pool or an after-hours pool (or any other team you wish to create). Confidential documents can be split off into a special queue that goes only to certain typists or transcriptionists.

 If you happen to have attorneys who are attached to their recording devices, it’s possible to upload files from these recorders using the SpeechLive desktop app and assign them just like all the other audio files.

This same desktop app has an add-on that allows an attorney to utilize the SpeechLive speech-to-text capability. This “floating app,” as Cantelon described it, is accessed by clicking on a microphone icon. It enables you to use the SpeechLive speech-to-text function with any application you want. Simply open the floating app, which appears as a small box, then place your cursor in the application you want to use—for example, your email or Word—and dictate away. SpeechLive will convert your words to text. For best results, Philips recommends you use their SpeechMike Premium dictation microphone or a SpeechOne headset.

[](https://f.hubspotusercontent30.net/hubfs/470182/Speech%20Processing%20Content%20Syndication%202022/psm6000_philips-speechone_aps_rgb-1.png)The floating box can be minimized and accessed with a single click whenever it is needed. In addition to Word and email, you can use it in search engines, spreadsheets, databases, and your case and matter management software—really any application you use on your desktop.

Management and Assessment

Aside from helping individual attorneys work smartly and efficiently,  Cantelon explained that [SpeechLive](https://www.speechlive.com/us/) can help management measure productivity.

“You have the ability to run reports,” she noted. These reports can show who dictated a certain file, how long it is, who transcribed it and when, which is valuable for firm operations and assessment.

Cantelon said managers can decide how long finished dictations sit on the active work list before they’re moved to an archive. They can decide at the account level who can see the archive, and choose the time after which an archive will be permanently purged.

“All of this, as far as workflow and management, is done through the browser,” she added.

Security

Last but far from least, there is security, that perennial concern of attorneys given they are professionally obligated to safeguard the confidentiality of their clients’ documents and communications. 

SpeechLive dictations are always sent via encrypted HTTPS channels. They are temporarily stored on secure servers and deleted after transcription. Dictations created by the SpeechLive Smartphone app are stored in an encrypted form on the phone. All encryptions use AES 256-bit, the industry standard.

As for access to SpeechLive, every Workflow user must choose their own password, which can be reset anytime. Dictations can only be viewed by those with a username and password. Administrators can also set the app to require multi-factor authentication. Users would then have to enter a six-digit PIN received via email to verify their identity, in addition to furnishing the username and password.

The multifactor-authentication service is provided by Microsoft. SpeechLive is hosted on Microsoft Azure secure servers, one of the world’s leading platforms for cloud-hosted solutions, according to materials provided by Speech Processing Solutions.

To maintain its security standards and processes, Microsoft Azure continuously performs penetration testing and works on threat detection and prevention in areas like unauthorized intrusion and denial of service. Microsoft pledges a 99.9 percent “uptime guarantee” at all hours of every day. The company also has a “lights-out policy,” meaning it has put various measures in place to protect operations from power failures, physical intrusion, and network outages.

For U.S. clients, “the servers are in the U.S.,” Cantelon noted, “meaning there’s no worries about data residency. Nothing leaves U.S. soil, including the speech-recognition engine. Everything is tightly secured, not only with our application, but with Microsoft Azure.” SpeechLive uses several data centers based on client location, including facilities in Canada, Europe, and Australia.

The Wrap

[SpeechLive’s](https://www.speechlive.com/us/) mobile speech-to-text capability and intuitive interface are likely to save busy people valuable time. Management may appreciate the solution’s flexibility, not only in terms of usage, but also the way it allows for easy monitoring of workflow and dictation and document management. Perhaps most important, SpeechLive’s security measures are likely to satisfy even famously risk-averse attorneys.

# The Salary Cut Roll Backs Continue: Another Billion-Dollar Biglaw Firm Reverses Course

We love a salary trend here at Above the Law! And when the news is good, so much the better. After salary cuts became the new norm in the springtime of COVID, now that summer’s here and autumn is around the corner, quite a few firms have decided that those cuts aren’t needed anymore, or at least they no longer need to be as severe as the initial haircut.

[Back in May,](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/holland-knight-cuts/) Managing Partner Steven Sonberg of Holland & Knight announced staff furloughs and salary cuts for partners, associates, and staff. Cuts to partner draws averaged 25 percent at the firm, on a progressive scale. Associates, counsel, and senior professionals saw compensation cut by 17.5 percent. Staff making $75,000-$150,000 had a 10 percent pay cut and staff making $150,000+ got a 15 percent reduction.

But now, as[ reported by](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/holland-knight-reduces-covid-19-pay-cuts-for-associates-staff) Bloomberg Law, Holland & Knight has walked back at least some of the cuts for all employees:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
However, the firm said that it had restored 30% to 50% of the original 17.5%, 15% or 10% cuts at the end of June, with all associates receiving a 30% restoration of their salaries. The firm is currently evaluating a further restoration, a spokesperson said.

Let’s hope it’s only a matter of time before full salaries are restored.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries or restoring previous cuts, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# 'Beer At Law' Tells All
## Just by hearing BAL talk about his work it’s clear that he enjoys what he’s doing.

One of my favorite parts about being on social media is how people connect with people they never expected to meet. That was the case when I ran into an Instagram meme account called [Beer At Law](https://www.instagram.com/beeratlaw/) (BAL). Most of the lawyers I meet on social media are relatively junior or have gone on to pursue alternative careers.

But BAL is different. Because he’s actually a successful equity partner in Biglaw. So I thought I’d take the chance to ask him some questions I’ve always wondered about what life is like on the other side. That conversation (over beers, of course) made me think: Hey, this would be a pretty cool article for Above the Law.

I’ve read a lot of articles from partners giving advice to associates. They often contain platitudes. No one actually tells it like it is. BAL, on the other hand, had all this great insight, and was willing to speak with me candidly (anonymously) about what it’s like being a partner, how to actually generate business, and common mistakes made by associates.

So without further ado, here are four of the key takeaways from the interview:

Being Known For A Specialty Will Help You Generate Business

“The era of the service partner is over,” BAL said. You can’t just grind out hours and expect to be promoted to the partnership. Instead, you need to add value by bringing in business for the firm. To me, as an outside observer, this is the hardest and most valuable part of being a Biglaw partner. So how did BAL find a way to originate clients?

It all started when BAL was right out of law school. One of his earliest cases involved a ton of doc review, but there were two key differences from the typical slog. First, the opposing firm proposed using complex keyword searches and a new technology called “predictive coding” for discovery. Second, the client was interested in knowing what was happening in discovery and being able to see important documents and cross reference them with other documents to see how they could tell the story of the case. But it wasn’t just a search for “hot docs.”

The client wanted to be able to see the story developing. So like any good partner, BAL’s boss said “no problem” to the client. Which was quickly followed by “I don’t want to do that; you figure it out” to the associate.  And having no Chill Paralegal on that case to save the day, BAL was left to do just that.

And that’s how he developed expertise on e-discovery.

Now at the time, e-discovery wasn’t exactly the most sought after specialty. But BAL leaned into it. And importantly, learned how to translate the technical aspects of electronically stored information (ESI) to lawyers and clients. Over time, as BAL helped on more varied cases, lawyers from different practice groups and different offices in BAL’s firm started sending “quick questions about ESI.”

As he moved up in seniority, BAL started to speak on panels and write articles about e-discovery and e-retention, which was becoming a hot topic, not just in litigation but also in data management for several industries.

Shortly after BAL made partner, there was a major case involving an allegedly mishandled ESI production. After some “creative” allegations from the other side, BAL’s firm was called in as co-counsel to assist. And through an unexpected series of events, BAL became the “tip of the spear” for the team. In the end, the firm was happy with the work, the client was happy with the outcome, and lead counsel was happy BAL’s firm solved the problem.

Then something completely unexpected happened: E-discovery became a hot topic. And at that precise moment, very few lawyers had that expertise. BAL had such a strong reputation and expertise that a partner from — get this, a completely different Biglaw firm — referred some e-discovery work for their own clients to him!

This part of the story almost melted my brain. Why on earth would a partner refer a matter to another firm? Well, as it turns out, it was because that partner wanted to look good to his clients. Giving away a piece of business to make sure the job — managing e-discovery — would be done well would raise the referring partner’s reputation with his other clients.

BAL ended up doing a great job with this case and built a name for himself. After that, he became a known expert on e-discovery, which led to other referrals. Business also came from law school friends who were no longer practicing. “One day all of your friends will be the ones in charge,” BAL said. “And they’re going to need advice.”

But what if you don’t have the expertise these friends, or potential clients need? Well, you can always refer them to other experts (just like that partner referred that e-discovery matter to BAL). In fact, one of BAL’s sources of business is a series of referral relationships inside BAL’s firm, but also with smaller firms. What I took away from all this was that the value of a lawyer isn’t just their expertise, it’s also their knowledge of who can help.

Creating Value By Understanding Who The Experts Are

BAL emphasized how important it is to understand what I’ll call the ecosystem of helpers. When you’re an associate, you don’t see this part of the practice. “If you’re managing doc review and you’ve never done it before, it’s not like you can refer it to some other associate,” BAL explained.

“But when you’re a partner, you can do stuff like that. Be an expert in your space, sure, but it’s equally important to find the experts in all the other spaces that can help when you can’t. And not just lawyers. Know the experts, know the vendors. Clients are always happy to hear, ‘I have just the person for that’ when you can say it with certainty. And then those clients will tell other industry leaders they know the same thing about you.”

This is the flip side of BAL’s story about how he became known and gained visibility for e-discovery. It started small, with a random matter that he handled, but led him to get deeper into this world of vendors, how to search for documents, etc. That expertise got him invited to speak on panels and conferences, and enabled him to write substantive “think piece” articles. That got his name out as an expert for partners at other firms.

Incidentally, this opened my eyes to why so many Biglaw partners have reached out to me directly to discuss Ironclad. Even though we’re a contract management system that doesn’t typically overlap with their client engagements, Biglaw partners are still interested in referring us out to their clients. Because we are part of that “ecosystem of helpers” and referring us out makes them look good to their clients. The firms don’t even want a referral fee — they know that the trust and goodwill generated more than outweighs short term financial gains.

It makes a lot of sense. Being a Biglaw associate is similar, BAL explained. Except instead of the broader ecosystem, it’s the ecosystem within your own firm. Where is the form bank or brief bank? Do you know who the best writers at the firm are? How can you tell which template to use? Which paralegals or support staff are best to work with?

Understanding the internal “structure” of the firm helps you get things done. Which is just one of many under-recognized skills of a great associate. As BAL put it, “My favorite question to get from a partner was ‘do you know anybody who …’. Sometimes the answer was me, sometimes it was somebody else. But being asked was a boost just because it validated that there was a level of trust from those above me. And being able to say ‘yes’ to that question and provide a name was instrumental in advancing up the ranks.”

Your Role As An Associate

According to BAL, there’s often a disconnect between what associates think the job is about versus what it’s actually about. Even though firms hire smart law grads to be associates, a big part of the job is to follow instructions and do what you’re told. “Don’t try to show me how smart you are. I already know you’re smart or the firm wouldn’t have hired you. Don’t get me wrong; I like smart people who disagree with me, because that’s how the big ideas about strategy develop.

“But that’s the ‘invite-only’ part of this job. Every new associate, even those that worked in law firms before or whose parents are lawyers, starts at the level of total unconscious incompetence — we don’t know what we’re doing and we can’t even see the full breadth of how much we don’t know. To overcome that ignorance requires listening with humility, unembarrassed to not know everything already.” Which, incidentally, is most challenging for new associates who graduate from the best law schools.

For example, if you’re an associate who’s told to draft a settlement agreement, don’t reinvent the wheel. BAL recounted a story where a junior rewrote an entire client template to “fix the issues.” And even though some of the changes seemed  good in the abstract, they weren’t required for the matter, and that defeated the purpose. “The template had already been vetted through multiple cases and firms,” BAL explained. “Making changes created more problems from a client-management perspective. And we didn’t have time for all the lawyers and business folks to review everything.”

That problem could’ve been avoided if that associate understood the assignment and, more importantly in BAL’s view, the client’s goals as they relate to the assignment. That’s the other part about becoming a great associate. Don’t be afraid to ask questions early on when you get assigned work. Partners recognize that they might not give the clearest of instructions.

“When you ask me good questions, it tells me what you understand or don’t understand,” BAL said. “Let go of the imposter syndrome and ask me whatever you need clarified. Better to do that up front than to spin your wheels for a week and then give me something I don’t want. For all intents and purposes, the partner is your client when you’re an associate. And when I know an associate will ask good questions and understand the assignment, that’s an associate I can trust. That’s an associate I will want to call on for future matters, introduce to my clients, and help promote to other partners inside the firm.”

Is It Worth It Being A Biglaw Partner?

At the end of the day, it’s all tradeoffs. Yes, the money is good, BAL said. “Seeing the clearer connection between the value I provide and the extra comp I receive does settle a lot of the questions I used to let gnaw at me as an associate.” But there are significant drawbacks that involve more than just a high volume of work. As a partner, one of your main roles is to ensure there is more work coming down the pipe. Which means you have to spend a lot of time out there selling, pitching, on top of your “day job.”

The success of a partner is also heavily numbers driven. And often that success is outside of your control. In that way, the job of a partner reminds me a lot of that of a salesperson. You’re accountable for bringing in a certain amount of revenue, and have some control over it — but often macro factors can swing you one way or another. You also spend a lot of your time asking clients to pay their bills.

Still, BAL loves what he does. “You get to think about the big picture more as a partner,” he said. “Where do I want to go with this matter strategically? How do I translate the client wants to legal solutions? Do I even want to deal with this at all?” Part of this is the increased autonomy and freedom where you get to pick and choose what you work on. He says no a lot (OK, maybe not a lot, the reward for good work is still more work, but he says no more often than he did as an associate). And even when he doesn’t, he’s able to lean on other people by referring matters to others inside (and outside) the firm.

Just by hearing BAL talk about his work it’s clear that he enjoys what he’s doing. At the end of the day, I think that’s what it’s all about. Yes, the money can buy lots of things — including the craft beer and occasional “crispy bois” as would befit a meme account like BAL. But if you’re going to spend your days working, it might as well be on something you truly enjoy.

BAL had one last piece of advice for balancing everything when the job gets stressful: “Never forget to enjoy your Friday happy hour, whatever that means to you. For me, it’s a little sushi and a large Asahi (or Orion if they have it). For you, maybe it’s totally different. But regardless, don’t ever skip it if you can help it. We work enough and whatever is in that email notification can certainly wait a couple hours on a Friday night.”

# Are Redundancies On The Horizon After Allen & Overy Merges With Shearman?
## Leaders of both firms don't seem to be too worried about it -- which is a good thing.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

When you delve into the details, there isn’t much overlap. We, compared to Shearman, are small in the U.S., and the practices are in fact compatible. In the rest of the world, our practices are substantially larger than Shearman’s, and the overlap is very limited. There isn’t a plan for redundancy, but rather strengthening our capabilities in the areas we operate.

— [Wim Dejonghe](https://www.allenovery.com/en-gb/global/people/Wim-Dejonghe), global senior partner of Allen & Overy, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/07/18/ao-shearman-leaders-face-pension-and-management-questions-amid-merger-roadshow/) on the prospect of layoffs taking place after the firm combines with Shearman & Sterling to form A&O Shearman. Both Dejonghe and [Adam Hakki](https://www.shearman.com/en/people/h/hakki-adam), Shearman’s senior partner, have said that redundancies aren’t really a concern of theirs because of their complementary office locations and practice areas. “We are positive about where the vote will end up. And we are having conversations about integration, culture and clients,” Dejonghe said. “The partnership is asking the right questions with the right focus.”

# Why Aren't More Biglaw Firms Conducting Layoffs Now? Because The Recession's Layoffs 'Punished' Them

When we go back to the financial crisis of ‘08 and ‘09, we saw firms decimate associate classes, and when the market picked up, they found they hollowed out their associate ranks. It really financially punished a lot of firms. They didn’t have the associate depth to handle the uptick in work.

— Michael Ellenhorn, founder and CEO of investigative intelligence firm Decipher, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/12/12/year-end-lateral-activity-swings-toward-the-normal-with-litigators-now-in-demand/), on why Biglaw firms may be hesitant to conduct more layoffs, despite the current economic climate. In fact, Ellenhorn says lateral activity right now is “swing[ing] toward the normal” as Biglaw firms strive to “maintain consistency” within their ranks.

# Beyond The Hype: Mastering The Art Of Legal Tech Demos Inspired By Google's Gemini
## A product demo in the legal tech world is more than a presentation; it’s a narrative that weaves together technology, user needs, and real-world applications.

Navigating the delicate art of product demonstrations in the legal tech industry, I’ve learned that it’s a dance of precision, trust, and realistic storytelling. As a former CEO of a Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) company, I have seen demos that dazzled and others that fizzled. The difference? Authenticity and understanding the audience.

This brings to mind the recent unveiling of Google’s Gemini. Touted as a groundbreaking AI model, Gemini’s introduction was shadowed by embellishments in its demonstration. This incident serves as a rich learning ground for anyone in legal tech aiming to make a mark with their product demos.

When Google unveiled Gemini, it was expected to be a monumental leap in AI. However, the demo video, while impressive, took liberties with reality. It portrayed simplified interactions, sped-up responses, and edited outputs. Although common in tech demos, this approach sparked critical responses from developers and industry watchers. It highlighted a crucial lesson: authenticity matters in the world of technology, especially in legal tech.

It’s tempting to showcase a utopian view of your product, but balancing ambition with reality is crucial. Legal professionals appreciate a demonstration that acknowledges both strengths and areas for growth.

Transparency With Limitations

Be upfront about what your product can — and cannot — do. This level of honesty builds trust and sets the stage for future enhancements and updates.

Tailoring To The Audience

Understanding the legal audience’s mindset is key. Their needs and pain points are unique, and your demo should speak directly to these. Showcasing how your product can simplify their daily tasks or solve complex issues will resonate deeply.

Interactive Elements

Interactive demos that allow the audience to experience the product firsthand are invaluable. During my time in CLM, demos that engaged the audience with real-world scenarios and interactive features always left a lasting impression.

Actionable Insights For An Impactful Demo

Preparation Is Key

Research your audience thoroughly. Understand their challenges and tailor your demo to address those challenges. Rehearse your presentation to ensure a smooth delivery.

Clear And Concise Presentation

Clarity is king. Ensure your demo is easy to follow, avoiding technical jargon that might alienate your audience. Keep your pace steady and allow for questions.

Handling Questions

Anticipate potential questions and prepare answers. Being able to address concerns on the spot demonstrates expertise and confidence in your product.

Engagement And Interaction

Incorporate elements that invite participation. Whether it’s a Q&A session or a hands-on segment, interaction keeps the audience engaged and makes your demo memorable.

Follow-up Strategy

The demo isn’t the end. Develop a strategy to follow up with attendees, offer additional information, and keep the conversation going.

Reflecting on my journey as a CEO in legal tech, I recall a specific demo that was a turning point for our company. We had developed a new feature that we knew could revolutionize certain legal processes. However, we created a scenario-based demonstration instead of simply talking about it. We invited attendees to participate and experience the feature in a simulated legal environment. This approach showcased the product’s capabilities and its practical application in a legal setting. The overwhelmingly positive response reinforced a vital lesson: show, don’t just tell.

A product demo in the legal tech world is more than a presentation; it’s a narrative that weaves together technology, user needs, and real-world applications. It’s an opportunity to build trust and establish a connection with your audience. The Google Gemini incident, despite its shortcomings, serves as a crucial reminder of the value of authenticity and the power of a well-executed demo. Let’s use these insights to refine our approach, ensuring that our demos not only showcase our products but also resonate with the unique needs and expectations of the legal community.

# Biglaw Not As Plugged Into AI As We Thought
## The AI era is still not here.

Last week, we [wrote up](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/tech-survey-reveals-the-era-of-biglaw-ai-is-already-here/) the [2023 ILTA tech survey](https://www.iltanet.org/resources/publications/surveys/ts23). The mammoth 300+ page report provides a wealth of insight into legal tech adoption across the industry. There are so many angles to pursue. I chose AI and… oops.

The survey included a graph showing that 85 percent of respondents said their firms are already using generative AI for at least some business tasks. But it turned out the graph was unintentionally inverted and only 15 percent of respondents said their firms were using genAI.

Can’t have a survey about AI without including a hallucination!

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
So… that undermines one key takeaway from the article. Alas, the generative AI era has not really started in Biglaw yet.

The idea that 85 percent of the legal world already embraced generative AI sounded a bit bold, but since the graph didn’t make any representation as to how much a firm had to use AI to count, it seemed possible that a bunch of firms are deploying it sparingly. This also offers an explanation for why such a broad swath of firms have yet to establish clear policies around AI beyond laziness and negligence.

But the other point made in the original piece remains true: law firms are all over the place on where they think generative AI slots into their workflow. This also suggests that law firms might be waiting on the “killer app” to emerge and provide a clear use case before hopping into this world.

And the race to develop that is officially on.

# Biglaw Firms With Tech-Centric Clients May Soon Face Financial Difficulties
## Will this mean more layoffs are ahead?

Bay Area firms saw record profits last year, partly because of the boom in the tech sector. Now we’re seeing a substantial number of employees being laid off at tech companies, and it makes sense those companies are also going to cut expenses, including legal fees. Firms with a tech-centric client base are going to feel that impact.

— Summer Eberhard, a West Coast-based associate recruiter with Major, Lindsey & Africa, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/11/10/gunderson-associates-out-of-a-job-after-dip-in-billable-work/) in the wake of stealth layoffs made at firms like [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/stealth-layoffs-junior-associates-top-20-biglaw-firm-cooley/) and [Gunderson](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/biglaw-firm-makes-2-rounds-stealth-layoffs-billable-work-disappears-gunderson/).

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

# Morning Docket: 02.05.18
## * “I’d like to see in the Constitution a statement that men and women are people of equal citizenship stature. I’d like to see an equal rights amendment in our Constitution.” Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is all in favor of amending the Constitution to benefit women. Are you? [[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2018/02/02/carrying-an-i-dissent-tote-bag-on-stage-ruth-bader-ginsburg-tells-d-c-crowd-shes-still-going-full-steam/?utm_term=.a827e9a513ee)] * Kashyap Patel, the “primary author” of the House Intelligence Committee’s secret memo, is no stranger to controversy. You may remember when he dropped out of [this bachelor auction](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/01/very-prestigious-lawyers-are-selling-themselves-to-women-for-the-highest-price/) due to an issue with his license to practice or from this [“Order on Ineptitude”](https://extremism.gwu.edu/sites/extremism.gwu.edu/files/Al%20Hardan%20Order%20on%20Ineptitude.pdf) after he was [berated by a federal judge](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/judge-calls-doj-sons-of-bitches-on-the-record/). [[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/us/politics/kashyap-patel-nunes-memo.html?referer=)] * Duke Law has a brand new dean, and she’ll be starting her job come July 1.

Professional staff members at Biglaw firms are under a lot of stress and pressure to perform their jobs well, but it seems as though all of the recent attention that’s been paid to mental health in the legal profession is being afforded only to associates and partners. The results of a new survey by fSquared Marketing, a Canadian legal consulting firm, seem to confirm that this is how law firm staff members — legal marketers especially — feel about the situation.

The survey polled 200 law firm staff members, comprised of legal marketers and business professionals, 72 percent of whom worked in the U.S., with the remaining 24 percent in Canada and 4 percent in other countries.

The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/09/09/stressed-out-law-firm-staff-say-their-mental-health-is-being-ignored-survey-finds/) has the details on the results:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
More than 75 percent of legal marketers agreed with the statement that they “often feel overwhelmed at work.” And it wasn’t about compensation or hours worked: More than 70 percent of respondents felt they are compensated appropriately. Much of the stress, they said, stems from the feeling that attorneys do not understand or respect their work.

Half of the respondents strongly agreed with the statement that attorneys lack respect for their role, while 74 percent of business professionals felt that lawyers do no understand their role in the firm. …

Only 9 percent of respondents agreed that there is a focus on the mental well-being of “non-lawyers,” and 71 percent said their law firm does not provide formal support related to stress management and mindfulness.

“It’s difficult to convey the stress to attorneys of what we do. To try and convey how many balls we are juggling sounds defensive and lame, so we suck it up and consequently [have] stress,” said one respondent. “I think mental health is an issue like many others in law firms: if there’s any attention paid to it, it’s as it relates to attorneys — not staff,” said another.

This is extremely disheartening news. We certainly hope that Biglaw firms will quickly address this elephant in the room that is their unhappy ranks of their staff members. These are the people who make sure law firms run efficiently, and it’s high time proper attention is paid to their needs.

# Downtown Biglaw Mainstay Announces... Probably A Bonus Match?

Look, it’s real simple.

If you’re planning to match the prevailing compensation rate, you want to broadcast that far and wide. If you’re planning to exceed the prevailing rate, you actually have more reason to advertise that fact. The only reason to keep things dodgy is if you’re hoping to shortchange some associates.

So why are we getting class-specific bonus memos out of Cahill that seem to match the market rate? If it’s a full match, just say so!

Maybe there’s a fly in the ointment, but so far Cahill looks like a match. Just as a refresher, this is what a match would look like:

First	Second	Total

# What Lawyers Can Learn From Google's Quest To Build The Perfect Team
## How is your law firm’s group culture, and how can it be improved?

“Now I know that’s contradiction, wants and needs in competition / But it’s hard to stay on point with such extremes in opposition / While we waiting on that compromise, proceed with that conscious eye.” – [Lupe Fiasco](http://genius.com/408215)

The New York Times Magazine recently published an article, [What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?WT.mc_id=SmartBriefs-Newsletter&WT.mc_ev=click&ad-keywords=smartbriefsnl&referer=&_r=0), by Charles Duhigg. In his article, Duhigg writes that Google started “Project Aristotle” in 2012 to study hundreds of Google’s teams and figure out why some stumbled while others soared.

Despite mountains of data, [Abeer Dubey](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?WT.mc_id=SmartBriefs-Newsletter&WT.mc_ev=click&ad-keywords=smartbriefsnl&referer=&_r=0), a leader of the project, stated that it was near impossible to find patterns. But his team kept coming across research by psychologists and sociologists that focused on what are known as ‘‘group norms,’’ as Duhigg notes:

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather: One team may come to a consensus that avoiding disagreement is more valuable than debate; another team might develop a culture that encourages vigorous arguments and spurns groupthink. Norms can be unspoken or openly acknowledged, but their influence is often profound. Team members may behave in certain ways as individuals — they may chafe against authority or prefer working independently — but when they gather, the group’s norms typically override individual proclivities and encourage deference to the team.

So which norms were the ones that successful teams shared? The researchers observed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared:

1. On the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’ On some teams, everyone spoke during each task; on others, leadership shifted among teammates from assignment to assignment. But in each case, by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount. ‘‘As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well,’’ the study’s lead author Anita Woolley said. ‘But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.’

2. The good teams all had high ‘average social sensitivity’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues. One of the easiest ways to gauge social sensitivity is to show someone photos of people’s eyes and ask him or her to describe what the people are thinking or feeling — an exam known as the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. People on the more successful teams in Woolley’s experiment scored above average on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. They seemed to know when someone was feeling upset or left out. People on the ineffective teams, in contrast, scored below average. They seemed, as a group, to have less sensitivity toward their colleagues.

These traits are part of what’s known as [psychological safety](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?WT.mc_id=SmartBriefs-Newsletter&WT.mc_ev=click&ad-keywords=smartbriefsnl&referer=&_r=0) — “a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up,” as Harvard Business School professor [Amy Edmondson](http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6451) put it in a [1999 study](http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=e55fd191-97da-4b52-a54d-d1ae6abb0a6e%40sessionmgr111&vid=1&hid=115&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=2003235&db=bth). Psychological safety fosters a “shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking” and creates “a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.”

According to Duhigg, the Google researchers found that although factors like having clear goals and fostering a culture of dependability also mattered, the data showed “that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work.”

Earlier this year, the Harvard Business Review [found](https://hbr.org/2016/01/collaborative-overload) that ‘‘the time spent by managers and employees in collaborative activities has [ballooned by 50 percent](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?WT.mc_id=SmartBriefs-Newsletter&WT.mc_ev=click&ad-keywords=smartbriefsnl&referer=&_r=0) or more’’ over the last twenty years. No doubt, in today’s increasingly interconnected world, lawyers are required to collaborate with each other on an ever-increasing basis. And with [extremely high attrition rates](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/high-minority-attrition-rates-continue-to-plague-large-law-firms/) continuing to plague law firms, it is more important than ever to focus on teamwork.

How is your law firm’s group culture? Do [Asian-American women](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/double-jeopardy-gender-bias-against-women-of-color-in-the-legal-profession/) feel more pressure to act “feminine” — demure and passive — and receive more pushback if they don’t? Are [Latinas](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/double-jeopardy-gender-bias-against-women-of-color-in-the-legal-profession/) at risk of being seen as “angry” or “too emotional” when they assert themselves? Are [black women](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/double-jeopardy-gender-bias-against-women-of-color-in-the-legal-profession/) perceived as “angry black women” when they express emotion? Does your firm even have any Asian-American, Latina, or black women?

So what can lawyers and law firms take away from Project Aristotle? Teamwork is essential to success. And psychological safety is pivotal to making a team work. If your law firm is suffering from high attrition rates or a combative culture, it may be time to review your “group norms.”

After all, as many of you already know: teamwork makes the dream work.

Biglaw associates, how should you spend your bountiful bonuses? Perhaps you’re planning to buy a Peloton. Perhaps you’re planning to purchase your own Lawyerly Lair to someday be featured here on Above the Law. Or perhaps you’re planning to completely pay off your law school loans.

If you’re feeling more altruistic, how about making a charitable donation to support a good cause? Today is [Giving Tuesday](https://www.givingtuesday.org/), and it’s a time to give back to your community, whether through donations of your time or your money. Don’t forget that your law firm may be willing to match any of your charitable contributions. Some ideas:

All of us will either die or retire someday. Even us founding partners. For me, I am having so much fun I want to live – and work – forever. But I guess that isn’t in the cards.

Many professional service firms – including law firms, accounting firms, financial services firms, and other professions and businesses – are facing the current situation or something very similar to it:

They were founded somewhere around ten or twenty or thirty years ago.

There was a founding partner who started the business (the “Founder”).

This Founder had something special going on. Either she was exceptionally talented or she had a lock on a cool client/customer or a cool business model. One way or another, there was something in her, or maybe just a luck factor, that allowed her to do some amazing things.

Likely she was a Level Four Leader (as defined by Jim Collins in Built to Last), which means she pushed the organization forward by the sheer force of her will, skill, and heart. She had an indomitable spirit, extraordinary talent, and worked insanely hard. Those around her were pulled forward in the slipstream as she raised the organization to incredible levels.

Others with superstar potential were marginalized – not intentionally, but because there really wasn’t a place for them. Or more likely they didn’t come to the organization in the first place. To be clear here – this is typically not because the Level Four Leader was doing anything negative or bad. Her motives were incredibly pure – it is just that with someone with this skill set there sometimes just isn’t room for someone else with an equivalent level of skill.

Likely the organization is doing very well – and maybe even super-well – with a great base of clients, investors and/or customers.

Things look pretty dang good, to be honest. What is there to worry about?

However, consider the following thoughts in this hypothetical:

First – most obviously – the Founder – let’s call her Jane — is 66 years old, and (suddenly?) everyone looks around to wonder, how much longer is Jane going to do this? And what will happen when Jane moves on? Everyone is in a comfort zone that Jane is there to help, to be a sounding board, to stick up for people, to pick them up when they are down, to lead the team through thick and thin, to arbitrate disputes, to bring in clients/customers and even get rid of bad clients/customers. There will be a power vacuum when she leaves. That is disquieting.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Second – less obviously – will people join the organization in this uneasy situation, and if they are considering coming, the first question they will likely ask is something like “uh….not to be difficult …..but what is your plan for your organization after Jane?” If there is no good answer, a critical initiative to the lifeblood of any organization – recruiting star people – stops dead in its tracks.

Third – there may be some financial things going on – like renewing a long-term lease or signing up for other financial obligations that seem to look murky. Is Jane going to step up for a liability when it is likely she won’t be around to enjoy the upside? Should other owners do so when there is a risk to the longevity of the organization?

Fourth – for those in the organization now – are they getting a little antsy? Wondering what will happen. When a headhunter calls, they used to just say “not interested,” but now maybe they are at least a little open-minded.

Fifth – does everyone start to wonder who will run the organization next? Is that someone they are comfortable with – someone who will treat them well – be as good as Jane (or better) – or someone that makes them nervous?

Sixth – who is really going to do Jane’s job? Jane does so many things. Remember, she is very talented. Who could fill those shoes? And, if Toby could fill those shoes, who will take over the job that Toby is currently doing? This thought with the backdrop that Toby is likely super-talented too, so his job and shoes will also be difficult to fill.

Seventh – as everyone starts wondering about this, other dust devils are kicked up. Once fear and concern about the future takes over, everyone looks up from their contented cubicle where they were heretofore just cranking out business for the company and its customers and starts to wonder about what is going to happen next. Work suffers as everyone starts to focus not on growing the business and on client/customer matters, but on internal future politics and such.

Eighth – and finally, Jane is in a position where she can’t say to worried partners and associates, “don’t worry about this – I have it covered – go back to work” since, by definition, she doesn’t have it covered.

I see this issue a lot either through our recruiting program, where I see lateral partners looking to leave their current firms due to fears of succession issues, and through evaluating my own firm’s succession plan. It causes me to think a lot about these challenges – for my own law firm – for other law firms – and for clients as well. My next article will contain recommendations and possible solutions. As always, if a reader has a suggestion that you can send me in the next week, I will consider including it in my next article – and I thank you in advance for the help.

Law enforcement and medical assistance arriving at the scene (City of Orlando via Wikimedia)

It’s not clear what can be said in response to the [shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/14/us/orlando-shooting.html?action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=span-abc-region&region=span-abc-region&WT.nav=span-abc-region&_r=0) that left 49 people dead and 53 wounded. In the face of a tragedy like this, the worst mass shooting in American history, words seem inadequate.

But words are what we work with as lawyers. And to their credit, a number of law firms and law schools have issued eloquent, heartfelt statements about the tragic events in Orlando. We have posted two of the best below, one from [Paul Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/paul-weiss-rifkind-wharton-garrison-llp/) and one from [NYU Law School](https://abovethelaw.com/schools/new-york-university-law-school/).

Subject: Orlando & Paul Weiss

Dear Members of the Paul Weiss Community,

Words cannot adequately express the heartbreak and horror over this morning’s tragedy in Orlando.

Our firm has spent years fighting discrimination against the LGBT community and pressing for equality, culminating in our transcendent victory in Windsor.

Today’s events remind us that while we may have secured victory in the courts, we still must fight social prejudice and narrow-minded hatred every day in our neighborhoods.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Today’s events, like so many prior horrific incidents, also call into question our nation’s gun laws. Many of you have approached me in recent weeks and suggested we exercise our pro bono muscle and consider litigation promoting sensible gun control.

We have been speaking with the Law Center Against Gun Violence, the Brennan Center and the Brady Center to explore litigation designed to promote sensible gun control and to combat certain arbitrary practices on the part of gun manufacturers.

We hope that, through our efforts, we will be able to play a small role in eradicating senseless gun violence, just as we have played a role in establishing a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, protecting the voting rights of the disenfranchised, and combating segregation in our public schools.

It is in our DNA to act when we see injustice. We cannot sit idly.

Our thoughts and prayers go out to those who lost loved ones this morning.

NYU LAW SCHOOL — COASES LIST — JOINT STATEMENT ON THE ORLANDO SHOOTING

From: Matt Barnett
Date: Sun, Jun 12, 2016 at 11:48 PM
Subject: OUTLaw, MLSA, ACS & Brady Campaign Joint Statement on the Orlando Shooting
To: Law School Exchange

OUTLaw, the Muslim Law Students Association, and the NYU Law chapters of the American Constitution Society and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence would like to issue a joint statement on the events in Orlando last night.

We foremost would like to express our profound sympathy for the victims and solidarity with the LGBTQ community, both in Orlando and across the world. The attack happened in a nightclub—traditionally a place of refuge for the LGBTQ community—but we refuse to be fragmented or frightened into silence and we will continue to find strength in community. We also recognize that queer, trans, and gender-nonconforming people of color bear a disproportionate share of the violence against our community—we will not look over the fact that it was “Latin Night” at the targeted club.

We condemn those who would use this event to further narratives of Islamophobia and xenophobia and we refuse to let violence against us be used to justify violence against others. We refuse to allow this event to be used to drive a wedge between our communities: we recognize that the forces seeking to otherize Muslims and marginalize the LGBTQ community are one in the same.

We furthermore condemn those who would seek to minimize the role of firearm access in this tragedy. This was the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the United States, but barring dramatic action to restrict civilian access to weapons of war, it will not be the last.

The beginning of the modern LGBTQ movement began with an act of violence against another nightclub, not far from NYU Law. We hope that as we heal, we can find courage in one another and rise from this tragedy stronger and more engaged than ever in the fight for equality, inclusion, and autonomy. None of us are free until all of us are free.

In solidarity,

The executive boards of OUTLaw, the Muslim Law Students Association, and the NYU Law chapters of the American Constitution Society and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence

# Suspended Biglaw Associate Likely To Get Reduced Sentence In Molotov Cocktail Attack
## And you can forget about that terrorism enhancement.

When we last checked in on suspended Pryor Cashman associate Colinford Mattis and housing attorney Urooj Rahman, both charged in May 2020 for their [involvement with a Molotov cocktail attack](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/furloughed-biglaw-associate-charged-in-new-york-molotov-cocktail-attack/) on a police vehicle in Brooklyn, New York, in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, they’d pleaded guilty to one count of possessing or making a destructive device as part of a deal. Those pleas were quickly complicated by the fact that prosecutors sought to add a terrorism enhancement to their sentences.

Many months have since passed, and it looks like we’re finally getting closer to a resolution in this case. As it turns out, with a new U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York comes a new sentencing scheme. Lo and behold, a new agreement has been reached, and Mattis and Rahman are now looking at sentences of 18 to 24 months, as opposed to a decade (or more) of prison time.

The [New York Law Journal](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2022/05/11/government-to-seek-lower-sentence-for-lawyers-charged-in-molotov-cocktail-case-under-new-agreement/) has the details:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In a letter filed Tuesday, prosecutors asked U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan to convert a May 18 hearing originally scheduled for debate over the terrorism enhancement to a change-of-plea hearing, where [Mattis and Rahman] are set to plead guilty to a conspiracy charge carrying a maximum sentence of five years.

“The government, in turn, has agreed that, at sentencing it will … recommend, pursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, that the Court impose a non-Guidelines sentence within a range of 18 to 24 months’ imprisonment,” prosecutors wrote. “The defendants remain free to argue for a sentence below the sentencing range recommended by the government.” …

Prosecutors wrote in the Tuesday letter that their recommendation of 18 to 24 months is “well below” the range calculated in Mattis and Rahman’s pre-sentencing reports.

“Given where this case started, with an indictment that included a 40-year mandatory minimum count, where we have landed is a dramatic difference,” said Rahman’s attorney Paul Shechtman, a partner at Bracewell. “We’re deeply pleased that the U.S. Attorney’s Office took a close second look at the case.”

The defense team is poised to ask Judge Cogan for a sentence of time served, as Mattis and Rahman have now been in home detention for about two years. Both attorneys are still likely to be disbarred.

# Top Biglaw Firm Raises Salaries For Associates Yet Again
## More money for associates, yay!

Now that Cravath has entered the scene with a generous new salary scale, Biglaw firms are racing to match it and offer top-tier compensation to their hardworking associates. Which firm is the latest to enter the salary wars?

It’s a firm that’s [already raised salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/hey-might-want-to-pick-up-the-phone-the-money-is-calling/) just last week!

Cleary Gottlieb — a Biglaw firm that brought in $1,223,119,000 gross revenue in 2020, putting it in 32nd place in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — is pulling out all the stops for associates once again by matching the Cravath salary scale. If you recall, the latest salary scale ranges from $215,000 for entry-level associates to $415,000 for eighth-year associates and beyond.

This is what the new salary grid looks like at Cleary:



Like many of its peer firms, Cleary’s re-raise is retroactive to January 1, and associates will see their new compensation come through in their March 31 paychecks. Congratulations, for the second time!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Cleary.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Look Who's Coming To Play At The Compensation Party
## There's always a catch.

Welcome to the land of raises and special bonuses, Mayer Brown associates! It may have taken the firm some time to get here, but everyone seems pretty glad they made it.

As is becoming almost standard among the top of the Biglaw field, they’ve decided to match the associate compensation structure set by the Big 3 (that’s the [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/)/[Simpson](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/)/[Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) scale), which is comprised of increases (in the range of $10,000-$25,000) to the base salary for all associates, along with special summer bonuses, based on class year.

For those of you that may have, somehow forgotten what that scale looks like, here’s a primer:

But, there’s a catch. In order to get the raise associates must have billed 2000 hours last year (2017) in firm development hours. To get the special bonus they must have racked up the annualized equivalent of 1900 client chargeable hours through the end of June, though they will have the opportunity to make up those hours by the end of the year and get the money then.

In order to receive the salary increase and bonus payments, consistent with our usual practice, associates must be in good standing on the payment dates.  Full-time associates generally must have worked 2000 Firm Development hours in 2017 to be eligible for the salary increase.  To be eligible for the special bonus, full-time associates must have recorded the annualized equivalent of 1900 client chargeable hours as of the end of June 2018. Associates who do not meet this requirement now but do meet it at the end of the year will be eligible for the special bonus at year-end in addition to any normal bonus payable under our annual bonus policy. Individual bonus amounts may vary from this scale based on considerations such as overall performance and productivity.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Being John Quinn
## John Quinn's firm may not look like a lot of firms, but it works.

John Quinn could destroy me. I don’t mean in a courtroom, though he is famous as one of America’s top trial lawyers. I mean that in a street fight, the 66-year-old I interviewed at the Los Angeles firm that bears his name could probably whoop me good. Quinn is fit, confident, and pulls no punches. He’s got client relationships older than some of the lawyers in his firm. It’s easy to understand why so many businesses trust him with their high-end, must-win litigation, or why Quinn Emanuel consistently reports some of the highest profits-per-partner of any law firm in the world.

I wrote in this column [recently](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/the-culture-card-in-law-firms/) about the power and pitfalls of firm culture, and the need to identify a strong vision for a firm’s culture. John Quinn has that vision, and the tenacity to get what he wants. He famously fell in love with the sushi prepared by a chef in Tokyo. When the sushi industry in Tokyo struggled following the Fukushima reactor meltdown, [Quinn helped found a new restaurant for that chef in Los Angeles](http://www.ladowntownnews.com/news/how-lawyers-and-a-tsunami-brought-top-notch-sushi-downtown/article_f6427afc-95d4-11e3-adc5-0019bb2963f4.html), down the street from his firm, so he could get his favorite sushi any time he liked.

Not much is typical about John Quinn, or the firm he founded 30 years ago, Quinn Emanuel. When you walk into the firm, you’re greeted by a huge carved wooden shark suspended from the reception area ceiling. The hallways are filled with attorneys, but instead of suits and dresses, it’s shorts and jeans, [maybe even firm-branded flip-flops](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/08/summer-is-ending-but-flip-flops-are-still-hot-at-quinn-emanuel/). The dress code is unprecedentedly loose for a mega-firm. Anything goes, reportedly, short of underwear or swimsuits. The only requirement is that every attorney has a suit stashed in their office for the odd emergency courtroom appearance.

And yes, every single attorney is prepared to head to court on a moment’s notice. Quinn Emanuel is the rare litigation-only mega-firm. Where conventional wisdom suggests building a firm around transactional practice groups, which in turn spin off litigation, that wasn’t what Quinn set out to do. “We’re not trying to be all things to all people,” he told me; “We don’t have all these practice groups and claim that we’re the best at all of them. We do just one thing, and we think we’re the best, or among the best at that.”

The firm isn’t afraid to be offbeat with its associates. It experimented with jettisoning its summer associate program in favor of focusing on third-year lateral hires, though it has recently brought that summer program back to a limited degree. Back in 2015, when work seemed to be slowing down, Quinn sent an all-hands email. Instead of beating the bushes and asking the associates to scurry up work, he told them “[Enjoy it while it lasts…in the meantime, do some fun stuff.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/01/work-dries-up-at-quinn-emanuel-and-its-leaders-solution-is-for-attorneys-to-do-some-fun-stuff/)

The firm’s been unorthodox in its overall business strategies, often to startling effect. It expanded internationally at a time when the very concept of a global litigation firm, by Quinn’s own admission, made no sense. And yet the demand turned out to be there, and cross-border litigation matters flooded in.

The firm also has a remarkable appetite for contingency work compared to its peers. As much as 10 percent of the firm’s hours might be devoted to contingency work at any given time, providing the firm ample opportunity to take part in the upside of its massive litigation cases. Per Quinn, part of that is simply a reflection of the firm’s composition. “We don’t have a corporate practice, a transactional practice. So there may be something to the idea that we’re more comfortable in assessing and living with the risk.”

Quinn Emanuel made the striking decision early on to never represent any of the major banks or financial institutions. By turning down those huge, reliable clients begging to throw money at them, Quinn Emanuel ended up able to sue those same banks later on, free of any conflicts. The litigation spawned by the 2008 economic meltdown was a bonanza. “You saw the movie ‘The Big Short?’” Quinn asked me. “The last act, which isn’t in the movie, is Quinn Emanuel sues all those banks and recovers over $40 billion.”

“Sadly,” he added, “not on contingency.”

John Quinn struck me as a firm leader who has been trying to carry the best of the so-called “golden era” of law into the modern day. The classic concepts of partnership and collegiality, of valuing the firm over oneself, sound a bit less creaky and musty when he talks about them. Loyalty is key to him, for better and for worse. He’s well known for employing the same admin and driver for the last 20 years. But it’s not all group hugs and kumbayas. Quinn recently made headlines by sending [another, less warm and fuzzy all-hands email](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/john-quinn-is-not-happy-about-selendy-gay-and-he-sent-the-angry-reply-all-to-prove-it/?rf=1) after the co-chair of Quinn Emanual’s National Trial Practice group announced she was leaving to start her own, competing law firm. Quinn publicly shredded the “deception” and “ingratitude” allegedly displayed by his former partner in light of all the support he claimed the firm had provided her in the past.

If you’re looking for a universal lesson to take away from the Quinn Emanuel experience, it’s that there aren’t any universal lessons. A good firm culture is bespoke. It has to be crafted out of a few good ideas and hopefully not too many bad ones, and it has to fit the people who call that firm home. From the shark in the reception area to the litigators in shorts and flip-flops, there’s a lot about Quinn Emanuel that just doesn’t translate. Some might call it bizarre, but it all somehow works here, in this time and at this place, to the tune of over $5 million in profits per partner a year.

I ended my interview by asking Quinn what he wanted his legacy to be. In his own immortal words:

# Ex-Biglaw Partner Suspended From Practicing Law Over Side Solo Gig
## Running your own firm while you're a Biglaw partner will cost you that Biglaw partnership and your ability to practice law. Who knew?

If you’re a Biglaw partner, it’s probably not a good idea to do work on the side in contravention of your firm’s own policies. It’s probably an  even worse idea to bill the Biglaw firm’s clients for your side hustle. An ex-Crowell & Moring partner who landed on the wrong end of a disciplinary ruling is finding out exactly why.

Matthew Melville, formerly of the Am Law 100 firm, was accused of running his own side gig while working at the top Biglaw firm and underreporting the money he made from it. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/ny-suspends-moonlighting-ex-partner-law-firm-crowell-moring-2024-01-05/) has the details:

The appeals court said Melville secretly performed legal work for non-Crowell clients and also personally billed Crowell clients for work he solely did, outside of Crowell’s usual billing structure. He earned more than $360,000 from his side practice, the court said.

Crowell discovered Melville’s side practice in November 2021 after a client received invoices from both the firm and Melville, the court said.

In its ruling, the court said Melville “admitted that he engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation” in violation of New York’s professional rules, and suspended him from practicing law in the state for six months. Melville must also comply with business and mental health monitoring and reporting for two years.

In a statement, Crowell & Moring said: “We promptly terminated Matt Melville’s partnership with the firm in 2021 when we learned that he had engaged in conduct in violation of the firm’s practices and policies and bar rules.” The firm went on to say that despite Melville’s conduct, there was no “adverse impact on our clients.”

Melville told Reuters that he intends to continue practicing law in California, even though the State Bar plans to place a “consumer alert” on its website noting that he’s been suspended in New York.

# These Elite Biglaw Firms Could Charge HOW MUCH Per Hour During A Recession?!?!

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

Heavyhitter bankruptcy and restructuring firms like Kirkland & Ellis and Weil Gotshal charge big bucks per hour for their services. If these Biglaw firms raised their rates in 2020 just as much as in years prior, how much could they be charging per hour?

Hint: Per court records, Kirkland increases its rates twice a year, and Weil increases its rates once a year. Kirkland has already increased its rates once in 2020. Kirkland partner rates currently top out at $1,845 (a 2.7% increase) and its associate rates top out at $1,165 (a 3.6% increase). Weil partner rates currently top out at $1,695 (a 5.9% increase) and its associate rates top out at $1,050 (a 5.5% increase).

# Give Associates A Reasonable Amount Of Time To Respond To Emails
## Unneeded follow-up emails can create more unnecessary work for associates and demoralize them.

I swear … one more email. Just one, and that’s it … into the abyss!

I picked up a couple of pet peeves while working as an associate attorney at several different law firms before starting my own shop over four years ago. Perhaps the most ridiculous phenomenon of some law firm managers I witnessed during my career as an associate is that some partners send follow-up emails an unreasonably short amount of time after the first email was sent. This tactic is often not useful and can lead to ill will and low morale around an office.

When I was an associate working at a midsize firm, I would often get emails from bosses after normal working hours. Generally, managers should refrain from sending emails outside of normal working hours, but I get how, in emergencies, sometimes this is unavoidable. Moreover, sometimes lawyers send out emails when they remember to do something so that they do not forget during the next business day.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In any event, one of the partners sent an email around 10 p.m. — around the time I usually go to sleep. I received the email during my end-of-the-day routine and did not think I needed to respond immediately, since it was not an emergency and could be dealt with during business hours. I felt like it was completely appropriate to respond to the partner first thing when I got to the office the next day.

At around 7 a.m. the next day, the partner sent me a follow-up email asking if I got the first email! I thought this was inappropriate on a number of levels. For one, this nonessential communication was happening outside of normal business hours when it could have easily occurred during business hours. Beyond this, the partner had sent a completely unneeded email without giving me enough time to respond to the first message. Any reasonable person could see that I may not have the ability to read and respond to the email already since they were both sent outside of business hours and within a short amount of waking time from each other.

At other points, partners might send follow up emails during the same day a mere hour or two after sending the initial email. Since people might be in court or working on time-sensitive matters, this is usually not enough time for people to respond to the initial email. Unless a partner knows that an associate is in an office and at their desk, they should not assume that just an hour or two of response time is sufficient before sending a follow-up email.

Such emails can lead to some negative outcomes in offices. Perhaps most importantly, unneeded follow-up emails can create more work for associates. This creation of additional messages that associates need to read and respond to can make it even more difficult for associates to keep track of all of the matters to which they need to respond. Also, these messages can be annoying, show associates that partners do not respect work-life balance, and show that partners do not have a sense of reasonableness around work expectations.

There are a few rules that partners and other managers can follow to make sure that they do not send too many unneeded emails. One rule? Just give people who are known to be working and not on vacation, a full 24 hours before sending out a follow-up email. There is a natural expectation that recipients of emails will respond to the messages within one day, and if they do not, this might be reason to send a follow-up email.

Of course, there are instances in which someone cannot wait a full day to confirm whether a recipient has seen an email and is responding to the message. However, the least amount of time that seems appropriate to give people before sending a follow-up message is half a day. If someone sends an email first thing in the morning, they should wait at least until the afternoon before following up. Moreover, if someone sends an email in the afternoon, it might make sense to follow up no sooner than the next morning. This gives people a reasonable amount of time to respond to emails without disturbance.

All told, associates and other professionals at law firms are usually busy, and sending unneeded follow-up emails can clutter inboxes and annoy workers. Partners and other managers should follow a few simple steps to ensure that do not send out too many unneeded follow-up messages.

# The Top Biglaw Firms In New York City (2024)
## Are you in a New York state of mind? This is where the Biglaw money is.

Many law students and lawyers alike have long dreamed of someday working in New York, the city that never sleeps (especially if they wind up as Biglaw associates). New York firms are regarded as the crown jewels of the legal profession, and it’s in New York where firms typically set the stage for Biglaw salaries and bonuses across the country. But which firm is considered the best in the Big Apple?

Thanks to Vault’s recently released regional rankings, we now know which Biglaw firms are dominating the legal scene in Manhattan. This ranking is based on votes tabulated from associates who were asked to rate firms on a 1 to 10 scale based on their prestige within the region.

Here are the top 10 most prestigious firms in New York (you can see the full list from Vault by clicking [here](https://firsthand.co/best-companies-to-work-for/law/best-law-firms-in-each-us-region/new-york)):

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
- Cravath, Swaine & Moore
- Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz
- Davis Polk & Wardwell
- Skadden
- Sullivan & Cromwell
- Simpson Thacher & Bartlett
- Latham & Watkins (up from #9)
- Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison (down from #7)
- Kirkland & Ellis (down from #8)
- Debevoise & Plimpton
It’s worth noting that several of these firms are known as compensation leaders, with Cravath, Skadden, and Simpson Thacher each having been the first to announce bonuses throughout the years, and Cravath and Davis Polk each raising the stakes on associate salaries in recent years. Just outside the top 10, we find Milbank — a firm that has taken the lead in raising associate salaries and bonuses since 2018 — at No. 15, up from No. 13 in the 2023 rankings.

Congratulations to all of the Biglaw firms that made the latest edition of Vault’s New York rankings. How did your firm do this time around? [Email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BLaw%20Firm%5D%20Vault%20Rankings), text us at (646) 820-8477, or tweet us [@atlblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog) to let us know how you feel.

I was chatting the other day with a summer associate who reached out to report that his firm had a [100 percent offer rate](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/summer-associate-offer-rates-2016-tons-of-future-lawyers-will-be-making-180k/) for summers. I asked him if he might also have a nomination for our [summer associate event contest](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/what-was-the-best-biglaw-summer-associate-event-of-2016/).

“The raise was the highlight obviously,” he said. “We could have done nothing else and I would have been happy.”

That sums up the feelings of Biglaw summer associates around the country. The most exciting summer “event” was Cravath [raising starting salaries to $180,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/?rf=1).

But we’re pleased to report that there was still plenty left in the bank for firms to show their summer associates a good time. After reviewing your nominations, we’re pleased to announce the following six finalists for our annual summer associate event contest:

1. [Finn Dixon & Herling](http://www.fdh.com/). As we’ve discussed repeatedly in these pages, chronicling the rise of boutique firms, Biglaw firms don’t have a monopoly on cutting-edge matters or top-tier talent — nor do they have a monopoly on fun. Finn Dixon & Herling, a Stamford-based firm with about 50 lawyers, took partners, associates, and summer associates to Chelsea Piers, where they played trampoline dodgeball. Said our source, “It was a blast!”

2. [Freshfields](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/freshfields-bruckhaus-deringer/). The Magic Circle firm pulled something far more exciting than rabbits out of its hat: orchestra-level seats to Broadway’s hottest show, [Hamilton: An American Musical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_(musical)). With tickets to the Tony-winning show hitting four figures over the summer, especially right before [Lin-Manuel Miranda’s departure](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/11/theater/hamilton-lin-manuel-miranda-final-show.html), this probably cost the firm a pretty penny. But as someone who enjoyed Hamilton from orchestra seats earlier this year, I will attest that it’s worth it. I’d gladly go see it again — especially on someone else’s dime, like these lucky summer associates.

3. [Kirkland & Ellis](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/kirkland-ellis/) (Houston). It turns out that K&E had 100 percent offer rates in all of its U.S. offices (per a firm spokesperson), not just in the Houston office we [previously mentioned](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/summer-associate-offer-rates-2016-tons-of-future-lawyers-will-be-making-180k/). But we still suspect the Kirkland summers in H-Town had the hottest time (and not just in terms of temperature):

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
K&E (Houston office) took the entire summer class, as well as a large group of attorneys, on an all-expenses-paid weekend trip to New Orleans. We stayed at the Windsor Court, arguably the nicest hotel in the city, and had a group dinner at the famous Emeril’s, as well as a jazz brunch at Palace Cafe.

As Emeril himself might say, [BAM!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvazQUYG1kE)

4. [Quinn Emanuel](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/quinn-emanuel-urquhart-sullivan-llp/). Don’t count the defending champion out (as I sort of did [the other day](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/what-was-the-best-biglaw-summer-associate-event-of-2016/)). Quinn still has a summer program, even if it’s [smaller than before](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/biglaw-firm-decimates-summer-associate-program/) (about ten or so summers), and it still shows them a good time:

I was a summer at Quinn Emanuel, and we all went on the annual firm hike — three days, 34 miles of hiking in Iceland. It was a blast! Just wanted to throw that out there so Quinn isn’t completely written off from the summer associate event contest.

The famously competitive John Quinn doesn’t like to lose — and now QE has a shot at keeping its crown, thanks to this Iceland excursion.

5. [Richards Layton & Finger](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/richards-layton-finger/). This contest almost always has a big-ticket concert in the running (past years have seen appearances by Beyoncé and Taylor Swift), and 2016 is no exception. Richards Layton, one of Delaware’s top corporate law firms, wanted to put its summers in a Wilmington state of mind — so it took them to see The Piano Man himself, live in concert. That they got to enjoy the musical stylings of Billy Joel from a luxury box only made it better.

6. [Stoel Rives](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/stoel-rives/). The Portland-based firm flew all of its summer associates back to the home base in the Rose City for two days. Said our source, “Each summer got their own room at a nice hotel. All summers were also given passes to go to the Nike employee store.”

As a former Portland resident (I lived there for a year while clerking), I can say that it’s one of the most beautiful cities in the country, especially in the summer. As my colleague Joe Patrice, also a former denizen of the City of Roses, put it, “Hipsters, free-range quinoa, AND passes to get shoes 10% off? F**k it, just hand them the trophy now.”

Well, not so fast — the winner will be decided by you, our readers. Please cast your vote now (voting closes on MONDAY, AUGUST 15, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time):

Ponder for a moment, what I call “the legal innovation paradox”: in a billable hour regime, efficiency reduces profit. (Let’s call it “The Paradox,” if you are into the whole brevity thing).

Anyone who has worked in Biglaw holds this truth to be self-evident: the more time spent on a task, the happier the partners the more revenue and profit flow to the law firm. In such a regime, how can innovative legal companies (which reduce time spent on tasks) encourage law firms to adopt them?  As a warrior on the front lines of that battle in my day job, I can tell you that it’s quite difficult.

The Paradox is perplexing to those outside of the legal industry.  They think, logically, if you can reduce the cost of your product or service (below that of your competitors), you should be able to gain disproportionate market share and thus profit.  But the problem is that very few lawyers believe that the gears of commerce, which work so well in other industries, apply to legal. And, it’s hard to convince a bunch of millionaires that their business model is broken!

The Atriums: Solving The Paradox

Enter two legal entities, Atrium LTS and Atrium LLP (hereinafter, “The Atriums”).

Over the next two columns, we are going to explore how The Atriums are working to solve The Paradox — and it is the most interesting and ambitious story of legal innovation I have come across since launching alt.legal (although not all my colleagues at [ATL necessarily agree](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/is-revolutionary-law-firm-atrium-a-case-of-clearspire-deja-vu/)).

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
First, let me try to explain The Atriums in a nutshell:  The Atriums are two separate, but equally important entities (dun dun):

Atruim LLP is, at its core, a traditional law firm with Biglaw-quality lawyers focused on high-end client representation — for 80% of their work day.  Critically, the other 20% will be focused on testing, integrating and providing feedback on legal technology designed by Atrium LTS (LTS stands for legal technology solutions). Its goal, modestly, is to be “the largest multi-practice law firm in the US.”

Atrium LTS is a venture-funded, legal technology startup with a huge war chest and a technology veteran at its helm.  LTS will build tools and technologies for its sister law firm, Atrium LLP, and eventually the broader legal market. Atrium is truly a baby of Silicon Valley. Founded by serial entrepreneur, Justin Kan, they raised a [“record breaking Series-A round,”](https://www.legaltechnology.com/latest-news/startup-corner-atrium-lts-raises-10-5m-to-revolutionise-legal-services/) of $10.5M.

And here is the magic: as part owners in Atrium LTS, both partners and associates have two ways of making a living: the typical billable hour (or other fee arrangement), and the success of the technology in Atrium LTS, which they collectively own. They expect that their efforts in each entity will be self-reinforcing, leading to ever-better results for their clients, more clients due to their success, and ever-better systems through their efforts perfecting the tech products LTS.

Paradox Solved?

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
So just who is [Justin Kan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Kan), and why should we believe he can succeed in legal?

Justin is co-founder of Twitch, a live-streaming video game platform, acquired by Amazon for $970M, and a partner in Silicon Valley’s darling incubator, [Y Combinator](http://www.ycombinator.com/). We have had the honor to spill ink over Y Combinator a [couple](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/y-combinator-gets-alt-introducing-ironclad-the-legal-startup-for-startups-legal/) of [times](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/better-know-a-columnist-a-conversation-with-joe-borstein/)  in the pages of ATL. Justin is the newest, and most high-profile, example of Y Combinator nurturing innovative legal companies, and working to explode the traditional legal regime.

Thus, Justin, through founding or investing in nearly 80 companies, became an “involuntary power user” of legal services, and was routinely puzzled by law firm business practices. He saw the problem we all saw, and now is using his tech skill to try to make things better.  

Don’t Be The Taxi Driver Complaining About Uber.

So the world is changing and most of us lawyers don’t like it.  Let’s shake our fists at [the Fates](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/The_Fates/the_fates.html) and lament the loss of the billable hours of yore.

Or . . .  we can take a look at what the Atrium LLP founders, [Augie Rakow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/augierakow/) (formerly a partner at [Orrick](https://www.orrick.com/)) and [Bebe Chueh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bebe-chueh-6968a216/), (founder of AttorneyFee.com, which sold to [LegalZoom](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-quiet-crisis-in-legal-and-how-to-fix-it-eddie-hartmans-vision/?rf=1)), are creating.  In my view, the model they have built (high-end law firm, empowered by high-tech proprietary legal technology company), has not been tried before, and is bursting with potential. As Peter Theil puts it, “competition is for losers,” so why not try something promising and new.

Enjoy Part I of my interview below with Augie and BeBe, and email me with questions for Justin Kan, which I will strive to incorporate into Part II.

Joe Borstein: So the Atriums, together, represent a unique business model.  What were the events which lead to their creation?

Augie Rakow: Justin really got this going, because he thought that the status quo in legal was just “head scratchy.”  He couldn’t understand why law firms were not doing things like other businesses.

Moreover, the amount he had spent on legal during his 10+ years founding companies in Silicon Valley blew his mind.  Even when compared to other professional services industries he was spending money on, law firms never marketed to him as a customer.  For example, other professional services companies at least tried to retain and reactivate him as a client after a deal was done.  No lawyer has called him after he sold his company to ask “how did it go”?

JB:  So give me an example of something that doesn’t work as well in legal as in other businesses. 

AR:  Well, the way law firms get clients is totally ad hoc, as I know from personal experience.

You might ask why law firms don’t use their CRM (or Customer Relationship Management program like SalesForce[[1]](#f1)) or why they don’t use a sales team to find new clients.  The reason?   Because they don’t have a CRM or a sales team that really knows the market.  In other words, insufficient investment.

Now, the good thing about law firms is that there is a lot of autonomy for their partners.  But that means, in practice, that the same lawyer does everything.  The marketing, the sales, even the collection and all other functions, so it’s amature-ville across the board.

JB:  So what was your personal impetus for building Atrium LLP?

AR:  I wanted to come to the marketplace with a truly differentiated practice, which didn’t look the same as everyone else in the market, because it was actually better.  At Orrick, I had learned how to sell the way everyone else was doing it, and had built a great book of business.

But the only way to grow under that regime was to sell harder and be ever-more responsive, which hits upon a ceiling of possibility pretty quickly.  Basically, I saw that lawyers were competing on “hustle” and “chipper-ness,” rather than innovation in delivery of legal services.

Peter Theil puts it best when he says “competition is for losers,” but my dad also taught me that to succeed big you need differentiated expertise.  You want a deep and narrow topic where only 5 people in the world have your expertise.

JB:  So how did you try to make your practice differentiated?

AR:  One weekend, earlier this year, I decided I would learn how to automate a financing!  I sat down and wrote out the specs for a program which would eliminate a lot of the heavy lifting.

In March, I told told my wife I had to make a move.  I felt like leaving to do this WAS the risk-averse move. While I loved being a lawyer (with all its beautiful mental abstractions), and liked being a Biglaw lawyer, I hated the logistics of being a lawyer, which were a huge part of the job and of no value to the client.

If I could automate those logistics, and build a differentiated firm, I would have so much more to offer my wonderful rolodex of clients.

My main professional asset was a network of people who would call and ask for advice.  Now it will broadcast an even better message to a high caliber of network, with a message of innovation.  Ultimate business development message.

JB:  So how did startup-maven Justin Kan com into the picture for you? 

AR: Great story.

I had represented Justin’s brother, but didn’t meet him until I commented on a post he had put on Facebook, in which Justin was crowdsourcing what people were spending on their financing:

Poll: how much did you pay in legal fees for your seed round, series A, or series B+? Pls let me know what round it was for as well

I replied with my thoughts on how someone like Justin could keep costs down. From there a private conversation evolved about why the business of legal was so damn broken. We immediately saw eye-to-eye and thought that if we each focused on what we do best, we could make a far better mousetrap.

Bebe Chueh: At this point we had found the founding team.  I led the raise as Augie was still at Orrick.  And I was free as I had finished my earn-out with LegalZoom.  General Catalyst was the lead investor.

JB: Explain to the audience how the law firm works?

AR and BC:  Basically, the law firm attorneys and staff own the technology company and have a responsibility to spend time on it.  Generally, we expect the team to spend 80% of their time on client management and 20% on process improvement, to make the client experience better in sustainable ways.

In exchange for that process work, Atrium LLP employees get advisor equity in the tech company.  The goal is to build amazing technology for ourselves first.  LTS’s second client may be opposing counsel, tired of being run ragged.

JB:  What’s your long term goal with the firm?

AR and BC: Goal is to build the largest multi-practice law firm in the US. And with a fragmented law firm market this is not that far-fetched.

For example, no law firm has taken more than about 1.5% of the market.  We believe this is due to a lack of corporate structure in the firms, and it represents extreme fragmentation, even in the fragmented world of professional services. Also, the law firm will be like a tech company in many meaningful ways.

First, the office itself is in the design district near Air BNB in SF.  It has more staff on the engineering side of the business (LTS) than on the legal side (Atrium LLP), with the goal of making things better/cheaper/faster all the time.

Our fundamental innovation is in creating an economic incentive for long term investment in the operational and business aspects of a law firm.  We will be constantly improving the delivery of our advice while doing the actual advising.

JB: Thanks Bebe and Augie! 

Before I close, I want to revisit an article I did last year with [Eddie Hartman of LegalZoom](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-quiet-crisis-in-legal-and-how-to-fix-it-eddie-hartmans-vision/?rf=1), on the quiet crisis in legal. I reported:

In one hour at FutureLaw, [Eddie] laid out a compelling case that our legal system will remain in a quiet crisis until non-lawyers (you may have heard of them: businesspeople, technologists, marketers and managers) can own shares in law firms, and drive the level of competition, experimentation and change we see in other sectors of our economy.

But did Eddie have it backwards? What if lawyers work for, and own shares in, legal technology companies? Together can they push forward the quality of their legal work product?

Stay tuned for my next installment on Atruim, where I interview Justin Kan and find out why a mega-rich, mega-successful tech guru is taking on legal, and why he thinks Atrium will work where others have failed.

[ [1]](#reff1) The fact that I feel that have to explain this on ATL is evidence of his point.

# Top Biglaw Firm Matches Cravath Scale, But Associates Will Have To Wait To See The Money
## The firm’s fiscal year begins in April, so associates won’t be seeing their salary increases and bonuses for a few more months.

Biglaw was all about the holiday merriment late last year, with several firms making major compensation announcements just before Christmas.

What could possibly be better than a salary increase on the Cravath scale? A salary increase on the Cravath scale paired with bonuses! And what could be even better than Cravath scale raises and bonuses? Not having to wait months to receive them! But unfortunately, there’s no such luck at this firm.

We recently learned that Hunton Andrews Kurth — a firm that brought in $804,052,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 62 in the most recent Am Law 100 — announced raises and bonuses in line with the Cravath grid. This is what the new compensation scale looks like at the firm:



Hunton’s fiscal year runs from April to March, so eligible associates — those who are meeting performance expectations with regard to their commitment, quality of work, productivity, and overall economic and firm contribution — won’t see their salary increases and bonuses until on or around April 1, 2024.

Good things come to those who wait, so congratulations to everyone at Hunton Andrew’s Kurth!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from the firm.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of compensation updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or email us (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus/Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks for your help!

# Lawyers Have Much To Be Thankful For This Thanksgiving
## The financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has not hurt lawyers as much as individuals in other industries.

This year will likely go down as one of the worst in recent memory. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage and has led to an unfathomably high level of loss and suffering. In addition, even though the economy has recovered from its low of several months ago, many people are still out of work and in trouble financially. Yet, numerous lawyers still have many reasons to be thankful this Thanksgiving season.

Lawyers are extremely lucky that our industry has not been as affected by current conditions as much as other parts of the economy. Indeed, many law firms are able to continue operating, albeit with some challenges. This distinguishes us from retail, hospitality, and other industries that have been completely devastated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The fact that lawyers are able to more or less continue operating at a similar level as before the pandemic has softened the financial pain many lawyers have felt. Of course, many law firms instituted layoffs, furloughs, and salary cuts at the beginning of the pandemic. However, as this website has detailed at length in several prior articles, many firms have eliminated salary cuts, and some have even reimbursed lawyers for money they were not paid earlier in the year. Some firms have reversed course on furloughs as well. Of course, the legal industry, like many other sectors of the economy, has endured permanent job losses as a result of the pandemic, but the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has not hurt lawyers as much as it has individuals in other industries.

Many lawyers should also be thankful because we are capable of working remotely (for the most part). Many workers need to show up in person to complete their jobs. This not only includes healthcare workers, but also individuals who work in hospitality, real estate, and even some other office jobs. Being able to work remotely means that many lawyers are able to complete their jobs while minimizing their risk of being exposed to COVID-19. In addition, being able to work from home means that attorneys have an easier time juggling child care, healthcare needs, personal matters, and everything else all of us are contending with.

Of course, some attorneys and support professionals are being forced back to offices, [which I predicted would happen toward the beginning of the pandemic](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/will-some-law-firms-reopen-their-offices-too-soon/). Sometimes, there are legitimate reasons to return to offices, but many times, managers are forcing workers back to offices to supposedly increase their productivity or since they can’t bear the thought of paying for an unused office (more on this in a future article). Nevertheless, the vast number of lawyers are able to work from home, which has made dealing with the ongoing pandemic far easier.

Numerous lawyers should also be thankful that we are doing better financially than individuals in many other industries. Of course, some practice areas have definitely slowed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, there are fewer real estate deals occurring in the present environment, litigation has slowed, and any cyclical practice areas are suffering as the economy has faced challenges in recent months. However, numerous practice areas have remained steady, and some practice areas have expanded because of the ongoing pandemic. Many firms have adapted to meet the current needs of their clients, and some firms may be able to expand their expertise in the future because of their experiences during the pandemic.

Lawyers should also be thankful because many law firms were able to take part in government assistance programs designed to help businesses impacted by COVID-19. For instance, many law firms were eligible to participate in the Payroll Protection Program, and judging from my LinkedIn feed, many law firms big and small of which I am familiar took part. In addition, numerous law firms also took advantage of programs sponsored by FEMA and the SBA in order to make it through the earlier parts of the pandemic. Many businesses were unable to participate in such programs, since restaurants, hotels, and other businesses were unable to keep the requisite number of people on the payroll to obtain the benefits of these initiatives. Of course, businesses of all types and sizes also took part in such programs, but lawyers should count themselves lucky that they had the support of these initiatives.

Naturally, the legal profession has suffered due to the COVID-19 pandemic, just like any other industry. Some titans of our profession passed away due to the virus ([and other valued lawyers were thankfully able to recover from COVID-19](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/coronavirus-and-me-david-lat-covid-19-journal/)). In addition, lawyers, just like everyone else, have had to deal with the everyday suffering and inconvenience caused by the COVID-19. However, as we begin the Thanksgiving holiday, lawyers should recognize that we have many reasons to be thankful this season.

Former Polsinelli bankruptcy partner Trey A. Monsour has [filed a lawsuit](https://www.abajournal.com/files/MonsourSuit.pdf) against the firm alleging sexual orientation and age discrimination. Monsour, now a partner at Fox Rothschild, says the firm failed to provide him associate and administrative support, lowered his compensation, and even de-equitized his partnership before replacing him with a heterosexual woman. All of which is alleged to be a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, a violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and fraudulent inducement.

The complaint alleges that Polsinelli, in order to appeal to progressive clients and it combat its “Midwestern, ‘good old boys’ reputation,” touted its diversity but the lawsuit alleges that commitment is “farcical” and “mere pretense.”

As [reported by ABA Journal](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/polsinellis-commitment-to-diversity-was-mere-pretense-gay-ousted-partner-alleges-in-bias-suit), the lawsuit points to Polsinelli’s diversity numbers in support of the allegations:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As evidence, the suit says Polsinelli has low numbers for hiring and promoting minorities to leadership positions when compared to other top law firms in the United States.

According to the suit, Polsinelli reported in 2019 that at least 72% of its partners were white heterosexual men; 22% of its partners were white heterosexual women; less than of its partners 2% were members of the LGBTQ community; and, at most, 7% of its partners were among all other minority groups combined, including veterans.

The complaint alleges Monsour was unable to receive much in the way of administrative or associate support, and when he complained about it, the situation worsened. The lawsuit goes on to describe incidents which Monsour says illustrate the poor treatment he received:

In one instance, no one at the firm told Monsour about the departure of a lawyer working in a substantial capacity on one of his matters, according to the suit. Instead, Monsour learned about it from outside co-counsel on the morning of an important hearing. When Monsour expressed concerns, a department chair “condescendingly asked” in an email whether Monsour “was able to stay ‘calm,’” the suit says.

In another “strange episode” in fall 2019, Monsour’s business and personal files were lost when the Houston office relocated to a new space in the same building, the suit says. The lost documents included client files, contracts and personal files containing his will and power of attorney. No other attorney files were lost.

In March of 2020, Monsour was fired from Polsinelli, despite what he characterizes as excellent work product and outperforming other attorneys on “clear, quantifiable metrics.” The complaint says when Monsour asked for a reason why he was let go, he was told he’s “difficult to work with.” Taken together, the lawsuit alleges what Monsour experienced was discriminatory, “a fact starkly punctuated by derogatory comments by firm leaders regarding gay employees that Mr. Monsour overheard firsthand.”

Chase Simmons, chairman and CEO of Polsinelli, [said the “allegations are outrageous.”](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/gay-lawyer-calls-polsinellis-diversity-focus-marketing-ploy)

“The firm will vigorously defend itself against these erroneous and defamatory charges,” Simmons said. “We will do so with the facts, relying primarily on Mr. Monsour’s own words and actions. They will paint a very different story.”

# Biglaw Firm Increases Associate Compensation For A Hot Salary Summer
## Associates are thrilled.

Memorial Day has come and gone, but summer’s official start date is still a few weeks away. That means Biglaw firms have until June 21 to get in shape — and by that, we mean increasing associate salaries. This trend started about six months ago, but some firms are just now making their compensation moves.

Which firm just announced that its associates would indeed be having a hot salary summer?

That would be Wiley Rein, the prominent DC firm known for its government and policy work. The firm brought in $239,650,000 gross revenue in 2021, putting it in 141st place in the latest Am Law 200 ranking. Sources tell us that the salary news — a Cravath match — was revealed during an associates meeting, and that associates later received memos personalized by class year. If you’ve forgotten what the Cravath salary scale looks like, here’s a reminder:

- Class of 2021: $215,000
- Class of 2020: $225,000

# Another Biglaw Firm Targeted By Harvard Law School Students Over Mandatory Arbitration Agreements
## Law school students claim the firm has been deceptive about their mandatory arbitration stance.

Biglaw firms that employ mandatory arbitration agreements as a condition of employment have been put on notice — law school student activists are coming for you. Harvard Law student activists, organized as the [Pipeline Parity Project](http://www.pipelineparityproject.org/about/), have made it their mission to take down firms that require employees to arbitrate employment issues. The group has already targeted [Kirkland & Ellis](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/harvard-law-school-students-organize-dumpkirkland-campaign-over-biglaw-employment-arbitration-agreements/?rf=1) and [DLA Piper](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/one-biglaw-firm-refuses-to-do-away-with-forced-arbitration-agreements/) (with Kirkland[ reversing course](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/law-school-students-stand-up-to-biglaw-firm-win/) on the issue) and now their sights are set on a firm they claim has been deceptive about their arbitration stance.

This morning, Pipeline Parity Project (PPP) launched #DumpVenable. In [response to a survey](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/which-biglaw-firms-still-require-summer-associates-to-sign-mandatory-arbitration-agreements/) sent on behalf of T14 law schools, Venable said the incoming summer associate class would not have to sign mandatory arbitration agreements. However, according to an email obtained by PPP and sent only a few weeks after their survey response, the firm reversed course. The firmwide email, from partner G. Stewart Webb, Jr., announced a change in the firm’s arbitration position, stating, “The Firm has adopted a Mandatory Arbitration Provision that will be applicable to all Venable Personnel.”

[In a statement](http://www.pipelineparityproject.org/dumpvenable-for-its-deception/), the student activists are specifically calling out the “deceptive” actions of Venable:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Why did Venable intentionally deceive an entire class of incoming associates? What do they have to hide that has caused them to expand their use of forced arbitration at a time when their peer firms are renouncing its use? And what will Venable’s future employees say when they learn they have been lied to?

And it’s really the perception that law students have of being lied to about an incredibly important issue that is sticking in the craw of many. A Harvard Law 1L, Beth Feldstein said:

It’s unacceptable for any business to make its employees or customers sign away their legal rights. Venable publicly claimed to be doing the right thing, then turned around and deprived its workers of their day in court. We’re not going to let them off the hook.

Similar to their other dump Biglaw campaigns, PPP is encouraging law students not to interview with Venable and for student groups to not accept sponsorship from Venable until they do away with the mandatory arbitration provisions.

To address the lack of gender diversity in the upper echelons of the legal profession, top firms and corporations have bolstered family-friendly benefits, such as extended parental leave, flexible hours, hybrid or remote work, and childcare supplements. Of course, such benefits are far from universal, but there is no denying that parental benefits are now the standard. These benefits represent important progress in a profession traditionally marked by its long hours and high levels of stress. Indeed, the early years of an attorney’s career also tend to coincide with first-time motherhood for many.

Being a lawyer mom is hard, but incredibly rewarding.

Being a lawyer mom in waiting, on the other hand, is just plain hard.

One in eight couples will struggle with infertility. The majority of private health insurance plans do not cover IUI and IVF treatments. Even when pregnancy is achieved, one in four pregnancies end in miscarriage. One [survey](http://www.rmanj.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RMANJ_Infertility-In-America-SurveyReport-_04152015.pdf) found that 68% of people would consider a job change to ensure they have fertility coverage (this figure increases to 90% for those who have experienced fertility struggles). It is clear that these issues matter to employees.

Nevertheless, challenges associated with infertility, miscarriage, and adoption often remain out of sight and out of mind, making family-building difficulties a blind spot for employers in the legal profession and beyond. Managing partners and corporate leaders are typically past child-bearing age and were brought up in a time where such issues were “personal” and thus kept private. Sadly, silence and stigma surrounding these struggles can obscure the negative impact infertility has on an employee’s mental well-being and career progress.

I struggled with infertility in my late-20s. The heartache, isolation, anxiety, and financial strain of it seemed to touch nearly every aspect of my life during the two-and-a-half years it took to conceive our daughter. But I was one of the lucky ones. Not everyone’s infertility journey is as relatively short, or ends so happily. Some suffer multiple unsuccessful rounds of IVF, experience a failed private adoption, or go through multiple miscarriages. The physical and emotional toll of infertility is tremendous and, due to constraints of age and biology, often falls at a time when an attorney is simultaneously expected to prove her dedication and fitness for future partnership in the form of high billable hours.

Still, if infertility and adoption are so expensive, is it too big of an ask for the legal profession to better support employees’ pre-baby efforts while we press for more family-friendly policies post-baby? The family-building benefits offered by [Starbucks](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/starbucks-offers-in-vitro-fertilization-employees/) may suggest otherwise. In 2017, the ubiquitous coffee shop chain made headlines for providing its employees with $20,000 for IVF, including for its part-time baristas making $10,000 per year on average. Starbucks’ Family Expansion Reimbursement program also helps with adoption costs and recently expanded to assist with surrogacy, IUI, and fertility medications not covered by health insurance.

The reality is that supporting employees in their family-building endeavor does not need to be a costly proposition. In fact, it can be a boon for recruitment and retention — particularly for women in the profession. (Make no mistake, infertility is not only a female problem. But the physical burdens associated with IVF and miscarriage are predominantly borne by women.)

One simple way to start is by educating employees on the ways in which their employer’s current benefits can help. This can be as simple as including a “family-building” subsection within the employee handbook or benefits guide. This subsection can discuss options like using FSAs or HSAs for infertility treatments, even when health insurance will not cover these medical options. This subsection can also encourage the use of mental health benefits throughout the family-building process. Studies have shown the rates of depression in women struggling with infertility are similar to those in women battling cancer. Many employers already offer easy-to-access EAPs for counseling. During the pandemic, more counselors have begun offering remote sessions, making counseling more convenient and accessible than ever before.

Likewise, having specific leave policies in place for fertility treatments or bereavement days following a miscarriage can cost relatively little, but provide a priceless benefit by showing compassion and support to an employee during an indescribably trying time. Many employers state that they handle these delicate situations on a case-by-case basis, but this can be problematic. An unwritten policy runs the risk of inequitable application and makes an employee feel like they are asking for special treatment, instead of claiming a benefit that is already theirs for the taking when needed.

Needless to say, the most desirable family-building benefits do require some investment and employer buy-in — though perhaps not as much as employers might presume. For example, typical private health insurance plans do not cover IUI and IVF unless mandated by the state in which they work, and only about one third of U.S. states mandate any infertility coverage. And yet, in a [2021 survey](https://resolve.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-Fertility-Survey-Report.pdf) on fertility benefits, employers were asked if covering infertility benefits had resulted in a measurable, significant increase in medical plan cost; an astounding 97% said they have not experienced a significant cost increase, including employers that currently cover IVF. Likewise, in Massachusetts, where IVF coverage is mandated, a state-commissioned study found that the mandate adds as little as 54 cents to $4.44 per person per month.

That’s right! For less than the cost of one cup of coffee per person per month, your firm can be almost as family-friendly as Starbucks! In all seriousness, few things foster loyalty like making it possible for a mother’s child to exist. Supporting family-building efforts is a win-win for employers and employees alike.

Last week we reviewed the [evolution of law firm partnership economics](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/evolving-partnership-economics-the-equity-and-non-equity-models-are-starting-to-blur/), from the early days of a single-tier, all-equity partnership, to the emergence of a non-equity partner track, to the increasingly complex range of current partnership arrangements. We pointed out that as the economic models of partnership have grown increasingly complex and differentiated, so have the implications for current and potential partners.

This week we’re going to delve into those implications and challenge the traditional assumption that equity partnership is necessarily more attractive than non-equity partnership. On balance, equity partnership is likely still more rewarding in most cases. But for lawyers in certain situations, non-equity arrangements can have strong appeal.

Benefits of equity

Plenty of lawyers still aspire to become equity partners, and for good reason. Equity partnership slots are increasingly scarce, and in a profession that greatly values prestige and status, securing partnership shares is viewed as the pinnacle. The equity partners of a growing and profitable firm can expect to take home an outsized share of the financial rewards. Holding equity also gives a partner a stronger voice in firm governance in the form of voting rights.

Voting rights and partner compensation are often closely connected. For example, one factor that contributes to the equity partnership’s outsized compensation share is origination credit. It is common for firms to structure origination credit formulas to reward equity partners more than their non-equity colleagues. Senior lawyers often pursue equity partner opportunities to receive greater origination credit for their matters. Having input into how the formulas that award origination credit are constructed is an example of the potential value of voting rights.

Downsides of equity 

It’s easy to focus on the considerable benefits of becoming an equity partner, but there are also some real downsides that should not be overlooked. Most notably, the boost in status that comes with being named an equity partner is paired with a sizable financial hit in the form of a required capital contribution. This contribution is typically in the range of 25 to 35 percent of annual compensation, but at some firms it can amount to 50 percent or more. Regardless, it’s a lot of money to fork over to the firm, especially for lawyers who are still relatively early in their careers. And getting the capital contribution back may not be so simple. Under the rules of many partnership agreements, the firm is not obligated to return the money until years after an equity partner’s exit. Less significant, but still worth noting: equity partners must pay for their own benefits. 

Another factor to consider is that equity partners’ [voting rights are diminishing](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/02/27/the-death-of-the-law-firm-partnership-vote/) at many firms. Historically, a wide range of decisions—ranging from lateral partnership hires to office lease renewals—required a vote of the full equity partnership. As the size and geographic spread of partnerships has expanded, many firms have determined that it is more practical to delegate most decisions to a small committee or even to the sole discretion of the firm’s Chair. From an efficiency perspective, this is largely a positive development, but one side effect is reduced influence for equity partners who are not in top leadership posts. With respect to an increasingly broad set of issues, these partners are treated more like employees than owners.

When is non-equity best?

Weighing the benefits and downsides, non-equity partnership looks relatively appealing in some scenarios. The opportunity to avoid a substantial capital contribution can be a selling point to both the youngest and oldest partners. At the younger end, partners may not yet have built up enough of an investment portfolio to feel comfortable allocating such a large sum to an illiquid investment in the firm.

At the senior end of the spectrum, a departing equity partner who is contemplating one more short stint at another firm before retirement may be attracted to the simplicity of a non-equity arrangement. Partners in this situation have nothing to prove by again becoming equity partners. They may instead place more value on gaining the flexibility to invest in other ways the capital contribution that their prior firm will return to them. The opportunity to avoid assuming liability for the new firm’s debts is another benefit.

For partners in certain niche practices that do not entail a large standalone book of business, non-equity partnership can also make more sense. Practices such as Tax and Trusts & Estates often function as service providers to other practices in the firm, such that the firm’s origination credit formulas may not greatly reward the partners who specialize in these niche areas. A non-equity partnership arrangement that properly values these partners’ contributions may be the right answer.

A compromise approach: from non-equity to equity

For many partners, the best approach may be to split the difference by pursuing non-equity partnership opportunities that are likely to lead to equity partnership later. This enables the partner to delay the capital contribution hit, while preserving the opportunity to capitalize fully on client relationships as the partner’s book of business expands. Obviously, a partner hoping to go this route must first assess whether the firm offers a real and viable track from non-equity to equity. Where this pathway really does exist, it can offer the best of both worlds.

# Think You'll Have A Pleasant Experience As A Pregnant Biglaw Associate? Think Again.

[A] friend from work texted, “I have something to tell you.” She had overheard the partner on the phone the night before. “He said you flaked again for some pregnancy-related excuse.”

The words stung like finding out from a friend that my boyfriend had been cheating on me. I had given so much of myself, my time, my sweat, my tears and my pregnancy to this man. But the second I expected some basic human consideration, I was thrown away like a dirty diaper. If I couldn’t give them everything, I was nothing. I had fallen into the stereotype of a woman whose priorities had shifted and my baby hadn’t even been born.

I knew there was no choice. I had to leave.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
— Jenny Leon, a former Biglaw associate, describing the [stressful work environment that she reportedly endured during her pregnancy](https://www.scarymommy.com/pregnancy-discrimination-pandemic/), where she says she often found herself “being constantly berated by egomaniacs.” One night, as she contemplated going to the hospital because she was spotting at 35 weeks pregnant, a partner called, shouted at her, and allegedly seemed “annoyed” that she had to attend to what she believed was a medical emergency. It was then that she knew she could no longer work at the firm. “I left my law firm after being discriminated against during my pregnancy. This experience is not unique,” she claims in an op-ed at [Scary Mommy](https://www.scarymommy.com/pregnancy-discrimination-pandemic/).

# Biglaw Behemoth Reups Its Lease -- What Does This Tell Us About The Market?
## No new digs for this firm.

It’s always possible that Sidley Austin just really loves its existing office space and doesn’t want the hassle of moving. After all who wants the headache of having to thank all those movers? Not Sidley, [that’s for damn sure](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/biglaw-partner-stop-wasting-my-life-with-your-thank-yous/). But after a rumored search for a new home, the decision to remain in their existing offices is an enticing invitation to read some tea leaves.

Sidley is staying in its 575,000 square foot space at 1 S. Dearborn St. As [Crain’s reports](http://www.chicagobusiness.com/realestate/20161221/CRED03/161229967/chicago-law-firm-sidley-austin-renews-loop-lease), the deal locks down Sidley as the building’s primary tenant for an unspecified number of years to come.

In a statement from the firm:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“We have renewed our lease at One South Dearborn after conducting a thorough evaluation of our space needs,” Larry Barden, Sidley Austin Management Committee chair, said in the statement from Hines. “Staying in this prime Chicago Loop location makes sense for us from a business connectivity standpoint. With a few design renovations to leverage unused space for collaborative areas and maximize the amount of natural light, our modern, efficient workspace will allow us to continue to attract and retain talented professionals.”

So one interpretation of this could be that Sidley isn’t expecting a massive expansion in headcount any time soon. That’s probably not a revelation given the [stagnant nature of the legal market](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/the-legal-industry-is-still-on-life-support/), but here’s concrete proof that firms aren’t giddy about making big, bold changes right now.

Hopefully Sidley attorneys are happy with their current home.

# Yes, You Still Need To Check Your Zoom Name Before Logging In
## You'd think after a year of this, people would be better at it.

Joe and Kathryn discuss the latest legal Zoom fail as a defendant flirts with contempt after his sister changed his Zoom moniker to some sort of sci-fi sex machine. The pair also talk about Ropes & Gray’s decision to transition to a three-day office work week and the latest insulting, dubious rant from the National Conference of Bar Examiners declaring that poor test results for minority applicants is… probably because minorities aren’t cut out to be lawyers in the first place. Yikes!

I’ve posted a lot about Biglaw — the leisurely lifestyle, the sense of freedom and autonomy, the back-slapping camaraderie (isn’t your Biglaw firm like that?), and the … (wait … umm, there was one more minor thing), oh yeah … the money.

But still — it was not for me.  I found, and I’ll freely admit that some people do not share my view, that I was missing something at Biglaw.  Maybe I’m just a contrarian, but the free and easy lifestyle of Biglaw (okay, fine — the money) only goes so far.

So what was I missing that Biglaw, despite its vain efforts to make me a happy camper, could not provide?

A nap?  Sweat pants?  No alarm clock?  No subway?

Yeah, sure.  When I left Biglaw for remote lawyering at my present gig at a “cloud-based” firm, I got all of these and more … Sure, naps when I want them, and sweat pants all day.

But … something was missing.

Yes, there are aspects of working from home for a cloud-based firm that I didn’t foresee.  I have no one watching over me with a stop watch, there’s no screaming and hair-pulling in the hallway, and there are no panicky colleagues sweating on my desk.  Yes, I know — why did I make this move?

So to you, former comrades, I must provide the five reasons why some people might want to stay where they are in their cozy 8 x 10 office.  For some people, the grass isn’t always greener, so you should know what you’re getting into before you leave Biglaw.

1) The vital energy and thrill at Biglaw — generated by the yelling, the fighting, the threats and teeth-gnashing that occur when a client wants a document in, say, one hour, and let no attorney stand in its way — no longer exists.  As the work is serially passed downstream from senior partner to junior partner to senior associate to junior associate, it gathers speed and force (isn’t that one of Newton’s Laws?), as well as anxiety and panic (and, let’s not forget angst, much angst!!) until someone has a stroke!

But what power that rolling stone has … bowling over all in its path!  And the anonymous junior associate — what virtue and altruism shown in sublimating his/her very personhood to the betterment of … the senior partner!  That’s teamwork!  That’s a microcosm of the perfect society!

Boy, oh boy — the good old days!  Who doesn’t want to sacrifice their health for a paycheck?!

2) Without the constant cajoling and threats to “BILL MORE!” and the warnings that if your hours fall below 2,400 hours, the $1,000 bonus would not be given, or you could be canned, what would be the incentive to work at all?

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Clients?  Phooey.  It’s the whip that’s motivating!  And face it, Biglawyers: you not only get used to the whip, but (can you say “Stockholm Syndrome”?) eventually you like it and it becomes you.  Right?

Ah, the fear and anxiety — it’s the necessary fuel to lawyering!

3) If you were to leave Biglaw, the wonderous mysteries of compensation would no longer enthrall you every year, and how would you replace that thrill? I remember how we all chewed our fingers to see what the Compensation Committee had decided about our next year’s comp.  Did we work hard enough, bill enough, run the treadmill fast enough?  Did we originate enough business?  Did we do better than the guy in the next office, and how did we stack up against our counterparts in other offices of the firm?

And, most important, did we kiss up to the right people — at the right times?   Watching a thriller or reading a riveting detective novel could not be more exciting or chilling!

Without all of the measuring of input, output, WATY, BATY, realization rate, and whatever metric is used to monetize us, and comparing these to last year and projecting them through 2025 and magically arriving at a single number which will define us … well, what would law life be?

Now I have too much spare time for working out, day dreaming, and thinking about my family and my life — oy vey.

4) There’s the camaraderie and fun at the office. If you work from home, or wherever you feel like working, won’t you miss the elevator chatter and staring at your shoes until you reach your floor?  Saying “good morning” every morning to everyone on the corridor?  And saying a cheerful “Hi!” to the managing partner (as you slink back into your cell) when s/he makes the rounds at 7 a.m. and/or 8 p.m. to see who’s working and billing? 

And playing the fun game of hide-and-seek by devising creative ways to be scarce on Friday afternoon?

Won’t you miss it?

Confess it — you will.  Reading a book at home is no substitute for sharing harrowing partner experiences with your Biglaw colleagues.  And long lunches with friends, or … yes, a nap!  Nah, doesn’t stack up to that gourmet dinner delivered RIGHT TO YOUR DESK!

5) Finally, to women Biglawyers: you make up 46% of associates (although only 22% of partners), but despite these numbers, Biglaw still thinks of you as “the secretary.” And you still get eyed up and down by the senior partner, and get comments on your appearance.  Won’t you miss that?

Takeaway

So, my former comrades, I say to you — if you’ll miss these five things, then maybe Biglaw is a good fit for you.  But the rest of us will leave those troubles behind.  Sigh.

“I would expect to see some very large transactions this year simply because all the stars have aligned,” Cohen said. “Private equity firms are flush with new capital commitments, they’ve seen some very large amounts of funds raised in the past 12 months and credit markets are as bold and resilient as we’ve seen in a long time,” he said.

Notable deals announced for 2018 include:

* Madison Square Garden’s ludicrous policy banning all attorneys adverse to the venue — and any entity with a tangential relationship to the venue — is still illegal as to non-sports events, but the appellate court lifted the injunction, deciding that banned lawyers can only recover monetary damages. So we’re most likely going to expand the population of adverse lawyers soon. [[Law360](https://www.law360.com/newyork/articles/1591091)]

* Tougher rules announced for Supreme Court justices and other federal judges getting free junkets. Or, in more practical terms, “tougher rules announced for other federal judges” because the Supreme Court has shown exactly zero interest in being bound by rules.

# Inside Jones Day's $210,000 Myth
## $210,000 is not what you think it is.

Black box compensation systems remain a thumb in the eye of transparency efforts designed to give associates (or potential associates) the information they need to make intelligent decisions about the best place for them to work. But they persist. And no Biglaw firm is more committed to the secretive model than Jones Day.

And that’s why Above the Law is[ launching an effort](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/jones-day-raises-salaries-but-remains-a-black-box/) to crack open the firm’s black box compensation model, [as we did in 2016](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/?rf=1) after the market raised salaries. (We are still collecting data for that, so please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Jones%20Day) or text us 646-820-8477 with any and all information you have about your compensation or comp for other associates you know. Providing us with your year, a sense of your hours — low: >1800, average: 1800-2000, high: 2000+ — and salary range is very, very useful.)

One thing that’s come up repeatedly in our efforts is folks pointing out that Jones Day pays “above” market for firs-year associates (a [recent announcement](https://www.jonesday.com/en/careers/locations/united-states?tab=compensationandbenefits) puts that number at $210,000). One hopeful associate at a rival firm even inquired if this would signal another round of Biglaw raises. But, unfortunately for Jones Day associates (and others hoping for an even bigger raise), that’s not at all what it means.

See, other firms are ahead in overall compensation — by a lot. Jones Day doesn’t do bonuses, so that “above” market number includes all bonuses given out at other firms. So, between special bonuses (valued at $12,000 for first-year associates) and [year-end bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/biglaw-bonus-chart-2020/) (anticipated to be at least as big as last year’s bonuses, which clocked in at $15,000 for first-years), well, you can see who is ahead. It doesn’t take an advanced degree in mathematics to determine $5,000 is not much compared to $27,000.

This weird myth of JD being ahead on compensation is exactly why we want to shine some light on their compensation. So, Jones Day associates [hit us up](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Jones%20Day), we know everyone is curious about what really goes on at the firm.

# A Spooky Saga: Protect Human Rights Or Face Gunna’s Revenge
## Never underestimate the power of a ghost's attachment to their kitchenware or a lawyer's ability to make the world a better place!

Lawyers are essential to preserving democracy, upholding the rule of law, and creating a more just society. The spooky Saga of Gunna serves as a cautionary tale to remind us to always remember that people matter most. 

The medieval tale grew around [Gunnuhver Hot Springs](https://icelandtravelguide.is/locations/gunnuhver/), an area of highly active steam vents, lava fields, and the largest boiling mud pool in Iceland. According to local legend, an old witch, Gunna, lived near the spring on land owned by a lawyer, Vilhjalmur Jonsson. 

When Gunna failed to pay rent, Jonsson confiscated her most-prized possession: her beloved cooking pot. Enraged, Gunna starved herself to death.

Strange occurrences during Gunna’s funeral unnerved the community. The next day, they discovered Jonsson’s dead body, battered and broken — a sure sign of Gunna’s ghostly vengeance! Her restless spirit plagued the area until a clever priest banished her into the hot springs for eternity. 

Never underestimate the power of a ghost’s attachment to their kitchenware! 

People Need Lawyers To Protect Their Rights

Let’s take a step back and consider Gunna’s relevance today. Witch or not, Gunna wasn’t given a chance to be heard, like many people whose voices are excluded from public discourse today. She didn’t pay rent, but Gunna still had rights that needed to be protected.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The one person with the expertise to protect Gunna’s rights stole her property. Jonsson paid the ultimate price for his pot pilfering, a stark reminder that individuals who feel wronged by nefarious actors can have little to no legal recourse without a lawyer’s legal assistance. 

Lawyers have a genuinely awesome responsibility to promote justice, champion human rights, and ensure that everyone’s voice is heard. We’re bound to maintain the rule of law, often by setting up systems that lay the groundwork for more fair and equitable communities and businesses and implementing and enforcing solutions to protect the rights of all. 

Yet, many people still cannot afford legal representation. Systemic inequalities, discrimination, and socioeconomic biases can impact a lawyer’s ability to effectively advocate for clients. Courts are overburdened, and client interests don’t always neatly align with broader considerations of justice and fairness. 

Lawyers often must make difficult decisions in challenging circumstances. There tend to be no ideal solutions, and consequences can affect the lives of many. 

But there is also much to celebrate as today, lawyers are embracing technology as a powerful instrument in their fight for a more just world.

Technology Is A Powerful Tool For Protecting People’s Rights

By increasingly leveraging automation, lawyers can serve more people more efficiently. Data-driven AI tools aid decision-making and bring transparency to legal processes, paving the path for the public to build trust in the legal system.

Technology helps lawyers target specific goals and issues with enhanced precision and accuracy. With clarity comes the opportunity to use resources more efficiently, collaborate more effectively, and drive positive change as we advance into a more informed and cooperative future. Lawyers who seize the opportunities technology offers can take the lead and continue to innovate to meet evolving client needs.  

Happy Halloween!

By advocating for justice and strong legal frameworks for society to flourish, lawyers can help make the world a better place. As arbiters of a more peaceful society, we can also help prevent ill will (and potential acts of retribution) against others. Remember Gunna’s story and protect people’s rights with all your might, for if you don’t, well, let’s just say you don’t want to face the wrath of a vengeful ghost armed with a cooking pot. Stay safe this Halloween, and do your best to avoid supernatural encounters with Gunna!

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs.

# Morning Docket: 07.19.16
## * It's been exactly two years since FSU Law Professor Dan Markel was killed in an alleged murder-for-hire plot. He was locked in child-custody litigation with his ex-wife, Wendi Adelson, until the time of his death, and it is that litigation that is the suspected motive for his violent slaying. The Adelsons' attorney suggests instead that perhaps some FSU students ""had it in for [their] law professor."" [[Sun Sentinel](http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-fsu-slain-professor-divorce-20160714-story.html)] * In an effort to ensure criminal defendants receive competent representation, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) has introduced the Clarence Gideon Full Access to Justice Act, which would create the Defender Office for Supreme Court Advocacy. Per Justice Elena Kagan, a program like this would be an ""enormous help to the system."" [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/a-defender-office-for-supreme-court-advocacy/)] * Husch Blackwell and Whyte Hirschboeck Dudek have officially completed their merger, and the combined firm, which will continue to be known as Husch Blackwell, has more than 700 lawyers. Now that the books are closed on the merger, maybe the firm will have time bring its associate salaries to market -- or not. [[Journal Sentinel](http://www.jsonline.com/business/law-firm-combination-completed-b99763679z1-387317771.html)] * The recent outcome of the Microsoft data privacy case is a great example of what can happen when the law can no longer keep up with technology.

# Why The First Day At A New Job Matters

Six years ago (heaven help me), I wrote in this space about the [on-boarding process](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/09/inside-straight-the-on-boarding-process/).  At corporations, new hires frequently show up for work and can’t do anything.  They don’t have a telephone, a computer, a pencil, or a pad of paper — it’s as though no one expected them to show up at the office.

I bemoaned that situation.

If you hire good people, you can’t immediately make them think that no one cares if they do any work.  That projects the wrong image, and it causes employees to become lazy.

Something weird happened after I wrote that column.

It turned out that I was right.

Folks are now studying the on-boarding process, and it turns out that it matters.

Dramatically more people stay with a company if they have a good on-boarding process.  (I’ve seen all kinds of[numbers for this on the web](http://blog.octanner.com/editor-picks/an-onboarding-checklist-for-success-infographic), but many sources seem to agree that new employees are 50 to 60 percent more likely to stay with a company for several years if the employees are treated right early on.)

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
What can you do to improve the on-boarding process?

There are the basics, of course:  Have someone greet the new employee.  Have someone escort the new employee around the floor, to show where the paper clips are and introduce the new employee to co-workers.  Take the new employee to lunch on the first day.  Announce that a new person has been hired, so existing employees expect to see a new face on the floor and know to introduce themselves.

There are the slightly more sophisticated things:  Create a first day agenda that tells new people what they’re doing, summarizes what they need to know, and (if you’re couth) includes a first day gift.  Host some events at which new people get to know each other.  (Law firms with large entering classes tend to do these things for people entering as a group.  But law firms don’t do nearly as well with lateral associates or partners, who arrive at a firm singly or in very small groups.  It’s the same for corporations:  When a new class of employees arrive, corporations tend not to perform too badly.  But when single employees arrive, the on-boarding experience falls way off.)  Explain to the new hire who reports to whom within the organization, so the new person begins to understand the ropes.

Help the new person understand the company’s jargon.  Prepare a short note that explains whether, at your joint, “DC” refers to the District of Columbia, a defined contribution plan, or the disclosure committee.  Is “PC” more likely to refer to a personal computer, property and casualty insurance, or information that’s personal and confidential?  (Is it politically correct to ask that question?)  All those endless acronyms are initially awfully hard to follow; take pity. 

(After the new employee has been around for five years, the employee will still encounter consultants who say they plan to “converge the optimization levers.”  That’s not a problem with the employee; fire the consultant.)

If you’re thinking a little harder, consider more advanced stuff:  Have a “one-stop shopping” online portal that gives employees links to everything they’re likely to need.  Create a small committee of people responsible for making sure the on-boarding experience remains consistently top-notch.  (If no one’s responsible for watching the process, the process will deteriorate.)  If you can afford it, survey both managers and new employees about the on-boarding experience.  Identify the glitches, and make sure the person who’s joining the company reacts the same way as the manager.

Work hard to make new employees feel a part of your organization.  At law firms, new lawyers who understand the joint can better cross-sell and increase profitability.  New non-lawyers can help the place run more effectively.  The same holds true for corporations.

Think about day one; it sets the stage for days two through forever.

# World’s Wealthiest Law Firm Announces Colossal Partner Class
## With more than 150 new partners, how many of them will enter the firm’s equity ranks?

There’s no denying that Kirkland & Ellis is one the nation’s greatest law firms. Not only does the firm offer a compelling combination of prestige, profitability, and pay (including [special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/kirkland-special-bonus-2021/), even for non-share partners), but now it’s once again shattering the market on partners.

Bigger is apparently better at Kirkland, because late last week, the firm announced its largest-ever partner class. We’re not exaggerating when we say this class is huge. This year, the firm welcomed a partner class of 151, up from 2020’s record class of 145, 2019’s class of 141, 2018’s class of 122, and 2017’s class of 97.

But how many of these new partners will enter the firm’s equity ranks? Last year, the firm had 476 equity partners and 682 nonequity partners. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/10/01/kirkland-promotes-151-to-partner-topping-last-years-record/) has some information on the firm’s successes throughout the pandemic:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
With talent at an all-time premium, Kirkland has set the pace in multiple respects, emerging as [a top competitor](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/04/28/kirkland-emerges-as-top-competitor-in-associate-talent-battle/) for associate bonuses and incentives and [outpacing most of Big Law](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/08/09/kirkland-sets-pace-in-a-highly-active-associate-market/) in associate laterals in and out. …

Kirkland’s overall lawyer head count increased by 4.9% last year, while its gross revenue increased by about 16.3% to $4.83 billion, and its profits [per partner] grew more than 19%, to about $6.2 million, [according to American Lawyer reporting](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/04/09/kirkland-set-to-stay-on-top-after-double-digit-revenue-and-profit-gains-405-80183/), as the firm benefited from a mergers and acquisitions and private equity comeback as well as a surge in restructuring matters.

As far as diversity is concerned, Kirkland opted not to show photos of its [new partnership class](https://www.kirkland.com/news/press-release/2021/10/kirkland-announces-new-partners), but from what we can tell, once again, the firm’s new partners are once again looking mighty male and mighty white.

It continues to be important for firms to know that these subjects won’t go unnoticed. Diversity and inclusion matter — to a firm’s current lawyers, to potential recruits, and perhaps most importantly, to clients.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Biglaw Firm Unexpectedly Offers Bonuses That Were Deferred Under COVID Cuts
## Exciting news!

The coronavirus crisis has ravaged Biglaw firms, with salary cuts, furloughs, and layoffs galore. Some firms are delaying or reducing bonuses, and others are eliminating bonuses (and salary increases) entirely this year. Given the economic fallout of the pandemic, it seemed unlikely that any firm would be offering previously scheduled bonus payouts — especially firms that had already announced a veritable pu pu platter of austerity measures.

But that’s exactly what’s happening.

Sources tell us that earlier this month, Husch Blackwell — a firm that originally [slashed equity partner draws](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/husch-partner-cuts/) by 15 percent and reduced salaries for all managing directors and c-level executives by 10 percent before later cutting compensation for all income partners by 10 percent and implementing a round of [rightsizing measures for lawyers and staff](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/husch-layoffs/) (ranging from job terminations and furloughs to salary reductions, transitions to less-than-fulltime status, early retirements, and deferrals) — paid out a special associate bonus that was supposed to be deferred until January 2021 under the auspices of the firm’s COVID cuts.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
In a brief memo about the firm’s associate client development bonus (i.e., associates’ cut of work they bring in), [Dean Boeschen](https://www.huschblackwell.com/professionals/dean-boeschen), Husch Blackwell’s chief growth officer, had this encouraging message for associates: “Thank you for all of your hard work and efforts over the last few months. Your initiative and follow through truly helps us stand above the competition.” As with almost all other firms that have partially rolled back their austerity measures, things must be going better than expected over at Husch Blackwell. That memo is available on the next page.

Congratulations to all associates at the firm who received their client development bonuses much earlier than expected.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm announces any type of bonus payment for associates, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonuses) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonuses”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks for all of your help!

# Many Biglaw Firms Are Horrible At Managing Workflow

Many prior articles on Above the Law have discussed how overworked Biglaw associates are, and how Biglaw firms typically expect their associates to bill an insane number of hours.  And it is true that in exchange for making huge sums of money, Biglaw associates usually need to work their tails off to generate revenue for their firms.  However, many Biglaw firms are not efficient in how they manage their workflow, and this could impact how efficient these shops are at making money.

As many attorneys both inside and outside of Biglaw know, work is often informally distributed at Biglaw shops.  Indeed, there is typically no centralized system for doling out work at many Biglaw firms, and since Biglaw associates do not usually have ownership over cases, they typically serve at the whims of partners who have work to hand out.  This system can lead to a variety of perverse and inefficient ends.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
For one, associates looking for work typically need to ask partners for additional projects, which can sometimes be a humiliating experience.  Indeed, I remember one time, I hit a dry spell of work to complete as a Biglaw associate.  I literally had to go door to door like a beggar asking for people to give me assignments.  Since I had to meet billable-hour targets, as more time passed, I definitely got more desperate when asking for work.  I also felt that the people I asked for work were wondering why I was so slow, and considered that it might be because of poor work product.  This in turn made me hesitant to ask for more work, since I didn’t want to have the perception that no one wanted to work with me.

In addition, the process of doling out work at many Biglaw shops can increase the “brown-nose” culture of those firms.  Of course, Biglaw associates ordinarily need to “kiss the ring” quite a deal, since they owe their big paychecks and their quality of life to the partners.  However, when work is informally doled out, associates are encouraged to further ingratiate themselves to the partners so that they can be considered if there is the chance to complete work.  This can create an enormous amount of pressure at firm social events, since associates are not focusing on having a good time, but on joining conversation circles with leading partners and currying favor with the “brass.”

Informally doling out work can also create tension among associates themselves.  Since associates are competing for assignments, they might view each other with hostility rather than cordiality.  Indeed, while working at a Biglaw shop, I heard about an associate lying about another associate’s workload so the other lawyer could get the chance to work on a given assignment.  Furthermore, informally doling out work might mean that some associates are slammed with assignments and others have little to do.  This is not only inefficient, but might create tension among associates, since no one wants to be overworked when a colleague doesn’t have enough to do.

Of course, Biglaw firms can adopt systems that more efficiently handle their workflow.  Perhaps the most efficient workflow system I ever saw was when I was a summer associate in Biglaw.  For the summer program, my firm allowed partners to upload assignments for summer associates onto an online platform.  Once the project was submitted, the next available summer associate would get an email with details about the project, and they would complete the assignment.  After the project was finished, the referring attorney would get an email to complete an evaluation of the summer associate’s work, and, the summer associate would get an additional project.  This system ensured that everyone had projects to complete, and even offered the benefit of real-time evaluations.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
At other firms at which I worked, attorneys were assigned a set number of cases (usually 25-40) and the associates were primarily responsible for these matters.  The responsible attorney handled everything regarding those cases, including [depositions, motions, and discovery](https://www.rothmanlawyer.com/common-motions-filed-during-litigation/).  If that attorney ever needed work, they would just take out a file and complete tasks related to their cases.  Of course, this system made it difficult to pawn off assignments on other people if an attorney was overloaded with work, but this process ensured that attorneys rarely had little to do.

I understand why many Biglaw firms will never institute a more efficient workflow system.  Many Biglaw firms like informal distributions of work, since partners often have a preference for associates they like to handle certain types of projects.  In addition, part of the Biglaw system involves well-liked associates receiving tons of work and meeting expectations [while underperforming associates get less work and move closer to the door](https://www.rothmanlawyer.com/limitations-on-the-right-to-fire-employees/).  In addition, Biglaw firms are usually loathe to give associates any real responsibilities, and would rather force-feed projects to their underlings as a way of retaining control over cases.

However, begging for work can have a huge emotional toll on associates and can create perverse incentives for attorneys.  Perhaps more importantly for partners, Biglaw firms could probably make even more money if they more efficiently managed their workflow.

# Another Day, Another Transatlantic Biglaw Merger To Create A 1600-Lawyer Megafirm
## It's been less than a week since the last one, so let's have another Biglaw merger.

Here’s a picture of a merger even though this is a story about a merger between two female managing partners because stock images are convinced only white men do business.

Bryan Cave and Berwin Leighton Paisner have joined forces to form Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner, which obviously sucks for old Berwin but should brighten the day of the joint firm’s current lawyers, who will now boast the “fourth-largest real estate practice among law firms.”

Before getting into what this means for the new firm, it’s worth pointing out that this is a good sign for real estate generally. Berwin Leighton Paisner took some flack in 2016 for [freezing junior attorney salaries](https://www.legalcheek.com/firm/berwin-leighton-paisner/) over fears that Brexit would disrupt the firm’s core high-end commercial property work. They ultimately loosened up when the market didn’t suffer as badly as expected. But Brexit still impacted the firm in a significant way — partner Chris Bryant wrote [Brexit: The Musical](https://www.legalcheek.com/2017/09/i-watched-brexit-the-musical-at-blps-office-and-it-was-actually-really-great/).

When you think about it, this merger resembles the [Hunton & Williams and Andrews Kurth deal](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/biglaw-merger-creates-new-1000-lawyer-firm/), finalized less than a week ago. While Hunton Andrews Kurth built its merger around an opportunity to combine an oil and gas practice with a thriving utilities practice, Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner seems focused on a globally minded real estate practice.

In that way, this deal makes a lot more sense than the two firms’ prior efforts to get hitched. Bryan Cave sniffed around Dickstein Shapiro and Squire, Sanders & Dempsey in the past. Meanwhile, Berwin Leighton Paisner was racing to the altar with Greenberg Traurig before that fell through.

And it makes sense for the partners involved too. From [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2018/02/26/bryan-cave-blp-partners-approve-transatlantic-merger/):

both firms have broadly similar profits per partner, with BLP posting PPP of £630,000 ($836,876) for fiscal 2016-17 and Bryan Cave having a similar figure of $865,000 (£655,584) for 2016.

Looks pretty good. Roy Strom has more on what this means for the legal landscape:

A firm with $900 million in gross revenue last year would have ranked No. 37 in the most recent Am Law 100 list and No. 44 in the Global 100 rankings, directly between McDermott Will & Emery and Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy in both tables. Bryan Cave, whose 2017 financial results have not yet been disclosed, reported $608 million in gross revenue for 2016. BLP, meanwhile, took in £272 million ($361.3 million) in gross revenue during fiscal 2016-17.

With mergers continuing at a breakneck pace, it’s going to be interesting to see that Am Law 100 next year. I wonder how many names will match the 2015 list?

This is also a merger between two firms helmed by women, a fact that one hopes will be looked at as a curious non-sequitur by readers 20 years from now. Maybe by then, there will be better stock images to use.

Jeffrey Standen

If you’re a high-profile man accused of sexual harassment or other inappropriate conduct, what’s your next move? It turns out resignation might be the best move.

We’ve documented how Judge Alex Kozinski’s resignation from the Ninth Circuit [halted the investigation into the allegations against him](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/case-closed-judge-kozinskis-retirement-stops-inquiry-into-his-behavior/), and may have been [the easy way out](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/the-biglaw-partner-that-called-out-judge-kozinski/). Now comes the story of another high-profile man — this time a law dean — who resigned from his position in the face of misconduct allegations. The twist in this case is that the man in question, [Jeffrey Standen](https://chaselaw.nku.edu/faculty/full-time-faculty-bios/JeffreyStanden.html), will stay on at Northern Kentucky University Law School as a professor — and the highest paid one, at that.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

As[ reported by](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/your-watchdog/2018/02/20/northern-kentucky-law-dean-jeffrey-standen-resigns-after-3-women-complain-then-stays-professor/318802002/) the Cincinnati Enquirer, multiple women who worked for Standen complained about his behavior, saying he created an uncomfortable work environment by making them bend over or otherwise display themselves and commenting on their appearance:

The full-time employee reported that Standen made her stand on a table while wearing a dress to reach an air vent, and then hold on to his belt loop while he did the same.

One of the student workers reported Standen would drop things and make her pick them up and made her rearrange items on the bottom and top shelves of a bookcase repeatedly “and he watched me the whole time.”

That same woman said Standen made repeated requests for a hug on her last day and for her to try on a T-shirt in front of him. She also said he previously tried several times to set her up with his son on a date.

Standen “made me uncomfortable to the point that all my friends could tell when I had finished a shift there because of my mood,” she wrote.

“Dean Standen also made comments about my physical appearance that went past the norm,” the complaint stated. “If I didn’t wear makeup or dress up he would ask if I was sick then proceed to be measurably more condescending and cold than usual.”

All three reported that he routinely commented on their mode of dress.

“I often found that times that us girls wore dresses, skirts, or leggings seemed to be when he asked to do things in his office like arrange his bookshelves or stand on chairs to fix his vent,” the third woman, a former student, wrote in her complaint.

Staten denied the allegations saying:

“I am demanding of my co-workers, much as I am of myself,” Standen wrote. “I was informed by university officials that it was the perception of hostility, and not hostility itself, that led to complaints. At no time did I ever intentionally act with anger toward my co-workers.”

Northern Kentucky conducted an investigation into the allegations and found that while Standen violated Northern Kentucky University’s Values and Ethical Responsibilities Policy, his actions were not sexual misconduct. The report found “sufficient evidence to support a finding of an unhealthy culture of fear, intimidation and bullying.” And a “[p]erception created by Dean that he does not respect employees and treats them with belittling and demeaning actions or statements, especially women.”

Standen was allowed to resign from his position for “personal reasons.” He told the Enquirer, “My decision to resign had nothing to do with the investigation or the complaints. My reasons are personal and I shall leave them as such.”

After he resigned, the NKU Provost Sue Ott Rowlands offered him a position as a professor at the law school. (The school said it is policy to allow deans to stay at the university as professor when they resign.) That would mean a 15 percent pay cut, but still make Standen the highest paid professor making nearly $222,000 a year. He accepted the position.

The university’s Board of Regents says it is “very comfortable” with this result:

Rich Boehne, chairman of NKU’s Board of Regents, said the board stands by the final outcome.

“This started with some rumors, and then the university folks proactively reached out to those potentially involved and moved very quickly to look into this,” Boehne said. “The board is very comfortable with the investigation and the conclusion reached and how they handled it from there as they followed the school’s policy and this was not just an arbitrary decision.”

So I guess students should just take it on faith that Standen will not foster a similar environment of “fear, intimidation and bullying” in a classroom. And women should just hope he won’t make any “belittling and demeaning actions or statements,” because it sure doesn’t look like the school is doing much to make sure it doesn’t happen.

It’s the day before Thanksgiving, and I’m sure there are lots of you reading this that are ready to be done with work already. If that’s you, Above the Law has you covered with the latest in Biglaw bonus news to distract you as the minutes count down to the end of the day.

Fried Frank — a firm ranked 60th on the AmLaw 100 with $780,300,000 in gross revenue in 2020 — is the latest to get in on the new year-end bonus scale. The lockstep bonuses, which are up 15 percent over last year’s bonuses, are given on the below schedule:

Plus associates and counsel are eligible for a “premium” on top of these bonus amounts, which can up the bonus payout between $2,250 – $30,000. As noted in the firm’s memo, “an associate in the class of 2014 is eligible to receive a maximum year-end bonus of $145,000.” And remember, all this largesse is in addition to the previously announced special bonuses. Niiiiiice. It’s becoming[ increasingly](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/boies-match/) [common](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/cadwalader-bonus-2021/) for firms to offer some additional bonus money on top of the traditional lockstep amount. Given the[ super busy](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/biglaws-throwing-around-500000-signing-bonuses-in-red-hot-lateral-market/) [lateral market](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/is-skadden-arps-handing-out-retention-bonuses-to-only-some-associates/), it’s unsurprising that those associates that are particularly valuable are being given a little (or a lot) extra.

All bonuses will be paid on or before December 31st. You can read the full memo on the [next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/fried-frank-bonus/2/)

Congratulations to associates on the generous bonuses!

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

In today’s digital landscape, your personal brand matters more than ever, and lawyers are not immune from having one. Whether you own a law firm, work in Biglaw, or serve as a corporate counsel, your unique value, passion, and the work you do should be easily recognizable. In fact, the very first place companies, law firms, and clients venture to search for you is on Google. Not sure where to begin building your personal brand? Here are some tips to get you started.

Build Your Social Media Presence

With social media being the foundation for how we network, engage, and converse with our target audience, it’s incumbent upon us to showcase our professional image and business value. Having a distinct online presence is key, especially a robust [LinkedIn profile](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/4-changes-to-make-to-your-linkedin-profile-that-will-enhance-your-legal-skills-and-visibility/) that gets you seen and noticed.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Before you launch your brand on LinkedIn, first determine what your unique value is to the outside world and your target audience. Ask yourself the following questions: What makes you different? What’s your practice area? What are you an expert in? What are you most passionate about? What problems do you solve for your clients?

In your LinkedIn profile, consider the wide range of people you may connect with, since you want your profile to speak to a broad audience. Be sure to include your contact details, and complete all pertinent sections: headline, summary (“about”), experience, education, and skills. Don’t overlook the “featured” section, which is great for linking your law firm’s bio, a recent blog post or article you’ve authored, an upcoming speaking engagement, or even a podcast interview.

Tell Your Story And Engage

Whether you believe it or not, your hobbies, struggles, and other facets of your career are part of your story and personal brand. They can form the impetus to a new connection, a new client, a new conversation, or even a written story behind your “why.” Let me give you a real-world example. I ran the New York City Marathon in 2011. I am not an athlete by any means. I was just an average woman with health struggles who had a dream to run a marathon and finish it.

I entered the lottery, got in, ran the race injured, and crossed the finish line. One of my first [HuffPost articles](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-running-a-marathon-taught-me-to-chase-my-career_b_5797b60de4b0b3e2427d1d8d) chronicled how it led me to chase my long-time dreams of leaving law to be a professional writer. That article was promoted by the editors and led to a surge of outreach once I shared it on social media. The moral here: reflect on your passions, talents, and hobbies — look for the ones that can tell a story and connect a reader with you.

When it comes to posting content on LinkedIn, I’m a proponent of publishing content off LinkedIn (via a blog or article), and then sharing it on LinkedIn — whether through a link to your post, or via a comment in your post. Outside content is part of a long-term strategy that will continue to remain searchable on Google. Tell your story and have a way for people to connect with you or link back to you. Otherwise, you are just waiting for someone to “click” on a long-form LinkedIn post without sending them to your firm’s website, other published media, or the link to the event you want them to register to attend.

Remember that building a personal brand takes time. Building an audience takes time. Building your legal career or law firm takes time. However, all of it circles back to your story and brand. Your personal brand is just that — personal. Start thinking about how you can share that story through digital content.

# World's Largest Law Firm Splitting Up
## Dentons and Dacheng part ways as Chinese government regulations stiffen.
By [Joe Patrice](https://abovethelaw.com/author/joe-patrice/)

Shares[](https://twitter.com/share?url=https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/dentons-dacheng-break-up/&text=World’s%20Largest%20Law%20Firm%20Splitting%20Up)[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/dentons-dacheng-break-up/&display=popup&ref=plugin&src=share_button)[](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/dentons-dacheng-break-up/)[](javascript:void(""#ea-share-count-email""))
Dentons and Dacheng got together back in 2015 to create the world’s largest law firm with over 6,000 attorneys. The union since ballooned to roughly 12K lawyers. But that’s set to end as [Dacheng will leave the Dentons umbrella](https://www.law360.com/articles/1708671/dentons-divorces-china-s-dacheng-citing-new-chinese-rules). Can we characterize this as verein bad news? No… that’s a pun too far.

A [draft letter to the erstwhile conglomerate’s clients](https://assets.law360news.com/1708000/1708671/client%20communication_new%20relationship%20with%20china%20region.pdf) pins the blame for the conscious uncoupling on the Chinese government.

I write to share that, in response to an evolving regulatory environment for Chinese law firms in China — including new mandates and requirements relating to data privacy, cybersecurity, capital control and governance —Dentons is modifying its relationship with Beijing Dacheng Law Offices (大成), the Chinese law firm partnership that has been a member of the Dentons Group since 2015. Effective this month, 大成 — previously our China Region — will no longer be a member of the Dentons Group and will instead operate as a separate and independent legal entity under a “preferred firm” relationship with Dentons.

Dentons will maintain its Hong Kong practice which predated the Dacheng agreement.

While China’s data privacy laws date back a couple years, new guidance has transformed “China’s version of GDPR” into a compliance nightmare steeped in vague national security rhetoric. The final version of the “Measures for the Standard Contract for Cross-border Transfer of Personal Information” and the “Standard Contractual Clauses for Cross-border Transfer of Personal Information” recently took effect and bar the transfer of personal data outside China without undergoing a security assessment. And it all sounds… [onerous](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/cross-border-data-transfers-under-china-s-personal-information-protection-law):

To complete the mandatory government security assessment, the company subject to such assessment in China must submit a self-assessment report, the cross-border data transfer agreement, the application form, and any other documents/information requested by Cyberspace Administration. Based on the timeline given in the Security Assessment Measures, if the company submits an adequate application, it will take about 60 days to complete the security assessment, but such time may be extended depending on the complexity of each application. Once approved, the security assessment is valid for two years, except that a new security assessment is required if there are certain changes, such as changes in how the foreign recipient uses the data, change of control at the personal information processor or the foreign recipient.

Some sources indicate that six months in, [only two companies had managed to pass the assessment process](https://shuftipro.com/blog/chinas-data-protection-and-privacy-laws-2023-update/). That’s not going to work for a global law firm structure and even with the most benign of stated intentions, there are a lot of Western clients that might fear any process that gives a Chinese government entity access to its law firm’s systems.

Alas, this story might have a bit of a “meet the old boss, same as the old boss” flair. Even without Dacheng… Dentons is most likely going to have more lawyers than everyone else by next year.

Looks like “[Sloppy Steve](https://www.theroot.com/white-house-on-sloppy-steve-bannon-new-phone-who-dis-1821907562)” is lawyering up. As first [reported by](https://www.thedailybeast.com/steve-bannon-lawyers-up-russia-investigators-ready-to-pounce) The Daily Beast, Steve Bannon is turning to [William Burck](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/burck-william), the superstar Quinn Emanuel partner, to help him prep for his interview with the House Intelligence Committee, currently scheduled for next week.

If you’ve been diligently following along with all of the moves in the national saga broadly referred to as the “Russia Probe,” Burck’s name probably sounds familiar. (And most Biglaw junkies know, at least by reputation, this prominent white-collar defense lawyer and co-managing partner of Quinn’s D.C. office.) That’s because Burck [also represents White House Counsel Don McGahn and Reince Priebus.](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/top-white-house-lawyer-don-mcgahn-and-reince-priebus-turn-to-biglaw-giant-as-they-lawyer-up/) It’s [being reported](https://www.law.com/sites/nationallawjournal/2018/01/11/steve-bannon-turns-to-quinn-emanuels-burck-amid-russia-probe/) that Burck’s representation extends only to preparations for Bannon’s House Committee interview and his time on the presidential campaign — not to Robert Mueller’s investigation or to Bannon’s time at the White House or the transition team.

As the Daily Beast notes, Burck’s… familiarity with the Russia probe could be held against his clients by the government:

“In general, prosecutors don’t like it when the same attorney represents multiple people who are subjects—or more—because it looks like they’re controlling the story,” said Ken White, a former federal prosecutor who specializes in First Amendment issues, speaking of investigators’ targets.

And, of course, having separate counsel makes it easier for the government to flip targets. Not that anyone associated with the [Trump campaign](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/former-trump-foreign-policy-adviser-pleads-guilty-to-lying-to-the-fbi/) would know [anything about that.](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/breaking-michael-flynn-charged-by-special-counsel/)
