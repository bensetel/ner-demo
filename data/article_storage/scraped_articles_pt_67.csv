# Morning Docket: 01.31.18
## * According to his friends, President Trump is reportedly planning to ask Attorney General Jeff Sessions to prosecute special counsel Robert Mueller and his team.

[[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/30/trump-reportedly-talking-about-having-sessions-prosecute-mueller.html)] * For the first time in more than 80 years, the Senate has confirmed a circuit court judge with a missing blue slip. Yesterday, Judge David Stras of the Minnesota Supreme Court was confirmed to the Eighth Circuit, with a 56-42 vote that threw decades-old tradition to the wind. [[The Hill](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/371453-senate-confirms-trump-nominee-despite-missing-blue-slip)] * “It’s really important that lawyers in large firms know that they can sign up....” In the short time since the initiative was announced, more than 500 lawyers have signed up to take on cases for the Time’s Up legal defense fund, and they’ll be able to provide free consultations to victims of workplace sexual harassment. [[Big Law Business](https://biglawbusiness.com/hundreds-of-attorneys-join-times-up-legal-defense-fund/)] * The robots are coming: Former payroll managers from Dechert claim in a federal age and gender bias suit that they were laid off because they were the oldest women employees in the department. The firm says that's not the case, since it was cloud-based technology, not discrimination, that took their jobs. [[Legal Intelligencer](https://www.law.com/sites/thelegalintelligencer/2018/01/30/dechert-says-tech-not-gender-spurred-staff-layoffs/)] * A California appellate court has breathed new life into a proposed class action that accuses Tinder of charging older users more money to use the enhanced version of the app. The judge who wrote the opinion reversed the lower court using slang very familiar to dating app aficionados.

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Will Allow Lawyers To Work From Home 50% Of The Time
## The firm has reached a happy, middle ground as far as flexibility is concerned.

Most Biglaw firms are eyeing September returns to their offices for attorneys and staff, with varying degrees of remote options. At some firms, the five-day, in-office workweek is a thing of the past, and at others, employees can expect to be in the office all day, every day. Dechert — a firm ranked No. 37 in the most recent Am Law 100, with $1,071,163,000 gross revenue in 2020 — seems to have found a happy medium.

According to a recent memo sent by policy committee chair Andy Levander and CEO Henry Nassau, the firm is expecting all attorneys to come into the office starting on September 13, on at least a part-time basis. The firm will allow for hybrid work arrangements, but requests that lawyers spend about half their time working in-person on days of their own choosing.

Firm leaders came to this decision after reviewing the thoughts of 1,400 Dechert employees who were surveyed on what Dechert’s return to the office should look like. “The results confirmed what we had been hearing,” Levander and Nassau wrote, “that many of you value the flexibility to work virtually at least some of the time and supervisors trust their people to be effective, regardless of their location.” Here’s a relevent excerpt from the firm’s memo:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The future is flexible, and we trust you to choose where and how to work based on your needs, your family, your team and your clients, underpinned by our culture of exceptional client service and an understanding that each of us is responsible for contributing to the fabric and culture of the firm. …

Through this flexible hybrid model, we believe we can balance in-person and virtual working in a way that engages and empowers our community to better support our clients and meet the professional and personal needs of our people.

Dechert is a firm that “strongly encourages” vaccination against COVID-19, and hopes that attorneys will come into the office this summer on a voluntary basis to readjust and connect with colleagues.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

A jury trial, pitting one of Biglaw’s biggest names against an elite boutique. A celebrity client — who takes the stand. And booze, lots of booze. Do I have your attention yet?

In this age of settlement and alternative dispute resolution, jury trials are rare — perhaps [one percent](https://bol.bna.com/no-retirement-71-year-old-lawyer-leaving-weil-wants-more-trials/) of federal cases. So it’s great, at least for aficionados of courtroom drama and war stories, to see a case go all the way to a jury verdict — with some crazy twists and turns along the way. From [Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/907095):

A tequila company ripped off the distinctive skull-shaped bottle of comedy legend Dan Aykroyd’s Crystal Head Vodka, a California federal jury found on Wednesday, handing Crystal Head a win in its trade dress infringement suit.

After roughly four hours of deliberations in downtown Los Angeles, the eight-person jury on Wednesday delivered a unanimous verdict in favor of Crystal Head maker Globefill Inc., finding that defendants Elements Spirits Inc. and its founder Kim Brandi had intentionally infringed Globefill’s trade dress by making and selling KAH brand tequila. The jury found that KAH, which comes in Day of the Dead-inspired skull-shaped bottles, was likely to confuse ordinary consumers into thinking it was made by, or affiliated with, Crystal Head, and had been designed with this objective in mind.

Globefill and Crystal Head co-founder Dan Aykroyd were represented by David Berg — one of the nation’s [top trial lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/5-litigation-lessons-from-joe-jamails-trial-strategy-in-pennzoil-v-texaco/), described by one grateful client as “the St. Jude for bet-the-company cases” — and his colleagues from [Berg & Androphy](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/a-legendary-litigator-jumps-from-biglaw-to-boutique/). Elements was represented by one of Biglaw’s best: Cravath, Swaine & Moore, with partners [Thomas G. Rafferty](https://www.cravath.com/trafferty/) and [Keith R. Hummel](https://www.cravath.com/khummel/) leading the team.

How do you vanquish Cravath in the courtroom? Calling a rebuttal witness who appears at the end of trial and [demolishes the other side’s case](https://www.law360.com/articles/906979) certainly helps (emphasis added):

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Globefill called to the stand tattoo artist and occasional sculptor Walter “Buddy” Szymoniak.

Under questioning by Globefill attorney David Berg of Berg & Androphy, Szymoniak testified that he had met Elements founder Kim Brandi in 2009, when he was tattooing her then-boyfriend, and Brandi told him she was trying to launch a tequila that would be contained in bottles that resembled Mexican Day of the Dead sugar skulls, or calaveras. Szymoniak said that he told Brandi he had experience with sculpting, casting and molding, and he was then hired to help her improve on her first clay prototype.

Szymoniak testified that Brandi wasn’t happy with what she had come up with and actually gave him one of Crystal Head’s glass skull-shaped bottles for him to make a cast of, and that he then used clay and tools to modify that copy to produce the version that Brandi ultimately accepted.

Considering that Brandi had previously testified that she had never seen the Crystal Head bottle before making the KAH Tequila bottle, Szymoniak’s testimony was… less than helpful for Elements.

And wait, it gets worse (again, emphasis added):

Szymoniak said that he hadn’t heard from Brandi since 2010 — until last Tuesday, when she contacted him via Facebook. Szymoniak said she asked him to come over, saying she wanted to give him a check for $10,000 to make up for his not receiving royalties he had been promised for his work. Once he got to Brandi’s place of business, however, she focused on the lawsuit, asking Szymoniak for help finding differences between the bottles and telling him she had been lying when she told the jury she hadn’t even heard of Crystal Head when she made her own bottle.

“She just said, ‘I lied under oath and said I had never seen the crystal skull bottle, but I handed it you, the frickin, the effing bottle,’” he said.

That’s Perry frickin’ Mason. As Berg & Androphy partner [Jenny Kim](https://www.bafirm.com/attorney/jenny-h-kim/) told me, “Unbelievable case. First time in David’s 50 years where we found a rebuttal witness who said that defendants admitted to lying on the stand and paid $10K in hush money. It’s a good story of how old-fashioned, boots-on-the-ground investigative work is an essential part of any trial.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
A good story indeed — which David Berg shared with me when we spoke yesterday, shortly after the jury handed down its verdict.

The Berg & Androphy team hadn’t reached out to Buddy Szymoniak, designer of the KAH Tequila bottle; they assumed that he was a very good friend of Elements founder Kim Brandi, and that he would not be helpful. But this past weekend, two Berg & Androphy associates, Victoria Mery and Zenobia Bivens, said they really wanted to try and speak with him.

On Saturday night, Mery and Bivens called upon Szymoniak. He was unwilling to speak with them — but hinted that he might be willing to talk to Dan Aykroyd, co-founder of Crystal Head with artist John Alexander. (Celebrity has its privileges.)

On Sunday night, Dan Aykroyd, David Berg, and local counsel [Hernán Vera](http://www.birdmarella.com/attorneys/hernan-d-vera/) of Bird Marella dropped by to see Szymoniak at his tattoo parlor. He was still reluctant to talk, saying he was afraid of being sued for his involvement in sculpting the KAH Bottle for Kim Brandy.

Berg explained that the only people who could sue him for that would be, well, Globefill and Aykroyd — and that they wouldn’t do that. After Berg and Aykroyd gave Szymoniak a signed release, protecting him from being sued for his role in designing the KAH Bottle, he told them the whole story — the same story he would later share in open court, to devastating effect.

I asked Berg: was this the most dramatic, “gotcha”-style episode in his long career as a trial lawyer? He shared this story with me:

I had one trial like this, where I had something this dramatic, decades ago. But not since.

It’s 1971. I’m in a criminal trial in Harris County, Texas, representing the defendant.

The next witness for the state is seated, reviewing something in his lap. Then he gets on the stand. I say to him, “I saw you looking at some notes over the break. Did you use those to refresh your recollection?” He says yes, so I get to see the notes.

They’re on a white legal pad. On the left side, there’s a lot of writing, inside a big circle. On the right side, there’s an arrow pointing to the circle, and writing that says, “LIE ABOUT THIS.”

The jury was out for 14 minutes. They didn’t even need that much time — they tried to return a verdict while still in the jury box.

The jury in the Crystal Head case took a bit longer, but not very long — about four hours, returning after breakfast.

“I had no doubt that we’d have a verdict afterward,” Berg told me. “Most juries like to have one last meal on the government.”

The jury delivered a unanimous verdict in favor of Globefill, i.e., Crystal Head and Dan Aykroyd. Judge Consuelo B. Marshall will now decide on remedy — how much Elements will have to pay to Globefill, plus injunctive relief in Globefill’s favor.

I was curious: did Dan Aykroyd’s celebrity play a role in the case?

“In the prior trial [in 2013], his celebrity hurt him — it was sort of a ‘David and Goliath’ story,” Berg explained. “This time, Danny was so human, and so good [when on the stand](https://www.law360.com/articles/905598/dan-aykroyd-breaks-down-booze-bottle-angles-in-ip-trial), that the jurors really warmed to him.”

Speaking of “David [Berg] versus Goliath” stories, as a Biglaw fanboy I couldn’t resist asking Berg: what was it like going up against the well-oiled machine that is Cravath?

“They’re friends, they’re wonderful lawyers, and they did a great job,” Berg said. “We just had the facts on our side.”

Very true, and a nice reminder of the greatness of the American justice system. You can go out and hire the best lawyers money can buy — a top-flight Biglaw firm like Cravath, or a powerhouse boutique like Berg & Androphy. But so much of the time — not all the time, but probably more often than in most other nations’ justice systems — the law and the facts will prevail.

# Am Law 100 Firm Makes Global Employee Cuts, Citing Overcapacity
## More layoff news just before the holiday weekend.

We’re very sorry to say this, but the Biglaw layoffs are far from over. Rightsizing strikes again as yet another firm slims down its employee head count.

According to a report from the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/05/25/bryan-cave-cuts-47-staff-globally-citing-excess-capacity-in-secretarial-and-administrative-roles/), the firm behind the latest round of layoffs is Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner. After conducting a “comprehensive review of support ratios,” the firm — which brought in $845,190,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it in 61st place in the most recent Am Law 100 — is making global cuts among its secretarial and administrative staff, citing excess capacity. Lawyers were not included in BCLP’s employee downsizing efforts.

The firm has cut ties with 47 business professionals across all of its offices (34 U.S. employees, as well as 13 employees across Europe, the Middle East, and Asia). Here are additional details:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
According to the firm’s statement, Bryan Cave’s focus on achieving sustainable growth required it to invest in its “people, technology, and brand” in a targeted way to ensure appropriate levels of support across the platform, “prioritizing areas that require the greatest investment.” The firm declined to comment further on layoffs.

The firm noted in its statement that those affected by the layoffs will receive “competitive severance benefits, outplacement assistance and resources to facilitate their career transition.”

Best of luck to those who are being let go from Bryan Cave.

The new Cleary partnership class?

Happy election day! We hope you have done your civic duty by voting in this historic election.

Speaking of election, one of Biglaw’s biggest and best names, the white-shoe firm of [Cleary Gottlieb](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/cleary-gottlieb/), just elected 16 new partners and counsel. Naming new partners is usually a cause for celebration at a firm, and based on the credentials and accomplishments described in Cleary’s [press release](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/cleary-gottliebs-new-partner-class-where-are-the-women/2/), this new group is impressive indeed.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
But they fall short in at least one key metric, as displeased CGSH associates and alumni have informed us:

Maybe you’ve seen it, but Cleary just elected a new crop of partners/counsel. 15 men and 1 woman; VERY WHITE. It feels very embarrassing and throw-back-y for a firm so proud of its diversity.

Don’t want to generalize too much based on one year, but women are substantially more than 12.5% of the associate ranks.

Have you and your team considered a story about Cleary’s recent promotions? Of the 16 promoted to partner and counsel last week, only 1 was a woman. In 2015, it was 3 out of 14 partners and counsel, and in 2014, it was 1 out of 10 partners and counsel (with only 1 woman partner in each of those years). In 2013, they promoted no women partners. Those seem like fairly dismal numbers for the promotion of women.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
I asked this source: how many women were considered for partnership this year?

It’s hard to know [how many women were up this year]. It’s not transparent. There have been a few senior women departures lately…. There are a number of women that are upset about this, so I wasn’t sure if you’d already heard.

We have heard, as reflected in the comments above. And it’s worth noting that some of these complaints come from men and from Cleary alumni (who are often in a position to hire their former firm, and who increasingly [consider diversity](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/gcs-back-new-initiative-to-bring-diversity-to-the-legal-profession-will-it-make-an-impact/) when selecting outside counsel).

We reached out to the firm for comment. Managing partner [Mark Leddy](https://www.clearygottlieb.com/professionals/mark-leddy) had this to say:

While we are proud of the talented colleagues who were promoted to partner and counsel, we all share in the disappointment that women and lawyers from diverse backgrounds were significantly underrepresented. There are no excuses; we must do better. We have undertaken a number of initiatives and are firmly committed to making the investments necessary to ensure that our culture is one in which all lawyers can thrive, and we will continue to do so. We believe these efforts will have a long-term impact on the promotion of women and diverse lawyers to senior leadership positions in the firm.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
That’s a solid response — taking responsibility, pledging to do better, and not blaming the disappointing numbers on a shortage of qualified candidates. Of course, time will tell whether Cleary’s initiatives bear fruit.

In fairness to Cleary, it’s far from the only firm that’s [struggling with diversity issues](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/ball-dont-lie-what-percentage-of-biglaw-partners-are-white/). And it’s also worth noting that Cleary, an impressively international firm, generally does well in terms of diversity. Earlier this year, for example, it made the American Lawyer’s [top 10 firms for diversity](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/the-best-law-firms-for-diversity-2017/). (But note that Am Law focuses on racial and ethnic diversity, as opposed to other forms of diversity; the Vault diversity rankings, in contrast, consider diversity “as relating to minorities, women, LGBT individuals, individuals with disabilities, and military veterans.”)

In fairness to Biglaw, it is improving on some metrics when it comes to the treatment of women (a few [high-profile](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/traci-ribeiro/) [lawsuits](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/kerrie-campbell/) [notwithstanding](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/biglaw-partner-alleges-sexism-derailed-her-career-in-a-new-lawsuit/?rf=1)). Just last week, for example, the Diversity & Flexibility Alliance released a [new report](http://dfalliance.com/research/new-partner-report/) showing that of those lawyers promoted to partnership at 134 large U.S. law firms over the last year, [37 percent are women](http://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/859294/number-of-female-partners-in-biglaw-hits-5-year-high?nl_pk=be0f8226-d5ba-43b9-bffa-9431e90fddc5&utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=corporate) — the highest since the Alliance began collecting the data in 2012, as noted by the [WSJ Law Blog](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/11/03/more-women-promoted-at-law-firms-but-still-lag-behind-men/).

Per the WSJ, “just 10 firms reported not promoting a single woman, and most of those had fairly small class sizes.” So Cleary, with its one woman partner, is definitely on the low end of Biglaw in this regard. (On the bright side, Cleary’s partner does have some racial and ethnic diversity; one new partner and two new counsel are of Asian ancestry.)

We will be covering other firms when it comes to partnership promotion and diversity issues; we just started with Cleary because of all the reader tips we received. If you would like us to look into diversity issues at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Diversity%20at%20%5BFirm%20Name%5D) and share what you know. Thanks.

# Ropes & Gray Sweetens Office Reopening With Free Food
## That's right: free breakfast, lunch, and snacks for all lawyers and staffers in all offices.

Several law firms have already announced plans for the reopening of their offices. At most of them — and for the handful of firms doing soft openings this summer — between now and September, offices will be open for voluntary, optional use so that lawyers and staff members can casually reacquaint themselves with in-person law firm life. As we know all too well, after more than a year of working remotely, some employees [aren’t exactly eager to return](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/permanent-remote-associate-positions-for-biglaw-would-ease-the-pain-of-returning-to-the-office/) to the office; in fact, they may be dreading it.

What could make the situation a little more palatable? Free food, and lots of it.

That’s exactly what will be happening at Ropes & Gray — the Biglaw firm that was first to officially [end the five-day, in-office workweek](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/ropes-grays-reopening-plan-puts-an-end-to-the-5-day-in-office-workweek-for-associates/) for associates. According to a source, the firm will be providing complimentary breakfast, lunch, and snacks every day of the week from the day after Memorial Day through Labor Day for all lawyers and staffers as part of its office return plans. Eva Ciko Carman, managing partner of the firm’s New York office, announced the news this week:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
If you choose to come into the office, the firm would like to welcome you back with complimentary breakfast and lunch, prepared by Flik. That’s right: Free food for anyone in the office. …

[I]f you’re comfortable coming into the office, we hope that this will be a nice treat.

The free meals will be offered in all of the firm’s U.S. offices, as well as the firm’s London office. Employees will be treated to an array of standard breakfast fare (sandwiches, eggs, bagels, muffins, fruit, and yogurt) and for lunch, there will be a variety of salads, sandwiches, burgers, and desserts (ranging from cookies to fruit).

If you’d like to encourage your lawyers and support teams to return to the office voluntarily, why not make it a little more delicious? Kudos to Ropes & Gray for sweetening the idea of returning to the office.

(Flip to the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/ropes-free-food/2/) to see the full memo from Ropes & Gray.)

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

As soon as you find out about reopening plans at your firm, please email us (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# After Slashing Partner Compensation, Biglaw Firm Moves To Stage 2 Of COVID-19 Austerity Measures: Attorney Layoffs (And More)
## More cuts at this Am Law 200 firm.

The thing about the uncertainty surrounding the economic upheaval caused by COVID-19, is that things are, well, uncertain. Even the best laid, most thoughtful plans can change, and pretty rapidly at that. So it shouldn’t come as much of a surprise that Biglaw firms that have already announced cost-cutting measures are going back for more.

At Husch Blackwell, a firm claiming the [100th spot on the latest Am Law 100](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/04/21/the-2020-am-law-100-ranked-by-gross-revenue/#) ranking, their initial foray into COVID-19 austerity measures were aimed at those at the top of the law firm food chain. The firm [previously announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/husch-partner-cuts/?rf=1) equity partner draws were cut by 15 percent and all managing directors and c-level executives had their salaries cut by 10 percent. Now we’ve learned there are even more cuts at the firm.

For this second round, Husch Blackwell announced a pu pu platter of austerity measures. Income partners are taking a hit to their compensation, and the dreaded layoffs and furlough are coming to both the attorney and staff ranks. From the firm’s statement ([available in full on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/husch-layoffs/2/)):

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Effective May 1, 2020, the firm is instituting a 10 percent holdback of fixed income partner compensation. The holdback is across the board and is equal to or smaller than earlier measures taken that impacted equity partners and senior administrative leaders. The firm is also implementing a series of measures to align its headcount with the downturn in the nation’s economy. These measures include a combination of job terminations, furloughs, salary reductions, transitions to less-than-fulltime status, early retirements, and deferrals. Both lawyers and staff were affected by some or all of these measures, but the total number impacted represents less than 10% of the firm.

The firm also announced modifications to its 2020 Summer Associate Program. The incoming class will be split into two groups, and each group will participate in a five-week program over consecutive five-week periods beginning in mid-June.

Chair Greg Smith had this to say about the cuts:

“This crisis is more prolonged and extensive than early estimates indicated, and while we made every effort to avoid these actions, they have become necessary,” said Husch Blackwell Chairman Greg Smith. “Notably, many of the impacted individuals are on furlough, and this simply because there is very little for them to do while we are in Work-From-Home mode. We are hopeful that they will be recalled to work as soon as it is safe and feasible to do so.”

Above the Law wishes the best to those that suddenly find themselves out of work during this tough time.

# Attorneys Should Respect Elder Lawyers
## As a friend of mine loves to say, they call it the 'practice' of law for a reason, and people usually gain more knowledge of the law the longer they are practitioners in the legal profession.

This past week, I paid my annual bar dues for a jurisdiction in which I practice. When I looked at the fee schedule for the bar dues, I noticed that attorneys who have practiced law for 50 years or more no longer needed to pay annual bar dues. My first instinct was to wonder why senior attorneys did not need to pay bar dues since they practice law just like the rest of us and should seemingly pay the same dues as everyone else. However, upon further reflection, this policy makes a lot of sense and perhaps reflects the respect people should have for senior lawyers in the legal profession. In many instances, senior lawyers add much value to legal practice and should be respected by other attorneys.

I routinely encounter senior lawyers in my practice, which I am loosely defining as attorneys who have practiced law for at least 40 years. Such attorneys can be a wealth of information about the legal profession and might understand more about why things are the way they are today because of practices employed by legal professionals in the past. I interacted with a senior attorney on a file recently, and like many of the senior lawyers I encounter, he enjoyed discussing his varied experiences in the profession.

At one point, we were talking about the need to conduct a procedural task in our case to move the matter forward. Most practitioners knew that this procedural task needed to be performed, but few probably wondered why this procedural task existed in the jurisdiction. The senior lawyer told me that he thought that it was a remnant of an era when efiling did not exist and people had voluminous paper files that were not easy to search. Even though papers are served and filed electronically these days, this particular procedural task still likely still exists because of long-ago practices.

Senior lawyers also have numerus interesting stories about current judges before which many lawyers practice. Most jurists used to practice law, but since I have only been in the legal profession for around a decade, I do not know too many former colleagues who are currently judges. However, more senior lawyers likely remember current judges from their days practicing law.

Some infamous judges in the jurisdictions in which I practice are known for being sticklers with the law, knowledgeable about legal matters, or notorious for other habits. It can be hard to think that these renown individuals were once practicing attorneys dealing with all of the stress and difficulty that comes with practicing law. I always enjoy talking about what judges were like as practicing attorneys, which makes it less intimidating to go before these judges for legal matters.

Senior lawyers are also a great resource since they typically have an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. As a friend of mine loves to say, they call it the “practice” of law for a reason, and people usually gain more knowledge of the law the longer they are practitioners in the legal profession. Senior lawyers are far more likely to be familiar with a legal issue that they might have handled in their decade’s long career than someone who has not practiced law as long.

Earlier in my career, I had to deal with a peculiar legal issue that caused substantive and procedural issues in a case I handled. I spoke with numerous lawyers, and no one had dealt with the exact legal issue before. Finally, I spoke with a lawyer who had practiced law for decades, and he told me he faced the exact issue earlier in his career. This senior lawyer gave me a number of helpful tips that made it much easier for me to deal with this issue for my client.

All told, senior lawyers can be a great resource to the legal profession, and I understand why state bars cut senior attorneys a break with bar dues and why senior lawyers are afforded other courtesies. If a senior lawyer is a stakeholder to a legal matter, they can be a solid resource for the other attorneys involved.

There are many different and exciting ways to rank law firms. How prestigious are they? How much money are they making? How much take-home cash do partners earn? How big are they?

Yes, size matters, especially after a year where lateral movement slowed thanks to M&A activity tanking amid the tech industry’s implosion. The talent wars of 2021 were almost an afterthought as outright and stealth layoffs soon become top of mind worries for lawyers and legal professionals alike.

The New York Law Journal recently unleashed its annual [NYLJ 100](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2023/08/11/nylj-100-new-yorks-largest-firms-by-attorney-headcount/), a ranking of the largest law firms in New York covering the previous calendar year. As luck would have it, many Biglaw firms increased their New York City head counts in 2022, and the top 100 firms in the city netted about a 4.5% increase in attorneys over their 2021 numbers. If you’ve ever wondered about head counts, this is the ranking for you.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In total, about 24,790 attorneys were working in the New York offices of the state’s 100 largest law firms last year…. In fact, three-quarters of the law firms saw a head count increase of some sort — highlighting that New York law firms were still growing even though M&A tumbled last year and their corporate practices slowed down.

The top 15 biggest firms (numbers show attorneys in New York) are not surprising. Let’s take a moment to gawk at Manhattan’s Biglaw behemoths:

1. Kirkland & Ellis: 795
2. Davis Polk: 791
3. Paul Weiss: 766
4. Simpson Thacher: 693
5. Latham: 651
6. Weil: 628
7. Skadden: 624
8. Debevoise: 610
9. Sullivan & Cromwell: 508
10. Fried Frank: 487
11. Ropes & Gray: 462
12. White & Case: 447
13. Cravath: 441
14. Milbank: 437
15. Sidley: 435
Congratulations to Kirkland for employing more lawyers in New York than any other firm. This firm wins the award for putting the “big” in Biglaw in the Big Apple.

Every quarter we report on law firm financials and every quarter we see some kind of milquetoast improvement — revenues up, expenses up just a shade less, demand down, confidence… meh. One factor in every one of those reports is the collection and realization rate, the figure that explains the gap between billing the time and getting the check from the client. For years, we’ve chalked up low realization to a combination of attorney laziness and the disconnect between lawyers as practitioners and lawyers as businesspeople. But perhaps the real culprit in keeping firms waiting on their money is the out of control in-house legal department.

The Association of Legal Administrators and Bellefield Systems [released a report](https://go.bellefield.com/annual-law-firm-leader-survey-on-outside-counsel-guidelines-2019-0) last week on the nature of outside counsel guidelines and examining how firms deal with getting all their bills in. It’s not a surprise that in-house counsel are trying to keep bills low — that’s a given. Nor is it a surprise that legal departments internalize more work than ever to manage spend. But what receives less attention in the world of billing is the Byzantine guidelines clients concoct to delay paying the bills they owe.

And these delays can be significant:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Invoice rejection is universally experienced and varies by degree. Most firms experience 5-10% of e-bills getting rejected or reduced (43.24%). Almost a quarter of firms experience 11- 20% of e-bills getting rejected or reduced (21.62%). Over one third of firms (35.81%) experience 21% or greater of e-bills getting rejected or reduced.

15% of firms do not appeal rejections either because of lack of staffing power or writing off as a cost of doing business.

The report tells us that 88.83 percent of firms receive outside counsel guidelines from clients but 25 percent of firms have no process to synchronize their work with these guidelines and around 63 percent only have an ad hoc process for doing so. That’s unfortunate because there is zero effort to harmonize guidelines and every client creates their own inane rules for billing compliance. These rules can be as arbitrary as “don’t use X word in your descriptions even if we all know you’re doing X” with the result being an outright rejection of a monthly bill.

In addition to lack of staffing to handle client guidelines, the majority of firms feel that OCG are simply too complex as their top compliance challenge (66.04%), and nearly half report that they are simply too long with too much info, and they didn’t read them (43.4%).

On the one hand it’s amusing to see corporate attorneys hoisted by the petard of their own onerous quasi-adhesion contract language that no one really reads, but that’s no justification. The clients might say that they have enterprise-specific, nuanced needs that they want counsel to address. Oh, come on! You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You’re a random company in need of attorneys willing to tell you what they did and for how long. Get over yourselves.

Note that I said clients might say that. In this case, “might” is doing a lot of work because clients seem pretty comfortable just admitting they’re trying to force a write-off.

In 2019, clients are now pulling back on outside counsel spend and the overwhelming majority (81%) report utilizing Outside Counsel Guidelines as one of the most effective tools for controlling costs.

Firms lack the staffing to stay on top of all of this and attorneys lack the time to learn how to comply with every client under the sun. While that may save some money today, it’s not an effective long-term strategy because eventually firms will staff up and just pass the cost on to clients — congratulations on just making everything more expensive!

In the meantime, one thing firms can do to avoid getting hung out to dry by outside counsel guidelines is consider Bellefield’s own product. Their [iTimeKeep](https://www.bellefield.com/itimekeep/) system is set up to provide compliance guidance at the point of time entry. Basically, if you’re writing a description that violates the guidelines programmed into the system it’ll let you know right then and there. Frankly, clients should probably be demanding firms get this system before a bunch of admins get hired.

That might be a pretty smart guideline to add.

They always say when it rains it pours and the case of the once Biglaw firm of LeClairRyan proves the saying. We’ve been [reporting on the firm](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/leclairryan/) a lot recently, what with partners fleeing from the firm like rats on a sinking ship — even [name partner Gary LeClair](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/name-partner-bolts-from-struggling-biglaw-firm/) is leaving — and being barred by their lender from returning [departing partners’ capital contributions](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/biglaw-firm-prohibited-by-lender-from-returning-former-partners-capital-contributions/) and the firm handing out [WARN Act notices informing staff](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/is-this-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-this-biglaw-firm/) of pending mass layoffs. But it turns out a decimated headcount isn’t the only problem the firm is facing.

Earlier this month, the firm was sued by the landlord of their Williamsburg, Virginia, office for $348,000, apparently over back rent. The lawyers practicing out of the office left the firm in February, and as [reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/07/30/teetering-leclairryan-faces-claims-over-shuttered-office-gender-bias/) Law.com, the firm signed a promissory note, but the lawsuit suggests they haven’t lived up to the terms of the agreement:

The bare-bones confession of judgment filed by Robertson Liebler Development Group indicates that the law firm failed to pay the amounts due under a promissory note. The note doesn’t mention rent, but Robinson Liebler has the same address as the LLC that is listed in property records as the owner of the building where LeClairRyan had its offices.

LeClairRyan agreed to pay its landlord $506,000 under the promissory note, which was notarized Feb. 14 and signed by firm president Elizabeth Acee. Once the firm paid $272,000, the remaining amount due was to be waived, but based on the amount of the judgment, LeClairRyan only appears to have made the first two payments, plus a few hundred dollars.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

The firm is also facing an unequal pay lawsuit. Former marketing professional Marci Keatts says she was paid less than her male colleague who was hired after she was and whom she was supervising:

Keatts was initially hired at the firm as a marketing communications coordinator and was promoted to marketing communications professional at the start of 2018, according to the complaint.

While in her previous role, she learned that she was earning $14,000 less than a male colleague hired five years after her start. She said that even after being promoted to supervise the colleague and receiving a $7,000 increase, she still lagged his salary by $7,000.

As part of LeClairRyan’s [“law firm 2.0,”](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/the-biglaw-firm-that-keep-losing-partners-is-revamping-their-leadership-structure/) both the plaintiff and her subordinate were transferred to ULX Partners (the firm launched a strategic partnership with alternative legal service provider UnitedLex). Keats says she brought the matter to human resources, but the pay disparity continued. The plaintiff says she left the firm because of the unequal pay:

“This was not a voluntary decision on plaintiff’s part, but the result of defendants’ insistence of continuing a discriminatory pay practice towards plaintiff as reflected in the compensation associated with the ‘offer’ for continued employment,” said Keats, represented by Harris D. Butler III of Butler Royals in Richmond, Virginia.

# Enough With The Bad News, Biglaw Bonus Season Is Almost Here
## When will this year's year-end bonuses be announced? Stay tuned!

It’s November 8, and Thanksgiving is just a couple of weeks away, which means that bonus season is nearly upon us. Wouldn’t it be nice if your law firm gave you a little something extra to be thankful for this year? We sure think it would be! After all, the news coming from Biglaw lately has been a bit depressing, with worries of outright layoffs and stealth layoffs plaguing associates’ minds. Let’s give those hardworking attorneys something to be excited about for once.

Let’s reminisce about bonuses for a moment, shall we? This is what [last year’s supersized Cravath bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/first-mover-on-bonus/) looked like:

- Class of 2021 – $15,000 (pro-rated)
- Class of 2020 – $20,000

As we [noted](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/after-last-years-bonus-bonanza-biglaw-associates-arent-expecting-anything-special-this-bonus-season/) in our annual bonus survey report, unlike last year, no one is really expecting any kind of special bonus on top of their regular bonuses this year due to current economic conditions. While that may be a little underwhelming considering last year’s bonuspalooza, many of our sources have managed to convince themselves that absolutely anything at all is better than being laid off.

Wondering when your bank accounts will be a little more flush? Here’s a list of the dates when year-end market bonuses hit Biglaw since 2006, the very first year Above the Law started publishing bonus news. Take a look:

- 2021: November 22 ([Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/first-mover-on-bonus/))
- 2020: November 11 ([Baker McKenzie](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/))
- 2019: November 7 ([Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/breaking-biglaw-bonuses-are-here/))

- 2016: November 28 ([Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2016-associate-bonuses/))
- 2015: December 7 ([Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2015-associate-bonuses/))

- 2007: October 29 ([Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/10/cravath-announces-bonuses-special-and-otherwise/))
- 2006: December 11 ([Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2006/12/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announced-cadwalader-rumored/))
If a firm other than Cravath decides to lead the pack, then bonuses may come down the pipeline any day now. The best thing for associates to do right now while they wait is to just keep billing, just keep billing, just keep billing — that is, if they’ve actually got any work that’s billable. In the meantime, we’ll be right here along with you, waiting on bonuses to be announced. Tick tock, Biglaw….

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus/Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus/Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Global Chairman Of World's Biggest Law Firm Says Going Back To The Office Is 'Not Going To Happen'
## Thanks to COVID-19, nothing is ever going to be the same in professional workplaces.

With 19,000 employees in 183 offices in 75 countries, most working remotely, I keep being asked when we are going back to the office. With offices in every pandemic hot spot in the world — from Wuhan to Milan — let alone places with reputations of managing the crisis, like Singapore or Seoul, we have learned that no matter what is allowed, people do not go quickly or easily back to the office. …

Lawyers, bankers, accountants, consultants, executives of all types, all are wondering when they and others like them might “go back to the office,” as if the answer will come by government edict and the only variable is timing. But, in reality, the answer is, it’s not going to happen — at least not as we once knew it — no matter what any government official says.

— [Joe Andrew](https://www.dentons.com/en/joe-andrew), global chairman of Dentons, writing in an opinion piece about what the concept of [“going back to the office”](https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/494889-lets-stop-asking-when-are-we-going-back-to-the-office?) means for professionals and the support staff who work with them, noting that the “literal distance between the haves and the have nots is likely going to grow even wider” if these workplaces open before a COVID-19 vaccine is widely available. Click [here](https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/494889-lets-stop-asking-when-are-we-going-back-to-the-office?) to read Andrew’s important essay, which deals with issues like financial instability and sexism that would be put on display if professionals push to return to the office too soon.

# More On The Trump 'Disqualified For Insurrection' Debate

About a month ago, [I did you a favor](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/how-baude-and-paulsen-opened-pandoras-box-is-trump-eligible-for-the-presidency/). I read the entirety of [Baude and Paulsen’s](https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=584095096086107103081119073006001127032069023053024057123011010026070114029098117025037027038012044049023025013125093124012123119094030029067022082011113081088003048050036022017104100065086071082089005121100028084016120081094064066004081095084004002&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE) 126-page magnum opus on why Trump is barred from running for the presidency under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.

No good deed goes unpunished.

Damned if Professors Josh Blackmun and Seth Barrett Tillman didn’t write [their own 126-page magnum opus](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4568771) on why Trump remains eligible to run for the presidency despite Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment. So I read that one, too, to allow me to give you a sense of the arguments.

If anyone writes another 126-page article on this subject, count me out. I don’t have time for this.

Baude and Paulsen and Blackmun and Tillman disagree about damned near everything. But I’m going to focus on a single issue: When Trump was president, was he an “officer of the United States”? That’s the threshold requirement for Trump to be barred from running again.

Let’s start at the beginning. Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment bars folks from running for president (or other offices), if those folks engaged in insurrection:

having previously taken an oath as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States

Trump was never a member of Congress, a member of a state legislature, or an executive or judicial officer of a state. The question is whether Trump falls into the second category — when he served as president, did he serve as “an officer of the United States”? If Trump has previously served as “an officer of the United States,” then he’s arguably prohibited from running again for the presidency.

Baude and Paulsen devote just six of their 126 pages to explaining why one who serves as president serves as “an officer of the United States.” Basically, they say:  (1) this is the straightforward reading of the text of Section 3, (2) Articles II (the president) and VI (other officers) of the Constitution require certain government officials to take oaths to support the Constitution; the disqualification provision of Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment should be read at least to disqualify those required to take oaths; and (3) Section 3’s intent was to be reasonably comprehensive in disqualifying insurrectionists from running for office.

Blackmun and Tillman respond: (1) there is contemporaneous evidence from the days after the Civil War that the people who drafted Section 3 did not believe that one who served as president served as an “officer of the United States”; (2) Section 3’s disqualification clause should apply only to oaths required by Article VI, not Article II, of the Constitution (for reasons that you can read on your own if you’re interested); and (3) multiple other provisions of the Constitution expressly exclude the president and vice president from the category “officers of the United States.”

These arguments are not silly. The Impeachment Clause of the Constitution, for example, says: “The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” That sure sounds as though the president and vice president are not included among the “civil officers of the United States.”

I’m not going to judge these arguments; that would require Herculean effort. But I will note that Northwestern Professor Steven Calabresi [has changed his mind](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/18/us/politics/trump-calabresi-14th-amendment.html) on this issue, first concluding that Baude and Paulsen had the better of the argument and, more recently, deciding that Blackmun and Tillman rule the day. I know that politicians will scream “politics!” no matter how the courts rule, but the truth is that there are intelligent (and hard) arguments on both sides of this issue.

A coda: Harvard Professor Lawrence Lessig recently wrote [a column in Slate](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/09/trump-disqualification-colorado-ballot-hail-mary.html) arguing that Section 3 should not be read to disqualify Trump.  He fears that this would lead us down a slippery slope of trying to decide precisely what constitutes engaging in insurrection under the Constitution.

Again, this is not silly. Suppose Trump’s January 6 plot had succeeded. Pence had disqualified some ballots for Biden, instead counted the Trump ballots, and declared that Trump had been re-elected. Suppose that tens of thousands of Democrats then protested on the grounds of the Capitol. Some of those Democrats, including elected officials, engaged in illegal acts of civil disobedience to show their outrage. Would those Democratic elected officials have engaged in insurrection, disqualifying them from holding future office?

It can’t all depend on whose ox is gored. The law must mean something.

Politicians will squeal to serve their political ends. But intelligent, thoughtful people who care about the law will realize that the disqualification question is a hard and close one. There will be much more to come before the 2024 election.

# Law School Celebrates Worst Bar Exam Results In Nearly 10 Years
## Yikes...

The saddest celebration ever?

Last week, in a surprising twist of fate, we learned that the national mean score on the July 2016 administration of the Multistate Bar Examination (MBE) had [inched up higher](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/surprise-despite-all-expectations-to-the-contrary-bar-exam-scores-went-up-this-year/) than it had been in recent years. In July 2015, at 139.9, the national MBE mean was the lowest it had been in nearly three decades. This summer, the national mean MBE score is 140.3, four tenths of a point higher.

But does that mean that law students, on the whole, passed the exam in greater percentages? Absolutely not, as the results from North Carolina seem to suggest.

North Carolina’s bar exam results are usually shrouded in secrecy. The state does not publicly publish the number of people who have taken its exam, much less its overall passage rates, but thanks to one law school’s emails to students, we’ve been able to gather some of that information. For example, we know that in July 2015, the overall passage rate for first-time takers in the state was 67.1 percent, and that in July 2016, the overall passage rate for first-time takers in the state was 65.9 percent.

Last summer, for-profit InfiLaw institution Charlotte School of Law, the very law school whose emails we rely upon for statistics on the North Carolina bar exam, displayed test results that were so subpar — only 47.1 percent of the school’s first-time takers passed — that Dean Jay Conison [blamed Charlotte’s graduates for “not do[ing] the work”](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/law-school-dean-blames-lazy-students-for-terrible-bar-passage-rate/) needed to pass the exam. This summer, an even smaller percentage of graduates from Charlotte Law passed the exam — 45.24 percent — but Dean Conison seems to be relatively thrilled about the results. Why on earth is he so pleased? We’ll allow him to explain himself.

Here’s an excerpt from an email Dean Conison sent to all students late last month:

Our 45.24% first-time pass rate, although not at the levels we wish, marks an increase of 11% from the February 2016 pass rate, and signals that our improvements are having an impact. Our ultimate bar pass rate over the past five years has been approximately 78%, and we expect many more of our graduates to pass the North Carolina bar examination in coming administrations.

According Charlotte Law, North Carolina’s pass rate in February 2016 was just 51.1 percent, and now we know that approximately 34.7 percent of the school’s graduates passed the February 2016 bar examination. We don’t how many Charlotte Law graduates took the February 2016 test, nor do we know how many of them took the July 2016 test, so Dean Conison’s talk of the school’s “improvements … having an impact” is a bit like comparing rotten apples to spoiled oranges. For the time being, here are some real statistics to examine: the percentage of Charlotte Law graduates who passed the bar exam after the school began to lower its admissions requirements in 2010. Take a look, courtesy of [Charlotte Law’s own website](http://www.charlottelaw.edu/gainful-employment-aba-required-disclosures.html) (most recent results included by ATL):


(Table via Law School Transparency)

Exam Date	First Time Bar Passage Rate	State Average Rate
July 2009	67.3%	80.63%
Feb. 2010	73.3%	68.86%
July 2010	87.0%	79.8%
Feb. 2011	75.0%	72.3%
July 2011	78.79%	82.19%
Feb. 2012	53.13%	60.24%
July 2012	68.22%	78.76%
Feb. 2013	69.8%	62.4%
July 2013	57.8%	71.01%
Feb. 2014	60.0%	64.15%
July 2014	56.0%	70.6%
Feb. 2015	40.5%	54.5%
July 2015	47.1%	67.1%
Feb. 2016	34.7%	51.1%
July 2016	45.24%	65.90%
Congratulations, Charlotte School of Law, because the results from the July 2016 administration of the bar exam are your worst in nearly a decade. It’s time to party like you’ve got up to six figures of nondischargeable loan debt and a [26.3 percent chance](http://www.charlottelaw.edu/userfiles/files/CSL%202015%20ABA%20Employment%20Summary%20Report.pdf) of working in a full-time, long-term job as a lawyer! Talk about a job well done.

At the conclusion of his email, Dean Conison says the school will be “carefully analyzing the data in order to make further improvements for February 2017 and beyond,” and “will continue to share with you our plans to improve bar outcomes and provide strong value to our students.” With all due respect, it looks like the best way for Charlotte Law to further improve its bar outcomes and provide strong value to its students is to raise its admissions requirements as opposed to merely accepting federal loan dollars to fill seats that would otherwise be empty. Better luck next time, Charlotte Law!

While the administration at Charlotte Law may not be doing any favors for its students and graduates, it is doing a service for those at other North Carolina law schools who took the state’s bar exam. Dean Conison provided the school-by-school breakdown of bar exam results for all other law schools in the state, which by comparison make the Charlotte School of Law’s results look even more depressing.

Which North Carolina law school did the best on the state’s exam in July 2016? Flip to the next page to see Dean Conison’s full letter to students, as well as the first-time bar exam passage rates for the following law schools: Elon, North Carolina Central University, Campbell, University of North Carolina, Wake Forest, and Duke.

# Gibson Dunn Partner Files For Divorce Before Christmas To Be With Tiger Woods Mistress

Honestly, I never expected to hear about Rachel Uchitel ever again, much less have occasion to write about her in a legal industry publication.

Uchitel enjoyed a brief flicker of fame after [Tiger Woods was injured in a car crash](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2019/11/26/tiger-woods-sex-scandal-car-crash-10-years-later/4296503002/) after his infidelities had come to light. Uchitel was one of more than a dozen identified mistresses that Woods maintained, which was almost as impressive a feat as winning the 1997 Masters by 9 strokes. But after his marriage dissolved and he endured a long-term rehabilitation, Uchitel seemed destined to fade into obscurity.

But, she’s managed to work her way into my consciousness yet again, dammit.

According to the Daily Mail, Uchitel is now with Gibson Dunn partner [Ed Batts](https://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyer/batts-ed/), who is married and — according to his wife — [abandoned his family five days before Christmas to move in with Uchitel](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9111089/Tiger-Woods-ex-mistress-Rachel-Uchitel-spotted-canoodling-new-married-boyfriend.html).

Kissing passionately, this is Tiger Woods’ former mistress Rachel Uchitel with her new boyfriend – married lawyer Ed Batts, 47, who dumped his wife and her three children five days before Christmas to be with the former nightclub hostess.

His wife is understandably distraught, and told the Daily Mail that Batts blindsided her by taking steps to prepare for this moment in secret:

In an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com, Batts’ devastated wife Robyn, 59, claims he began an affair with Uchitel at the end of November after meeting her online and walked out less than a month later – leaving her heartbroken.

Batts had kept his plan to leave secret – shipping his Porsche to Florida days before his departure, with Robyn claiming he told her it was at the dealership to be repaired.

Court filings seen by DailyMail.com show Batts filed for divorce on December 17.

But Uchitel [told Page Six](https://pagesix.com/2021/01/09/rachel-uchitel-says-shes-target-of-new-beaus-wife/) that Batts was already separated from his wife.

“Robyn is publicly humiliating her estranged husband, whom she has been separated from for quite awhile, by using me as a target.” She added, “It’s sad that the media has yet again taken a story out of context and are trying to paint me as a mistress, when that is not the case.

Separation is a tricky liminal state. It’s also exactly the status a married man would claim while building a relationship with someone already burned by being labeled someone’s mistress. Whatever is going on, I’ve been forced to expend mental energy on Rachel Uchitel again and 2021 is off to a wretched start.

Linda Tirado is a veteran journalist who went to Minneapolis last month to cover the protest sparked by the murder of George Floyd. In covering the [protests against police aggression](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/i-came-cover-aggression-minneapolis-then-i-became-victim-it-ncna1221241), she became a victim when she was hit in the face with a rubber bullet, leaving her blind in one eye.

In the latest episode of The Jabot, I talk with Tai-Heng Cheng, global co-head of the international arbitration and trade practice at Sidley, who is representing Tirado in her case against the City of Minneapolis, its chief of police and police lieutenant, Minnesota’s Department of Public Safety Commissioner and state patrol colonel. We also chat about why pro bono is so important right now, what Sidley is doing to support these efforts, what is Biglaw’s responsibility to support criminal justice reform/anti-racism efforts, and why more attorneys should be involved in pro bono efforts.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wears when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

# BREAKING: Davis Polk Finally Announces New Compensation -- And It's MORE Than The Milbank Scale
## More money for associates! Let the matches begin!

Attention, associates: the moment you’ve been waiting for in the 2022 salary wars has finally arrived. Davis Polk & Wardwell has finally made a move, and we think Biglaw attorneys are really going to like it. After staying silent since [Milbank announced the $215K salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/) on January 20, the compensation leader has finally announced its plans.

This is not a Milbank match. We repeat, this is not a Milbank match. Davis Polk is offering even MORE money to associates.

Here is the new Davis Polk scale (compared to the Milbank scale):

- Class of 2021: $215,000 ($215,000)
- Class of 2020: $225,000 ($225,000)
- Class of 2019: $250,000 ($250,000)
- Class of 2018: $293,500 ($285,000) $8,500 more
- Class of 2017: $335,000 ($325,000) $10,000 more
- Class of 2016: $360,500 ($350,000) $10,500 more
- Class of 2015: $381,000 ($370,000) $11,000 more
- Class of 2014+: $396,500 ($385,000) $11,500 more
Davis Polk is rewarding its midlevels and senior associates with compensation increases ranging from $8,500 more to $11,500 more than the Milbank scale. This is now the scale to match. How long will it take?

Congratulations to all associates at DPW — and all associates everywhere else, because we have a feeling that the market is about to get moving!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Davis Polk.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

# Impeachophilia: The Democrats' Futile And Self-Destructive Attraction To Impeachment
## With no advantages and concrete risks, the fascination with impeachment is becoming a dangerous weakness.

If you’ve consumed any mainstream political media or even [listened to the Above the Law podcast recently](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/law-school-decision-2019-part-ii/), you’ve heard these agitated calls for Democrats in the House to “do something” and bring articles of impeachment against Donald Trump on the strength of Robert Mueller’s conclusions regarding Trump’s efforts to obstruct justice. Mueller’s painstakingly detailed report functionally put the decision to take action against the sitting president in the hands of Congress and, in the ideal world that the Framers envisioned, Congress would be taking action on the basis of this report to remove Trump from office at this moment.

But this isn’t an ideal world.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Let’s cut through all the emotion and vitriol and take a dispassionate view of the impeachment option and the intendant risks of trumpeting this extraordinary legal procedure.

The simple criteria to evaluate this process is whether or not, on balance, impeachment makes it more or less likely that Donald Trump remains president of the United States in either the short or long term. High-minded talk about constitutional obligations and moral duties is all well and good, but as the ultimate aim of impeachment is a conviction ending in removal, the most important lens for evaluating this mechanism is “does this take him out of office” full stop.

So, does impeachment make it more likely that Trump is removed from office in the short-term? No. Counting to 67 — the number of Senators required to secure a conviction in the Senate — is a relatively simple task and the Democrats fall well short.

One argument in defense of impeachment raised in our recent podcast is that there could be some vague value to “forcing Republicans to go on the record” that makes an impeachment trial valuable for reasons beyond securing a conviction. This is dubious at best and more likely cuts the other way. The argument seems to be that voting to support Trump in light of the evidence could compromise some GOP senators. Yet no trial is needed to see where most of these very senators stand — they’re gleefully sharing their conclusions on television every day — and the Senate map reveals that most of the GOP’s senators would only help themselves in the long run by sticking with Trump.

On the other hand, consider vulnerable GOP senators in “purple” states. The high bar of reaching 67 votes provides these senators all the electoral shelter they could want. Someone like Susan Collins gets to vote to convict to protect her moderate brand and walk back to an increasingly Democratic-leaning electorate and say, “yes I supported Kavanaugh and any number of unpopular Republican programs, but I tried to remove Trump from office so let’s let bygones be bygones.” Republicans can, with a wink and a nod, release multiple “purple” senators to do the same and bolster potentially shaky reelection bids.

Moving on, does impeachment make it more likely that Trump is removed from office in the long-term? Less clear, but unlikely. While a good number of Americans long ago made up their minds about this whole affair, if there are any potential swing voters left, the Trump camp believes their only interest is in finality. It’s a sentiment that liberal media helped fuel in lionizing Mueller’s investigation and setting up the eventual report as a definitive conclusion that everyone could rely upon. This, in turn, is what motivated Barr’s comical four-page summary to read more into the report than was actually there.

Would an acquittal after a five-week trial (to use the only other recent impeachment proceeding as a guide) damage Trump’s electability any more than it already has? Probably not. But would giving Trump the claim to “finality” of an acquittal bolster his chances even slightly? Almost assuredly. James Comey’s “clearing” Hillary Clinton in the summer of 2016 basically silenced the email scandal for months — and if Anthony Weiner could keep it in his pants, would have kept it politically irrelevant for the whole rest of the election. The Mueller report frustrates the administration because, on the obstruction parts anyway, it leaves lingering questions and keeps them from moving on. Say what you will about the dog and pony shows that were Fast & Furious and Benghazi, but the open-ended, harassing investigations did much more to sow doubt and stir up grassroots support for Republicans than a conclusory trial would have.

That unending harassment is more effective than a constitutional trial mechanism is certainly bad for the Republic, but it’s the reality.

A Senate trial may be rigged affair, but it would hand him the rhetorical flourish he desperately wants — “it’s over… they tried me and found nothing.” Trump would get to repeat this mantra twenty times a day for a year and a half. He gets to point and say “scoreboard” whenever anyone challenges him. For a candidate whose electoral success is entirely tied to exuding the appearance — deserved or not — of “winning” this is a tremendous risk for his opponents to invite.

To sum up, impeachment makes it no more likely that Trump is forced from office either sooner or later and only increases the risks that he prevails in the long-term by handing him a valuable campaign mantra and shoring up threatened Republican Senate seats.

But even if the reality of impeachment is a losing proposition for Democrats, could the idea of it be a winner? Many a fundraising appeal and grassroots organizing campaign will be based on the need to impeach Trump. On the other hand, setting up voters for something that they can’t deliver is a strategy fraught with risk. Could failing to follow through on the rhetoric alienate supporters and suppress turnout? It’s definitely a risk and one that grows more acute the more breathlessly it’s hyped.

So far, the Democratic presidential candidates have largely downplayed impeachment as, at most, something they support but that is ultimately tangential to their policy proposals. This seems smart… unfortunately the media doesn’t want to hear Liz Warren solve student debt when they can ask her about the big shiny object of impeachment. Every day impeachment is a top story is a day a candidate’s actual campaign pitch isn’t.

Despite all the hopes and dreams of rank-and-file Democrats over the last couple years, the only path for them is electoral victory. Yet impeachophilia keeps rearing its head everywhere you look. It’s almost, not unlike the Hulk in last year’s Infinity War, Democratic boosters are scared to come out and go head to head with Trump, having been burned before. There has to be an easier way out they surmise.

There isn’t. Raise money, organize, campaign, win — at all levels. There is no magic shortcut to replacing Trump in the White House. The sooner everyone’s honest with themselves about this, the sooner they can get down to that work in earnest.

# Associate Bonus Watch: A New And Improved Policy At Hogan Lovells
## As technology makes geography less relevant, it makes less sense to pay associates more or less in bonus money based on where they happen to sit.

We recently wondered if New York bonuses would be taking over Washington, after the D.C. powerhouse of [Covington & Burling](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/covington-burling/) adopted a [“unified scale” of “presumptive bonuses.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/associate-bonus-watch-new-york-bonuses-go-to-washington/) Today we bring you news suggesting the answer is yes.

A source at [Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/hogan-lovells/) recently shared the good news with us:

To follow up on a recent post you had about [NY vs. DC compensation](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/associate-bonus-watch-are-d-c-based-firms-cheap/), there was a new compensation policy announcement from Hogan Lovells of a nationwide bonus scale at the New York market levels. This is great news for those of us in DC who have been pushing for bonuses to match our peers in town at NY- or LA-based firms who get paid the NY scale. This also moves us well ahead of other DC-based firms, including Covington’s new convoluted policy. Previously, HL associates had to hit 2200 billable hours to get the NY bonus — now that’s down to 2000, which can include 150 pro bono hours.

The firm has rightly gotten flak in the past for being cheap — talking about being a top-tier firm, but not willing to compensate associates for the work. It’s been especially frustrating the last couple years when revenue growth in the U.S. has been approaching 20%. So Steve Immelt, our [fairly new CEO](http://www.hoganlovells.com/hogan-lovells-appoints-steve-immelt-as-new-ceo-12-17-2013/), should get credit for moving us toward the top of the market. With the discretionary bonuses outlined in the memo, many associates will now be getting a good bit more over the NY scale.

Also worth adding is that it’s a huge benefit moving away from the black box of what hours level equates to what bonus amount in the old sliding scale. Now we know exactly what we need to do to hit the market bonus.

Said a second source:

Everyone in my office is very pleased. There was a known retention problem, and this will go a long way to remedy that.

How is Hogan Lovells explaining its move? Here’s the key language from the memo (posted in full [on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/associate-bonus-watch-a-new-and-improved-policy/2)):

We have reviewed our policy for associate bonuses in all of our U.S. offices in light of current market activity. The contributions of our associates are critical to the success of the firm and we want to ensure our bonus system recognizes those contributions. Reflecting on our goals of providing associates with fair and market-based compensation and of being a well-integrated firm where work is performed across offices, regardless of where associates happen to sit, we have decided to adopt a single, nationwide discretionary bonus scale effective this compensation year (November 1, 2015 – October 31, 2016).

This makes perfect sense. As Biglaw firms become increasingly national and even global, with technology enabling greater collaboration across offices, having a geography-based caste system for comp grows harder to defend.

Congrats to Hogan Lovells associates on the better bonuses, and props to the firm for updating its policy to reflect “current market activity” and the “critical contributions” of its associates. Now that Covington and Hogan are using unified bonus scales, expect other D.C. firms to follow suit.

# Kirkland Announces Bonuses... And Associates Aren't Pleased
## The days of bonuses beating the market by 30 percent are behind us.

Is this all?

Kirkland may be the richest law firm around, but its bonuses have left associates feeling like it’s an off-brand law firm from a wholesale club.

The firm doesn’t announce lockstep bonuses with a tidy memo. But associates have historically landed bonuses [30-40 percent over market](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/kirkland-ellis-comes-to-play-with-above-market-bonuses/) and sometimes [upwards of double](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/associate-bonus-watch-kirkland-ellis-returns-to-shattering-the-bonus-market-ceiling/). More often it’s [around 25 percent over](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/after-hyping-above-market-windfall-kirkland-ellis-releases-their-bonuses/). Last year, when the firm took in record profits, associates [reported 10-15 percent premiums over the market](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/kirkland-bonuses-2021/). Was this a permanent downward trend? One tipster told us that the firm indicated that they would fix last year’s decline. In the tipster’s words, “They didn’t.”

Opening the black box of individualized bonuses is always tough, but we have multiple tips to work with at this point and it appears the firm stuck with something around 10-15 percent over market… though it looks like some high performers got close to 20 percent by our back of the envelope math.

Obviously, better than the market is still better than market. But Kirkland made its charge to the top of the Am Law universe by cultivating a reputation for paying top dollar. It’s how the firm aggressively lured talent and kept those lawyers working like machines as revenue rose higher and higher.

And a steady decline in bonus premiums over the last few years is not what associates expect from a firm with PPP that’s now north of $7 million.

Unsurprisingly, associates aren’t pleased. “No one is ever thrilled, but this was a slap in the face to the people doing the work,” wrote one. Another observed, “People are not pleased to say the least (and not just normal grumpy).” One tipster suggested that, while over market, their personal bonus figure still ended up lower than last year despite high hours.

Maybe the market has truly turned on the firm. We won’t know until we see this year’s numbers to check if that PPP figure has slumped significantly. Though that might not be enough to quell the decline in morale. And at least one associate isn’t buying it: “Blaming it on the current market is garbage.”

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Associate Bonus Watch: No News Is Good News
## This is not the most exciting announcement -- and associates are probably okay with that.

It’s January, which brings with it a new year to fill with billable hours, [new classes of law firm partners](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/new-partner-watch/), and a few new bonus announcements. While most New York-based firms announce bonuses in November and December, firms in other cities often wait until the new year to break their news. And we are standing by to cover them.

Today we bring you the bonus news of [Goodwin Procter](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/goodwin-procter-llp/). They’re individualized, with amounts to be communicated on January 24 and paid on January 25, but in the meantime, we have the memo (posted on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/associate-bonus-watch-no-news-is-good-news/2/)).

It is, in substantive terms, pretty much the same as [last year’s memo](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/associate-bonus-watch-better-than-before-by-a-bit/) — which is probably a good thing, since the 2015 bonuses received a warm reception at the firm.

There are some minor tweaks. The review category previously called “Meets Basic Expectations” is now called “Below Frameworks” — a sign that meeting expectations isn’t good enough in Biglaw? The category previously called “Strong” is now called “Successfully Achieves Frameworks” (which strikes me as a mouthful; not sure what the problem with “Strong” was). The category of “Distinctive” remains, well, “Distinctive.”

Although the Goodwin Procter bonuses are individualized, the firm does reveal information about the distribution of bonuses. The reference to “the amount listed for their class” refers to a table that tracks the market aka Cravath scale. For the 2016 bonuses, here’s the money quote:

This year, over 68% of associates are receiving bonuses. Of those receiving bonuses, 40% will receive an amount greater than the amount listed for their class, 36% will receive their class amount, and 24% will receive less than their class amount.

Here’s the comparable information for the 2015 bonuses:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
This year, over 70% of associates are receiving bonuses. Of those receiving bonuses, 42% will receive an amount greater than the amount listed below for their class, 27% will receive their class amount and 30% will receive less than their class amount.

So the percentage of associates getting bonuses and the percentage of associates getting above-market bonuses are roughly the same. The real shift takes place between people receiving market and below-market bonuses — and it’s positive for associates. For 2016, 36% are getting market and 24% are getting below market — an improvement on the 2015 figures of 27% at market and 30% below market.

The memo then discusses base salaries for 2017. No surprises here; we covered Goodwin Procter’s [move to the $180K scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-boston-based-firm-matches-cravath/) over the summer. On the bright side, the firm has not raised the 1,950-hour threshold for bonus eligibility along with salaries. Yay!

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

It’s hard out there. Beyond the health disaster that has taken hold of the nation, there is the very real economic upheaval. The financial ramifications have hit one Am Law 200 firm, in the words of a tipster, “especially hard.” At Schiff Hardin, which made $192,848,000 in 2018 gross revenue, ranking 150th on the Am Law 200, salary cuts are the order of the day, which for some attorneys will be 50 percent decreases.

While the majority of attorneys will see a 15 percent compensation cut, certain practice areas are taking an astonishing 50 percent hit. That is the largest cut to associate salaries Above the Law is tracking. The firm estimates it is 6 percent of Schiff Hardin attorneys who are taking this huge pay cut. Staff making $100,000+ will also be subject to up to a 15 percent cut, and they’ve laid off some staff members.

A spokesperson from Schiff Hardin provided the below statement, which details all of the cost-cutting measures the firm is taking:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Schiff Hardin is taking prudent steps to help the firm withstand the economic uncertainty created by the coronavirus pandemic. We are implementing various measures, including temporarily reducing compensation by 15% for most of our attorneys. About 6% of our attorneys will have their compensation reduced by up to 50% based on anticipated demand. We are reducing the salaries by up to 15% for staff who make more than $100,000, and a small number of staff will be laid off. We have canceled our summer program, but have extended offers to all five of our summer associates upon their graduation, and we have deferred the start of our incoming first year class until at least January 2021. These are challenging times for our attorneys and staff and we are asking everyone in the firm to make sacrifices and share the burden. We believe this is the right approach for our firm and will allow us to continue to provide quality service to our clients and ensure the strength of the law firm going forward as we weather this health and economic crisis.

Best of luck to those at the firm shouldering the worst of the austerity measures.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# Biglaw Firm Busts Out Special Bonuses -- But They're (Mostly) Below Market Rate
## It may not be market rate, but it's better than nothing.

Despite all the upheaval in the legal industry (and the rest of the world) in 2020, there’s also been a fair amount of good news — mostly in the form of money. Elite Biglaw firms have largely decided to hand out special bonuses — in addition to the traditional year-end bonuses — in recognition of associates’ hard work during a particularly challenging time. Now Cozen O’Connor has decided to get in on the action.

According to leadership at the firm, Cozen O’Connor had a pretty good year. And they’re willing to share that good fortune with the rank and file of the firm, from an email sent by the leadership ([available in full on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/cozen-special-bonuses/2/)):

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
We could not be more proud of the fact that we did not need to take the austerity measures that many firms took in reducing compensation of its staff and lawyers.  It proves that our business model of retaining earnings to protect against unforeseen circumstances in the economy is the absolute right way to manage a law firm.  Of course nobody could have predicted that a pandemic would test the resilience of the legal industry, but whatever the event, our financial strength set us apart from our peers.

The bonus scale at Cozen is as follows:



As you can see first year associates make out slightly better under the Cozen scale (market rate is $7,500 for them). The class of 2018 is the same as market rate. But by the class of 2017, associates are missing out compared with the market numbers. And we’re not talking about chump change — the difference for mid-level to senior associates is $10,000 to $20,000 depending on class year.

# Associate Bonus Watch: More Money At McDermott
## Associates at the firm are much, much happier this time around.

We’re well into the “new” year by now (and yesterday was the first day of spring, in fact). But we’re happy to report that the [“year of atonement”](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-another-boutique-beats-biglaw/) trend in Biglaw bonuses has carried over into 2016.

Last year, associates at [McDermott Will & Emery](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/mcdermott-will-emery/) couldn’t quite agree on whether the MWE bonuses were [“very generous” or “underwhelming.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/03/associate-bonus-watch-mixed-feelings-plus-changes-to-base-salaries-at-mcdermott-will-emery/?rf=1) This year, on the other hand, opinion is fairly uniform — and positive.

We’ll start with the facts then proceed to the opinions. Here’s a report from [Law360](http://www.law360.com/articles/773596/mcdermott-is-stuffing-associates-pockets-on-bonus-day):

More than half of McDermott Will & Emery LLP associates based in the U.S. will receive bonuses above the market rate — by as much as $45,000 in some cases, the firm said Friday.

A substantial number of associates received bonuses above the market benchmark for the sixth straight year, the firm said in a Thursday memo shared with Law360. Individual bonuses were based on evaluations of associates’ performances, including quality of work and productivity.

We have posted the memo, sent by compensation chair [John P. Hendrickson](http://www.mwe.com/John-P-Hendrickson/), on the next page. Hendrickson notes that “this year 55% of our U.S. Associates will receive bonuses in excess of the [Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2015-associate-bonuses/), including Associates in each of the seven compensation class years in which we award bonuses.” (Note that McDermott recently changed its approach to base compensation.)

Here are some opinions on the McDermott bonuses that we received from more than satisfied associates:

- “I’m happy. Technically wasn’t eligible because I missed hours, but [I got something] when I expected nothing.”
- “My sense is that most people are happy. For example, the two first-year associates I spoke with were $7,500 and $12,500 above market respectively. The firm announced that many associates exceeded NY market by as much as $45,000. If you had high billables and good reviews it was not unreasonable to nearly double market bonus in many cases.”
- “Everyone I spoke with is happy, and at or above market.”
- “Everyone seems pretty happy with bonuses…. I was below 2000 hours but received above market.”
- “Beat market. My [spouse who works at MWE] was very pleased – a partner even called to [ask how my spouse felt about the bonus], which was nice.”

Very nice indeed. And props to MWE for enhancing associate bonuses even though firm revenue remained flat. According to [Law360](http://www.law360.com/articles/773596/mcdermott-is-stuffing-associates-pockets-on-bonus-day), last month the firm reported that revenues declined by a little under a percentage point, from $900 million in 2014 to $891.5 million in 2015.

We believe there are still a few more bonus announcements that either haven’t been made or that haven’t been covered in our pages. If you can help us out, please reach out [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus%20Memo) or by text message (646-820-8477). Thanks.

# DLA Piper Partner Out Following #MeToo Allegations

 An unidentified partner at DLA Piper New Zealand is out of the firm following two “behavioural incidents” in 2017, and is under investigation by the New Zealand regulatory authority. While full details of the circumstances leading to the partner’s departure are unknown, we have some information.

As[ reported by New Zealand news outlet Stuff,](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/102838702/another-wellington-lawyer-leaves-firm-after-behavioural-incidents) the partner in question had been told not to attend the firm’s Christmas party unsupervised. What led to this mandate is unclear, but it appears to be warranted. Despite this warning, he went to the party during which the alleged incident occurred.

DLA Piper New Zealand managing partner Martin Wiseman [confirmed to American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2018/04/05/dla-piper-ditches-new-zealand-partner-after-metoo-claim/) that an incident occurred. The staff member affected reported it two days later and the firm took action:

“The firm took immediate steps in December 2017 to ensure the safety and well-being of the staff member involved,” Wiseman said.
Wiseman said that DLA Piper investigated the incident that month and subsequently reported it to the New Zealand Law Society (NZLS), a body overseeing barristers and solicitors in the country, under a “confidential reporting regime.”

“The incident is being investigated by the NZLS Standards Committee and DLA Piper New Zealand has submitted itself to a confidential NZLS process,” said Wiseman in his statement, which noted that the firm is not able to discuss any other aspects of the incident or individuals involved due to NZLS’s confidentiality requirements.

Wiseman also confirmed the parter left DLA Piper in December.

The firm also made the following statement following news of the investigation:

“Respect, inclusion and equality are central to our firm’s values,” a DLA Piper spokesman said. “We are committed to ensuring our workplace is a supportive and positive environment and expect our people to uphold the firm’s high standards. Where this is not the case appropriate action will be taken.”

We can only hope that firms dealing with sexual harassment issues are able to deal with the situation quickly and decisively. It is only with this support from firms that women will feel comfortable and safe coming forward and the real work of ending sexual harassment in the legal industry can begin.

# The Worst Of Biglaw

Just a few hours before the NCAA crowns its men’s basketball champion, we have a winner in the Above the Law March Madness Biglaw Lawyers Behaving Badly Bracket.

After two weeks  of voting, the results are in — and the winner is former Allen & Overy partner Edward De Sear, who’s serving a sentence of 17.5 years in prison for child pornography and sex trafficking a minor. Let’s all be glad there isn’t something worse lurking in the corners of Biglaw, because the crimes that De Sear committed are pretty awful.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
De Sear’s [most serious offense](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/12/it-gets-worse-ex-biglaw-partner-who-possessed-kiddie-porn-pleads-guilty-to-child-sex-trafficking/?rf=1) — the sex-trafficking one — is a stomach-churning affair. De Sear paid the child’s parents cash in 2011 to travel from Paris to Brussels with the at-the-time six-year-old and sexually abuse him. The [Bergen Record](http://www.northjersey.com/news/Saddle_River_man_sentenced_to_prison_for_sex_trafficking_charges_.html) has additional details about the crime, and the punishment for the parents involved:

Assistant U.S. Attorney Leslie Faye Schwartz told the judge that the government could prove that DeSear facilitated the child’s international travel by, among other things, paying cash to the boy’s fathers, a same-sex couple who were sentenced in Indiana earlier this year to 30 and 40 years in prison. The couple, Mark J. Newton and Peter Truong, both citizens of Australia, bought the infant from his Russian mother for $8,000 in 2005, took him to various countries where they allowed other men to abuse him, and made hardcore videos that were distributed across a global pedophile network known as the Boy Lovers network, according to authorities.

There are no words to express how awful that is.

We hope you’ve found this [trip](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/who-is-the-worst-behaved-former-biglaw-attorney) [down](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/who-is-the-worst-behaved-former-biglaw-attorney-part-2/) memory lane enlightening — and filled with plenty of cautionary tales. There were lots of Biglaw attorneys whose bad deeds we’d nearly forgotten, and it’s always good to be reminded of how bad Biglaw can get.

# Elite Law Firms Recognized As Some Of The Best For Women (2022)

Year in and year out, we watch law firm after law firm pay lip service to their commitment to diversity in the legal profession, with promises to put women attorneys on equal footing with their male counterparts, whether it be through hiring and retaining more women attorneys, promoting more women attorneys to equity partnership ranks, providing more leadership positions to women attorneys, or adopting more family-friendly policies to ensure that women attorneys are able to excel at their jobs while maintaining a stable work/life balance. Despite these continued assurances, and despite the fact that a number of firms have made great efforts to improve women’s stature in the law, there is still much more to be done.

Today, Seramount (formerly known as Working Mother Media) released its fifteenth annual list of the Best Law Firms for Women. These law firms are considered pioneers in the field when it comes to attracting, retaining, and promoting women lawyers. These law firms not only stand out as being family-friendly workplaces, but they also ensure that women shine in their equity partnership ranks.

Which firms made the cut for this year’s ranking?

To earn themselves a spot on the Best Law Firms list, self-selected applicant firms must complete an extensive application (more than 300 questions long) with topics ranging from attorney representation, schedule flexibility, paid time off and parental leaves, and development and retention of women. Questions also included ability to work from home some of the time, family-friendly benefits, and mentoring and sponsorship participation. Seramount then selected the best firms based on data provided by those firms from the year 2021. “Our Best Law Firms for Women continue to improve in many critical areas,” said Subha V. Barry, president of Seramount. “Representation of women managing partners has increased significantly and we’ve seen progress for multicultural women lawyers at every level. Our firms recognize the importance of recruiting and retaining this important talent pool and have developed the family-friendly benefits to prove it. All of these combined are important steps toward parity.”

So what do we know about the recognized firms? Forty-three percent of managing partners at the firms are women, and 38 percent of those deciding promotions to equity partner are women. Thirty-six percent of women associates at these firms are multicultural women, and 22 percent of women equity partners promoted are multicultural women. The firms average 16 weeks of paid gender-neutral parental leave and 67 percent of the firms cover in-vitro fertilization.

Without any further ado, here are this year’s honorees (in alphabetical order):

Former Simpson Thacher attorney turned founder of the $1 billion Marble Ridge Capital LP fund, Daniel Kamensky, was sentenced to time in prison after pleading guilty to bankruptcy fraud. U.S. District Judge Denise L. Cote gave him a six-month sentence after Kamensky admitted to pressuring Jefferies Financial Group to not place bids for assets being sold by Neiman Marcus in insolvency proceedings.

As [reported by](https://www.law360.com/articles/1382634) Law360, Judge Cote said Kamensky was a “good man” but his behavior was “deeply disturbing.” In sentencing, she also pointed to Kamensky’s attempt at covering up his actions:

The judge also credited Kamensky’s explanation that his conduct in pressuring Jefferies not to bid for the retailer’s MyTheresa e-commerce assets — and later asking for his contacts there to lie — was a panic move.

“He came undone. He tried to control what he could not control and in doing so he betrayed his profession,” the judge said. “He tried to get another person to lie for him. He tried to obstruct justice.”

Kamensky apologized to the court and his family for his behavior:

“There is no excuse for my behavior and I am deeply regretful and embarrassed for my conduct,” he said. “I was aware other bidders were going to come in. Whatever triggered my reaction, I will never know. It doesn’t excuse my conduct — what I did was wrong.”

Kamensky will surrender to custody by June 18th.

We’re really aiming to give them that true, in-person experience, but just doing it by another avenue.

— Jenny Connelly, Sidley Austin’s national legal recruiting director, commenting on the format of the firm’s [10-week summer associate program, which will be held virtually](https://www.law.com/2021/05/27/for-summer-associate-programs-several-law-firms-keep-pandemic-precautions-in-place/) this year, except in its Dallas and Houston offices. The firm will be hosting 180 summers, and some in-person events for everyone may be considered as the summer goes on.

# Does Not Compute: Why Don’t Law Firms Leverage Data?
## Most are late to the party.

[](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/the-legal-tech-non-event/law-firm-kpis/)Time and again, data has proven to be essential for modern businesses, and some of the biggest companies in the world rely on big and small data to make better decisions. 

So, why are law firms mostly late to the party?

We invited Mary Juetten of [Traklight](https://traklight.com/) onto the Non-Eventcast to help us find out.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But, before we kicked things off for reals, I talked to Mary about whether Valentine’s Day is a viable holiday, or just a way to sell greeting cards (3:22) — maybe it’s both? 

Then, we start off slow, by discussing what a KPI even is (5:02). Mary then talked about how processes and workflows inform the building of KPIs (10:42). 

Mary also went over when to review KPIs (18:48), including financial and qualitative metrics (21:41).  You can even solicit feedback from your clients about the viability of the KPIs you use (22:48).

Every lawyer should be using data analytics to define and refine what they do. If your law firm wants to get serious about data management, give this podcast a listen.

# Hawaii Strikes Down The Grandma Ban
## The most obvious ruling against the Travel Ban yet.

The Trump administration’s attempt to legislate bigotry was dealt another blow today when a federal judge in Hawaii ruled that grandparents count as “family,” regardless of country of origin.

It is, possibly, the most obvious ruling yet against the sloppy effort by Trump and the Roberts Court to discriminate against Muslims without looking like they’re discriminating against Muslims.

For those who haven’t been following along this summer, let’s briefly run through where we stand with the Travel Ban, so you can see how today’s decision was entirely predictable:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
- In late June, the Roberts Court [lifted the injunction](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/did-roberts-show-his-hand-on-the-travel-ban/) against Trump’s travel ban for people with no connection to the United States, but maintained it for people with a “bona fide connection” to U.S. citizens or institutions.
- Except the Court did not spell out what a “bona fide connection” would be. They left that call to the executive. It’s the kind of judicial deference that would make sense if we were dealing with a basically competent or even halfway literate executive branch.
- Instead, the unreformed bigots working for Trump came out with the narrowest possible list of bona fide connections. Which, again, would probably be fine since the Court clearly anticipated that any list emanating from this White House would be pretty narrow. But…
- This list was also stupid and inconsistent. Stepchildren counted as “family,” — which is not surprising from the President with an NBA roster of children over a minor harem of wives — [but grandparents did not](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/trump-administration-decides-grandparents-arent-real-family/?rf=1). The list was so poorly thought out that mere days after issuing it, the State Department had to revise it to include fiancés/fiancées in the group of people with bona fide connections to the U.S. Think about that for a second: you’re trying to figure out who is allowed to come into the country, and you just forget to include people about to get married to American citizens? That’s just shoddy work.
- Hawaii, and 15 other states, almost immediately sued over the administration’s narrow definition of “family.” That’s the way it’s going to work now, for the rest of Trump’s term. His policies are so obviously bigoted and so legally lazy that we’re going to end up asking the courts to “clarify” every single one.
Which brings us to U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson, who issued a total smackdown of the grandma ban. [From NBC News](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/federal-judge-loosens-travel-ban-restrictions-grandparents-others-exempt-n782826):

“The Government’s definition represents the antithesis of common sense,” Watson said in his ruling. “Common sense, for instance, dictates that close family members be defined to include grandparents.”

Watson ruled the government cannot use a main provision of the travel ban to exclude “grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and cousins of persons in the United States.”

“The Government’s definition represents the antithesis of common sense” should be the epithet for this administration. Given that Trump’s supporters know what less than 50% of those words mean, it would make a particularly elegant inscription on the regime’s headstone.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Honestly, what choice did Judge Watson have here? The Roberts Court basically said “Here son, I caught you a firefly” and Trump said “AHH, BLERRGG, SMASH STOMP STOMP, uhh… this one’s broken, can I have another one?” Watson had to say no.

I’m mildly interested to see if the Trump people appeal this decision, first to the Ninth Circuit (where they will lose again) and then to the Supreme Court. It would make no sense for them to do so, but this is Trump we’re talking about, and the rules of logic don’t apply.

But I really hope that Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy are watching what’s going on here. The Court gave the Trump administration a chance to narrowly tailor its travel ban, and they mucked it up so royally that courts had to smack it around less than a month later. If you give this administration ANY opportunity to be bigoted, THEY’LL TAKE IT. And they’ll take it in an embarrassing, shoddy way that all but requires the courts to step in again.

Is this what the Supreme Court wants? Do they want to authorize a narrow travel ban, which the administration quickly metastasizes into a broader Muslim Ban, which the courts then have to step in and curtail again?

You give this administration an inch, and it’ll take a mile-long dump on Twitter, making you look stupid for anticipating anything less. The question is really: How many other travel ban cases does Roberts want to hear in his lifetime?

# Holy Guacamole! Foley Considers Tex-Mex Flair
## Another law firm looks to Texas.

Foley & Lardner tried to [get together with Britain’s Eversheds](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/holy-moly-a-gigantic-transatlantic-merger-for-foley/) for some tea and crumpets. Unfortunately, [that fell apart](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/foley-lardner-to-leave-eversheds-standing-at-the-altar/). Then they [eyed Friedman Kaplan](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/holy-moly-an-incestuous-law-firm-merger-for-foley/) for a slice of New York’s litigation pie. But we’ve heard nothing else about that.

But perhaps Tex-Mex is more Foley’s speed. Because yesterday, we learned that [Foley & Lardner is in merger talks with Texas firm Gardere Wynne Sewell](http://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2017/10/31/foley-lardner-gardere-mull-potential-merger/). When you consider that Gardere just last month [took on Bufete Hernández Romo](http://www.texaslawyer.com/home/id=1202800684505/Gardere-Expands-in-Mexico-City-With-5-Litigation-Lawyers), a Mexico City commercial arbitration and litigation boutique, it seems Foley might be very interested in moving into the hopping Texas and Mexico markets, both areas where the 19-office Foley has no presence today.

And Texas is a smoking hot legal market with Houston’s reliable energy business and the multiple corporate headquarters dotting the greater Dallas area. There aren’t a lot of places in the U.S. where law firms can find demand, but Texas is one of them. For now. And with [the cost of living near rock bottom](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/), Texas is drawing top-notch talent seeking to make the most of those $180K first-year salaries. Meanwhile, the legal market in Mexico sits at the crossroads. Full of talent and rife with opportunities thanks to the open market with the U.S., lawyers have every reason to feel good about the Mexican legal landscape… if it weren’t for the White House periodically calling to “renegotiate” NAFTA and build an onerous wall along the border to slow the flow of trade to a crawl. Consider the Mexico portion of this deal a high-risk, high-reward proposition.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Will this deal go through? Foley doesn’t have the greatest track record on that count with a pair of big ticket mergers dying on the vine over the last few years.

On the other hand, the American Lawyer notes someone has already registered www.foleygardere.com, which in merger terms is the equivalent of moving to the “It’s Complicated” status on Facebook. So there’s that.

[Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/morning-docket/)
# Morning Docket: 03.10.16
## * Justice Elizabeth Warren? While that may have a nice ring to it for some, given the extreme political gridlock that any Supreme Court nominee -- much less someone who's considered a staunch Democrat -- will be subjected to in the Senate, it's just not something that's ever likely to happen during President Obama's last term. [[CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/08/politics/elizabeth-warren-supreme-court/)] * Not that he was a very likely choice to begin with, but Judge Adalberto Jordan of the Eleventh Circuit has asked that he be taken out of consideration for a Supreme Court nomination to fill the vacancy left by the late Justice Antonin Scalia.

* Justice Elizabeth Warren? While that may have a nice ring to it for some, given the extreme political gridlock that any Supreme Court nominee — much less someone who’s considered a staunch Democrat — will be subjected to in the Senate, it’s just not something that’s ever likely to happen during President Obama’s last term. [[CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/08/politics/elizabeth-warren-supreme-court/)]

* Not that he was a very likely choice to begin with, but Judge Adalberto Jordan of the Eleventh Circuit has asked that he be taken out of consideration for a Supreme Court nomination to fill the vacancy left by the late Justice Antonin Scalia. He would’ve been the Court’s first Cuban-American justice if appointed and confirmed.

Hooboy! Judge Jeffrey Beaverstock of the Southern District of Alabama sure isn’t happy with Outokumpu Stainless USA, a steel mill, and their attorneys at Littler Mendelson PC. Outokumpu is the defendant in an hour-and-wage lawsuit and Judge Beaverstock has [taken them to task ](https://www.law360.com/pulse/articles/1442176)for discovery abuses — more than just calling them out, he entered a default judgment on liability in favor of the plaintiffs, and over the course [of a 94(!)-page order](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.alsd.63006/gov.uscourts.alsd.63006.344.0_1.pdf), he does not hold back.

I mean, he starts out strong from the jump:

This case is lamentable. Mercifully, it is rare. Here, the Court is compelled to protect not only plaintiffs but the Court itself from a defendant’s pervasive bad faith.

And what does “pervasive bad faith” even mean? Well, Judge Beaverstock is happy to detail the issues:

Time and pay records are of primary importance in FLSA actions. Defendant refused to produce complete and accurate records and misrepresented to the Court and Plaintiffs material facts surrounding its refusals. The Magistrate Judge entered orders and imposed sanctions against Defendant through the course of discovery, but Defendant was undeterred. Defendant persisted in its misconduct through the date set for final pre-trial conference, at which point Defendant still had not produced basic time and pay records. As a consequence, the Court was left with no choice but to cancel the pre-trial conference and, instead, conduct a general status conference. This was followed by show cause hearings to address Defendant’s failures. For the reasons set out below, the Court determines default judgment is the only remaining sanction sufficient to address Defendant’s bad faith and the damage wrought by it.

Yeah, Judge Beaverstock details — and I mean DETAILS, the opinion is 94 pages after all — defendant’s problematic behavior including: repeated refusals to produce the necessary documents; blaming its delays on a third-party payroll processor, Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (“ADP”); lack of response to allegations defendants doctored key documents; ignoring a motion to compel; and refusing to take responsibility for the discovery delays. It’s a real journey y’all.

But rather than get mired in the deets, let us peruse the deft way Judge Beaverstock deals with the situation — all emphasis added:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Defendant’s discovery obligations in this action were not novel. Defendant’s discovery failures, though, were extraordinary resulting in a long train of discovery and sanction motions against it.

The record is littered with discovery orders, discovery conferences, motions to compel, and motions for sanctions, all designed to deter Defendant from its continuing obstinate refusal to produce its time and pay records.

Since October 2018, Defendant repeatedly represented to the Magistrate Judge and to Plaintiffs that it would cooperate with discovery requests and comply with court orders. When Defendant failed to cooperate or comply as represented, it offered a variety of excuses, and then made more representations. Defendant then dishonored those representations. Then, Defendant commenced the whole sorry pattern over again. This pattern of Defendant’s misconduct poisoned the entirety of this case. As set out below, it is now clear that Defendant’s misconduct was deliberate and in bad faith.

Defendant did not rebut the substantive, and substantial accusations, it had doctored and produced false records. Likewise, Defendant did not explain, at all, why it had refused to produce records it had previously agreed to provide. Rather, Defendant argued its “production issues” were due to the Plaintiffs’ unreasonable requests and an uncooperative third-party payroll provider, ADP, maintaining there was no evidence to support Defendant’s actions were in bad faith. (Docs. 220 and 246). To be clear, in response to sanctions, twice, Defendant abdicated, dodged and misconstrued its responsibility for its own failures.

At every turn, Defendant delayed, obfuscated, violated or outright ignored the Court’s orders, resulting in inefficiencies and confusion, and ultimately delayed resolution of a case Defendant represented as one that would be fairly simply to resolve. (Doc. 91). Throughout, the alleged violative pay practices continue, a potential boon to Defendant. A clear picture of willful and prejudicial discovery abuse, requiring imposition of the strictest of sanctions, emerges.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The Court cannot ignore Defendant’s calculated sabotage of the judicial process.

Defendant withheld and failed to produce “linchpin” evidence. Defendant engaged in flagrant bad faith designed to derail the orderly resolution of Plaintiffs’ lawsuit.

However, when the pattern is viewed in the context of the entire case, it is clear Defendant’s tactics were subversive and its behavior manipulative, intentionally designed to undermine the Court’s orders and authority over the discovery process.

It really comes across as cartoony behavior — something observers have pointed out.

Sometimes, you just need to take the W. Discretion is the better part of valor and all that, so when circumstances contrive to hand you a procedural victory, accept the win graciously and don’t try to rub it in — least of all not when there’s a federal judge waiting to slap you back down.

Eastern District of Pennsylvania Judge Chad F. Kenney lashed out at attorneys Robert Sanzo of Litchfield Cavo representing Walgreens and Jacqueline Promislo of Cozen O’Connor repping Bilco Industries over conduct that “evinces bad faith and a profound defection from the standard litigation process.”

So what happened? Well, it was a personal injury case involving a Bilco manufactured ladder at a Walgreens location. And the Walgreens expert, Jody DeMarco, allegedly lied on the stand about whether the attorneys knew DeMarco was returning to the site of the accident to conduct their own tests. As [reported by](https://www.law.com/thelegalintelligencer/2024/03/13/judge-scolds-litchfield-cavo-cozen-oconnor-attorneys-for-disrespect-for-court/) Law.com:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
While the court struck the testimony, instructing the jury it should not be considered as evidence, “the court was still under the impression that DeMarco proceeded to the site at his own discretion,” which was not true, the opinion said.

“Still, even at that moment while DeMarco was still on the stand, attorneys Sanzo and Promislo had effectively blindsided the court, and in doing so diminished the process and demonstrated their disrespect for the sitting judge,” Kenney said. “It was only after the verdict, and the court review of emails by and between Sanzo and DeMarco, and Sanzo and Promislo, that the court became aware of the full depth of disrespect.”

The plaintiff moved for a new trial, but Judge Kenney denied the motion, saying, the testimony regarding the site visit “was altogether redundant.” The Third Circuit upheld the district court’s decision and only then did plaintiff seek sanctions, which were denied as untimely.

Rather than take that victory, Sanzo and Promislo tried to play their Uno reverse card and filed their own motion for sanctions and a bill of costs. Given their “demonstrated record of unclean hands,” Judge Kenney was having exactly none of that.

While the defendants were the prevailing party, the court denied the bill of costs over the attorneys’ conduct in the previous suit, finding Sanzo and Promislo “were in flagrant disregard for the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.”

The attorneys’ representations to the court were evasive and misleading, noting that “at a critical point in the trial defendants failed to provide the bare-minimum respect and candor owed to plaintiff McManus, his attorneys, and this court,” the court said.

“Defendants’ victory in the case and failure to receive sanctions (on procedural grounds) does not expiate their abdication of duty as officers of the court,” Kenney said. “Counsel must ask themselves whether it was worth it. Unfortunately, there are those who would answer that a win is a win no matter how you get it.”

Not every motion is worth it. While you may think, “what’s the worst they can do? Deny it?” The harsh treatment the attorneys got in this case show — if you value your pride — there’s plenty a judge can do.

# Why Is It So Hard To Stifle Yourself?

It’s been a while since I’ve had a “what were they thinking?” post. I wasn’t thinking about writing one now, but I couldn’t resist, given the plethora of gaffes from the merely stupid to the absolutely outrageous and deserving of discipline.

Let’s start with the judge who asked an alleged rape victim whether she had closed her legs. No, he wasn’t joking, and of course, it was a male judge who asked the question. I think that any female judge would have known better than to humiliate an alleged sexual assault victim. And I didn’t know whether there is such a thing as the “closed legs” defense in a rape case. Would an “open legs” defense be better? The judicial ethics board has recommended that the [judge be removed](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/01/judge-asks-alleged-rape-victim-if-she-closed-her-legs-judicial-ethics-panel-asks-judge-to-step-down/), based not only on this incident, as egregious as it is on its own, but also on other prior incidents. Shame on him, but why with “priors,” so to speak,  wasn’t he woodshedded previously?

Then there’s the judge in New York [who has resigned](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/01/jurist-of-the-year-resigns-amid-investigation-into-abusive-personal-demands/) and agreed to never seek judicial office again, the death penalty sanction. He had been judge of the year in 2018. Oops. Why did he resign? Apparently, he created a hostile work environment, not just recently, but since he had taken the bench years ago. What the hell took so long? (I know, I know, fear of job loss, retaliation, and other similar reasons.) It wasn’t just a case of being asleep at the Rip Van Winkle switch for the conduct to have gone on for so long without any consequences. Finally, someone or more than one someone woke up. Better late than never.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Although not a judge, and unlikely to ever be one, [Michael Avenatti](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/above-the-laws-2018-lawyer-of-the-year-contest-the-winner/), ATL’s 2018 Lawyer of the Year (everyone makes mistakes, even ATL) is [now in court](https://nypost.com/2020/01/29/nike-lawyer-recalls-alleged-blackmail-by-michael-avenatti-as-trial-starts/), not as a lawyer, but defendant. (Karma is a bitch.) Whatever happens in New York will not be the end of [Avenatti’s legal troubles](https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/attorney-michael-avenatti-named-federal-grand-jury-indictment-accuses-him-stealing). He faces trial this spring in Orange County (we like to call it the “O.C. ”) [for embezzlement and tax fraud](https://www.kusi.com/judge-sets-may-2020-trial-date-for-michael-avenatti/).

The State Bar is breathing heavily down his neck, having [filed disciplinary charges](http://members.calbar.ca.gov/fal/Licensee/Detail/206929). Will the outcome of the various criminal proceedings determine what kind of discipline the State Bar will impose? Unlikely, as the State Bar’s mission is public protection.

Memo to self: [don’t lift language from confirmation hearings](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/lawyer-is-reprimanded-for-lifting-quotes-from-supreme-court-justices-on-her-judicial-application) of United States Supreme Court nominees without attribution. Sounds simple, right? An Arizona lawyer has been reprimanded for lifting quotes in her application for a seat on the state’s court of appeal. The quotes were from Justices Samuel Alito and Neal Gorsuch. Reading what she lifted, the sentiments expressed in those quotes are not unique to those two nominees or any other judicial candidate. Couldn’t she have rephrased them in her own words? She’s since withdrawn her application.

You youngsters probably don’t remember Zoe Baird and the Nannygate issue that derailed her nomination as Attorney General for Bill Clinton. Much the same happened to Clinton’s second nominee, Kimba Wood. [Janet Reno had no kids](https://www.newsweek.com/nannygate-ii-womens-backlash-195214) and no Nannygate issue, so she became Clinton’s attorney general.

In Montana, a judge faces accusations [about the truthfulness of her legal employment](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/judge-is-accused-of-misstatements-about-nanny-employment-and-legal-experience) and her nanny’s employment, the latter being the pretty much the same issue that precluded both Baird and Wood from the Attorney General’s gig.

Is Nannygate an issue that only attaches to women lawyers?I Googled the term “male lawyers Nanny Gate” and found that almost all references were to women lawyers, but several prominent men were [caught in Nannygate years ago](https://people.com/archive/nannygate-revisited/).

Since women have the bulk of the majority for child care, care for aging/infirm parents, and any and all other cares named or unnamed, it’s not surprising that one of the main reasons that women leave Biglaw is that these kinds of cares are almost always the exclusive territory of the women. Nothing new there. Will there ever be? [Childcare Commitments Are Driving Women Out of Big Law | The American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2019/12/03/childcare-commitments-are-driving-women-out-of-big-law/)

We all make stupid mistakes, maybe not criminal, but stupid, thoughtless, and with the ability to put our feet in our mouths — one of the few things I have had no trouble doing since infancy. Perhaps if we could just keep our mouths closed until we have something of value to say and not just something that we think it cute or funny or au courant.

If there was only a device that would allow us to eat our words before we could speak them, a sort of implanted word shredder, a self-censoring Twitter. We might be a whole lot better off, and perhaps a whole lot less disciplined.

# Newly Merged Biglaw Firm Lays Off Attorneys Amid COVID-19 Upheaval

The Midwestern firm of Taft Stettinius & Hollister finalized its merger with Minneapolis-based Briggs and Morgan in the early days of 2020. Remember January? It seems like several years ago now, before the pall of coronavirus overtook every facet of our lives. Anyway, back then, the [merger went off without issue](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/01/03/taft-lathrop-gpm-officially-tie-the-knot-kicking-off-2020-law-firm-mergers/), and the new and improved Taft Law firm looked to [break into the Am Law 100](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/08/30/midwestern-merger-has-taft-stettinius-bound-for-the-am-law-200/).

“There were no hiccups or problems we didn’t anticipate,” said Steven Ryan, the partner in charge of Taft’s Minneapolis office. Taft managing partner Robert Hicks expressed similar sentiments, saying while there was some “scrambling” at one point, “it couldn’t have gone any better.”

Anyway, the world is a very different place now.

Though the firm claims strong financials, they’ve determined the prudent course of action is a regimen of austerity measures. From Taft Law’s statement (available in full on the next page) on the cost-cutting:

Taft substantially out-performed its budgets in 2018 and 2019 and is performing ahead of budget through March 31, 2020. As a result of conservative financial management, Taft maintains a strong balance sheet and liquidity. Notwithstanding its strong financial position, as a result of the significant disruption to the global and United States economies that already has occurred as well as the anticipated, pervasive effects of COVID-19 that almost certainly will disrupt those economies for the next several months, Taft adopted a comprehensive COVID-19 Financial Plan, effective April 1.

So what is the firm doing to cut costs? Well, partner draws were cut by 25 percent, and the firm had to make layoffs — of both attorneys and staff — and they’ve left the door open for additional austerity measures, should they be necessary:

Under Taft’s COVID-19 Financial Plan, all partner draws were reduced by 25% and minimal reductions – spread across all of its seven primary offices – were made in attorney headcount (1.4% firm wide) and staff headcount (3.5% firm wide). Given the significant uncertainty of COVID-19’s financial impact on the firm’s many clients, the forward-looking plan contemplates multiple scenarios and pivot points to help firm leadership select the best course of action based on future information and conditions as they develop.

Taft’s Chairman and Managing Partner Robert J. Hicks had this to say about the firm’s COVID-19 plan:

“We are very thankful for our size, scale and financial strength, together with the remarkable loyalty and culture of our clients and personnel. These advance, conservative measures are merely intended to add to our existing strong financial and liquidity positions so that we can better weather the COVID-19 storm while we help guide our clients through this time. Taft prides itself on looking forward and never hesitating to invest in or protect our future. We view this proactive approach as the appropriate and best practice in this situation.”

# More Law Firm Offices Should Have Gyms
## Some lawyers and staff will head into the office more if offices had gyms since they can 'kill two birds with one stone' by going to work and exercising.

As discussed on this and other legal news outlets, law firms have been implementing various initiatives to try to convince employees to return to offices. Some law firms have offered free meals and other benefits, while other firms just forced attorneys and staff to return to offices or face adverse employment consequences. Since such explicit policies about returning to work are not popular, law firms should focus on providing benefits and other resources that make it easier for lawyers and staff to return to offices. Assuming law firms have the space and resources, shops should consider having gyms in their offices to help convince attorneys to return to work.

I admit that having a gym at a law firm office is pretty rare. In fact, I never worked at a firm that had an in-house fitness center (although I have worked at shops which had gyms nearby that employees could use for free or at a discount). However, I once interviewed at a law firm that had a gym right in the office.

Back when I was a 2L in law school, I did a number of callbacks for summer associate gigs in the New Jersey ‘burbs. I was taking a tour of one of the firms, and the office resembled the dozen or so other law firms I had visited. However, the tour guide then took me to the law firm’s gym, which was located right off the main row of offices on the bottom floor of the firm’s building.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The gym was relatively large, perhaps the size of a fitness center in a big apartment building. There were free weights, benches, and exercise machines that looked relatively new. Inside the gym, two attorneys were pumping iron, and one of the lawyers was spotting the other. Both were talking shop, but I am unsure if they were billing for the conversation or not! The tour guide said that the office had a few private bathrooms that included showers, so people could freshen up after the gym if they wished.

After seeing this gym, I expected that a lot of law firms would have fitness centers at which attorneys and staff could work out, but I never came across another law firm gym in my entire career. Law firms often have expansive offices that sometimes span several floors. These offices can include cafeterias, media rooms, and all manner of amenities. However, it seems like most of even the biggest law firms do not have gyms at their offices.

Creating a fitness center in a law firm office can have a number of benefits. Firstly, and I am not health expert, but having a fitness center can likely improve the health and lives of employees. Numerous people do not exercise enough, likely due to the fact that people do not have access to a fitness center or the time to travel to one and then work out. This can not only affect someone’s general health but their mood and productivity. However, if employees had a gym in their office, it would be easier to go to a gym, and these employees would realize all of the health and life benefits of exercise.

Having a law firm gym can also improve team cohesion at a firm. As previously mentioned, I saw a few lawyers bonding at the law firm gym I visited, and it is important to communicate with colleagues in a more casual setting to have the best collaboration. A gym can provide this benefit since employees who use the gym have the shared mission of working out and might even participate in group classes and the like, which can increase teamwork and rapport more explicitly.

Moreover, having a gym in a law firm office might nudge employees to return to offices. Many employees need to travel to a gym several times a week in order to work out, and depending on where they live and where their gym is located, this can involve a substantial amount of time. I am willing to bet that some lawyers and staff will head into the office more if offices had gyms since they can “kill two birds with one stone” by going to work and exercising. Of course, some people are not interested in exercise, but those that are might be more willing to be in an office if a fitness center is too.

Of course, there are numerous practical considerations law firms need to evaluate when deciding to open a gym in a law firm office. Gyms needs to be properly maintained, and law firms need to ensure that lawyers and staff are safe when using fitness equipment. However, for law firms with enough space and resources, having a fitness center in the office can be a great way to encourage people to come back to work and promote the health of employees.

# 3 Takeaways From The Lex Machina 2023 Patent Report
## A little less than half of the damages awarded in 2020 have already been reversed on appeal, which may not bode very well for big verdicts achieved in 2021 and 2022 as well.

It is [Lex Machina](https://lexmachina.com/) Patent Report time. I covered the release [last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/3-takeaways-from-the-lex-machina-2022-patent-report/), as well as in [2021](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/3-takeaways-from-the-lex-machina-2021-patent-report/). As always, I highly recommend that readers [register](https://pages.lexmachina.com/2023PatentReport_LP.html) for the report and give it a read, as there may be more relevant information in the report than what follows for any given reader.

As I did in 2021 and 2022, what follows are three idiosyncratic takeaways based on my review. First, the report’s information on damages deserves further consideration. Second, we can discuss why some defendants have seen a significant decrease in patent cases filed against them. Third, we will check in on happenings in the PTAB, which remains as relevant as ever.

We can start with a look at what the report says about the value of patent cases from a damages perspective. In each year from 2020-2022, total damages awarded in patent cases exceeded $2.8 billion per year, reaching a high of $3.39 billion in 2021. Yet, a little less than half of the damages awarded in 2020 have already been reversed on appeal, which may not bode very well for big verdicts achieved in 2021 and 2022 as well. Still these numbers help illustrate the economic significance of the patent litigation industry, while also reinforcing why patent litigation remains such an important area of investment focus for litigation funders.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Interestingly, the number of cases in which damages were awarded in 2022 (67) is nearly 50% higher than the number of successful cases in 2020 (45). Could that be a sign of better diligence by funders and patent owners leading to better outcomes in patent cases? Or is it just a blip because of COVID-19’s impact in 2020? Either way, 2022’s successful case tally of 67 is the highest in any year since 2013, with the only other year having more than 60 damages-earning patent cases being 2017. It makes sense that the more rigorous diligence engendered by a more sophisticated patent assertion funding market should lead to a better batting average for patent owners in court. But more data is needed on that front before diligence counsel servicing funding groups can take a victory lap.

As large as the damages award numbers may seem, however, it is also important to place them in context. Between 2020-2022, reasonable royalty damages totaling $7.5 billion were awarded to patent owners across 102 successful cases. While those damages figures may be large in comparison to those achievable in other areas of litigation, they also pale in comparison to share price swings faced by frequent patent defendants. For example, in the biggest market value swing on record, Meta (Facebook) [lost $](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/biggest-singleday-market-cap-drops-us-stocks/)232 billion in value last February. That is 232 billion dollars in value lost in one month. In comparison, patent litigation risk seems trivial for a company that size. Yet, Meta, together with other large technology companies, fight patent cases worth $5 million with the same vigor as one worth $50 million — and $50 million is still a large damages award in a patent case, irrespective of the market cap of the losing defendant. In context, therefore, even the highest level of patent damages achieved can look like a rounding error on a publicly traded company’s balance sheet. At the same time, it is important to remember that the true value of filing or defending a patent case may not lie solely in the damages achievable or saved in the case.

Given the importance of damages in patent cases, it is interesting to see what is going on with the list of most active defendants in patent cases for our next report takeaway. For the Big Three (Apple, Samsung, and Google), the number of cases filed against them has either held pretty steady (Google) in 2020-2022 or saw a big jump between 2020 and 2021 only to moderately drop in 2022 (Apple and Samsung). For the latter group, the drop may be fed by the fact that Apple and Samsung are perennial targets for funded cases, which take longer to diligence and get going. (And as funding becomes more prevalent, the number of nonfunded patent cases filed against the Big Three target may actually be declining, which would be an interesting question for the in-house teams at these companies to comment on at some point.) What is even more interesting than the developments among the Big Three, however, is that three of the four next-most targeted defendants saw significant declines in cases filed against them when we compare 2020 versus 2022. And we are not talking about niche companies. Microsoft (40 cases in 2020 to 23 in 2022,) LG (from 27 to 19), and Dell (36 to 13) all saw big drops.

In that same span, both Microsoft and Dell saw big jumps in revenue, with LG[ reporting](https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2023/01/lg-announces-2022-financial-results/) that 2022 was its best year ever financially. How to explain their newfound unpopularity as patent defendants then? Here too, there is a chance that funding’s presence may have contributed to a reduced appetite for cases where the damages may not be as high as they would be against the Big Three, for example. One consideration, of course, is that for funders, anything that could prevent achieving the biggest financial result possible is a challenge. In that paradigm, even if a patent owner had a meritorious case involving laptop technology that could be brought against both Apple and Dell, as an example, there can sometimes be little incentive to file both cases at the same time, unlike in the prefunding days, where contingency counsel and their clients would often try to target as many large defendants that a portfolio could sustain.

A reluctance to file two cases against targets with disparate damages potential under certain circumstances is understandable. First off, filing that second case just adds to the amount of money needed from the funder, which is expensive capital for any patent owner to take on. Second, no one benefits from a settlement from the smaller target that is unable to cover the cost of funding both cases, or more importantly, could potentially impact on the damages potential of the larger case. Likewise, the availability of IPR can also discourage a plaintiff from filing against multiple defendants, for a number of obvious reasons in terms of cost and risk to the patents asserted. The strategic considerations can be complicated, but there is no doubt that the report is showing that the number of patent cases against second-tier targets, no matter how huge their revenues, has shown a steep decline these past few years. Perhaps this trend will continue.

Finally, the statistics for patent owners out of the PTAB remain sobering. For instituted IPRs, the chance of all claims surviving is a heady 6% compared with a 21% all challenged claims murder rate in the challenger’s favor. Add in a CAFC affirmance rate of 75% or so and it is clear that the IPR hurdle remains a significant one for patent owners to overcome. It is not surprising, therefore, that the number of IPR filings has held pretty steady between 2020-2022, or that the Big Three remain the PTAB’s most frequent customers.

Ultimately, if any one had the mistaken thought that patent litigation is a stultified endeavor, the report’s presentation of data that illustrates just how much things have changed between 2020 and 2022 should be enough to disabuse them of that notion. Once again, perhaps the most gratifying takeaway for me from reading the report is a sense of gratitude in having my professional home grounded in such a vital and interesting area of practice. I am sure that many in this readership feel the same way. Thanks once again to Lex Machina for pulling together and presenting the data in a way that highlights the richness of the patent litigation mosaic.

# This Biglaw Firm Is The First To Offer Billable Hours For 'Sustainability' Work

Lawyers, do you remember when you wanted to save the world? One Biglaw firm hopes that you still do — and they’re going to let you bill for it.

Reed Smith — a firm ranked at No. 28 in the most recent Am Law 100, which brought home $1,436,171,000 gross revenue in 2021 — recently introduced a program that will allow associates to count up to 25 hours of leadership, training, advocacy and development work tied to environmental sustainability towards their billable hour targets.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Reed Smith’s sustainability hours begin in June. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/sustainability-is-latest-cause-earn-hourly-credit-corporate-law-firms-2022-05-19/) has more information:

Qualifying work could include serving as a leader on the firm’s internal “Green Team,” organizing sustainability-focused meetings and initiatives, working on client partnerships or joining groups such as the Net Zero Lawyers Alliance, the firm said.

Law firms use annual billable hour targets to set performance expectations and allocate bonuses to associates and other salaried attorneys, who may bill up to several hundred dollars per hour for client work. Leaders at Reed Smith said they believe the firm is the first to count non-client sustainability activities in such calculations.

“It’s good, relevant work, which I think lawyers are looking for,” said Rebecca Hammond, the firm’s chief administrative officer.

It’s worth noting that not only do some of Reed Smith’s lobbying clients include ExxonMobil and Dominion Energy, but that Law Students for Climate Accountability gave the firm a “D” rating on its latest Law Firm Climate Change Scorecard, which the advocacy group uses to rate firms based on their representation of fossil fuel clients. Perhaps the firm is hoping that it may be able to turn things around for itself — and the planet — with its new program.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Biglaw Yelp Reviews Are Your Dose Of Surreal Comedy Today

Writing Yelp reviews of Biglaw firms as though they were functioning NYC restaurants started off as a bit of a lark. But after Yelper Samuel G. got started, he couldn’t help himself and put together a few more narratives of a hapless patron stumbling into law firms thinking they’re restaurants.

Hey, it beats stumbling into firms and [thinking they’re mid-grade shoe stores](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/biglaw-firm-rebrands-and-the-new-logo-is-lets-just-say-unconventional/).

This isn’t entirely inaccurate. What law firm isn’t opting for an “eat what you kill” model? But with only 4 stars, I don’t think Samuel got the full V&E experience. The last patron who felt they made a mistake going to Vinson & Elkins [walked away with $30 million](https://www.chron.com/business/enron/article/Vinson-Elkins-settles-with-Enron-for-30-million-1895559.php).



Note that the S&C people didn’t look up from their monitors long enough to say anything meta to Samuel like the V&E folks did. That tracks.

On the other hand, how was he walking so close to other pedestrians by the S&C offices. It’s a ghost town down there.



A 5-star review! Just goes to show you the importance of a clean bathroom.

But kidding aside, this gives us an idea if any of the big NYC firms are up for it. Let’s have a cafeteria competition! If we get a critical mass of interested firms, we’ll put together a panel of judges and sample, say, your best two dishes and award the best cafeteria in Biglaw. We can work out the precise details later. Would firms be willing to put their money where their mouths are — and by that I don’t mean talk, but, you know, the food they eat.

# Biglaw Attorney Arrested In Florida Road Rage Stabbing

Patrick Scruggs mugshot

Attorney Patrick Scruggs was arrested following a wild road rage incident. The lawyer, who previously worked as a federal prosecutor that handled some of the January 6th riot cases and most recently was employed as of counsel at Barnes & Thornburg, is accused of stabbing a man with a pocket knife on a Tampa bridge.

As [described by](https://lawandcrime.com/crime/florida-man-accused-of-road-rage-stabbing-is-a-former-federal-prosecutor-who-went-after-jan-6-rioters/) Law & Crime, the incident began during rush hour when a car stopped on the bridge for “unknown reasons.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The driver of that first car was identified as a 35-year-old man by the Florida Highway Patrol in a press release. His sedan had blocked some of the southbound lanes and the driver was visibly slumped over.

Upon noticing the distressed fellow motorist, a couple from Tampa – identified as a 40-year-old man and his 43-year-old wife – stopped just in front of the sedan and got out of their car to try and render aid to the man behind the wheel because of “the hazard,” the FHP says.

The driver of the second car was unable to get inside, so he went to find something to break the first car’s window and help the driver out, according to law enforcement. Just as that was about about to happen, however, the first driver woke up and jammed on the gas pedal – careening into the helpful couple’s car. Then, the driver tried to maneuver around the car he had just hit by backing up.

That’s when he reversed into Scruggs’ car, the FHP says.

The lawyer, who had been driving by the incident at the time his car was struck, got out of his vehicle, according to law enforcement. Then he allegedly managed what the second driver could not – walking over and breaking the 35-year-old man’s window. After getting through, the defendant pulled out a “pocket knife” and stabbed the 35-year-old over and over, according to troopers.

Scruggs was arrested on charges of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, aggravated assault, and armed burglary. He was released on $65,000 surety bond.

And his Biglaw career seems to have hit a bump, with a firm representative saying, “He is no longer employed with Barnes & Thornburg.”

But there may be more to the tale, at least according to Scruggs’s attorney. “There is much more to this incident than what is being reported and we are diligently working to bring to light the full facts of what occurred. We urge that the public keep an open mind and withhold from making judgments. We will bring forth all of the facts and make them known to the authorities in the proper forum.”

# Another $200K Biglaw Compensation Match
## Associates at the firm are very happy!

The Biglaw market seems to be moving pretty quickly in response to Milbank’s move to $200,000 in first-year associate compensation.

Just a few short hours after the associate salary raises were announced, we have another firm stepping up to the plate and matching the new market standard. Today Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft announced they’d be bumping up associate salaries between $10,000 – $15,000, depending on class year.

The new salary scale is as follows, effective July 1:

Class              Salary
2020/21         $200,000

2019                $210,000

2018                $230,000

2017                $270,000

2016                $295,000

2015                $320,000

2014                $340,000

2013                $355,000

You can read the firm’s [full announcement on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/cwt-match/2/)

CWT isn’t a firm known for sticking its neck out, compensation-wise. As a tipster noted:

Cadwalader already matched, which is shocking after it spent so much time last year trying to skimp on bonuses, and they’re seldom early movers. Guess they are trying to win people back over. We’ll take it!
Looks like all signs are pointing towards a big money summer in Biglaw this year.
Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Milbank) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Milbank”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

Matt Ritter

[Matt Ritter](http://www.laterallink.com/about/team/181) is a Senior Director of Legal Recruiting focusing on law firm and in-house placements in California and New York. He went to Penn Law (’05), worked at Mayer Brown and Kirkland as a corporate associate, then toured as a comedian, wrote and produced a few hit TV shows… and is now trying to help lawyers find their dream jobs! You could say he’s not your typical recruiter. He can be reached at mritter@laterallink.com or 917-576-0049.

It’s almost the end of the year, and you’re still at the firm you said you were going to leave. Still?! You’re not quite sure why you’re still there, but you know you have your reasons. Maybe it’s time for a little self reflection. We at Lateral Link believe there are plenty of good reasons to stay at a firm, but there are also a LOT of bad ones. Since you all loved the one he did [last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/10-horrible-reasons-youre-still-at-your-law-firm/?rf=1), here’s another quick video from a legal recruiter and comedian, Matt Ritter, with 13 really bad reasons to stay at your firm. If any one of these is you, please call us or email us at Lateral Link so we can help you with your Stockholm Syndrome.

Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Salaries Are Up And So Are The Non-Traditional Benefits
## The key to finding an employer that fits your style may be in the perks.

While salaries and bonuses drive most of the excitement for premier positions around here, benefits actually vary wildly between jobs and can make a big difference. If your firm matches your 401k contributions that can be a tremendous boon to your bottom line. If your firm’s health insurance forces you to jump through a million hoops to see a doctor, that’s going to put you in a permanent state of distress.

And employers know this, which is why we’ve seen an uptick in the [quality of perks offered](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/03/atl-march-madness-which-perk-do-you-want-from-your-firm/) in the legal industry over the last several years.

Special Counsel has released its annual salary and compensation guide for employers and candidates across in-house legal departments and law firms, collecting responses from over 6000 respondents across the country. Before we go any further, let’s get the big ticket item out of the way — here are the average salaries of firm and in-house jobs based on employer size:

Small
In-house: $126,176
Firm: $119,602

Medium
In-house: $179,860
Firm: $160,964

Large
In-house: $196,358
Firm: $234,556

No real surprise there. Even though some small boutiques are paying full market salaries, generally the smaller the firm the smaller the paycheck. On the other hand, at most of these smaller places, attorneys are buying back their lives — trading top-tier pay for a more manageable lifestyle.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In a true sign of the times, roughly 50 percent of the legal professionals polled say they’re offered flexible work arrangements. Telecommuting tools are robust these days and with the price of real estate in major markets, employers are not as squeamish about letting their people work remotely. Some firms are even [designing their new offices around this reality](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/biglaw-firm-designs-new-office-around-the-reality-of-telecommuting/). In-house legal departments were slightly ahead on this score, with 49 percent offering remote working opportunities, but 46 percent of firm respondents said the same thing.

Firms excel over their clients when it comes to family leave. Almost 50 percent of firms offer company paid paternity/maternity leave with only 35 percent of in-house departments offering paid leave. In addition, 13 percent of law firms offer onsite or emergency childcare to employees which sounds like an amazing benefit. If you’re looking to “parent while lawyering” get yourself to one of these firms!

Around 20 percent of in-house legal departments offer paid volunteer time, which is a nice perk and certainly encourages attorneys to fulfill their pro bono obligations. Other respondents described pet-friendly offices which sounds like an absolute nightmare for people with allergies. On-site gyms, cafeterias, and wellness benefits were reported too.

The moral of the story is don’t just judge an employer by the salary they’re offering. There’s an overlooked maze of benefits and perks that can make the difference between a superstar employer and miserable experience for you. Take the time to dig into those perks because in a lockstep industry, that’s where the customization is happening.

# Nineteenth-Century Law Firm Pays Twenty-First-Century Cravath Scale
## New York and D.C. offices are getting raises from this firm... what of its other offices?

You can forgive a firm that’s been around since 1876 for being a little cautious and slow when it comes to issuing raises. You don’t get to be this established with knee-jerk reactions.

But at this point, all but [the most dense firms recognize](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/lets-hear-from-the-furious-associates-at-firms-that-havent-matched/) this as the new normal. So it’s time for partners to dig in and figure out how to get the job done.

This afternoon, Stroock & Stroock & Lavan decided that if it can afford an unnecessary ampersand on its letterhead, it can afford to pay its associates Cravath’s scale. The memo, [attached on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/19th-century-law-firm-pays-21st-century-cravath-scale/2/), matches the Cravath scale through the Class of 2008 making $315K. The raises take effect on July 1. Our screenshot cuts off at that point, so it’s unclear if summers are included, but we’ll update when we know for sure. UPDATE (6/21/16 4:41 p.m.): Yep, summers matched.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
UPDATE (6/21/16 4:33 p.m.): The memo is addressed only to the New York and D.C. offices. While it’s not unusual to see a Miami office left off a matching memo, the Los Angeles office is another story. Apparently the memo received just cropped off the other offices. Miami is getting case-by-case compensation, while L.A. matches NY/D.C. through the Class of 2012 and then moves to a case-by-case determination. Both of these announcements match Stroock’s prior status.

But for the New York and D.C. associates at least, we offer our hearty congratulations, as always.

Full memo available [on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/19th-century-law-firm-pays-21st-century-cravath-scale/2/)….

So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Yale Law Students: 'Maybe Don't Invite FedSoc To Parties.' Right Wing: 'Doxx 'Em And Snitch To Employers'
## There's a profound disrespect for legal institutions on display here... and it's not coming from the Yale Law students.

Yale Law School continues to provide the field of battle to the right-wing proxy war over American society. They want [school rules against discriminatory conduct tossed](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/yale-law-school-trap-house-incident-not-a-free-speech-thing-no-matter-how-hard-folks-try/) and students [punished for voicing opinions](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/banning-law-school-protests-to-protect-free-speech-marks-new-orwellian-heights/) — if you want a window into what Sam Alito’s perfect society might look like, there are folks trying to make Yale Law the pilot project.

The latest comes on the heels of Alito’s leaked Dobbs opinion planning to toss a half century of settled reproductive rights law in the trash and, by its explicit reasoning, yank the rug out of a score of additional solid precedent.

It turns out that the most elite law students in the country have opinions about this radical shift. This isn’t a shock. But the Washington Free Beacon — the de facto field marshal of the Yale Law proxy war — is willing to gin up some shock to mobilize its audience.

So the Washington Free Beacon [tweeted out the story](https://twitter.com/aaronsibarium/status/1525494980025933824?s=20&t=QAET0SW0D2HmfOF-s2H2VA).



Let’s be entirely clear, the social media post that gets star billing in this story about the shocking war on conservatives asks “why are [FedSoc students] still coming to our parties?”

Hardly a wild-eyed query and a curious one for the Washington Free Beacon to hang its hat on since it ranted for weeks about FedSoc’s divine right to [hold a party with a racist theme](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/yale-law-shows-commitment-to-diversity-with-boilerplate-apology-to-minorities/) because they should be able to do whatever they want with their parties. Hmmmmmmmm.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Other posts suggested that watching Alito blow up both constitutional law and stare decisis proves that our legal institutions are deeply flawed and minor reform can no longer fix them. Which… not exactly a far-fetched take either.

The article names the students posting this stuff on social media, which earned a rebuke from conservative law professor Orin Kerr, who [tweeted](https://twitter.com/OrinKerr/status/1525507954127949825?s=20&t=DOhIiy_0rEkkDMka1x0yjA):



He goes on to say that naming students and exposing them to potential career consequences crosses the line.

Professor Kerr is very consistent on this point. Above the Law generally avoids naming law students on the grounds that they may not have figured out how the law works yet. That said, when you start hearing from 3Ls about to step into powerful positions, the argument that they aren’t fully in command of what they’re doing gets a lot weaker.

For instance, Kerr objected when [we identified Stanford grads](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/stanford-law-school-students-graduation-was-put-in-jeopardy-because-fedsoc-cant-take-a-joke/) trying to convince the school to take away another student’s diploma for making fun of FedSoc. They were days away from graduation, but more importantly their jobs were secure. The whole point of the story wasn’t the students, but the powerful conservative judges they were clerking for (which made identification inevitable based on the size of clerk classes). The judges were never going to punish them for this — the story was about the judges actively seeking out and rewarding trollish behavior.

Meanwhile, the Washington Free Beacon article makes a point of saying they contacted a student’s future boss, Judge Lewis Liman of the Southern District of New York (who “did not respond to a request for comment”). Reading between the lines, because the Free Beacon sees that Judge Liman was nominated by Donald Trump, the outlet is snitching to him in hopes of some kind of twisted fealty to the conservative cause (even though his nomination had a lot more to do with [a deal between Trump and Chuck Schumer](https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2018/09/in-new-york-federal-judicial-nominations-strike-bipartisan-balance/178150/) than party affiliation).

That’s a far more troubling worldview — and one that prove’s the student’s point — than anything in the Yale social media posts. Plus, the article’s intent to lean on Judge Liman shows a remarkable level of disrespect and offends me personally since I both worked for Judge Liman and then with him as a co-defendant counsel on a number of matters.

In any event, one article was about telling the public what matters to a handful of powerful judges and the other is about pressuring a judge to fire someone. That’s a pretty significant difference.

But this whole story gets even better when another prominent conservative legal figure ducks his head into the conversation. Ilya Shapiro, fresh off the “[Lesser Black Women](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/georgetown-laws-newest-hire-thinks-biden-will-nominate-lesser-black-women-to-the-supreme-court/)” rolled in [to complain about Kerr’s stance](https://twitter.com/ishapiro/status/1525628155138084865?s=20&t=DOhIiy_0rEkkDMka1x0yjA).



Moments later… we [needed to report a murder](https://twitter.com/hannnahmmarie/status/1525630573422714880?s=20&t=XQ1m5WayjhJGKYNrguxqNw).

# Eddie Redmayne To Play Paul Cravath -- Yup, *That* Cravath
## Attorneys all know the firm Cravath, but not the lawyer behind the name.

For the biggest of Biglaw firms, the names we know them by today have become disembodied from the lawyers who originally helmed the firms. Take, for example, “Cravath.” Attorneys all know the name, and associate it with high-quality lawyering and leadership on associate salaries. But in the 1880s it was Paul Cravath, attorney to George Westinghouse, who battled Thomas Edison over the patent for the lightbulb.

This IP fight provided inspiration to Graham Moore, who wrote [The Last Days of Night](http://amzn.to/2beSw6D), a work of historical fiction that’s now being made into a movie starring Eddie Redmayne, the Academy Award-winning actor. [Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/08/15/cravath-lawyer-spotlighted-in-book-movie-with-eddie-redmayne/) details the plot:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The book follows Cravath, years before he joined the now-famous firm, as he is plucked from obscurity to help Westinghouse battle Thomas Edison for the light bulb patent in an 1887 suit worth the modern-day equivalent of $270 billion and the right to wire America. The cast of characters also includes Nikola Tesla, Alexander Graham Bell and J.P. Morgan.

“I think what attracted me to Paul was that I felt like him,” said Moore, who won a 2015 Academy Award for adapting the “Imitation Game” screenplay. “I was trying to fathom the minds of Edison and Westinghouse and Tesla, these massive geniuses, in just the same way he was.”

So it looks like moviegoers will really get a sense of the lawyer behind the name, a fascinating prospect for modern lawyers, regardless of their firm pedigree. Moore’s research was meticulous, though he did butt up against some privilege issues:

In researching his novel, Moore said, he visited the firm’s offices in search of information on his subject. It turns out that the firm has a box of letters between Cravath and Westinghouse, written as the two plotted against Edison. Moore said that he immediately asked to see it, but was told that, nearly a century after the letters were written, the box is still protected by attorney-client privilege.

Even without the benefit of the privileged letters, it looks like it will be an interesting tale all about the beginnings of American patent law.

# The Pink Ghetto: How Maternity Leave And Promotional Bias Affect Biglaw's Gender Wage Gap
## Will getting pregnant while working at a Biglaw firm stop you from having a successful career?

Welcome back to [The Pink Ghetto](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-pink-ghetto/), a series where we take a look at some of the most appalling stories from one of the most sexist industries in the world: the legal profession. Today, we’ll be taking a look at what women experience in Biglaw firms during their pregnancies and maternity leaves, and how building a family may affect the gender wage gap and gender bias in promotions. These are real emails that we’ve received from real readers.

When you see things like this happening, say something. Together, we can inspire the change necessary to stop this disturbing behavior from being so prevalent in the law.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Pushing off compensation to bonus time (as recently reported for [Edelson](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/cravath-alternative-150k-now-much-much-more-at-bonus-time/)) contributes to the pay gap for women associates (and others who take extended leaves). I also think that generally the prorating bonus practice as perpetuation of gender pay gap in Biglaw warrants its own independent discussion.

I’m an associate at a Biglaw firm who had a child and as a result will make less over the course of my associate career because of the hit that we take at bonus time — my firm prorates bonuses when associates take a leave, the most common of which is maternity leave. A firm matching the Cravath salary scale and standard bonus structure compensates women who have children more than does a firm who “makes up for it” at bonus time — in a significant way.

I’ve heard through the Biglaw grapevine that other firms (like Skadden) do NOT prorate bonuses for associates on parental leave, but I have not confirmed with any primary sources. Unless and until firms stop prorating end-of-year bonuses for maternity leave, the gender pay gap will continue — and moves like Edelson’s to push a higher percentage of compensation off to bonus time will exacerbate that gap even further.

When I was applying for a summer associate position, I was very conscious of how firms treated female attorneys. As a result, if something about the firm seemed to suggest that my advancement opportunities would be severely limited, I would ask about it in my interviews (no sense working for a firm that doesn’t even pretend to respect women).

I was in one particular interview with a panel of several attorneys. After the interview panel, one male partner stayed behind to wait with me before the HR employee arrived for my tour of the office. I used the opportunity to ask why, despite having a large number of female associates, the firm had a very small percentage of female partners. The partner told me that he believes it is because men have a stronger drive to succeed and women don’t care as much about success.

I am now happily working at a Biglaw firm that does believe women can be ambitious and successful.

I wanted to make sure you saw the [recent decision](http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/474/474mass382.html) from the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, in my discrimination case against my former employer, Mintz Levin. It is a lengthy decision, but contains a fair amount of discussion about some of the evidence of the sexist firm culture and sex-based stereotypes that were employed by firm members. In other words, it is a more in-depth review of the sexist climate that I believe exists in most large law firms than you are likely to see anywhere else.

I would really like to see more attention being paid to these issues. It is no secret why so many women leave Biglaw, but because it isn’t discussed openly, it happens under the radar and can be couched as “opting out.” It isn’t much of an “option” when there are so many obstacles to opting in! The underlying papers also have a lot of information. The SJC touched on some of the statistics in the decision, but did not include the key fact that my section also failed to promote the women they admit were “stars”, while all of the men who stayed were promoted.

I was a mid-level associate at one of the bigger Biglaw firms and pregnant with my first child. The firm was holding its annual attorney retreat when the attorneys gather from all the offices around the country. One afternoon, the managing partner held a Town Hall-style Q&A for the associates. I recall that the room was packed. The managing partner got up on the stage and gave his spiel about the firm’s health and growth, then opened it up to questions from the audience. A female associate stood up and asked, “What advice do you have for a woman associate who wants to advance but would also like to start a family?” He leaned into the microphone and said, “Birth control.” There was some nervous laughter from the crowd, and the managing partner brushed the comment off as a joke. He quickly introduced the next speaker, a female partner from his office who was visibly pregnant. She informed the crowd that the firm had been exceptionally accommodating to her and she loved her job working for managing partner.

After the retreat, I started to really look around my office. There were no females partners who were also mothers. None. About a month later, I left.

To think we spent a hot second wondering if the market would follow Milbank to $200K. As it turned out, the market was more than ready to jump up to $205K.

The subject heading is “Associate Compensation and Extraordinary Bonus Announcement.” Tipsters report some bonuses for 2200+ hours and 2400+ hours, though we don’t have those laid out in the screenshot.

# World's First Publicly Traded Law Firm Slashes 640 Jobs
## Uh-oh...

Slater & Gordon, the world’s first publicly traded law, firm may be in some trouble. For the past year or so, news has flooded the market about the firm’s [$700 million loss](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/a-700-million-loss-puts-a-law-firm-on-the-ropes/) thanks to its controversial acquisition of the legal services branch of UK-based insurance claims processor Quindell (now known as Watchstone Group). Slater & Gordon now plans to sue Watchstone Group, which was placed under investigation by the UK’s Serious Fraud Office shortly after the acquisition deal closed, but that’s not the biggest news of the day concerning the beleaguered firm.

Today, Slater & Gordon released its annual report, which contained some shocking news. [Legal Week](http://www.legalweek.com/sites/legalweek/2016/10/05/slater-and-gordon-report-shows-16-drop-in-uk-headcount/?slreturn=20160905114710) has more information on the firm’s latest difficulties:

The firm, headed by managing director Andrew Grech, released its annual report earlier today, with the report stating that the firm now has 3,310 employees across 25 locations in the UK. This time last year, the equivalent figure stood at 3,950 people at 28 locations across the UK.

A spokeswoman for the firm said: “Some of the reduced numbers are down to Slater and Gordon streamlining the firm and reducing duplicated roles in the business. However, we are hiring in areas such as family law, general law and others.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
That’s 640 jobs lost over the course of a year, or about 53 jobs per month, which equates to 16 percent of the firm’s workforce in the UK. Slater & Gordon Chair John Skippen had this to say: “Slater and Gordon’s results for the financial year ended 30 June 2016 were disappointing and well below expectations. As announced in February 2016, a range of performance improvement initiatives were put in place in the second half of the year to improve profitability and cash performance across the business.”

As we all know, one of the the most popular ways to improve profitability and cash performance is through layoffs, and it looks like the powers that be at Slater & Gordon were working overtime to enhance the firm’s cash flow considering the high number of jobs that were eliminated.

We wish all of the lawyers and affected individuals at Slater & Gordon the best of luck while they seek new job opportunities in the legal industry and beyond.

If your firm or organization is closing its doors or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# Biglaw Firm Offers Super-High Bonuses For Super-High Billables
## Plus raises!

The good news continues in Biglaw, at least in terms of compensation.

The latest firm to announce largesse to their associates is Loeb & Loeb. The firm made $385,271,000 in  gross revenue in 2020, making it 99th on the most recent Am Law 100 ranking.

As you can see from the bonus chart below, it will take quite a few billable hours to match the market standard set by [Davis Polk (which includes year-end and special bonus numbers)](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/davis-polk-bonuses-21). But, if you hit those super-high billables (core hours include client billable hours and creditable non-billable hours) wow, those are some impressive bonuses. And for ease of comparison, Loeb & Loeb charted out what last year’s bonuses were like, so you can see just how much better associates are doing — monetarily — year over year:

2021
1900 Core Hours	2000 Core Hours	2100 Core Hours	2200 Core Hours	2300 Core Hours	2400 Core Hours
Tier 1	$7,500	$15,000	$22,500	$30,000	$37,500	$52,500
Tier 2	$15,000	$25,000	$35,000	$45,000	$55,000	$75,000
Tier 3	$25,000	$45,000	$65,000	$85,000	$115,000	$150,000
Tier 4	$50,000	$75,000	$100,000	$125,000	$180,000	$220,000
Tier 5	$65,000	$90,000	$115,000	$140,000	$210,000	$250,000
Tier 6	$80,000	$105,000	$130,000	$155,000	$235,000	$275,000
Tier 7	$90,000	$115,000	$140,000	$165,000	$250,000	$290,000
Tier 8/SC	$100,000	$125,000	$150,000	$175,000	$265,000	$305,000
2020
1900 Core Hours	2000 Core Hours	2100 Core Hours	2200 Core Hours	2300 Core Hours	2400 Core Hours
Tier 1	$5,000	$10,000	$15,000	$20,000	$25,000	$30,000
Tier 2	$10,000	$15,000	$20,000	$25,000	$30,000	$35,000
Tier 3	$15,000	$30,000	$45,000	$65,000	$85,000	$105,000
Tier 4	$30,000	$50,000	$75,000	$100,000	$130,000	$160,000
Tier 5	$35,000	$60,000	$85,000	$110,000	$140,000	$170,000
Tier 6	$45,000	$70,000	$100,000	$130,000	$160,000	$190,000
Tier 7	$50,000	$75,000	$105,000	$135,000	$165,000	$195,000
Tier 8/SC	$55,000	$85,000	$115,000	$145,000	$175,000	$205,000
However, that was far from the only good news at the firm. Loeb & Loeb also announced raises! The firm [wasn’t at market compensation](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/loeb-raise-2021/) before this round of raises, and well, [still isn’t](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/). But seeing as everyone but the most junior associates will see a bump in compensation, that has to make folks at least a little happy.

New Base as of 2/1/22	Current Base	Base Increase
Tier 8	$340,000	$300,000	$40,000
Tier 7	$325,000	$290,000	$35,000
Tier 6	$305,000	$275,000	$30,000
Tier 5	$285,000	$260,000	$25,000
Tier 4	$260,000	$245,000	$15,000
Tier 3	$235,000	$230,000	$5,000
Tier 2	215,000	$215,000	N/A
Tier 1	205,000	$205,000	N/A

# Law School DENIED Access To Federal Student Loan Dollars
## The student loan merry-go-round that kept one law school's doors open just came to an unexpected, screeching halt.

It’s a well-known fact that many law schools rely upon the willingness of the government to supply their students with unfettered access to federal educational loans to remain in business. In the short term, those loan dollars keep the law school’s lights on, but in the long term, those loan dollars keep students indebted, sometimes for the rest of their lives.

For one law school, the student loan merry-go-round that kept its doors open just came to an unexpected, screeching halt.

Today, the Department of Education announced that on December 31, 2016, it will end access to federal student financial aid for the Charlotte School of Law, a for-profit InfiLaw institution. Charlotte Law owes its inability to secure federal loans to its non-compliance with American Bar Association standards and to its own misrepresentations to students regarding the likelihood that they’d be able to pass the bar exam.

If you recall, Charlotte Law was recently [placed on probation](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/aba-cracks-down-on-law-schools-admitting-students-who-cant-pass-the-bar-exam/) by the ABA for being out of compliance with requirements that it have “sound admissions policies and procedures” and admit only applicants who “appear capable of satisfactorily completing its program of legal education and being admitted to the bar.” The Department of Education did not take kindly to the fact that Charlotte Law students were being taken advantage of, and decided it was time to step in, perhaps in a way that would hurt the school the most.

Here’s more information from a press release posted on the [Department’s website](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/charlotte-school-law-denied-continued-access-federal-student-aid-dollars):

“The ABA repeatedly found that the Charlotte School of Law does not prepare students for participation in the legal profession. Yet CSL continuously misrepresented itself to current and prospective students as hitting the mark,” said U.S. Under Secretary of Education Ted Mitchell. “CSL’s actions were misleading and dishonest. We can no longer allow them continued access to federal student aid.” …

Today’s action denies CSL’s request to be recertified to continue its participation in the federal student aid programs. Effective Dec. 31, 2016, CSL’s participation in those programs will end, and beginning Jan. 1, 2017, students may no longer use federal student aid to attend the school.

In announcing its decision to deny the school recertification for the federal loan program, Susan D. Crim, the director of the Administrative Actions and Appeals Service Group of the Department of Education, took Charlotte Law to task in a 14-page letter that can best be described as a verbal beatdown. Here’s one of the most salient paragraphs contained in her letter (available in full on the next page):

What are Charlotte Law students supposed to do now? Will they be forced to turn to private lenders to finance the rest of their legal educations at a school that recently posted its [worst July bar exam passage rate](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/law-school-celebrates-worst-bar-exam-results-in-nearly-10-years/) — 45.24 percent — in nearly a decade?

Charlotte Law has until January 3, 2017, to submit evidence to dispute the Department of Education’s findings. Will Charlotte be the first InfiLaw institution to fold under the substantial weight of its own failures? Perhaps we’ll learn its fate in 2017.

# Clients Keep Complaining, But Law Firms Are STILL A Bargain Even After Historic Rate Hikes
## Maybe the problem with rising legal costs is coming from inside the client's office.

Clients don’t like to hear this, but outside counsel are offering a pretty fair deal.

Whenever a law firm raises its rates, clients bemoan the added stress to tightening budgets and might lodge some empty threats about refusing to pay, but ultimately everyone realizes that no one gets fired for hiring Cravath — or another peer firm — and in-house counsel fork over the cash. Law firms raised rates last year and while most coverage focuses on the hikes being the biggest in a decade, it turns out law firms are still running behind inflation.

LexisNexis CounselLink collects data from over $52 billion in legal spending in more than 1.4 million matters to capture insights into the state of legal spend [in a new report](https://counsellink.com/trends/). And clients are definitely spending more:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.

The average partner rate increased by 4.5% (compared to 3.4% in 2021 and 3.5% in 2020). Average rate increases were up compared to 2021 in all law firm tiers and practice areas.

“Inflation affected most sectors of the economy in 2022, and legal services were no exception,” said Pam Gelfond, VP and GM of LexisNexis Legal Business Solutions. “We hope our report can help the legal community

Yeah… but inflation generally was up 6.5 percent in 2022. And it was up 7 percent in 2021. All told, attorneys have kept rate hikes below the rate of inflation. Admittedly 2020 outpaced inflation a tad, but lumping it all together, law departments still come out ahead.

That doesn’t necessarily help corporate clients. A reasonable increase is still an increase that the department has to cover with a declining budget.

But why is the budget shrinking? The [Fortune 500’s profits were up 114 percent last year.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fortune-announces-2022-fortune-500-list-301552608.html) Before blaming Biglaw for seeking a 5 percent revenue hike, maybe look in the mirror and ask why management can’t kick at least a 6.5 percent cost of living boost.

# 3 Questions For A Biglaw Refugee Turned Biglaw Vice Chair
## Read on for a range of insights from Bill Isaacson, including preparing for a career as a trial lawyer and the value of taking ownership over your legal career.

Back in 2016, I wrote about rediscovering one of my favorite voices, ESPN’s Tony Kornheiser, and how his move from radio to podcasting offered [lessons](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/beyond-biglaw-3-lessons-from-uncle-tony/) for lawyers hoping to strike out on their own. In particular, I focused on what prospective Biglaw refugees could learn from the 71-year-old Kornheiser’s focus on delivering a quality product to his listeners via a new medium.

Years later, I am still listening to the podcast, enjoying the rotating cast of characters discussing sports, culture, and the news of the day. All delivered alongside Tony’s detailed descriptions of his various physical ailments, as well as his general frustration navigating 2019 as a technophobic, cash-paying, intolerant of stupidity, one-percenter who is not afraid to mix it up with a home-invading flying squirrel or aggressive deer when the hour calls. Throw in humorous critiques of the ad copy submitted by the advertisers who keep the lights on and some user-submitted original music and jingles — it all adds up to an hour well-spent each day. (Even if my high schoolers protested vociferously when the podcast’s name was reflected on our car’s radio display screen while driving carpool at 7 a.m. This was a major embarrassment, even though I was listening to the show on my earphones. Which in and of themselves are embarrassing, since they are not Airpods. Can’t win.)

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Carpool faux pas aside, one of the recurring surprise guests on Tony’s podcast is his friend and legal luminary, Bill Isaacson, who is only one of the leading antitrust lawyers in the entire country, as well as the Vice Chair of Boies Schiller, where he was one of the original lawyers to join the then-startup firm, leaving a Biglaw partnership to do so. As I have had a long-held interest in the intersection of IP and antitrust, fueled recently by a spate of interesting cases raising antitrust issues in the context of standard-essential patents, I reached out to Bill in the hopes that he would agree to a written interview for this audience. As gracious as he is celebrated, he agreed, and I am pleased to share Bill’s insights on a range of topics, including preparing for a career as a trial lawyer and the value of taking ownership over your legal career.

As usual, I have added some brief commentary to the answers below and in next week’s second installment, but have otherwise presented Bill’s answers as he provided them.

1) You went to college on a debate scholarship and are now a Fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers. Looking back, do you think you were destined for trial work or was it your experiences in law school and beyond that led to a career in the courtroom?

I spent my high school years (at Marquette High School in Milwaukee) focused on debate, which did end up paying my way through college (at the University of Redlands in California).  Many debaters I knew then marched into law school. Law firms are riddled with ex-debaters, and I do not know many debaters that became doctors. I believe the reason for that is not so much the oral advocacy we learned, it is more the time we spent on research and structuring of complicated materials into arguments and presentations.  Because of debate, for example, I was researching in the law library in high school. Debate taught me more about how to prepare for trial than it did about how to communicate at trial. I eventually decided that “arguing” like in a debate was not always the best method of communication in court, and that my goal in court should be to have a (persuasive) conversation with a judge or jury.

GK: Bill makes a strong argument for exposing more students, particularly at a younger age to debate. As someone who teaches a high-school elective class on IP, I understand the importance of working with students on their writing skills. At the same time, giving them a taste of “getting on their feet” — while also developing their research skills so they are prepared to speak coherently and persuasively — is an important ingredient. And Bill’s points on the importance of developing research skills and learning to speak to your audience should resonate with any IP lawyer who gets (or hopes) to speak in a courtroom.

2) What is the biggest lesson you learned from taking the leap as a newly minted Biglaw partner to join Boies Schiller as one of the founding lawyers and how would you turn that experience into advice for other lawyers contemplating a similar move?

We just passed 22 years since the founding of the firm.  One part of the experience of practicing law in a law firm is that you are part of business.  It is a unique opportunity to help build a business with your colleagues (whether it is a new firm, a department, a practice area, etc.) in the environment and with the clients that you want. I recommend grabbing that opportunity if you get it.  Joining this firm at the beginning was the best professional decision I ever made. And I would have no regrets if it had turned out less successfully than it did.

GK: Speaking from personal experience, all I can say is that I agree with Bill wholeheartedly on the immense personal satisfaction that comes with helping to build a business. Especially with people you want to build it with, doing the work that you want to do, for the clients you want to work on behalf of. As weighty as the challenges are, the rewards are just so much sweeter for them.

3) For the past few years, you have often been mentioned as a spectator, and sometimes speaker, on Tony Kornheiser’s popular podcast. How important is it for lawyers to maintain friendships with people outside of the profession, whether or not they are famous?

We all need friends in our lives who make us laugh.  Although Tony’s television show PTI is more famous, I met Tony through his radio show.  I ended up through my brother (who is a Broadway producer) arranging good seats for Tony at Broadway plays and going to the theatre with him and the podcast regulars. The tickets for Tony became a running joke on his show and we became friends.  Tony’s audience often arranges for him all sorts of benefits (and well as sending him junk) and he provides laughter to his listeners in his podcast (“La Cheeserie!” to any other of the podcast listeners.). All in all, it is a healthy relationship. 

GK: For my thoughts on Tony, go back and re-read the intro paragraphs to this column. La Cheeserie to all. 

Next week, we will conclude our interview with Bill, focusing on some of his famous successes in the IP and antitrust arenas.

# Supreme Court Clerk Hiring Watch: New Year, New Hires
## And some justices have already hired all their 2019-2020 clerks as well.

Happy new year! And what better way to kick off 2018 than with a new installment of Supreme Court Clerk Hiring Watch?

In case you missed it during the hectic holiday season, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy recently hired a [full set of four clerks](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/supreme-court-clerk-hiring-watch-are-reports-of-justice-kennedys-retirement-greatly-exaggerated/) for October Term 2018 (i.e., 2018-2019). This might mean that Justice Kennedy, the longtime [subject](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/supreme-court-clerk-hiring-watch-to-know-a-judge-know-her-clerks/) of [retirement rumors](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/anatomy-of-a-rumor-on-justice-kennedys-retirement-next-year/) (which he’s even [joked](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/no-justice-anthony-m-kennedy-is-not-retiring-tomorrow/) about), is sticking around. Or it might not — because we’re talking about the hard-to-predict AMK, who’s a Supreme Court justice and can do as he pleases.

Before sharing with you the names of the newest members of [the Elect](http://underneaththeirrobes.blogs.com/main/2004/06/article_iii_gro.html), here are my customary miscellaneous observations of possible interest to folks who follow SCOTUS clerk hiring:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
1. In case you missed it, Tony Mauro and the National Law Journal recently put out a detailed analysis of the diversity — or lack thereof — among Supreme Court clerks. Check it out [here](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/sites/nationallawjournal/2017/12/11/mostly-white-and-male-diversity-still-lags-among-scotus-law-clerks/) (overview) or [here](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/sites/nationallawjournal/2017/12/11/shut-out-scotus-law-clerks-still-mostly-white-and-male/) (full findings), or read my colleague Kathryn Rubino’s write-up [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/white-males-dominate-the-scotus-clerk-ranks/).

2. As you’ll see below, there are now two different lists compared to the [last SCOTUS clerk hiring post](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/supreme-court-clerk-hiring-watch-to-know-a-judge-know-her-clerks/). One is for October Term 2018, and one is for October Term 2019. We now have a critical mass of OT 2019 hires to justify a separate listing for them.

3. In fact, upon information and belief, all nine justices have finished their OT 2018 hiring, even though we’re missing the names of a few hires for Justice Thomas, Justice Alito, and Justice Gorsuch. Furthermore, rumor has it that Justice Thomas and Justice Gorsuch have even finished their OT 2019 hiring.

(A friendly reminder: by [Above the Law tradition](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/07/supreme-court-clerk-hiring-watch-the-official-list-for-october-term-2013/), the last SCOTUS clerk whose hiring we learn about gets their own special profile in ATL’s pages, our version of the NFL draft’s [Mr. Irrelevant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Irrelevant).)

4. Chief Justice Roberts has even made a hire for October Term 2019, a Harvard Law School graduate named Zaki Anwar. One can see why Anwar would be appealing to JGR: Anwar graduated at the top of his class (Fay Diploma) from the Chief’s alma mater. And not only that, Anwar graduated summa cum laude, which is an especially big deal because in many years, HLS has no summa graduate. (Chief Justice Roberts and President Barack Obama were mere magna grads.)

UPDATE (7:50 p.m.): Looks like HLS is getting soft! From a Harvard Law source:

A minor correction for you. It’s no longer true that there are years at HLS without a summa graduate. There used to be a numerical cutoff, then for I think one year it was awarded to the top 1%, and now there’s a numerical cutoff again, but if no one hits the cutoff then the number one ranked graduate is designated summa. (Seemed like an odd policy when I heard about it, since you already have the Fay Diploma to recognize the number one graduate.)

See here for details: [http://hls.harvard.edu/dept/ocs/employers/hls-grading-policy/](http://hls.harvard.edu/dept/ocs/employers/hls-grading-policy/)

5. One interesting finding of the [NLJ survey](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/sites/nationallawjournal/2017/12/11/shut-out-scotus-law-clerks-still-mostly-white-and-male/) is that the top 19 feeder judges are responsible for more than two-thirds of all SCOTUS clerks. I’m actually surprised it’s not higher. If you look at the two lists below, you’ll see all the usual suspects (shout-out to my awesome former boss, Judge Diarmuid F. O’Scannlain of the Ninth Circuit).

6. By my count — if I’m wrong, about this or anything else, please [email me](mailto:dlat@abovethelaw.com?subject=SCOTUS%20Clerk%20Hiring) (subject line: “SCOTUS Clerk Hiring”) — 13 judges have at least two of their clerks on the lists below. I’ll refer to these judges just by their last names and with no mention of their courts because, to SCOTUS clerkship obsessives, feeder judges are like Beyoncé — a single name suffices. The 13 judges are as follows (in alphabetical order, with number of clerks placed so far in parentheses): Feinerman (3), Garland (4), Griffith (2), Katzmann (2), Kavanaugh (6!), Nathan (2), Oetken (2), Srinivasan (4), Sullivan (2), Sutton (3), Tatel (2), Watford (2), and Wilkinson (2).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
UPDATE (1/8/2018): Make that 14 judges — Judge Michelle Friedland (9th Cir.) should be added to the list, based on the update to Nick Rosellini’s prior clerkship information below. Judge Friedland is, like every judge on the list except for Judge Griffith and Judge Sullivan, a former SCOTUS clerk herself.

7. One notable omission from that list of 13 is Judge Alex Kozinski, the mega-feeder who recently [retired from the Ninth Circuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/breaking-judge-kozinski-is-retiring/?rf=1). But even though Judge Kozinski is no longer on the bench, his former clerks should continue to appear on these lists for some time.

Why? First, people often end up clerking for SCOTUS several years after their first clerkship(s). If you’re serious about clerking for SCOTUS, you should apply multiple times; sometimes the third (or fourth, or fifth) time is the charm.

Second, word on the street is that several of the Kozinski clerks whose [clerkships got interrupted](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/sources-report-3-kozinski-clerks-are-out/), or who never got to start with the judge in the first place, have found new and excellent homes with freshly minted superstars of the federal bench like Judge Gregory Katsas (D.C. Cir.) and Judge James Ho (5th Cir.). Look for Katsas and Ho to emerge as feeders in the future, especially when it comes to placing clerks in the chambers of their former boss, Justice Clarence Thomas.

8. Speaking of people clerking for SCOTUS well after their first clerkships, Justice Gorsuch appears to be continuing [his tradition](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/supreme-court-clerk-hiring-watch-meet-justice-neil-gorsuchs-clerks/) of hiring older, more experienced clerks, at least for his early Terms. (But for October Term 2019, he’s hired two 2017 graduates so far, which is pretty typical.)

For OT 2018, NMG has hired at least two people who graduated from law school about a decade ago, Ethan Davis (Yale 2008 / O’Scannlain) and Paul Mezzina (Harvard 2008 / Kavanaugh / Scalia). Mezzina is currently a [partner](https://www.kslaw.com/people/paul-mezzina) in the D.C. office of King & Spalding, and Davis was a partner in the firm’s San Francisco office until fairly recently. (In June 2017, Davis [left K&S](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethanpdavis/) to become a deputy assistant attorney general at the Justice Department.)

The big news in Biglaw, which we mentioned [earlier today](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/morning-docket-04-04-16/), is veteran dealmaker [Scott Barshay’s](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/scott-barshay/) lateral move from [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/cravath/) to [Paul, Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/paul-weiss-rifkind-wharton-garrison-llp/). He will assume the role of global head of M&A at PW, as noted in the firm’s [press release](https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/transactional/corporate/publications/scott-barshay-joins-paul,-weiss-as-global-head-of-ma.aspx?id=21671).

We first heard rumblings about Barshay’s move early on Sunday morning (although he actually started working at PW on Friday, as reported by the [American Lawyer](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202753959278/Top-Cravath-Deal-Lawyer-Scott-Barshay-Jumps-to-Paul-Weiss?kw=Top%20Cravath%20Deal%20Lawyer%20Scott%20Barshay%20Jumps%20to%20Paul%20Weiss&cn=20160404&pt=Am%20Law%20Daily&src=EMC-Email&et=editorial&bu=The%20American%20Lawyer)). Here’s what one source, a corporate partner at another leading law firm, told us:

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Scott Barshay has left Cravath (his bio came down last night around 10 p.m.). He’s going to Paul Weiss.

The Cravath partners are devastated. Biggest loss since David Boies left.

It’s probably fair to describe Barshay as the most notable Cravath defection [since Boies left CSM in 1997](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-10-21/why-david-boies-left-cravath) — partly because it’s so rare for partners to leave CSM’s hallowed halls, especially for a rival firm. As noted by Michael de la Merced over at [DealBook](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/04/business/dealbook/a-cravath-partner-moves-to-paul-weiss.html?ref=dealbook&_r=1), “[t]he firm has lost top stars over the years, but usually those partners made career changes” (such as Robert Kindler, arguably the biggest M&A name to leave Cravath before Barshay; back in 2000, Kindler [went into investment banking](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB960237259145733520), where he’s still killing it as global head of M&A at Morgan Stanley).

Some Cravath lawyers might be sad to lose Scott Barshay as a colleague — he’s fun to talk to, the kind of person who will argue during an interview about [whether the Iliad is better literature than the Bible](https://twitter.com/matt_levine/status/636539210074341380) (as Matt Levine of Bloomberg View [recently recounted](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2016-04-04/panama-papers-and-marquee-data)) — but there’s no doubt that CSM’s M&A practice remains robust. Some clients will surely follow Barshay to his new home (and we hear that he was working the phones over the weekend), but Cravath has a [long list of deals](https://bol.bna.com/after-barshay-exit-here-are-the-deals-cravath-is-advising/) being handled by other M&A stars, including department co-heads Faiza Saeed and Robert Townsend III.

At the same time, PW deserves props for its hiring coup. Scott Barshay is “one of Wall Street’s top deal makers,” according to the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/04/business/dealbook/a-cravath-partner-moves-to-paul-weiss.html?ref=dealbook&_r=1),” and his loss is “a blow for Cravath,” per the [Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/cravath-loses-top-deal-lawyer-scott-barshay-to-paul-weiss-1459710136). The 50-year-old Barshay joined Cravath some 25 years ago, after graduating from Columbia Law School in 1991, and he made partner in 1998. He previously served as head of CSM’s corporate practice (which is why his name has graced [bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/11/breaking-cravath-bonuses-are-out-welcome-to-the-2011-bonus-season/) [memos](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/11/breaking-cravath-bonuses-are-out-and-down/) in years past).

In 2015, Barshay worked on transactions with an aggregate value of almost $300 billion — enough to give him a respectable place in the league tables if he were a law firm unto himself. Many of these deals have been headline-making, such as client Starwood’s acquisition by Marriott and client Anheuser-Busch Inbev’s acquisition of SABMiller. PW’s corporate practice, led by [Bob Schumer](https://www.paulweiss.com/professionals/partners-and-counsel/robert-b-schumer.aspx) (brother of Senator Chuck Schumer, in case you’re wondering), advised on a little more than $300 billion in deals in 2015, placing it around [#19](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/04/business/dealbook/a-cravath-partner-moves-to-paul-weiss.html?ref=dealbook&_r=1) or [#20](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202753959278/Top-Cravath-Deal-Lawyer-Scott-Barshay-Jumps-to-Paul-Weiss?kw=Top%20Cravath%20Deal%20Lawyer%20Scott%20Barshay%20Jumps%20to%20Paul%20Weiss&cn=20160404&pt=Am%20Law%20Daily&src=EMC-Email&et=editorial&bu=The%20American%20Lawyer) in the M&A league tables. Look for a rankings rise from Paul, Weiss in the years ahead, now that Barshay’s aboard.

Inquiring minds want to know: how much will Scott Barshay earn at Paul, Weiss? That’s been a subject of some speculation. We initially heard all sorts of juicy rumors — a seven-figure signing bonus! a guarantee in the high seven figures! an eight-figure total pay package! — but we now have it on good authority that Barshay’s deal, while very generous, isn’t quite so lavish. PW doesn’t pay signing bonuses to lateral partners, and it isn’t giving him a guarantee; instead, his compensation will depend on how well the firm fares in 2016, pretty much like every other partner at Paul, Weiss.

We understand, however, that he should fare better financially at PW than he did at CSM. Cravath has a fairly strict lockstep compensation system, under which Barshay earned between $4 million and $4.5 million, as estimated by one source of ours.[[1]](#f1) Paul, Weiss is also largely lockstep, but as firm chair Brad Karp told the [Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/cravath-loses-top-deal-lawyer-scott-barshay-to-paul-weiss-1459710136), its “modified lockstep” system allows for “flexibility at the upper end for star performers.” In addition, as noted by [Am Law](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202753959278/Top-Cravath-Deal-Lawyer-Scott-Barshay-Jumps-to-Paul-Weiss?kw=Top%20Cravath%20Deal%20Lawyer%20Scott%20Barshay%20Jumps%20to%20Paul%20Weiss&cn=20160404&pt=Am%20Law%20Daily&src=EMC-Email&et=editorial&bu=The%20American%20Lawyer), the firm has a “significant bonus pool” that can sweeten the pot.

Will other partners or associates follow Barshay from Cravath to Paul, Weiss? One early rumor suggested that he might be accompanied by others, but senior sources at both firms now tell us that he’s coming solo.

Cravath’s reaction to the news was, well, très Cravath — understated and classy. The firm’s statement, issued to [Bloomberg BNA](https://bol.bna.com/paul-weiss-hires-top-ma-partner-from-cravath/fspoke) and the [WSJ](http://www.wsj.com/articles/cravath-loses-top-deal-lawyer-scott-barshay-to-paul-weiss-1459710136), wished Barshay “the best in his future endeavors.”

With the first quarter of 2016 in the rearview mirror, will other big names of Biglaw jump into the game of musical chairs? If you have advance word of a major move, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Biglaw%20Lateral%20Move) or text us (646-820-8477).

[ [1]](#reff1) Estimating Barshay’s 2015 Cravath compensation at $4 million to $4.5 million seems reasonable. In 2014, according to the [2015 Am Law 100 rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/04/the-2015-am-law-100-revenues-rising-profits-popping-and-a-new-1-firm/2/), CSM enjoyed profits per partner of $3.4 million (lower than the $3.8 million at Paul, Weiss, actually).

But 2015 should be a better year for Cravath than 2014 — the firm worked on more than $900 billion worth of deals last year, [second only to Skadden](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/04/business/dealbook/a-cravath-partner-moves-to-paul-weiss.html?ref=dealbook&_r=1) — and Barshay is of above-average seniority in the Cravath partnership. (He’s 50, the firm has a mandatory retirement of 65, and the average Cravath partner makes partner before 35 — the firm has a famously short partnership track that it has kept short, even as other firms have made the quest for partnership take a decade or more.)

UPDATE (4/5/2016, 9:35 a.m.): Over at Am Law Daily, Julie Triedman has an interesting piece, [Rainmaker’s Defection Could Test Cravath Lockstep Model](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202754085308/Rainmakers-Defection-Could-Test-Cravath-Lockstep-Model-?cn=20160405&pt=Am%20Law%20Daily%20Breaking%20News&src=EMC-Email&et=editorial&bu=The%20American%20Lawyer&slreturn=20160305092154), with more info about partner pay at CSM and PW:

Paul Weiss chair Brad Karp declined to say how much the firm agreed to pay Barshay. But a source with knowledge of the move said the amount is shy of $10 million—though not by much. The firm does not give guarantees or signing bonuses. (Top compensation levels at Cravath, by contrast, reached a bit over $4 million last year, according to two sources knowledgeable about the firm.)

Though 90 percent of Paul Weiss partners are compensated based purely on seniority, a small group of top business generators are rewarded far above the lockstep system in any given year.

“Paul Weiss will pay whatever it takes to get what they want,” said Sharon Mahn, a longtime legal recruiter and founder of Mahn Consulting in New York who frequently places top partners at elite firms.

This generally makes sense given what we’ve heard. Cravath pay topping out at $4 million might seem a tad low, but remember that CSM sets the [spread between the highest- and lowest-paid partners at 3 to 1](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/09/biglaw-its-not-all-about-the-benjamins/). If Barshay was earning a little more than $3 million at Cravath — imagine a system with a 3:1 spread, with junior partners making $1.5 million, midlevel partners making $3 million, and senior partners making $4.5 million (or a little less) — he might have tripled his comp in moving to Paul, Weiss.

UPDATE (5/4/2016, 12:00 p.m.): In the weeks since Scott Barshay’s departure, we’ve gotten some significant pushback on the claim that his former colleagues were “devastated” by his leaving. There were a few who were disappointed, one Cravath lawyer told us, but definitely not “devastated” — especially because, well, Barshay is a “complex” individual….

# Morning Docket: 04.05.17
## * Talk about an alleged fashion faux pas! LuLaRoe, the maker of the ""buttery-soft"" leggings that have taken the internet by storm, is facing a class-action lawsuit over the quality of the company's leggings. Plaintiffs claim that the leggings as ""tear[] as easily as wet toilet paper."" LuLaRoe, of course, has stated that the allegations are ""completely without merit."" [[BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniemcneal/lularoe-lawsuit?utm_term=.tf5xMDY3#.tm2VZXG8)] * ""There's a reason they call it the nuclear option, and that is because there's fallout. And this fallout will be dangerously and perhaps disastrously radioactive for the Senate for years to come."" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has set a vote to change Senate rules in order to confirm Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch. [[Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-gorsuch-idUSKBN1760YL)] * In a landmark en banc decision, the Seventh Circuit reversed itself and ruled that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects LGBT employees from workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. This is not only the first time in history that a federal appellate court has come to this conclusion, but it also creates a split from a recent Eleventh Circuit opinion. This will likely be heard by the Supreme Court. [[TIME](http://time.com/4726040/civil-rights-act-lgbt-workplace-discrimination/)] * Squire Patton Boggs has formed an alliance with Donald Trump's longtime personal attorney, Michael Cohen, who credits himself as the one who convinced the president to run for office. At this time, it's unclear what exactly Cohen will be doing for the firm, but he'll be working from the firm's offices in New York, London, and D.C. [[WSJ Law Blog](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2017/04/04/trumps-personal-lawyer-forms-alliance-with-squire-patton-boggs/?ref=/blogs/law)] * Dislike: Facebook must turn over digital information from almost 400 user accounts following its failed bid at the New York Court of Appeals to appeal a bulk warrant on privacy grounds. A lone judge dissented, bemoaning the fact that the high court punted on a case that could have disastrous effects on civil liberties.

# Am Law 100 Firm Furloughs U.S. Lawyers & Staff, Cuts Pay For All

The hits keep coming for the biggest of Biglaw firms thanks to the COVID-19 outbreak that’s crippled the U.S. economy. From salary cuts to furloughs to layoffs, there’s no end in sight for what firms are doing to protect their bottom lines and their fates in the legal market.

Today, we have news from Seyfarth, a firm that posted $669,360,000 gross revenue in 2018, earning it the 59th place on the latest Am Law 200 ranking. Seyfarth is taking some cost-cutting measures that seem quite austere. A memo detailing the firm’s plans is available on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-furloughs-u-s-lawyers-staff-cuts-pay-for-all/2/).

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In addition to salary cuts effective May 1 — equity partners will reduce their monthly draws by 20 percent (which started on April 1) while all U.S. lawyers will have their pay reduced by 10 percent and staff will see their pay reduced in levels, with those who earn $60,000 or less unaffected (0 percent on the first $60,000 of earnings; 5 percent on $60,000-$150,000 of earnings; 10 percent on earnings over $150,000) — the firm will be furloughing 10 percent of its U.S. employees for a 90-day period. The firm says those furloughed will be staff and a smaller percentage of attorneys; sources say the firm has furloughed 180 staff and 50 attorneys. Seyfarth will pay the full cost of all furloughed employees’ health coverage during the time they’re away from the firm.

The firm has also canceled its “summer fellow” program, but says it will provide stipends and extend offers to all law students who expected to work at the firm to join Seyfarth as “senior fellows” in fall of 2021, with their official start date as associates pushed back to January 2021.

Here’s a statement from Pete Miller, Chair and Managing Partner of Seyfarth Shaw:

Like most other firms, Seyfarth has elected to take prudent steps to protect our firm’s long-term success. While difficult, we believe these actions will see us through this unprecedented event and safeguard our firm’s future. We already have taken numerous steps to reduce costs that did not impact jobs. And while our financial foundation remains strong, we are implementing these new measures now out of caution. The last two years were among our best ever, and our Q1 financial results were also strong. But after pragmatically assessing the pandemic’s impact on our clients and the broader world economy — and the challenges they foretell for the rest of the year — we had to make several additional tough decisions this week.

While the measures will primarily apply to our US employees, we intend to follow a consistent approach across our international operations. Our hope and goal is to return to normal operations as soon as possible, and our first priority is to bring our people back to work. Our firm has already been tested by the pandemic in extraordinary ways, and I am inspired every day by the many ways that our team members are supporting our clients and each other in this challenging time. That includes doing everything we can to keep the firm headed in the right direction and to protect its future.

# Lawyer Delivers Oral Argument Before Supreme Court While Wife Is In Labor
## And no, it wasn't a labor law case.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I could be missing the birth of my child!

What could possibly be more stressful than delivering an oral argument before the Supreme Court? Delivering an oral argument before the Supreme Court while your pregnant wife is in labor a state away and worrying that you’ll miss the other most important delivery of your life.

This is exactly what happened to [Trevor Cox](https://www.huntonak.com/en/people/trevor-cox.html), Virginia’s former acting solicitor general when he delivered his oral argument in [Collins v. Virginia](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/collins-v-virginia/) — and no, it wasn’t a labor law case.

Cox, a 2009 Harvard Law graduate who now works as counsel at Hunton Andrews Kurth, revealed this competing delivery disaster in the annual holiday card that he sent to family and friends in December. Dan Diamond of POLITICO Pulse shared a portion of that card [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ddiamond/status/1080646022253211648) (with his friend’s permission, of course), where he said Cox’s story gave him “secondhand stress.” Take a look and pray to whatever god you believe in that you’ll never be forced to handle this amount of stress:

“Extremely impressive humblebrag. God tier,” [noted](https://twitter.com/JonEHecht/status/1080646860677603328) one of Diamond’s Twitter followers. “This may be a humblebrag least worthy of being humble,” [said](https://twitter.com/KaraLA/status/1080649553202896896) another.

What’s more is that Cox, who took his fair share of intellectual blows from the justices during oral argument, never even mentioned what was going on back home before he began presenting his case before the high court, and his stoicism was mentioned by NPR legal correspondent Nina Totenberg in her [summation](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/09/576871856/supreme-court-hears-side-by-side-search-cases-on-rental-cars-and-driveways) of the day’s arguments:

It was a tough session for Cox — tougher than the justices knew. As soon as he got outside the courtroom he was on the phone to the delivery room back home, where his wife was about to give birth to his first child.

Congratulations to Trevor Cox and his wife on the birth of their daughter. Hopefully this year’s holiday card from the Cox family will be a little less stress-inducing.

Abracadabra! The first Magic Circle firm has now entered the summer 2021 salary wars. Freshfields will be pulling a rabbit out of its hat for associates and summer associates with an increase in salary for U.S. associates.

Now that Freshfields has entered the arena, it’s time for other firms like Allen & Overy, Clifford Chance, and Linklaters to up associate salaries. Associates at these firms should thank Freshfields for making the first move and forcing their firms into action.

Here’s what the new salary scale looks like at Freshfields, thanks to Davis Polk:

# Solving Biglaw's Gender Gap

Imagine you are a woman in your first month at a large law firm. Imagine that you escape the office to attend your daughter’s dance recital, and that when it ends, you find your phone littered with missed calls from the female chair of your new firm. If you expected to hear a friendly voice interested in your daughter’s performance on your voicemail, you chose the wrong profession. Instead, when you return those calls, you are scolded for being unavailable and told emphatically to never turn your phone off again.

That is a true story. It’s a disturbing one, but not unusual in the world of Biglaw—if you’ve spent time in or around large law firms, you know scores of women with [similar anecdotes](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-pink-ghetto/). I repeat it here because it is so representative of a message that women continuously receive at the highest levels of the profession: you can work here or care for your family, but don’t expect to do both. This particular scenario happened to involve a woman working for a woman—a dynamic that presents its own unique issues, as a female colleague pointed out to me—but the problem is bigger than that.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The message sent to the woman above is just one contributor to a broader “gender gap” that has plagued the profession, negatively impacting the compensation, retention, and advancement of talented female lawyers for years. The gender gap is a frustrating problem, all the more so because it has persisted despite being the subject of significant attention (or at the least, lip service) over the last few decades. Whatever its other failings, the legal profession does not lack for intelligent problem solvers. And yet, anecdotes like the above remain commonplace. Hard statistics—like the fact that fewer than 20 percent of partners in large law firms are women—are even more telling of just how far we have to go.

The time has passed to get mad about the gender gap. But the time has not passed to do something about it. Fortunately, an influential contingent of the Biglaw community will be gathering at Stanford next month to do just that.

The event is called the [Women in Law Hackathon](http://www.diversitylab.com/hackathons/). I’m thankful that Bloomberg Law will be part of it, having myself regretfully watched more than one female law school classmate give up a partnership at an elite New York firm because those firms could not accommodate the needs of working mothers. The stories they tell—one friend installed a playpen in her office in order to be in the company of her child—can be painful to hear. That’s speaking as a man who has benefitted from Biglaw’s failure to retain women (Bloomberg Law Vice President and General Manager [Melanie Heller](http://www.bna.com/melanie-heller1-m17179926033/), for instance, was formerly with large New York firms). I can only imagine how enraging the “gender gap” is to those it affects more personally.

Certainly, there are some obvious reasons why the gender gap has proved difficult to close in the legal profession. First and foremost, sophisticated firms pride themselves on being available to clients whenever and wherever needed. Many firms publicly boast of their 24/7 accessibility. It’s an ethos that, at least on its surface, feels incompatible with the demands of parenthood—or at least primary caregiving.

Second, corporate clients have not demanded more change. In my frustration over the gender gap, I recently asked [Aric Press](http://berneropress.com/aric-press/), former editor in chief of the American Lawyer and now partner at Bernero & Press, if law firms were genuinely committed to addressing the problem. He answered with a definitive maybe, but noted that sustained serious pressure from corporate clients would really move the needle. “So public relations haven’t changed things,” I asked, “but public companies could?” Aric agreed. When clients demand, firms adapt.

None of this, of course, excuses law firms for the continued existence of a gender gap. Whatever explanations exist, the fact is that law firms have proven adaptable when faced with problems they truly want to fix. Since just the recent recession, law firms have actively deleveraged, developed a new class of employees (non-partner track associates), moved back offices to low-cost jurisdictions, outsourced certain work, and created other new roles and structures.

Now, it’s time to apply the profession’s adaptability and creativity to the cause of gender parity. At Women in Law Hackathon, nine different teams will compete in a Shark Tank-like format, presenting ideas aimed at improving the retention and advancement of women in Biglaw. Representatives from 54 different firms are participating, and two thirds of the participants are managing partners, practice group chairs, or others in leadership positions.

Each of the nine teams of nine will include two thought leaders on talent and diversity issues, as well as one Stanford law student, further diversifying the perspectives.

Bloomberg Law will be awarding prize money to the top three teams. (More precisely, prizes of $10,000, $7,500, and $5,000 will go to the winning teams’ choice of non-profit organizations advancing women in the legal profession and beyond.) I don’t have the solution to closing the gender gap, but I will be thrilled to be hear lots of new ideas for doing so as one of the judges.

# Federal Judge Absolutely NAILS Supreme Court's Ethics Dumpster Fire

The Supreme Court abides by no ethical code and it shows.

Clarence Thomas received [roughly half a million in undisclosed gifts from a billionaire](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/paragon-of-virtue-clarence-thomas-has-been-given-millions-of-dollars-in-value-off-the-record-and-it-totally-hasnt-impacted-his-judging-not-one-bit-nope/), Sam Alito took [free luxury vacations including one where he traveled on a billionaire’s private jet](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/sam-alito-pro-publica-wall-street-journal-ethics/) (and didn’t bother to later recuse himself when that guy needed the Supreme Court to do him a solid!), and Sonia Sotomayor [failed to recuse herself in cases involving her publisher](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/sonia-sotomayor-ruled-on-copyright-cases-while-disclosing-book-fees-which-is-sort-of-like-years-of-covering-up-yacht-trips-and-private-school-tuition/) (and used public employees to perform tasks for her personal book sales, which [may or may not be acceptable under general ethics principles](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/sonia-sotomayor-schools-conservative-supreme-court-justices-on-the-right-way-to-respond-to-an-ethics-inquiry/)). And we’re not even getting into the “not really a scandal but feels a little icky” like [Venmogate](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/maybe-the-guardian-should-leave-the-clarence-thomas-exposes-to-pro-publica/).

And [the Supreme Court has a plan!](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/john-roberts-supreme-court-ethical-failure/) Oh, just kidding. The Supreme Court has no plan and feels anyone who thinks they should have a plan [should promptly f**k themselves](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/roberts-senate-budget-cuts/).

In today’s New York Times, Judge Michael Ponsor of the District of Massachusetts wrote a measured, eloquent, [and absolutely scathing rebuke of the Supreme Court’s ethical cesspool](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/14/opinion/supreme-court-ethics.html).

The recent descriptions of the behavior of some of our justices and particularly their attempts to defend their conduct have not just raised my eyebrows; they’ve raised the whole top of my head. Lavish, no-cost vacations? Hypertechnical arguments about how a [free private airplane flight](https://www.wsj.com/articles/propublica-misleads-its-readers-alito-gifts-disclosure-alaska-singer-23b51eda) is a kind of facility? A justice’s spouse prominently involved in [advocating on issues](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/22/briefing/ginni-thomas-clarence-thomas-russia-ukraine.html) before the court without the justice’s recusal? [Repeated omissions](https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Testimony%20of%20Hon.%20Mark%20L.%20Wolf%20with%20Exhibits%201-3%20(5.15.23).pdf) in mandatory financial disclosure statements brushed under the rug as inadvertent? A justice’s taxpayer-financed staff reportedly helping to [promote](https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-sotomayor-book-sales-ethics-colleges-b2cb93493f927f995829762cb8338c02) her books? Private school [tuition](https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-harlan-crow-private-school-tuition-scotus) for a justice’s family member covered by a wealthy benefactor? Wow.

Judge Ponsor offers examples from his own career where he turned down gifts that wouldn’t even be visible if graphed next to just Sam Alito’s shenanigans because that’s what judges are supposed to do. Indeed, what judges must do.

All my judicial colleagues, whoever has appointed them, run into situations like these regularly, and I expect they have responded in just the same way. You don’t just stay inside the lines; you stay well inside the lines. This is not a matter of politics or judicial philosophy. It is ethics in the trenches.

On the other hand, you could make [bizarre “double standards” claims](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/judge-ho-clarence-thomas-ethics/) or compare luxury travel to [buying plastic Easter eggs and imaginary cookies](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/sam-alito-defenders-explain-private-air-travel-1000-wine-is-just-like-free-cookies-and-plastic-easter-eggs/). Right now, the Supreme Court seems content with this path.

# Former Vinson & Elkins Lawyer Leads Team To March Madness Showdown Against Tennessee

The Longwood Lancers only joined the top-tier of college basketball in 2007 and are heading to the NCAA tournament this week as the 14th seed.

It’s a different kind of T14 for Longwood coach Griff Aldrich, who always longed to coach basketball, but [took a detour along the way to attend UVA Law and wind up in Biglaw](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2022/03/07/griff-aldrich-longwood-ncaa-tournament/).

Aldrich hoped to begin his coaching career right out of college, having accepted a graduate assistant position with Dave Odom at Wake Forest. Unfortunately, Aldrich also hedged his bets with a law school application and Odom withdrew Aldrich’s coaching offer upon learning that the graduate had a chance at a law school education, a reminder that everyone thinks it’s great to be a lawyer except lawyers themselves.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
After a year trying to pay off T14 loans with D-III coaching, Aldrich realized it was time to get a real job, joining up with Vinson & Elkins in Houston. From there, he got into the oil and gas business and took a top job in an investment firm. He was making around $800K/year.

But basketball kept coming back for him. He started an AAU team to help kids in Houston. And when his best friend from college — Dave Odom’s son, Ryan — took the head coaching job at UMBC, Aldrich called and asked to help him out.

He joined UMBC as Director of Basketball Operations with a $32K/year salary.

After UMBC entered the national consciousness as the first and to date only 16 seed to upset a 1 seed,[[1]](#f1)
Aldrich was ready to move to a head job. Longwood’s school president — who overlapped with Aldrich at UVA Law — lined Aldrich up with a $150K salary and an opportunity to finally be the D-I head coach he’d always wanted to be.

A dominating season in the Big South ended with a conference tournament victory and a bid to the tournament. Some burst bubbles over the weekend helped the school crawl up to the 14 line.

The Lancers take on SEC Tournament champs Tennessee this Thursday at 2:45 Eastern.

# One In-House Counsel’s Take On 'Non-Negotiable Expectations' (Part II)
## The continuation of my reaction to the Paul Hastings now-infamous 'Non-Negotiable Expectations' slide deck.

Just this week, I used one of my vacation days midweek to attend a workshop focused on my family. In my out-of-the-office message on Outlook, I shared why I was out and requested that I only be reached in an emergency — defining it as something that could not wait until the next day. Most of my business clients understood — but I had a client reach out to one of my colleagues with a few nonemergency requests.

I share that to say — in continuation of my reaction to the Paul Hastings now-infamous Non-Negotiable Expectations slide deck — regardless of whether you are in-house or outside counsel, when it comes to timeliness and quality, some clients really do “expect everything to be done perfectly and delivered yesterday.” And I can assure you that I do not get paid $850-plus for one hour of my time.

Rather, providing “prompt, professional and polished” work is a part of being an excellent business partner and lawyer — regardless of how much you may be compensated. Although the author of the deck may have a valid point that if the billable rate is high then the expectation for excellence may be raised such that the acceptable margin for error may be very low. It’s a nod to the inverse of the adage, “You get what you pay for.” Like consumer goods, if you buy something that costs a lot, there is an expectation that the quality will be better.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
I also didn’t mind the advice to “take ownership of everything you do” or the reminder that a lawyer’s credibility and reputation is integral to your career. It’s true, isn’t it? While the “you own every mistake” sounds harsh, professional rules of professional conduct demand as such. If you recall, if you are a supervising attorney, you “own” your associate’s and paralegal’s mistakes too.

And maybe it’s just me, but as a young lawyer, I’d much rather someone explicitly share these kind of expectations with me, than for me to figure it out on my own. Giving notice and having disclosures is certainly a notion within our profession. But more importantly, if these expectations don’t work for me, I’d much prefer the transparency so I can pivot.

The part of the deck that did cause me to cringe was the advice that “I don’t know” is never an acceptable answer. I think it should have had a caveat: “I don’t know” is never an acceptable answer in and of itself. In other words, simply shrugging and saying “I don’t know” without any effort in trying to find out is unacceptable in our profession.

At the same time, “I don’t know for sure but based on what I could find, I think …” is different. Similar to “no questions until you’ve tried to figure something out for yourself,” the actual rub is when a young lawyer has not put forth any effort or attempted to engage in independent thinking before asking for someone to simply show them how or point them to the answer. For those of the generation of Yoda and his “do or do not, there is no try,” this is probably a point of deep frustration with younger generations.

Candidly, as a client, I don’t relish the idea of paying for your young lawyer to spin their wheels, and from a talent development and retention perspective, it may be a better approach for firms to “show” and not just “tell” new associates what to do.

In closing, am I in support of toxic law firm culture? No, of course not. I left because it wasn’t for me. But was the content on the PowerPoint slide as audacious as many seemed to believe? Not in my experience. To me, it was more akin to real talk, with some misplaced sarcasm that doesn’t translate through text alone.

Then again, in full disclosure, I regularly work with a couple of attorneys at Paul Hastings — and love feeling like VIP at Four Seasons and Alinea.*

# Why Reason Isn’t Enough
## Good legal managers appeal to emotion -- not just facts.

If you had to describe the basic function of an attorney, it would be to accurately investigate and frame the facts we are presented with, and then analyze those facts using logic and the law. We’re trained for that analysis, we’re very good at it, and we’re generally paid well for our skills. As managers of law firms, though, we desperately need to stop relying solely on facts.

Facts Matter…

Let me explain. Everything we do in our function as attorneys is premised on our ability to gather an accurate picture of the situation on the ground. Trial lawyers spend most of their careers engaging in discovery. Transactional attorneys do hours upon hours of due diligence to advise on whether a deal makes sense or not. When we go into the courtroom or belly up to the negotiation table, we and all the other attorneys put on our lawyer hats and agree that, in this room, leave your emotions at the door. It’s the facts that matter.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
You can’t become a lawyer if you’re not prepared to embrace this paradigm. The LSAT screens out anyone who can’t engage in logical reasoning based on fact patterns. Law school drilled us all in writing using some variation of the IRAC formula — Issue, Rule, Analysis, Conclusion. Every legal brief begins with a recitation of the facts that compel its legal conclusion. Contracts routinely contain recitals at the beginning explaining the background from which the deal contained within arises.

If there’s a recurring theme to this column, though, it’s that the skills that make us excellent lawyers can make us terrible businesspeople.

…Until They Don’t

The facts-first analysis approach breaks down when we attempt to apply it to the human problems that arise in law firm management. On the issues that matter most, [facts don’t change minds](https://heleo.com/facts-dont-change-peoples-minds-heres/16242/amp/).

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It’s [increasingly well documented](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/03/this-article-wont-change-your-mind/519093/) that humans have a tendency to get locked into their most closely held beliefs, and react poorly when presented with evidence tending to disprove those beliefs. We’re designed to avoid the cognitive dissonance that such evidence creates. Most of the time, we avoid the cognitive dissonance not by changing our minds, but by doubling down on our initial opinion.

There’s a whole host of inefficient, problematic behaviors that get grouped together under the concept of “confirmation bias.” At its simplest, humans tend to be biased in favor of evidence that confirms their preexisting beliefs. For a (hopefully) innocuous example, if you loathed the New England Patriots heading into Sunday’s Super Bowl, you’re more likely to read an online article called “Why The Pats Secretly Stink” than one titled “15 Things The Patriots Do Better Than Any Other Team.” If you were a die-hard Patriots fan, the opposite would probably be true. We find an inherent pleasure in being told that we’re right, and we seek out and reward those who do that for us.

Rational Arguments Can Make Everything Worse

There’s also another, more sinister side to confirmation bias. Beyond just seeking out affirmations that we’re correct, humans are wired to actively discount evidence that contradicts the beliefs we hold most dear. Most of us will happily dismiss contradicting evidence as flawed, biased, or simply wrong before we admit that it may have a point and we may need to change our minds. The more essential that belief is to our concept of ourselves, the more desperately we cling to it, and the harder we fight against evidence that cuts against us.

Oftentimes, presenting someone with facts that contradict their long-held, sincere, but objectively wrong belief only ends up reinforcing their original position. We’re motivated to find flaws that allow us to discount the evidence against us, and once we’ve successfully (in our minds) rebutted those arguments, we’ve convinced ourselves even further that our original position was correct all along.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The human mind tells itself it seeks truth, but it more often seeks happiness and comfort. Lawyers train themselves to avoid those cognitive traps, to rely on facts and attempt to be objective about our analysis. We’re typically aided by our emotional removal from the problems we’re analyzing. In private practice, we’re often not deeply emotionally invested in our clients being right or wrong. We want to get them a good result, but it won’t shake us to our core if our analysis leads us to conclusions our clients won’t like.

We don’t have the privilege of that same objectivity removal when it comes to dealing with our own personal interests, which is what firm management is all about. Firm managers who try to treat their attorneys and staff as just another set of clients, to be presented with and persuaded by facts and analytics, are setting themselves up for failure.

Your People Are Human, So Treat Them Like It

I’ve spoken with firm managers from across the spectrum, from boutiques to international megaliths, and the same stories repeat themselves. For example, a well-meaning management team approaches a partner to explain that they’re not going to receive the compensation they’re asking for. Management spends time laying out the revenues, expenses, profitability, and other objective aspects of that partner’s practice, and presents what it sees as an airtight case to support their decision. The partner in question dismisses this analysis out of hand, claims management is forgetting or inappropriately discounting all sorts of contributions the partner makes, compares themselves favorably to other partners who make more money, and digs in on their demands. Any human will struggle to see past their own self-interest, and most firms do a terrible job of understanding that fact and trying to cross the emotional gap. The two sides end up in a stalemate, neither convincing the other, until either someone cracks or the partner departs. Either result leaves the firm worse off than it was.

All is not lost. There are tried and true ways we can mitigate confirmation bias. It starts with accepting that when we make decisions as firm managers that impact our people personally and professionally, we need to spend more time appealing to emotion than we do appealing to reason. We need to find ways to present evidence that people don’t want to hear in a way that doesn’t lead them to conclude we think they’re wrong, stupid, and worthless to have ever disagreed with us. One powerful tool is assuring people that their position was entirely understandable and correct given what they knew, but that this new information should change their mind. We give them an out. We let them take comfort in the idea that they were already right, but that by accepting your arguments they become more right.

On a more personal level, we can look within ourselves and aspire to [intellectual humility](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/getting-it-right-when-we-get-it-wrong/), the willingness to accept that we might be wrong about things that mean a lot to us, and to make changes if that is the case. Intellectual humility isn’t about being right, but about becoming incrementally less wrong.

Let’s get out of our comfort zone, drop the facts for a minute, and take care of our people’s emotional needs. If we lead our teams by the heart, their heads will follow.

# 3 Questions For A Litigator Turned Litigation Funding Executive (Part II)
## Even without the increased stress on law firms and clients due to COVID-19, funders like Longford are positioning themselves as true financial partners for companies with meritorious legal claims -- no matter where in the life cycle of those claims the funder gets involved.

This week, I continue my written interview with John Garda of [Longford Capital](https://www.longfordcapital.com/leadership), regarding his experiences leaving a Biglaw partnership to join a leading litigation funder. Please see below for John’s answers to my second and third questions, focused on how clients and law firms can best position their matters to attract investment from litigation funders like Longford.

As usual, I have added some brief commentary to John’s answers below but have otherwise presented his answers as he provided them.

Gaston Kroub: How can clients, and not just law firms, take advantage of the opportunities presented by litigation finance?

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
John Garda: Longford Capital provides several funding options directly to our corporate clients. We are currently experiencing an increase in demand for our capital as the impact from the COVID-19 crisis continues to negatively impact individual companies and industries. In this uncertain and stressful landscape, our capital may provide a critical resource for businesses, and our industry continues to quickly evolve and innovate along the way to provide additional offerings. These offerings should prove especially useful in the current business climate. For example, in addition to traditional litigation funding of attorneys’ fees and expenses involved with bringing the claims, Longford Capital also provides a lump-sum catch-up payment to the business claim owner for attorneys’ fees and expenses that were previously incurred in the litigation before entering into a funding arrangement.

In addition, we are experiencing an increase in demand for ordinary working capital needs from businesses. As certain businesses struggle with short-term and long-term cash flow needs and other budgetary challenges, they can take advantage of the availability of our capital to overcome these challenges. We are now increasingly capable of stepping in and providing working capital to not only help these companies remain operational — but also to allow them to thrive — while also pursuing their legal claims.

Moreover, we are experiencing an increase in businesses wanting to monetize their existing legal claims before those claims are finally resolved in the underlying litigation. Many businesses want to take advantage of our available capital and recoup some of the losses in the form of cash now, not later. In the right circumstances, Longford Capital offers to pay the claim owner a portion of the claim’s perceived value up-front, so the company can earn a return at any stage of the litigation, including before even filing the claim, or after trial when a favorable judgment is currently pending on appeal.

GK: If anyone had any doubt that incorporating a discussion with litigation funders is a good idea for IP lawyers, John’s answer should dispel any such doubts. Even without the increased stress on law firms and clients due to COVID-19, funders like Longford are positioning themselves as true financial partners for companies with meritorious legal claims — no matter where in the life cycle of those claims the funder gets involved. At bottom, Longford seems committed to offering financial support for claimants and their counsel when and where it is needed. Getting access to that support, however, comes with an obligation to do some real work. For how best to do so, read on.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
What advice would you give to practicing IP lawyers interested in seeking out litigation funding on either a case or portfolio basis?

JG: Before approaching the funder, the IP lawyer should prepare a set of documents including the key information that the funder will need to help expedite the due diligence process. In addition to a full case budget and a damages analysis, the IP lawyer should include claim charts involving the top three to four patents aimed at the top three to four targets and any information related to validity including the results of any prior art searches and a re-examination. It is critical that the IP lawyer take ownership of the claim charts that are presented to the funder and be able to explain them in great detail.

Scheduling an initial conference call with the funder at the very beginning of the process is strongly recommended to introduce yourself, discuss the case and the package of information provided, and allow the funder to ask some preliminary questions. This is a very good first step toward establishing effective communication with the funder. The best way to position yourself for success is to be very attentive to the funder’s specific requirements and responsive to any requests for additional information. Maintaining effective communication throughout the process will help ensure the best chance of obtaining a successful funding arrangement.

One common mistake that IP attorneys make when presenting a case to a funder is focusing almost exclusively on liability and ignoring, for the most part, any meaningful damages analysis. Worse yet, providing a pie-in-the-sky damages analysis quickly falls apart when put to the test by the funder. This may cause a funder to quickly pass on an otherwise promising opportunity.

As with any business transaction, maintaining credibility is paramount. To that end, a practicing IP lawyer seeking funding should be very candid when assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the case. Using a matter-of-fact tone in presenting the case and shooting straight with the funder goes a long way in building trust. Proactively addressing the challenging aspects of your case while explaining how best to deal with those challenges is extremely helpful to better position your case for funding.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
GK: I have long been a proponent of a “damages first” approach to evaluating claims. Taking that approach necessitates an honest appraisal — by both client and law firm — of the likelihood of the case or cases achieving the client’s financial goals, while sticking to the agreed-upon terms of any engagement between the client and their counsel. If the decision is made to try to involve a funder like Longford, it makes complete sense to recognize that at bottom there are financial metrics that must be met — both in terms of potential case recovery relative to the investment, as well as with respect to controlling the matter’s costs. As John correctly notes, a relationship with a funder is exactly that — a relationship — and common sense dictates that the foundational aspects of any relationship (e.g., candor, pragmatism, etc.) hold true in interactions between counsel and a funder. It may still be early days for many IP lawyers when it comes to litigation funding. But, in my view at least, the time to start thinking about your firm’s relationship with potential funders was yesterday.

My thanks to John for the insights and cooperation, and I wish him continued success at the cutting-edge of litigation funding’s inroads into the legal industry. It is always a privilege to hear from someone who is engaged in interesting and timely work of deep interest to IP lawyers and their clients, and I thank John for agreeing to this interview. I am always open to conducting interviews of this type with other IP thought leaders, so feel free to reach out if you have a compelling perspective to offer.

Although corporate activity has retrenched from record highs in 2021, the Chicago legal economy and attorney job market remain robust, underscoring the variance between the strong labor market and the challenges of high inflation and a volatile stock market.

2021 Was a Record Year for Chicago Lateral Attorney Hiring

Like other major markets, Chicago experienced unprecedented law firm lateral attorney hiring during the 2021 economic recovery.  The surge of transactional work stretched the attorney benches of leading large and midsize law firms in Chicago, the third-largest legal economy in the U.S.  Corporate, lending, and real estate transactions significantly outpaced the number of available attorneys (mainly associates) needed to handle the matters.  M&A deals reached record highs in 2021—especially private equity-related transactions.  Notably, Chicago’s Kirkland & Ellis led all firms globally in 2021 as the top dealmaker advising companies on M&A transactions totaling over $443 billion.[[1]](#_ftn1)  Similarly, litigation saw an uptick in attorney hiring as courts worked through an extensive backlog of cases that were on hold during the pandemic.

The top Am Law-ranked, regional, and midsize law firms in Chicago hired a whopping 1,586 lateral attorneys between January 1, 2021, and December 31, 2021 (1,103 associates, 311 partners, and 172 counsels).[[2]](#_ftn2)  This was a 70% increase over the 933 Chicago lateral attorneys hired in 2020.  Markedly, associate hiring increased by 94%.  Compared to the pre-pandemic economy, 2021 Chicago law firm lateral attorney hiring was 57% greater than the five-year average of lateral attorneys hired between 2015 and 2019, when firms hired an average of 1,011 lateral attorneys annually.  The difference is even starker when comparing associates only: Chicago lateral associate hiring in 2021 was 78% higher than the five-year average between 2015 and 2019.  The leading practice areas driving the 2021 hiring boom were corporate (M&A, capital markets, and fund formation), finance, litigation, real estate, and IP (litigation and prosecution).

Sustained Hiring Strength in 2022

Turning to 2022, M&A and other corporate transactions have slowed down from last year, but corporate activity has not fully retreated. Rather, it has returned to [pre-pandemic levels](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2022/global-m-and-a-industry-trends-2022-midyear-outlook.html), which were still high by historical standards.  For the time being, the Chicago legal economy and lateral attorney hiring continue to perform strongly.  In the first half of 2022, there were 805 lateral attorneys hired by top Am Law-ranked, regional, and midsize law firms in Chicago.  This is actually ahead of the pace of Chicago lateral attorney hiring during the same period in 2021.  Notably, lateral hiring increased in the second quarter of 2022 (451 hires), compared to the first quarter (354 hires).

Core transactional practices continue to drive the Chicago legal economy, including large cap and upper middle-market private equity M&A and fund formation, strategic M&A, commercial finance, and real estate transactions.  In the first half of 2022, Chicago firms hired 201 corporate and finance lateral attorneys, which was an increase from the 163 hires in the first half of 2021.  Real estate had 66 lateral attorney hires in the first half of 2022, as compared to 43 hires during this period in 2021.  One impact of financial market volatility and other economic factors on corporate practice groups in Chicago and globally is a slowdown in capital markets.  Equity offerings have sharply declined with U.S. IPO volume down [95% from this point last year](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-28/us-ipos-can-t-shake-2022-slump-after-thriving-through-pandemic), but the majority of Chicago capital markets practices are debt focused.  While debt issuance has decreased, it has generally [retrenched to pre-pandemic levels](https://www.refinitiv.com/perspectives/market-insights/global-capital-markets-hit-the-brakes-in-h1/).

Leading Chicago commercial litigation and white-collar investigations practice groups have also maintained a busy pace in 2022, with strength in class action, securities, antitrust, FCPA, False Claims Act, and products liability cases.  Breach of contract matters have also increased, with an uptick in COVID-related business and supply chain disruption disputes.  There were 320 litigation lateral attorney hires in Chicago in the first half of 2022, an increase from 271 hires in the first half of 2021.  IP associate hiring has grown substantially, with particular demand for associates with pharmaceutical, biotech, electrical engineering, and computer science degrees.  As a major tech company and startup hub, Chicago is seeing an increase in tech transactions (licensing, software, and joint ventures), data privacy, and cybersecurity associate positions.  Chicago law firms hired 75 IP lateral attorneys in the first half of 2022, as compared to 58 IP lateral attorneys in the first half of 2021.  We have also recently seen more associate openings in restructuring practice groups, though not at the high levels that typically accompany a recession.

Before the pandemic, there was a sustained deficit of midlevel corporate, finance, real estate, and IP associates due to insufficient hiring in these areas through summer associate programs in earlier years.  Further, the limited number of law students matriculating with the most desirable engineering and life science degrees has always driven IP associate shortages.  Early 2020 COVID-related hiring freezes and layoffs further compounded these associate scarcities, pushing firms to their absolute maximum work capacity in 2021 and continuing into 2022.  Chicago lateral attorney hiring persistence correlates with strong national job growth in the legal sector, which in June added “35,200 more jobs than in June of 2021,”[[3]](#_ftn3) as reported in the [ABA Journal](https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/legal-jobs-continued-upward-climb-in-june-adding-92300-jobs-since-pandemic-low). The sector has grown to a total of 1,185,600 jobs, [exceeding the record highs prior to the Great Recession.](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/number-us-legal-jobs-now-exceeds-pre-great-recession-record-high-2022-07-08/)[[4]](#_ftn4)  However, we could potentially see more of an impact from the economy on hiring in the coming months—decreases in corporate legal work typically lag a few months behind actual reduction in corporate activity.

We are still seeing new associate positions open daily and are currently working on a range of posted and unposted associate searches in these and other practice areas with prominent large and midsize firms in Chicago.

With increased lateral associate demand in 2021, we saw significant compensation increases at Chicago law firms.  Currently, most of the top Chicago Am Law 100 firms have adopted the Cravath market-level base and bonus scales.  There are, however, many firms in Chicago with lower compensation scales, thereby creating major associate income disparities.  Many large Am Law-ranked Chicago firms remain on the 2021 market base salary scale with at or below market bonuses.  Some firms are even below last year’s market compensation scales.  This can create large income disparities between associates, in some cases reaching as high as six figures.  The potential for a substantial compensation increase creates a strong incentive for associates to lateral.  Signing bonuses for associates in high-demand practice areas are still common, though somewhat less frequent than in 2021.  On the return-to-office front, most firms have now implemented a 2–3 day per week in-office policy.  Firms are generally moving away from fully remote positions, but many transactional practice groups are still offering these roles, which are particularly attractive to associates earning Cravath-level salaries and bonuses while living in lower-cost cities.

Chicago also continues to be an attractive market for law firm expansion, with many firms opening new Chicago offices in the past few years.  Most recently, Norton Rose Fulbright launched their Chicago office in April 2022 and now has 16 attorneys with capabilities in tech transactions, data privacy, litigation, labor and employment, and energy transactions.

We anticipate steady continued lateral attorney hiring in the near term in Chicago.  If you are an attorney considering a lateral move in Chicago or elsewhere, having a local recruiter who is dedicated to the specific market is critical.  At Lateral Link, we are both a leading international search firm and a team of expert recruiters individually dedicated to specific cities and regions. Our recruiters effectively leverage their local market intelligence and strong firm relationships to facilitate a successful lateral search and interview process.

# Biglaw Firm Delays Start Date For First-Year Associates In Certain Practice Groups
## The firm will be offering a stipend to its deferred associates.

It wasn’t long ago that news spread of more Biglaw firms considering [deferrals for their entering first-year associate classes](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/more-biglaw-firms-are-considering-deferring-first-year-associates/) in the wake of [Gunderson](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/biglaw-firm-lays-off-10-of-its-workforce-may-defer-incoming-associates/) and [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/after-layoffs-last-year-cooley-delays-start-date-for-first-year-associates/) being the first to do so. After all, demand is expected to increase at the start of the new year, and many firms are eager to start their new associates off on the right foot — especially associates in corporate practices.

We know that firms aren’t looking forward to announcing these deferrals, but it looks like that time has come.

According to a source at Fenwick & West — a firm that brought in $750,435,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it in 66th place in the most recent Am Law 100 — a memo (available on the next page) was sent to incoming associates on May 30, offering information on their start dates. Per that memo, Fenwick, a leading firm for the technology sector, is deferring the start date of its first-year corporate and technology transactions associates to January 16, 2024, while its entry-level litigation and tax associates will be starting on October 16, 2023.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As noted in the memo, incoming associates in the firm’s corporate and tech transactions practices will receive a $15,000 stipend to assist with their living costs during their deferral. As noted previously, Cooley is offering a $10,000 stipend to its deferred incoming associates, so Fenwick is already ahead of the game when it comes to providing financial security to those who find themselves unexpectedly out of work.

The firm did not immediately respond to our request for comment.

Best of luck to those impacted by Fenwick’s deferral decision.

# Making Room For DEI: The Legal Ops Perspective
## As the demand for DEI initiatives grows, so does the need for a capable leader to take charge.

I recently spoke with a new general counsel who, like so many others, wants to build diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) objectives into the company culture. 

“Torts, contracts, civil procedure, constitutional law,” she listed. “None of my law school courses mentioned DEI! And the law firm I came from merely paid lip service to it.”  

As the demand for DEI initiatives grows, so does the need for a capable leader to take charge. In many organizations, the GC is the go-to person.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“But how can you make DEI a priority,” I asked my friend, “when you have so many other pressing matters on your plate?” 

- Around 60% of corporate law departments have recently seen a rise in the number of matters to manage. Yet, budgets haven’t risen at the same rate.
- CLOs/GCs [report increases](https://www.ftitechnology.com/l/gc-report-2023) in numerous types of matters such as fraud, misconduct, data privacy violations, class action litigation, contract management demands, internal investigations, and more. Meanwhile, legal departments are [hiring and outsourcing less](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/when-it-comes-to-in-house-work-its-a-legal-operations-world-and-were-all-just-living-in-it/). 
- [65% of decisions](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-make-better-business-decisions) are now more complex (involving more stakeholders or choices) than before. 
- The variety of regulations cited in 10-Ks tripled and the total volume of citations to regulations quadrupled over [a recent 20-year period](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2891494).
Legal departments are biz-eeee, y’all. It’s tough to go it alone. That’s one reason [six in 10 legal departments](https://www.acc.com/clo2022) now have at least one dedicated legal operations professional, and [70% of chief legal officers](https://accounsel.realmagnet.land/fy-2023-clo-survey) listed legal operations as the top strategic initiative last year.

Legal ops specialists cultivate a comprehensive perspective of how an entire organization functions. By pairing deep institutional knowledge with their multidisciplinary expertise, legal ops pros bring an informed and many-sided outlook to the table that significantly expands both your vision and influence. 

Legal ops teams help [design purposeful strategies](https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/2023/01/24/legal-ops-getting-greater-say-in-developing-strategy-companywide/) for collaboration, process efficiency, and operational excellence, often incorporating the optimal technology solutions to do so. GCs and CLOs can rely on them to connect actions to results as they:

- Provide detailed context to understand fundamental DEI issues and target specific areas to improve.
- Define specific goal-oriented success metrics and set initial benchmarks. 
- Consistently track and report progress with the efficiency of automated analytics.
- Ensure the company’s commitment is genuine and leaders are fully accountable.
Meet DEI Challenges

In other words, legal ops pros have the skills to implement the five common DEI factors McKinsey’s [DEI Lighthouses 2023 Report](https://www.mckinsey.com/Featured-Insights/Diversity-and-Inclusion/Diversity-Equity-and-Inclusion-Lighthouses-2023) says yield the most significant impact for underrepresented groups:

- A meaningful definition of success
- Accountable and invested business leaders
- A solution designed for its specific context
- Rigorous tracking and course correction.
Through partnering with a legal ops pro, my friend’s DEI initiatives can flourish while she focuses on the legal functions that bring value to the business.

Aligning interests to achieve mutually beneficial relationships is a key aspiration for law departments and outside counsel alike. 

In this episode of the UpLevel View podcast, legal operations expert Elizabeth Lugones of UpLevel Ops is joined by [Yusuf Mohamed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sphinx/), partner and member of the General Counsel practice at Taylor English Duma LLP.

Yusuf shares strategies beyond traditional cost analysis and performance monitoring, emphasizing the importance of viewing outside counsel as strategic partners rather than service providers. 

The discussion includes: 

- The challenges of managing legal practices as the organization grows, especially in implementing consistent engagement with outside counsel.
- The importance of in-house teams being proactive and setting clear expectations for law firms.
- Contrasting the communication methodologies between law firms and in-house departments, noting the differences in audiences and workflow.
- The future potential of more sophisticated AI tools to analyze legal data and envision possible legal risk scenarios.
- Why clients should not be hesitant about trying different pricing models, with the understanding that they can revert to old methods if unsatisfied.
- Transparency, conversation, and alignment of interests for achieving mutual benefits.

In the latest episode of The Jabot, I speak with Roberta D. Liebenberg and Stephanie A. Scharf. They’re the co-authors of a new study co-sponsored by the American Bar Association and ALM Intelligence that addresses why senior women lawyers are leaving law firms. We also delve into the results of the study which are simultaneously deeply upsetting and incredibly illuminating.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wears when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

# Ex-Biglaw Partner Pleads Guilty After 20 Years As A Fugitive
## Since the 1990s, this former Hunton partner has been dogged by allegations of illegal financial schemes.

Scott Wolas, 69, is a former litigation partner at Hunton & Williams (legacy firm of Hunton Andrews Kurth), and that is pretty much the least fascinating part of this story. See, since the late 90s, Wolas has been dogged by allegations of a wide variety of financial crimes. He even went on the lam when charges were brought against him in New York as part of a liquor-exporting scheme.

In 1995, Wolas was kicked out of his position in the Hunton partnership amid a scandal alleging overbilling and an outside investment scheme that swindled millions of dollars from investors. In 1997, he was indicted on 119 counts of fraud and grand larceny in New York over his alleged Ponzi scheme. That’s right around when he first went on the run, using a series of false identities to elude authorities over the years. By 1999, his financial antics led to his disbarment, and his now-former firm was left to clean up his mess. Hunton[ paid at least $6 million](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB914375187940915500) to investors over his liquor-exporting scheme. Plus the firm settled with a former associate who [alleged they were wrongfully fired](http://www.leagle.com/decision/19971181245AD2d936_1241/GEARY%20v.%20HUNTON%20&%20WILLIAMS) after pressing for an inquiry into Wolas’s billing practices.

Wolas was finally arrested in 2017 — but over a different, allegedly fraudulent financial scheme. By that time he was going by the name Eugene Grathwohl, and he convinced at least 19 people to give him $1.7 million as part of an investment scheme to buy a bar in Quincy, Massachusetts. But a week before the deal was set to close, Wolas pulled another vanishing act, disappearing with the money.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Wolas was tracked down by investigators to Florida, in the same town where to real Eugene Grathwohl lives. Wolas has now reached a deal with federal prosecutors, entering a plea to seven counts of wire fraud, one count of aggravated identity theft, one count of misusing a Social Security number, and one count of tax evasion.

[According to Law.com](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/06/29/ex-hunton-lawyer-longtime-fugitive-admits-to-1-7m-real-estate-fraud/), Wolas faces up to 20 year in jail, and he’ll have to pay an awful lot in restitution:

Wolas could face a maximum of 20 years in prison plus three years of supervised release on the wire fraud charges, while the identity theft charge carries a minimum sentence of two years that must be served in addition to any other prison sentence Wolas receives.

Prosecutors said that as part of Wolas’ [plea deal](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4568335-Wolas-Plea-Deal.html), filed in court on Thursday, they would also recommend he pay restitution of about $1.79 million to his victims, plus $69,768 to the Social Security Administration and Medicare, and another $318,266 to the Internal Revenue Service.

Wolas’s sentencing is scheduled for October 2nd.

# Top Am Law Firm's Massive Restructuring Leaves 4 Percent Of U.S. & U.K. Staff Out Of Work
## The firm says the pandemic has affected the way they work, and that's why these cuts are being made.

It’s long been a trend for Biglaw firms to reduce the amount of staff that is needed to support attorneys, but the economic upheaval of the coronavirus crisis seems to have supercharged the issue. This past fall, many firms restructured and rightsized their ranks, but as COVID continues to run rampant across the globe, with new variants and shutdowns in place, it looks like the cuts may climb in 2021. The latest firm to slash its staff headcount is Morrison & Foerster.

With $1,147,200,000 gross revenue in 2019, the firm came in 32nd place on the most recent Am Law 100 ranking. But despite this huge sum, the firm is moving ahead with layoffs among its staff members. “Staff and attorney morale is in the crapper,” said one of our sources.

According to a spokesperson, 38 employees will be impacted by the layoffs, representing “approximately 4% of staff positions in the U.S.” and a “handful of staff roles in the UK.” Here is a statement we received from MoFo:

The pandemic has affected the way we work as a Firm, and how we deliver for our clients and attorneys. This has accelerated trends, particularly in how we support our practices and staff our physical offices.

To position the Firm for continued success, we regularly evaluate our staffing model in light of technology advances, demand for services, and the needs of the business, and make adjustments accordingly. As part of this process, it became obvious that the fundamental changes we have experienced over the past year will outlast the pandemic, and that we needed to adapt, investing in those roles that best serve our clients’ emerging needs.

As a result of this review, we have taken the immensely difficult decision to eliminate approximately 4% of staff positions in the U.S., and follow a redundancy consultation process for a handful of staff roles in the UK. We have not taken this painful decision lightly, but felt it was necessary to address the evolving nature of our work, and to position the Firm for continued strength and success. We deeply appreciate the dedicated and valuable contributions these individuals have made to the Firm. We are focused on supporting all affected colleagues, each of whom were informed on Friday. Those affected will be eligible for severance pay and outplacement services, as well as healthcare benefits for those based in the U.S.

Best of luck to all those who are affected by the layoffs at Morrison & Foerster.

# Kasowitz Supposedly Taking Credit For Firing Preet Bharara
## If this is true, it's a really bad move.

Sometimes when people are feeling a little full of themselves they make boasts that they can’t really back up. But the more dangerous move is when they make boasts they can back up… but shouldn’t be broadcasting. If the reports are true, it’s unclear which Marc Kasowitz is doing, but if it’s the latter, it’s more fuel for the mounting belief that this administration is deeply, deeply concerned about its criminal exposure.

Which is probably not the message the counsel for the president wants to convey.

Jesse Eisinger and Justin Elliott of Pro Publica, publishing in the Huffington Post, report that Kasowitz is telling people that [he’s the one](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-fired-preet-bharara_us_593fe341e4b0b13f2c6dd665?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009) who convinced Trump to go back on his commitment to retain SDNY U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Marc Kasowitz, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer in the Russia investigation, has boasted to friends and colleagues that he played a central role in the firing of Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, according to four people familiar with the conversations.

Kasowitz told Trump, “This guy is going to get you,” according to a person familiar with Kasowitz’s account.

Those who know Kasowitz say he is sometimes prone to exaggerating when regaling them with his exploits. But if true, his assertion adds to the mystery surrounding the motive and timing of Bharara’s firing.

The problem, of course, is that it doesn’t really matter whether he’s exaggerating or not if he’s really making this claim. Because this brag, true or not, implies that there’s something (or somethings) illegal going on that Trump not only needs to worry about, but are so troubling that he needs to go out and fire any lawyers with an ethical duty to investigate criminal conduct within the government. If the alleged boast involved telling Trump, “Preet’s a bad prosecutor” or “Preet’s bad for Wall Street” or even “Preet’s bad for my clients” that would be troubling but wouldn’t reflect on Trump’s own legal predicament. But to tell people that Trump fired Preet because you thought Preet could uncover criminal activity that could “get” the guy you represent? That’s not a good look.

It’s not as bad as the ethical breach of telling people you don’t represent [that they don’t need to hire lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/is-marc-kasowitz-drunk-on-his-own-power/), but it’s not good.

For Kasowitz’s sake, one hopes he’s either never said anything about Bharara’s firing or is egregiously misquoted on the justification he offered the president. Because if he’s really telling this story, he may want to lay off the bragging for awhile.

It’s been a while since we’ve gone on the road to meet with our readers in the wilds outside of New York, but it’s time we make another trip and check in with our Washingtonians. On August 20, at 8 p.m., we’ll be heading to Rosa Mexicano in National Harbor for an evening of drinks, small talk, and bar trivia with proceeds of the event going to the D.C. Bar’s Pro Bono Center.

You can [read all the details and sign up here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/trivia-challenge-at-iltacon-tickets-46580583780). And if you aren’t around but you know someone in the area, let them know about our party too. The more the merrier!

So… yes, it’s in National Harbor which the Washington snobs will point out isn’t really D.C., but it’s worth a trip out to get some food and drink and chat with us about the law and all those raises the firms just gave out.

And if you’re attending the International Legal Technology Association Convention that week, then you’ll already be in National Harbor and steps away from the restaurant! Come on over after you’ve finished up your complimentary drinks from the convention and chat with us about the show.

After an opportunity to mingle and find your teammates, Elie Mystal and I will take over the microphone and ask a few rounds of trivia questions — some mix of pop culture and law and technology to appeal to everyone — so we can crown the smartest lawyers/techies in the room.

Thinking of coming? Bully! Here are the details:

August 20, 8:00 p.m.-11:00 p.m.
Rosa Mexicano – National Harbor

The Washington Post’s Style section isn’t normally where you’d go for your lawyerly insights, but last week they graced us with not one, but two legal stories. Joe Patrice and guest host Kathryn Rubino dive into [Tiffany Trump’s alleged law school woes](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/tiffany-trump-isnt-just-a-typical-law-student-yeah-no-kidding/) and the [hilariously grumpy life of Wachtell’s George Conway](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/george-conway-throws-shade-all-over-kellyannes-puff-piece/) as he navigates his days married to Kellyanne. There’s also some Brett Kavanaugh talk, because why not?

# 12 Lateral Interview Tips From A Legal Recruiter
## The interviewer may control the format, but you control the message.

Interviews for lateral hiring are much more substantive than summer associate interviews. Be prepared to show off what you’ve learned in your years at the law firm. You’ll need to commit to memory your own legal experience and the basics about the group and firm with which you are interviewing. Remember that the interview is your chance to present your professional story, not just a series of facts and answers to questions. Go in there with an agenda: to tell the story you’d like to convey. The interviewer may control the format, but you control the message.

Preparing for interviews is one area where working with a legal recruiter can give you a real advantage over other candidates. A good legal recruiter will work with you throughout the entire lateral process. At the interview stage, your recruiter should help you to determine how to best articulate your story, to anticipate the interviewers’ questions, and to be ready for any curve balls they may throw at you.

- Know your resume and deal sheet/representative matters sheet cold and be able to talk intelligently about anything on them, even if it was years ago. Just be sure not to give share any information that might be confidential. If there is one thing that trips up more associates in interviews it is a failure to show their legal knowledge and grasp of legal concepts.
- Do as much homework on the firm and on your interviewers as you can. Read carefully the firm website and the bios of the people you’ll be meeting with. This will help you formulate appropriate and precise questions in advance, and help you avoid asking generic questions that indicate you did not do your research.
- Do not sound negative about your current firm. If your interviewers ask (which they likely will) why you want to leave, be honest. But to the greatest extent possible, phrase your answer in terms of why you will be better off as a member of their group (and why you will add value to their team) as opposed to citing negative points about your current situation.
- Be prepared to say why you want to join that firm/group specifically and not just any other firm. This, again, is where you need to know some specifics about the firm and about the group.
- If you are trying to relocate to a different city, be prepared to answer the question “Why?” and what ties you have to the new city.
- Definitely be yourself and stay serious, but to the extent it’s natural, crank up the enthusiasm and energy level as much as possible. This is especially important for litigators, where you are being evaluated very much on your presentation and not just on the substance of your responses to questions.
- Always be positive about your experience and interests. If you are asked a question and you don’t know the answer, it’s fine to say, “I don’t know,” but follow it up with something you do know and can talk about articulately.
- Be prepared to ask your interviewers a few questions. Memorize these questions. Certainly ask sincere questions, but this is also your chance to show them that you have done your homework on the firm.
- Remember interview basics: make eye contact (with everyone, if you are interviewing with more than one person), remember to smile, don’t interrupt.
- Don’t be overly informal or chatty; be natural and likeable but fairly serious. The best interviews are back-and-forth conversations, not inquisitions. But don’t just assume that having a buddy-buddy rapport with the interviewer necessarily means you nailed the interview. If you spend too much time talking about non-law interests, this may be a sign that the interviewer is just trying to kill time painlessly.
- Practice! Most lateral candidates have not interviewed in years. Interviewing is just like test-taking: no matter how well you know the substance, you still need to practice the execution. Ask a friend or your legal recruiter to do a mock interview with you. You do not want to sound rehearsed, but you do want to sound prepared.
- Make a list of general interview questions and questions specific to your resume and deal sheet and speak with your legal recruiter about the best way to answer these questions. As a recruiter, I have helped numerous candidates prepare for interviews and I have received constructive feedback from numerous partners following my candidates’ interviews. It’s always best to have a second opinion, and better yet from someone who has experience with the lateral hiring process.

# Appealing Bonuses For This Firm
## Keeping pace in the New York market.

Because Mayer Brown prides itself on its appellate practice… get it?

Look, coming up with new titles for all of these announcements are hard. In a way, it reflects the ennui of the associate classes out there who seem to be so uninspired to learn that they’ll be getting the same bonus scale again. Yet the show must go on so we’re out here trying to come up with some kind of clever packaging to put around the fact that Biglaw is marching in lockstep once again.

Mayer Brown, a firm that [just announced its interest in expanding its New York practice](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/12/05/new-mayer-brown-leader-in-new-york-sets-course-for-expansion/), was not going to offer any daylight between itself and the competition when it comes to recruitment and retention. The firm is offering a full Cravath match in New York, via a memo sent around this week.

For those who haven’t fully memorized this scale:

2018 $15K prorated
2017 $15K
2016 $25K
2015 $50K
2014 $65K
2013 $80K
2012 $90K
2011 and earlier $100K

Good news for the Mayer Brown crew!

UPDATE: Though we’ve heard things aren’t all rosy over at Mayer Brown. Apparently, this bonus announcement only applied to the NY office and the rest of the firm is wondering what’s up.

# I’m Sorry, But For $1,200 An Hour, You Don’t Get To Have An 'Off' Day

Although I sometimes lament having to authorize the payment on the monthly invoice, I consider our company lucky to have a very impressive Biglaw partner on retainer from a nationally known Biglaw firm.

The partner has one of those Ivy League, SCOTUS clerk résumés which makes a legal nerd salivate and opposing counsel (especially in the Midwest) quiver and take our demands seriously. Which is why I have no problem authorizing the monthly invoices or going to bat with our c-suite on the need to continue such a sizable engagement when they question its need when we have “perfectly capable attorneys in our own backyard.”

Time and again, this partner and his firm have proven to be worth their weight in gold. Their client response time and work product have been beyond reproach, but recently, they stumbled.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
They stumbled not in a publicly embarrassing or legally compromising kind of way. But rather, they stumbled in both the time it took them to deliver on a relatively straightforward assignment and the subsequent quality of the same.

Like most in-house operations, we have Biglaw on retainer for two primary reasons,. First, as illustrated above, it is nice to have someone in your corner that immediately invokes a sense of seriousness into a dispute. Second, sometimes our small in-house team simply lacks the bandwidth to deal with an issue. Our decision to farm out this particular assignment fell into the second rationale. It was not a particularly complex assignment, but we needed a well reasoned and convincing legal letter, and we needed it fast.

Our company was in the final stages (i.e., the “should we sue or settle?” stage) of an outstanding dispute and we believed a well-timed letter from our nationally known Biglaw partner could have tipped the scales toward a settlement, our preferred outcome.

After having not received a return contact from the partner after my frenzied voicemails and subsequent texts, I followed up with an email detailing our specific needs and I requested a draft by COB of the following day. While I know some of the Biglaw readers are chalking me up as yet another unreasonable client with another unrealistic timeline, I assure you our past work history with this Biglaw firm indicated this would not be a problem.

After my email went unacknowledged and the following day’s deadline came and went without the letter, I began to call my other contacts at the firm only to be told the partner was indeed in the office, but they knew he had been battling a bit of a cold during the week. Nevertheless, they assured me they would hunt him down and deliver on the letter in short order.

Lo and behold, I received a draft of the letter roughly two hours later, but after a quick review, I realized it was laden with typos and lacked the normal legal oomph I was accustomed to seeing from the partner.

Lacking the time to swap redlined versions of the document until it met my normal expectations, I opted to clean it up myself and send it on its way.

Lest you think I am heartless, in no way do I expect the partner on the case to be at my beck and call at all hours of the day. However, for the standard hourly rate shown for the partner on his subsequent invoice, you had better do a better job managing my expectations.

Feeling under the weather? I get it, but at least put one of your equally qualified colleagues on notice they may need to hop on an assignment at a moment’s notice.

As in-house clients, I will be the first to admit we can get a bit demanding from time to time, and I make a conscious effort to only make such unreasonable demands when it is absolutely worth it.

But as someone paying $1,200 an hour, I think I have earned that right.
