Thanks to Davis Polk’s long-awaited announcement, the Biglaw bonus levees have officially been breached, and law firms are making their own bonus announcements left and right. Watch out for the flood of cash that’s about to flow through the legal profession!

Debevoise & Plimpton — a firm that brought in $1,224,942,000 gross revenue in 2020, putting it at #31 in the most recent Am Law 100 — made its own bonus announcement this afternoon. Lo and behold, the firm has matched both the Cravath bonus scale and the Davis Polk special bonus scale. According to the memo sent to all associates, here’s what that looks like at Debevoise:

“This has been another year of extraordinary challenges,” writes presiding partner [Michael Blair](https://www.debevoise.com/michaelblair). “Despite those challenges, you have unfailingly met the needs of our clients at the highest level, while also providing invaluable support to your colleagues.” These generous bonuses, ranging from $15,000 to $138,000, are a special thank you from the firm and a wonderful way to end another difficult pandemic year on a high note.

Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Debevoise.)

It’s official. This morning, Arnold & Porter and Kaye Scholer [announced their plan](http://www.americanlawyer.com/law-firm-profiles-result?firmname=Kaye+Scholer&slreturn=20161010102921) to [merge](http://www.wsj.com/articles/law-firms-arnold-porter-kaye-scholer-set-to-combine-1478790002) and become Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer, effective January 1, 2017.

The merger talks recently moved to a higher level, as reported yesterday by the [New York Law Journal](http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/home/id=1202772025137/Kaye-Scholer-Arnold--Porter-Merger-Talks-Heat-Up?mcode=1202617075062&curindex=0&slreturn=20161010092956) and [Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/kaye-scholer-and-arnold-porter-talks-heat-up/), but they are not new. The firms have been exploring possibilities for about a year, according to [Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/06/14/ap-kaye-scholer-keep-mum-after-report-declares-merger-d-o-a-2/). Back in May, one of our own sources at A&P shared this information with us:

[W]e have been looking for a merger partner for two years and Kaye Scholer, as well as Proskauer, were both targets at some point. This year we have ramped up our efforts to merge with a firm that has a strong corporate practice, but have not been successful. The possibility of a merger with KS has caused a great deal of controversy with the New York partners especially, who do not think that KS is at the same level as A&P.

Is that fair? Here our how the firms compare on various metrics:

Longevity: A&P was founded in [1946](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_%26_Porter), and KS was founded in [1917](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaye_Scholer).

Prestige: A&P is [#25](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/arnold-porter-llp/company-overview.aspx) on the Vault 100, while KS is [#70](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/kaye-scholer-llp/company-overview.aspx).

Size: A&P has around 665 lawyers, while KS has about 370.

So one can see where the A&P partners are coming from. Kaye Scholer might be older, but Arnold & Porter is more prestigious and larger. Some might say it also has a more storied history. Arnold & Porter was founded by Thurman Arnold, a former D.C. Circuit judge and Yale Law School professor, and Abe Fortas, who went on to become a Supreme Court justice (although he ultimately left SCOTUS amid controversy and disgrace). The other name partner, Paul Porter, was a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. So one can see the DNA for A&P’s strong litigation and regulatory practices in these three résumés.

More from our Arnold & Porter source:

The managing partner and chairman have spent time attempting to calm NY partners by giving non-answers to their questions. They are attempting to assure the partners that they are still in the early stages, but it is definitely true that each firm has shown the other financials.

Ah yes, financials. History is nice, but money makes the Biglaw world go round. Here’s how the firms stack up, per the [NYLJ](http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/home/id=1202772025137/Kaye-Scholer-Arnold--Porter-Merger-Talks-Heat-Up?mcode=1202617075062&curindex=0&slreturn=20161010092956):

Both firms emerged from 2015 in weakened financial positions compared with previous years.

Arnold & Porter, a 665-lawyer firm and a traditional litigation and regulatory powerhouse inside-the-Beltway, [declined in both revenue and profits per partner last year](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202752252250/The-Am-Law-100-Profits-Revenue-Slip-at-Kaye-Scholer). Gross revenue fell by 6.4 percent, to $650 million, while profits per partner fell 12.6 percent, to $1.21 million.

Kaye Scholer reported a 1.3 percent drop in gross revenue in 2015, to $370 million. Profits per partner dipped 2.1 percent, to $1.38 million, while revenue per lawyer declined 2 percent, to $1 million, [according to our previous reports](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=1202749981082/The-Am-Law-100-the-Early-Numbers-Arnold-amp-Porters-Revenue-Shrinks-by-45M).

So on paper they look like a decent match. A&P’s revenue per lawyer and profits per partner are a little lower than KS’s, but they are in the same ballpark financially.

The merger also has definite [geographic appeal](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202772026479/Arnold--Porter-Kaye-Scholer-Agree-to-Merge?et=editorial&bu=The%20American%20Lawyer&cn=20161110&src=EMC-Email&pt=Am%20Law%20Daily%20Breaking%20News):

A combination between Kaye Scholer and Arnold & Porter could create a deep bench of lawyers in both Washington, D.C.—Arnold & Porter’s largest office—and New York, the headquarters of Kaye Scholer.

In contrast to each other, Kaye Scholer now only has 22 lawyers in Washington, D.C., while Arnold & Porter has fewer than 100 in New York. Through a merger, each would gain hundreds more in the two competitive legal markets.

As the legal landscape evolves, we will probably see more mergers along these lines, as firms of moderate size and revenue join forces to compete with the biggest Biglaw players. Some firms merge out of necessity, simply [in order to survive](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/troubled-biglaw-firm-searches-for-hero-to-rescue-it-via-merger/?rf=1), but other firms merge in order to thrive.

Of course, the line between surviving and thriving will get thinner as time goes on. The firms that don’t figure out how to thrive, in an increasingly global and technologically advanced legal marketplace, simply won’t survive. It’s getting harder and harder to just trundle along as a medium-sized firm based largely out of a single city.

Best of luck to Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer. The moniker is a mouthful, but hopefully a big name will spell big success.

UPDATE (11:20 a.m.): More about the combined entity, from the [press release](http://www.kayescholer.com/in-the-market/news/firm_news/2016-11-10-synergy-arnold-porter-and-kaye-scholer-announce-combination):

Arnold & Porter LLP and Kaye Scholer LLP today announced the two firms have agreed to combine effective January 1, 2017 to become Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP. This strategic combination brings together renowned regulatory expertise, sophisticated litigation and transactional practitioners and leading multidisciplinary practices in the life sciences and financial services industries.

Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP will have approximately 1,000 lawyers across nine domestic and four international offices. In its largest offices, the firm will have approximately 400 lawyers in Washington, DC, 325 lawyers in New York, 175 lawyers in three California offices and 60 lawyers in London. The combination also gives clients access to lawyers in domestic offices in Chicago, Denver, Houston and West Palm Beach; and international offices in Brussels, Frankfurt and Shanghai.

Sizable headcount and a solid geographic footprint. We’ll be interested in seeing how Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer evolves and expands in the years ahead.

UPDATE (12:02 p.m.): Some constituencies at both firms are nervous about the merger:

- Associates in the New York office of A&P are thinking that “a combo of us moving to the KS offices and their larger size in NY will basically result in us becoming KS here, while the rest of the firm will not be impacted much.”
- Support staff are generally nervous and uncertain about their futures; mergers often bring cuts to administrative personnel to reduce duplication.
- There are rumors of some Kaye Scholer partners either leaving the firm or being demoted to counsel.
UPDATE (12:41 p.m.): A Kaye Scholer source tells us that the firm announced the merger on its website before officially telling associates, which didn’t go over well with some.

UPDATE (2:43 p.m.): An Arnold & Porter source explains the problem with the timing of the announcement:

While it’s true that the firms announced the merger on their websites before they officially told associates, that wasn’t the firms’ plan. They had called an associates meeting for 1 p.m. ET, with plans to publicly announce thereafter. But then the WSJ published its [story on the merger](http://www.wsj.com/articles/law-firms-arnold-porter-kaye-scholer-set-to-combine-1478790002) (after the associates meeting was announced but before it had occurred). At that point, the firms really had no choice but to issue their press releases. I haven’t encountered any associates here who feel slighted by the timing.

Note, by the way, the statement in the Wall Street Journal piece that “no significant layoffs or changes to the partnership structure are expected.” (But I’d wait and see on that; sometimes firms wait a few months for the dust to settle before making changes.)

# Top 25 Am Law Firm Hands Out Up To Six-Figure Bonuses For Associates -- But People Are Still Mad
## It's a happy day for *some* associates at this firm.

Another day, another bonus match. That’s what the next few weeks are going to look like in the world of large law firms in the United States. There’s just one question to be asked: Will firms match the original [Baker McKenzie bonus scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/), without special bonuses, or the [Cravath bonus scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/cravath-bonuses/), which includes special bonuses?

Paul Hastings just announced its year-end bonuses, and of course the firm is including special bonuses. No firm as highly ranked and regarded would want to offer associates below-market compensation. Here’s what the PH bonus scale looks like for 2020:

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Be mindful, however, of the firm’s note that the special bonuses are only for “qualifying associates.” How does one become a qualifying associate? It sounds like this may be hours based, because the bonus will be paid “subject to the firm’s qualifying criteria for time worked and closed for the period from February 1 through August 31, 2020, inclusive of approved special non-billable COVID-related time.” Sources from the firm seem quite upset about this hours requirement:

Vague wording but it looks like Paul Hastings won’t be paying the special bonus to those who were below track hours for the listed period but are on track to hit or exceed our yearly requirement. Unfortunate.

Paul Hastings bonus memo just received. Special bonus appears to only be given to associates who were on track to hit 2,000 hours between February 1st and August 31st–basically the time period at the height of COVID and will not be given to any associate who makes their hours by year-end, like a typical bonus.

Associates are PISSED. The special bonus is based on whether people were billing on track when COVID hit.

But even those that have worked incredibly hard in recent months to make up those hours to hit the year-end requirement, will still not receive the special bonus. Clearly PH is not actually matching the market, because this is not what other firms are requiring and hardly any associates will be able to receive it.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The pandemic ended in August? Somehow these hours requirements exclude everyone I have spoken to since their busiest months aren’t counted.

Saying that people are mad is an understatement. I have spoken to a dozen associates and no one will qualify for the special bonus. It is like they deliberately choose random dates (February to August) to ensure the least amount of associates qualified. Why those dates? Did Covid end in August? Did it start in February? Nope. Just Paul Hastings being the cheap firm we have known it to be. They are a “top firm” only in name, but definitely not in compensation. They do not even want to maintain the facade that they pay market anymore.

Note that the apparent standard for special bonus is whether you were given enough work to be meeting annualized pace at the height of the pandemic – not whether you met the overall annual expectations. I suspect many who will hit their annual targets will be denied the special bonus through zero fault of their own. Really disappointing that the firm is looking to pay as few people as possible, even those who did all that was asked of them this year and had slow spring/summer through no fault of their own.

Yikes. Some associates at Paul Hastings seem pretty pissed off about this…

Special bonuses will be paid on December 18, 2020, while year-end bonuses will be paid on March 5, 2021 for U.S. associates. Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

# A New Way To Avoid Associate Burnout: Offer Credit Hours For Non-Billable Work
## Something like this could actually work and help lighten the load for associates.

Firms should consider the additional approach of enhancing associate opportunities to participate in meaningful non-billable work and to have such work credited in the same way that billable work is credited. Such opportunities could include traditional pro bono work, as well as engagement in diversity and student pipeline initiatives and nonprofit board service.

— [Roger Juan Maldonado](https://www.sgrlaw.com/attorneys/maldonado-roger/), president of the New York City Bar Association and a partner at Smith, Gambrell & Russell, offering a suggestion on [how Biglaw firms can combat associate burnout](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2019/09/04/firms-should-credit-associates-for-meaningful-non-billable-work/), in addition to increases in paid leave time and partner transparency.

Shauna Clark

Come January 1, an Am Law 200 firm will actually have a woman of color at its helm. While it’s true that women generally, and women of color specifically, make gains in the legal profession[ at a “glacial pace,”](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/women-make-legal-profession-gains-at-glacial-pace-survey-says) according to a report by the National Association of Women Lawyers, there is some good news. Yesterday, Norton Rose Fulbright announced that partner Shauna Clark will take the position of Global and U.S. Chair, starting in the new year.

In the firm’s statements about the appointment, there’s a recognition of the historic nature of Clark taking over the role. It’s the first time a woman of color has held either the Global or U.S. Chair role and she’ll be the only woman of color to chair an Am Law 200 firm, as Gerry Pecht, Norton Rose Fulbright’s Global Chief Executive, said:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“Shauna will expand client relationships with her collaborative nature and bring our firm closer together with her unifying vision. Shauna is the first woman of color to hold either of these important positions at our firm as well as the only woman of color to be Chair of an ‘Am Law 200’ firm. Our people and clients will benefit from both her legal prowess and excellent judgment in the courtroom and the boardroom, as well as her invaluable perspective on diversity and inclusion issues.”

Clark received her JD from Tulane Law School and got her BA in political science from Louisiana State University. She is currently U.S. Head of the firm’s Employment and Labor practice and serves on the Global Executive Committee and US Management Committee. Clark, who has been at this firm since 1994, is also a member of the firm’s U.S. Diversity and Inclusion Committee and US Racial Equality Council, and says “making a positive change” will be a priority for her tenure in the positions:

“My immediate focus is to connect with our clients and grow these relationships through our world-class talent and superior service. I also will work with colleagues and clients to advance racial equality, diversity and inclusion throughout our firm and the legal profession. Following this year’s traumatic events across the US and in other parts of the world, making a positive change stands as even more of a priority, both at Norton Rose Fulbright and throughout our communities.”

And Jeff Cody, the firm’s U.S. Managing Partner, expressed his support of Clark:

“Shauna is a gifted leader, a dynamic communicator and trusted advisor.  As our new Global and US Chair, Shauna will bring her passion for the firm and her legal practice to client relationships across the US and around the globe. We have many exciting plans for Norton Rose Fulbright, and we are delighted to have Shauna in these roles.”

The Global Chair is a one-year role, which rotates across regions and the U.S. Chair position has a four-year term.

Congratulations to Clark!

Most people will read a headline like this and assume it’s a knock on the firm. With all the complaints about “black box” firms that treat their associates — and increasingly their partners — as cannon fodder undeserving of even the most basic transparency, it’s understandable that rebranding the whole firm without the input of all but a select handful of partners would be the subject of scorn. But this is actually the rare case where firms probably should be more of a dictatorship.

There’s a lot of good that can come from decision-making by democracy, but aesthetic choices are rarely included in that. Far too often, involving hundreds of stakeholders in designing a logo only results in gridlock and second-guessing. It’s how you end up turning a firm into [a mid-grade shoe store](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/biglaw-firm-rebrands-and-the-new-logo-is-lets-just-say-unconventional/) of compromise.

That’s not to say that single decision-makers or small committees are universally good. They can ruin a branding as easily as anyone. But by narrowing the decision to a small group, the risk of going off the rails is exponentially reduced.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Goldberg Segalla, a firm on the rise that’s climbed up into the Am Law 200 in recent years, prides itself on its “committee of all” approach. Which is why it’s noteworthy that managing partner Richard Cohen [decided to keep the partnership largely in the dark](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/06/20/why-this-am-law-firm-kept-partners-in-the-dark-on-a-branding-overhaul/) about its new look:

“It’s human nature, particularly with lawyers, to have an array of differing opinions with respect to almost anything,” Cohen said. “We recognized that when we did unveil the concept to our ownership community that it was extremely unlikely that all of us would have the exact same vision. We were prepared for a wide array of reactions.”

Cohen said they were pleased, but not surprised, that the rebrand thus far has gotten a positive response.

Ultimately, a three-partner committee worked with internal branding folks and outside consultants — you know, people actually trained in how to do this as opposed to Bob from Tax — to come up with a new logo, color palette, and website. It didn’t shorten its name like most firms do these days, which is a shame because “Goldberg” has that vintage late-90s wrestling feel.

What do you think of Goldberg Segalla's new logo?

- Love It.
- Hate It.
- Is this the logo for that shadowy business conglomerate that's the bad guys from, like, Blade Runner or something?

# Standard Of Review: 'All The Beautiful People We Once Knew' Skewers Life In Biglaw
## This is a unique, funny, and challenging novel about life in Biglaw.

A couple of weeks ago, I complained about the rampant problem of legal novels with boring, generic titles. Not so with the recent All the Beautiful People We Once Knew, the debut novel from shipping attorney Edward Carlson. A poetic title that does not even signify a legal novel? Now that is my kind of title! As for the book itself, [All the Beautiful People We Once Knew](http://amzn.to/2vSrvnp) is a unique, funny, and challenging novel about life in Biglaw.

The novel centers around Stephen Harker, a senior associate at Klingore LLP, a large law firm in New York. Despite being talented and well-regarded as an attorney, Stephen is at a make-or-break point in his career. He will be up for partnership soon and the partners do not believe that he is sufficiently motivated, as his billable hours are routinely lower than the other litigation associates at the firm. However, Stephen has a champion in Robert Fleeger, a brash, foul-mouthed litigation partner. Fleeger is a boorish human being, bragging about his sexual exploits and harassing everyone in sight, including one of the firm’s clients. Stephen and Fleeger frequently represent WorldScore, an insurance behemoth. WorldScore is litigating with Bud Thomas, a veteran and former soldier for a private defense contractor who is suing to receive damages for PTSD allegedly suffered in Afghanistan. Stephen struggles to make Fleeger and the client happy in his handling of the case, and he resorts to sleeping with Fleeger’s separated wife.

Carlson does an excellent job satirizing the world of Biglaw. Stephen is only semi-motivated at work, and he hates the focus on the billable hour. In one memorable paragraph in the beginning of the novel, Stephen imagines filling out his timesheets by describing various work centered around the frequent vulgarities uttered by Fleeger. Stephen also refuses to suck up to Celeste, the WorldScore client representative, despite her frequent flirtation with him.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Stephen is also stuck in his own head, a problem afflicting many litigators. In one scene, Fleeger bails on a court appearance at the last minute, and Stephen has to step in and argue a motion. Although Stephen is successful, he is incensed at Fleeger for what he perceives as unprofessional behavior. But Fleeger correctly points out that Stephen never would have excelled in court if he had time to ruminate about the motion in his head.

Edward J. Carlson (via author website)

Carlson takes aim at worker’s compensation litigation. The novel clearly views Thomas as damaged and deserving of compensation. But Stephen and Fleeger’s job is to deny him the ability to sue in tort for injuries suffered while working for a private defense contractor, as they argue that Thomas is legally required to file a worker’s compensation claim with the Department of Labor. Stephen, although ethically obligated to defend WorldScore to prevent it from paying Thomas, is clearly uneasy with the fact that the law seems to be stacked against Thomas and in favor of mega-companies like WorldScore.

Fleeger is the type of attorney who would probably have been fired or the subject of a lawsuit in many other professions, but as a lawyer, he succeeds because his brash nature is an asset (and he is the go-to attorney for a major firm client). Even though Fleeger’s behavior seems almost too ridiculous to be true at times, I have definitely known of many attorneys who frequently act inappropriately, but nothing happens to them due to their ability to bring in business.

Stephen and Fleeger frequently attend debaucherous parties thrown by the firm and attended by the firm’s clients. Carlson is clearly going for a Tom Wolfe vibe here, portraying the excess of the top one percent. But while lawyers certainly drink a lot, I do not think that such debauchery at official firm events is as common as portrayed in the novel. This is especially true post-2008. I was in law school during the financial crash, and when I started working as an attorney, I repeatedly heard from others that firm parties were much less debaucherous than they used to be (once attorneys started worrying about losing their jobs).

Readers should also be aware that this is not a typical legal novel. Carlson is an excellent writer, but his creative prose – complete with funny asides and non-sequiturs – is definitely challenging and might frustrate readers who expect the plot to move quickly. And the portions of the novel in which Stephen deals with Fleeger’s ex-wife are much less interesting than those portions regarding Stephen’s life at his firm. I found myself skimming any scene that did not have to do with law. But there is enough satire of Biglaw in All the Beautiful People We Once Knew to make the novel worthwhile. And at the very least, you can judge this book by its title.

(Disclosure:  I received a review copy of this book.)

# A Hashtag Leads To Marketing #Success

We can all point to moments in our professional lives that changed the course of our careers — crushing a stretch assignment, really connecting with a mentor, seizing a new job opportunity.

Those moments don’t happen all at once. And sometimes we only appreciate their origins with the benefit of hindsight.

In our experience, business development and marketing successes often start out small, whether you’re networking with potential new clients, establishing yourself as a thought leader, or building your brand on social media.

Co-hosting [PLI’s inSecurities podcast](http://bit.ly/34jQ2Bo), which focuses on developments in the securities regulatory, enforcement and accounting space, has been one of the coolest and most rewarding opportunities of our careers. And like so many great opportunities, it started small — with a hashtag.

Long before we hit “record” on the first episode of inSecurities, we connected through a hashtag at a securities enforcement conference. Attending the conference for our “day jobs” as forensic accountant (Chris) and securities regulatory attorney (Kurt), we were among a handful of people “live-tweeting” the event.

After we connected “IRL” at the conference networking happy hour, our bosses were impressed (and surprised!) that we managed to make meaningful professional connections over this “social media thing.”

We’d each found a kindred spirit in the securities enforcement and regulatory space, and we spent the next several years trading well-meaning barbs over lunches on K Street and in posts on LinkedIn and Twitter. We referred one another business from time to time, but we were mostly in it for the banter.

Along the way, we began to carve out space as thought leaders in our practice areas and on social media, and when PLI approached us with the opportunity to develop a podcast, we jumped at the chance. We saw the podcast as an opportunity to explore our love of content creation and marketing, to build our profiles in the regulatory and enforcement space, and to offer substantive — and fun — commentary for industry leaders.

Over the past 18 months, we’ve recorded pilot episodes, built a network of guests, and planned, recorded, edited, and produced more than two dozen episodes of the inSecurities podcast. It’s been quite a journey, and we’re incredibly grateful for the opportunity and the help we’ve received along the way.

We want to pay it forward by sharing some of the lessons we’ve learned, and some of the great advice we received from [Deborah Farone](https://deborahfarone.com/) and [Stefanie Marrone](https://www.socialmediabutterflyblog.com/) on Episode 11 (“[Business Development for Lawyers & Law Firms: A Conversation About Marketing, Selling and Social Media in Today’s Legal Environment](http://bit.ly/37s6GRD)”). Our top takeaways:

- Don’t go it alone – We never would have been able to finish 25+ episodes on our own — or had as much fun doing it. Along with our incredible partners at PLI who help shoulder the heavy burden of content creation, idea generation and promotion, and the enthusiastic, insightful guests we interview, we’re able to achieve results well beyond what we could have done alone.
- Be flexible – Our conception of the podcast has changed (more than once!) over time. Between the complex issues we tackle on the show and challenges arising from COVID-19, we’ve had to be flexible and strike out in new directions. We’ve also responded to the market — we’re sometimes surprised by the episodes that get the most downloads, so we take the feedback and adapt.
- Know when to skate, and when to glide – We have busy day jobs and competing demands for our time. There are times to push hard and churn out a few episodes quickly, and other times to focus our energy elsewhere. We’ve felt the tension of balancing deadlines in client matters with other professional commitments, our personal lives . . . and a podcast! Learning to navigate peaks and valleys has helped us to continue producing quality episodes at a steady pace (and to enjoy it!).
- Don’t be afraid to brag – As with our live-tweeting at the conference, we experienced mixed reactions to exploring this new media. But we took time to sit down with our colleagues, share the metrics, and discuss the meaningful connections created by our podcast efforts — to brag a little. Now, our firms fully support us, and recognize the potential business development and marketing opportunities that come with the podcast.

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

According to Leopard Solutions’ new white paper, Building a Lasting Legacy: Empowering Organizations Through Strategic Succession Planning, on average, how many days does it take to get promoted to partner for an entry-level hire at a Top 200 law firm in the US?

Hint: Back in 2012, it was only 1,353 days (3.7 years) and it has gotten much longer since then.

See the answer on the next page.

# Another Global Firm Matches
## Peer pressure mounts!

The pressure continues to step up on the Magic Circle firms doddering behind the salary frenzy. [Freshfields](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/magic-circle-firm-matches-cravath-scale/) and [Clifford Chance](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/international-firm-brings-its-u-s-associates-up-to-the-new-market/) have already taken the plunge, but Allen & Overy and Linklaters are still whistling and looking at the sky hoping no one notices that their peers have raised the stakes.

Well, it’ll be hard to ignore this: a [Silver Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Circle_(law_firms)) firm has now matched the market. Ashurst, a global behemoth with 27 offices in 16 countries, announced a raise matching the Cravath scale through ’08/$315K. The move portends a continued push to gain ground in the U.S., where Ashurst maintains a small office in New York and a tiny office in Washington (indeed, it’s not entirely clear that the firm even has associates based in its Washington office).

It’s a happy day for Ashurst, and no doubt another day of grumbling for the lagging Magic Circle associates. Perhaps, like in the world of Harry Potter, things are just a bit less magical in America.

# Top 10 Biglaw Firm Announces 4-Day In-Office Attendance Mandate

About two years ago, Above the Law praised Ropes & Gray for officially [putting an end to the five-day, in-office workweek](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/ropes-grays-reopening-plan-puts-an-end-to-the-5-day-in-office-workweek-for-associates/) for associates. Now, the firm is mandating that associates spend four days in the office each week, making it the latest elite firm to foist this unenviable requirement upon its attorneys.

According to a firmwide memo sent by chair Julie Jones and managing partner David Djaha, starting on November 6, the top 10 Am Law firm will ask that all associates come into the office on Monday through Thursday each week. Here’s an excerpt from the memo (available on the next page):

We are making this change because success in this highly competitive marketplace requires us to invest in what makes Ropes & Gray extraordinary—our culture, teamwork in furtherance of excellence for clients and our steadfast commitment to developing the best lawyers in the world. These strengths, which define and differentiate us, can only be realized to their fullest extent through in-person collaboration, learning and mentoring. Simply put, we need more people together, more often, more consistently.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Ropes is now the fourth major firm to require that attorneys spend four days working from the office each week. [Skadden](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/you-didnt-see-your-kids-before-the-pandemic-you-shouldnt-expect-to-see-them-now-says-elite-law-firm-partner/) came first, followed by [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/davis-polk-4-day-office/), and [Weil Gotshal](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/weil-gotshal-4-days-in-office/). We can’t imagine associates at the firm are happy about this. As [previously noted](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/biglaw-associates-are-not-happy-with-this-4-day-office-mandate/) by [Kate Reder Sheikh](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/kate-reder-sheikh?byconsultantorauthor=kate-reder-sheikh), a partner in the associate practice group of legal recruiting firm Major, Lindsey & Africa, associates have had a “very strong, negative reaction” to the four-day, in-office work mandate. On the bright side, the office attendance requirement at Ropes doesn’t begin until November; Skadden, Davis Polk, and Weil will begin requiring associates to work four days in the office come September.

Thankfully, Ropes recognizes that associates’ lives — ranging from health care appointments to child-related issues — still exist outside of the office, and is allowing for some flexibility within its new office attendance mandate. “We respect your judgment as professionals on work location when these situations arise. As a guideline, our experience suggests that these occasional circumstances have tended to arise in a range of 10-20 days per year. When these events come up, please let your teams know,” Jones and Djaha state in the memo.

The firm is still offering several weeks’ worth of optional remote time for associates, including the week of Thanksgiving, and the week between Christmas Day and New Year’s Day. Perhaps as a mea culpa of sorts for its new attendance policy, Ropes has also decided to include the last two weeks of August as part of its bank of remote weeks.

In closing the memo, Jones and Djaha write, “While we know our new in-office schedule will be an adjustment for some, we are confident this step is needed to ensure our firm’s long-term success.”

# Biglaw Associate Shot, Firm Is Offering A Reward To Find The Gunman
## The firm knows just how unusual it is to find itself in the position of offering a reward in a shooting case.

Spencer A. Hill

A first-year litigation associate at the Biglaw firm of Ballard Spahr, [Spencer A. Hill](https://www.ballardspahr.com/people/attorneys/hill-spencer.aspx), 37, was shot on Monday on his way home from the firm’s Philadelphia office in what authorities are saying was a botched robbery attempt. He is expected to make a full recovery.

[According to](https://www.philly.com/news/ballard-spahr-lawyer-spencer-hill-shot-west-philadelphia-reward-offered-20190307.html) the Philadelphia Inquirer, while walking Hill heard someone approaching him from behind, and when he stopped there was a man in a dark hood and blue jeans who shot him just below the chest. Wounded, he was able to make it to his nearby home, and his wife called emergency services. Hill was taken to Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, where surgeons located the bullet, but decided not to remove it. Had the bullet hit Hill an inch or so lower, he might not have been as fortunate:

“I realize just how close it could have been,” [Hill] said. “It hurts to be walking around, but it feels good.”

Ballard Chair [Mark Stewart](https://www.ballardspahr.com/people/attorneys/stewart_mark.aspx) said another attorney at the firm was a victim of violence in October, so born out of a sense of frustration, the firm is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrator in Hill’s case. According to Stewart, “So, we asked, ‘What can we do?’”

Stewart [also noted](https://www.law.com/2019/03/07/ballard-spahr-offering-10000-for-information-related-to-shooting-of-associate/) to Law.com how unusual it is for a Biglaw firm to find itself in the position of offering a reward in a shooting case:

“Among all the things I thought I’d be doing a chair as a firm, the idea of announcing an award for information on the shooting of an associate is not what I had in mind,” he said. “Neither the firm or I are experts in this and I never hope to be.”

Hill dedicates time to pro bono work to advance prisoner rights and criminal justice reform. Given Hill’s dedication to these causes, Stewart said it makes it particularly hard that he was a victim of violence:

“It’s unthinkable that a guy like Spencer who has devoted his life to helping other people” could be the victim of a shooting, Stewart said.

Those with information on the shooting are asked to call 215-686-TIPS.

# A Modest Raise... And The Associates Are Happy?

Above the Law’s coverage of associate salary increases can lead people to wonder how anyone can possibly work for less than the $190K scale. Even though we’ve tried to push back in these pages and explain that some firms (and especially some markets) simply can’t compete with the most elite firms and that’s just fine. We want associates to get all the compensation they deserve and we have an acute understanding of how law school debt puts young lawyers behind the 8-ball, but keeping pace has side effects.

Steptoe & Johnson LLP has announced raises for the first and second years in its Washington, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Chicago offices, matching the prevailing Milbank scale at those levels (and, we hear, giving an $8K raise in Phoenix). It’s not matching, at this point anyway, the scale as adjusted by Cravath — with higher salaries for more senior associates. In fact, the firm didn’t take a stand on raises for more senior associates, merely leaving open the possibility that they may see raises through the end-of-year individualized tier and salary decisions.

But tipsters from Steptoe seem… generally happy.

Mid-levels and senior associates will probably receive increased headhunter activity but most of us love working here and know that we trade being a compensation leader for flexible hours, reasonable partners, and a low leverage ratio.

That’s what gets obscured in the mad dash of salary news. With great compensation comes great billable responsibility, and firms that pay the maximum expect the maximum out of their lawyers. And firms that reach to join the elite tier may find themselves expecting more than the maximum out of their lawyers. While there are firms that expect associates to work all hours of the day and night and still take home less, when a firm is willing to embrace some flexibility — it’s still hard work, mind you — for slightly less pay, that’s perfectly fine. When I made my own lateral move years ago, I knew I was trading about $10K/year for the privilege of routinely leaving the office between 7 and 9 instead of between 12 and 2. Not only is that acceptable, the market actually needs firms like that or talented lawyers will slip out of the profession because they just can’t handle round the clock availability.

Congratulations to Steptoe & Johnson on navigating the difficult waters of balancing salary and workload.

# Biglaw Firm Defends Firing Of Widower, Noting 'Sadness And Grief Are Not Disabilities'
## The former partner alleges a 'toxic' environment.

A former partner in the London office of White & Case,[ Michael Wistow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-wistow-55752339/?originalSubdomain=uk), has accused his former firm of being a “toxic environment,” saying he was fired from the firm when he suffered mental health issues following his wife’s death from cancer. The former co-head of the EMEA tax practice sued the firm in a London employment tribunal alleging disability discrimination, saying his anxiety and depression following the death of his wife was a mental impairment.

As [reported by](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-19/-toxic-london-law-firm-accused-of-forcing-out-grieving-lawyer) Bloomberg, Wistow alleges in lieu of support for his bereavement, he dealt with a problematic atmosphere:

Wistow said that the symptoms of his poor mental health led to “a substantial adverse effect on my ability to carry out day to day activities,” but instead of being offered support during this time, he endured a “toxic environment,” according to a statement prepared for a hearing this week.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
He also compared the culture at White & Case to other Biglaw firms and finds that firm lacking:

Wistow said in his disability impact statement prepared for the tribunal that the culture was “toxic like nothing I had experienced at the other major City law firms I had worked at before.”  Wistow had previously spent 20 years at Clifford Chance LLP.

Among his claims, Wistow said he was accused of “lacking commitment” when he took a day off to spend time with his sick wife on her birthday, and senior management or HR did not follow up after he told them he was struggling. He also alleged he was “badgered” by the firm’s in-house legal team to leave after returning from bereavement leave.

The firm denies the allegations and says that rather than a discriminatory motivation, Wistow was let go for poor performance and that he was working on a new legal business venture while he was out.

But it’s really what the firm wrote in legal filings in the case that is catching attention:

The law firm “do not doubt the genuineness of his feelings of sadness and grief as a result of this,” Jonathan Cohen, a lawyer for White & Case, said in documents prepared for the hearing. “However, as well-known authority explains, sadness and grief are not disabilities as defined in the Equality Act.”

The firm has also noted they conducted an investigation by external counsel and determined there was no wrongdoing.

Listen, I don’t know nearly enough about any of this (or about British employment law) to opine on the merits of the allegations. But going with grief is not a protected class? Purely as a public relations matter, that’s terrible. While this may be legally accurate, it does pretty much nothing to dispel the perception that White & Case is a “toxic” work environment.

# In Shaky Economy, Polsinelli & UnitedLex Team Up To Help Companies Monetize Existing Assets
## Seeking out new revenue streams is the name of the game.

You know that great idea you had that just ended up languishing half-finished in your basement? The one that probably would be worth something if you just took the time out of your already busy schedule to get it done and show it off to the world?

Well, statistically speaking, your idea is probably worthless. But there are big companies out there with some actual expertise who live out the exact same scenario on a higher level. For these companies, it’s all about intellectual property amassed over the years that they never really leveraged or that they used for their own very limited purposes without considering how others could deploy it for their own applications. But with the economy mired in the rough, it might be time to take stock of what’s down in the proverbial basement and see if it has any value.

But that’s easier said than done for these companies, which is where a new joint venture between Polsinelli and UnitedLex comes in. The idea is to take the IP experience of an established law firm and partner it with the technological advantages of a legal services company, with the result being a new approach to IP investment, management, and, where necessary, enforcement capable of bringing new revenue streams to businesses with under-leveraged intellectual property.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
From a press release announcing the venture:

Providing a synergistic approach to patent drafting and prosecution, the partnership of Polsinelli and UnitedLex provides many business-level advantages, including: the ability to handle large patent prosecution projects; a coordinated process that ensures issuance and the strongest possible patent coverage; strategic advice regarding patent filings, including identifying the most impactful markets to pursue; and, the development of a large patent portfolio without a need for extensive in-house resources.

Polsinelli Intellectual Property Department Chair Patrick C. Woolley explained that companies should reconfigure how they think about intellectual property. “IP should be considered a ‘real’ asset with many advantages compared to traditional real assets. Our goal is to enable companies to protect and develop new assets while establishing a new way of leveraging valuable IP assets for years to come.”

Like many of the tech advancements hitting the legal industry these days, it’s unfortunate that it takes a global pandemic to spur changes, but if this leads to a revolution in how companies understand their own assets it should return dividends for years to come.

Would you give up your Biglaw life of luxury to escape the glass ceiling at your firm?

Imagine, if you will, the following scenario: You’re a fairly successful associate at a large law firm where you’ve worked for almost a decade. Your annual salary is nearly $400,000, a “very nice salary” by any means. You survived the Great Recession, and you even survived a law firm merger. You think you must surely be under consideration for partnership, but unfortunately, there’s just one problem.

You’re a woman.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
During your time at the firm, you’ve witnessed “blatant gender discrimination, sexual harassment, and a very clear glass ceiling,” and you’re not so sure anymore that this is a lifestyle you want to continue leading. You want to have another child, but you know from experience that “having a baby apparently makes you worth less as a lawyer.”

What do you do?

If you’re completely dissatisfied with your job, you could do exactly what [Kristen Jarvis Johnson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristenmj), a nine-year veteran of Squire Patton Boggs, did — you could quit.

The aftermath of Johnson turning in her resignation, however, caused a media firestorm after she engaged in a 10-hour [Ask Me Anything session on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4gi04u/iama_burned_out_international_lawyer_just/). Her story resonated deeply with fellow attorneys. Here’s a brief snippet of what she had to say on the site:

[F]or the past 9 years I have been a Partner-track associate at a Biglaw firm. They sent me to Doha, [Qatar,] for the past 2.5 years. While there, I worked on some amazing projects and was in the most elite of practice groups. … I became disgusted by luxury lifestyle and lawyers who would give anything and everything to make millions. I encountered blatant gender discrimination, sexual harassment, and a very clear glass ceiling. Having a baby apparently makes you worth less as a lawyer. … As a lawyer, I was working sometimes 300 hours in a month and missing my kids all the time. I felt guilty for spending any time not firm related. I never had a vacation where I did not work. I missed my dear grandmother’s funeral in December. In March I made the final decision that this could not last. There must be a better way. So I resigned.

After working for the firm for almost a decade, Johnson began to experience issues with gender bias. In an interview with the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/she-ditched-her-400000-a-year-legal-job-after-her-womans-card-only-held-her-back/2016/04/28/a3fb7d4a-0d3a-11e6-a6b6-2e6de3695b0e_story.html), she said a female leader at her firm told her about numerous instances where her ideas and proposals were stolen from her, with male leaders taking credit for them. She’d even heard stories of male partners saying “the partnership isn’t a place for working moms.” But what was the straw that broke the camel’s back and made Johnson decide that she needed to resign?

Here’s a small portion from Johnson’s op-ed piece published in [Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/perspective-why-i-quit-big-law-for-a-toy-company/):


Kristin Jarvis Johnson (Photo via LinkedIn)

For my career, I thought I could move past a senior partner trying to grab my leg or asking for a hotel rendezvous during lunch.

Then I hit my breaking point. The working environment spiraled downward after the firm merger. I saw women in leadership positions leave en masse within the first few months of the merger. My workload was constant and unrelenting. I had my second child, and balanced my maternity leave with my continuing work obligations.

Then I was turned down for a bonus for the first time while on maternity leave. I came back to work and hit the ground running in March of last year. Never took a real break, even on vacation, and gave it my all. My new baby was demanding, but I juggled his (and my older son’s) demands with everything else, even taking him and our nanny overseas to continue nursing during a long hearing. My grandmother — after whom my own son is named — died right before a hearing, and her funeral was during another. I was too busy even to mourn, let alone attend the funeral.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Johnson found diversity lacking at the firm, and felt there was a huge gender imbalance. She was once again turned down for a bonus and told to work harder than she already had been — so she quit. “This is an opportunity to regain the things I value in life, continue to pursue a successful career — but on my own terms, and to stop supporting a broken and biased firm system. I decided not to fight to break a glass ceiling, only to find myself in a hostile, overly-competitive, and unhealthy environment,” Johnson wrote.

Squire Patton Boggs, of course, was “disappointed” by Johnson’s op-ed and “strongly disagree[d]” with her comments, in a statement given to [Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/squire-patton-expresses-commitment-to-women-in-response-to-op-ed/):

We are committed to a firm culture that promotes full and equal participation, advancement and retention of women. This vision is supported throughout our firm and guided by the tireless efforts of our Legal Personnel Committee and Women’s Enterprise which were long-ago established to ensure our policies and procedures consider how the sometimes immersive nature of the legal industry could negatively impact women in the profession. This is demonstrated by the many exceptional women leaders throughout our firm, including those serving on our Global Board, acting as Practice Group Leaders and Office Managing Partners, as well as our General Counsel and Global Chief Operating Officer. This commitment extends throughout our Middle East practice. Four lawyers have been promoted to partner in the Middle East since the Squire Patton Boggs merger — two men and two women. Of the women, one was on maternity leave the year she made partner and the second was on maternity leave the year before she made partner. During the period when Ms. Johnson was in Doha, there were four partners in the office, two of whom were women. Our Doha office was also founded in 2003 by a woman partner who was the first non-Qatari attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Qatar and supported Ms. Johnson’s move to the office.

Now that she’s escaped from Biglaw, Johnson wants to “focus [her] energy on doing something great that contributes to breaking down gender barriers and glass ceilings.” She started a company called Boy Story with her sister, and they’re selling life-like dolls for boys — something that’s been missing in toy aisles. If you’re interested in helping her get this idea off the ground, you can donate via her [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1632532946/boy-story-finally-cool-boy-action-dolls) page.

What can you do to combat sexism and gender bias in the legal profession? Resigning is one option, but we’re interested in hearing ideas that can be instituted throughout all firms. Please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Retention%20of%20Women%20in%20Law%20Firms) or text us (646-820-8477) with your thoughts. All law firms — and Biglaw firms, especially — should be interested in retaining their female talent, instead of driving them out. Leaving shouldn’t be the only option that’s left for women.

In the legal profession, standing out necessitates more than just sharp legal acumen; it calls for an injection of personal creativity and distinctiveness into professional endeavors.

Hobbies and personal interests offer lawyers a unique avenue to deepen industry relationships in a way that is both genuine and enjoyable.

This exploration into merging personal passions with professional networking not only humanizes attorneys but also paves the way for more meaningful connections, setting the stage for networking that enriches both professional and personal lives.

Hobbies — from painting to rock climbing — serve as a reprieve from the demands of the legal world while also acting as a bridge, connecting attorneys on a more personal level with their peers and clients.

Imagine the impact of discovering a shared enthusiasm for mountain biking with a potential client or finding common ground in culinary arts with a colleague.

A Strategy for Genuine Connections

Integrating personal interests into networking doesn’t just add a layer of authenticity to professional interactions; it also opens up new avenues for connection. Here’s how to do it right:

Find Shared Interests: Reflect on your hobbies and consider how they might resonate within your professional circle. Move beyond common clichés and find interests that truly reflect both your personality and those of your contacts.

Create Unique Networking Events: Host events centered around shared hobbies to encourage interaction and camaraderie. Think book clubs, cooking classes, or photography walks — activities that foster genuine connections.

Celebrate Together: Leverage personal and cultural celebrations as networking opportunities. I’ve found hosting events, like a vibrant Diwali celebration, not only honors my heritage but also acts as a dynamic networking event, inviting a mix of friends, clients, and potential connections.

Initiate Conversations About Hobbies: Seamlessly weave your interests into conversations. This approach can reveal shared passions, laying the groundwork for stronger professional relationships.

Focus on Hobbies in Following Up: The true magic in networking often lies in the follow-up, where personal interests can significantly warm up the conversation. Moving from a simple follow-up to an engaging discussion about a shared hobby can transform the dynamic of the interaction, making it more memorable and establishing a rapport that transcends the typical client-lawyer dynamic.

Professionalism Meets Personal Interest

Integrating hobbies into professional networking is an art that requires balancing personal sharing with professional engagement. Here’s how to strike that balance:

Selective Sharing: Gauge the conversation before delving into personal hobbies. Share just enough to pique interest without overwhelming, ensuring your hobbies complement rather than overshadow your professional narrative.

Focus on Universal Appeal: Choose aspects of your hobbies with broader interest. For instance, discussing culinary explorations can engage a wider audience than niche hobbies might.

Integrate With Professionalism: Allow your hobbies to underscore your professional qualities subtly, ensuring that personal interests enhance rather than detract from your professional persona.

Networking Redefined

Redefining networking through personal interests can lead to unforgettable experiences.

For example, inviting clients and colleagues to a Depeche Mode concert, with everyone donning ’80s and ’90s band T-shirts, would break traditional networking barriers and foster connections in an atmosphere of shared enjoyment.

Consider how your hobbies can add depth to your professional interactions. Whether through themed events or casual conversations, let your personal interests guide you to new opportunities and deeper connections.

In a profession where differentiation is paramount, let your unique hobbies act as your signature, creating lasting impressions and enriching your professional network. Your passions not only define you but also open doors to genuine, rewarding connections in the legal landscape.

It looks like[ staff layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/law-firm-layoffs-amid-covid-19/) aren’t the only way law firms are dealing with the financial ramifications of the global pandemic. U.K.-based law firm Gateley, which is a publicly traded entity, announced that they would not be giving its shareholders their interim dividend due to the economic fallout from the coronavirus.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2020/03/24/gateley-cancels-shareholder-payouts-in-hedge-against-covid-19-fallout-292-63996/) Law.com, the move is designed to maximize liquidity:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
A dividend of 2.9 pence per share was due to shareholders on March 31. However, in a protective move, the firm announced via the London Stock Exchange on Tuesday that it was now “prudent” to cancel the payout in order to “maximize the group’s short-term liquidity.”

It also said that it would “suspend financial guidance going forward until both the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic becomes clearer.”

Michael Ward, the firm’s CEO, said the firm’s financials are poised to weather the financial turbulence:

“As a board, we consider these measures to be in the best interests of all our stakeholders. Gateley is a resilient and well-balanced business and our economic and geographically diversified business model is well-placed to withstand difficult economic conditions.”

And despite the firm’s stock prices taking a COVID-19 related hit — 20+ percent of the firm’s value was depleted over a two-week period — the financials seem solid. In the firm’s statement on the suspension of dividend payments they also touted their low levels of debt and “a solid first half performance.” This past year saw Gateley’s revenue climb an impressive 19 percent, breaking the 100 million mark — revenue was £102 million — for the first time.

[](https://abovethelaw.com/top-outside-counsel-2020/)In the market for legal services, some opinions simply matter more than others. Arguably, the opinions that matter the most are those of in-house counsel. The premise of our third annual outside counsel rankings is simple and direct. We asked approximately 1,000 in-house counsel two simple questions: 1) “Which law firms does your company engage for legal services?” and 2) “Please indicate the highest level legal work for which your company will engage the particular firm(s).” The “levels” of work were defined along a four-point scale:

1. Cost-efficient, bulk tasks
2. Routine matters
3. High-value, complex matters
4. “Bet-the-company” matters

Earlier this year, those in-house lawyers — from nearly 500 companies and over 40 cities — shared with us their evaluations of their companies’ outside law firms. Check out the results here.

# The Best Brand In Biglaw Isn't Skadden Anymore
## Who's the new top dog in the world of Biglaw?

The Acritas U.S. Law Firm Brand Index measures the best brand in law with a six-factor test — top of mind awareness, favorability, consideration for top-level deals and litigation, overall usage among U.S.-based clients and inbound usage among international clients — that historically reminds us that Skadden is Coca-Cola and McDonald’s all rolled into one. But this year’s survey threw us a curveball when Skadden fell to number two on the list. Who took over?

Congratulations to Donald Trump’s pet law firm, Jones Day, which took over the top spot in the survey after spending a number of years relegated to the [runner-up slot](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/the-best-law-firms-in-america-according-to-in-house-counsel/).

Look, perhaps it’s unfair to attribute Jones Day’s reputation bump to its role as Wormtongue to Trump’s Saruman (it’s a Lord of the Rings joke… [not that Jones Day will get it](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/jones-day-does-not-have-a-sense-of-humor/)). After all, there are [two Jones Days](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/will-the-real-jones-day-please-stand-up/), and securing this brand promotion required hard work from both Jones Days — including the firm that filed an amicus brief and short-circuited the government’s Ninth Circuit’s argument last week.

On the other hand, let’s not pretend the firm wasn’t riding Trump to expand its visibility throughout 2016. One would hope that in-house counsel don’t make decisions based on CNN hits, but it’s naïve to think that doesn’t boost the “top of mind awareness” to have senior lawyers providing high-profile opinions every day on cable news.

Jones Day had traditionally scored well in three categories Acritas measures: “Top of mind awareness,” “favorability,” and “top of mind for litigation.” This year, the firm increased in two more components of the survey: “Consideration for major M&A deals” and “inbound use of the firm by international clients.”

I would say Jones Day really stepped up their M&A practice, but as they’re quick to point out, they’ve been [#1 in M&A](http://www.jonesday.com/jones-day-maintains-1-ma-ranking-for-63rd-consecutive-quarter-07-11-2016/) for roughly as long as [UConn’s remained undefeated](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/14/515155652/uconn-women-win-historic-100th-game-in-a-row), so it’s not clear what they did to earn that extra nudge this time.

Congratulations Jones Day, you’ve made yourselves great again!

[](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2021/02/Pursuing-Justice-logo_ProBono2.jpg)Over the past year, lawyers have seen firsthand the impact of the pandemic and economic downturn on their pro bono clients. For many, the increased need has strengthened their determination to do more. From large firms to smaller regional ones, and from robust nonprofit organizations to smaller community foundations, professionals have come together to share expertise and resources – and [Pursuing Justice, a podcast series from Practising Law Institute (PLI)](http://bit.ly/39Dgb1u), has been telling their stories.

Hosted by [PLI Faculty Fellow Alicia Aiken](http://bit.ly/3rcn9QI), Principal at the Danu Center for Strategic Advocacy and the Director of the Danu Center’s Confidentiality Institute, Pursuing Justice features in-depth discussions with lawyers in private practice, legal services lawyers, and others on topics of interest to the legal community.

A Biglaw Firm Goes All In

As the pandemic unfolded last spring, Aiken spoke with Paul, Weiss Chairman Brad Karp about his firm’s response. Anticipating the impact of the shutdowns on “the most vulnerable in our society,” including workers in hospitality, retail, and food service, as well as the challenges of figuring out the PPP and other relief programs, Karp emailed all of the attorneys at Paul, Weiss, asking who wanted to work on a pro bono project to help individuals and small businesses. Within two hours, he said, over 400 attorneys – around 40 percent of the firm – had signed up, offering to do whatever it took to help gather and communicate essential information.

Listen to the episode, “[Pro Bono in a Pandemic: A Law Firm Goes All In](http://bit.ly/2YB9arm)”


Building Community by Supporting Small Business

As the pandemic progressed, Aiken met with transactional lawyers and nonprofit representatives based in Detroit to learn about pro bono initiatives aimed at helping the community. With small businesses disproportionately suffering losses from the shutdown, Steve Roach, a principal at Miller Canfield, looked for ways to lend his team’s transactional expertise to local businesses. From helping the area’s first women-owned bike shop with microloans and real estate, to advising businesses on employment and corporate governance during the pandemic, Roach and his colleagues take on a variety of matters to strengthen Detroit by supporting small business.

Aiken also spoke with Shamyle Maya Dobbs, CEO of [Michigan Community Resources](https://mi-community.org/), about how the organization has been helping to connect around 400 nonprofit and community-based organizations with legal advice and resources.

Pro Bono Begins at Home: A Lawyer Helps Her Community

More recently, Aiken has also turned the tables to be interviewed herself, discussing her long career as a legal services attorney and, more personally, her efforts to boost her own pro bono practice during the pandemic. In Part Two of a conversation, Aiken talks about how she found opportunities to help individuals in her own community, advising on tricky employment issues and more.

[E]ven the most disgusting criminals should have access to counsel when they violate the law, and Exxon’s shareholders will now pay big bucks for Seyfarth’s lawyers, who are probably some of the most expensive corporate defense lawyers in the country. But I don’t think there’s any need for Seyfarth to run up their billable hours since Freedom to Work would like to settle the case today.

— [Tico Almeida](http://www.freedomtowork.org/?page_id=18), founder and president of [Freedom to Work](http://www.freedomtowork.org/), commenting on [Seyfarth Shaw’s decision](http://www.washingtonblade.com/2013/08/23/seyfarth-shaw/) to defend a case alleging anti-gay bias at Exxon Mobil — one of the few Fortune 500 companies that lacks a written nondiscrimination policy prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

(Will Seyfarth come to regret this case? Let’s discuss….)

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  

Here’s more about the matter from the [Washington Blade](http://www.washingtonblade.com/2013/08/23/seyfarth-shaw/):

Seyfarth Shaw is representing oil-and-gas giant Exxon Mobil against charges of alleged anti-gay bias in hiring practices, according to the LGBT group Freedom to Work.

Tico Almeida, president of Freedom to Work, told the Washington Blade on Thursday night the Chicago office of Seyfarth Shaw elected this month to represent Exxon Mobil in the lawsuit, which was filed by his organization and is pending before the Illinois Department of Human Rights….

Freedom to Work [filed the lawsuit against Exxon Mobil in May](http://www.washingtonblade.com/2013/05/22/exxon-mobil-faces-lawsuit-over-alleged-anti-gay-bias/) after conducting a test in which it sent two fictitious resumes for a job opening at the company in Illinois. One was from a more qualified applicant who outed herself as LGBT on her resume; the other was a less qualified applicant who gave no indications about her sexual orientation or gender identity. The less qualified non-LGBT applicant received multiple callbacks, the more qualified LGBT applicant received nothing.

Regarding his reference to settling the case, Almeida isn’t interested in monetary recovery. He’d be happy with Exxon Mobil adopting a policy prohibiting discrimination against LGBT employees:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“In fact, one settlement option would be for Exxon to copy and paste Seyfarth’s own LGBT workplace policies, which have previously earned the lawfirm a 100 percent LGBT rating from the HRC,” Almeida said. “Exxon could also copy and paste the Chevron LGBT workplace policy, and we would accept that as part of the settlement.”

Alas, gasoline going back to $3 a gallon is probably more likely to happen than Exxon adopting such a policy, at least willingly. From a piece that James Stewart wrote for the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/25/business/a-corporate-giants-missing-support-for-gay-rights.html?pagewanted=all):

[A]s social attitudes and other corporations’ policies on the subject of gay rights have changed drastically, Exxon Mobil has moved steadily further from the mainstream, even within the energy sector. According to the Human Rights Campaign, 88 percent of Fortune 500 companies have adopted written nondiscrimination policies prohibiting harassment and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, as have all the major integrated oil companies that compete with Exxon Mobil.

As Stewart observed, Exxon’s policy (or lack thereof) “seems to be hurting the company with gay and lesbian customers and employees.” Could handling this controversial case hurt Seyfarth similarly?

As we noted [last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/11/the-best-law-firms-for-lgbt-lawyers/), Seyfarth enjoys a 100 percent rating on the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index, which measures employers on their commitment to LGBT equality. Could this case put Seyfarth’s perfect score in jeopardy? Quite possibly, according to the [Blade](http://www.washingtonblade.com/2013/08/23/seyfarth-shaw/):

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Michael Cole-Schwartz, a Human Rights Campaign spokesperson, said his organization would dock a hypothetical law firm for representing Exxon Mobil in a case alleging anti-gay bias at the company.

“Yes, we would and have done so in the past,” Cole-Schwartz said. “The firm Foley & Lardner was docked 15 points previously for their work representing organizations trying to stop marriage equality (engagements which have since ended and they are no longer docked), although it should be noted the firm has also had a long history of pro bono support for LGBT causes.”

After Foley partner Cleta Mitchell, whom I once dubbed [“an anti-gay gay icon,”](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/04/cleta-mitchell-of-foley-lardner-an-anti-gay-gay-icon/) stopped representing the National Organization for Marriage (NOM), the firm’s Corporate Equality Index score [skyrocketed](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/11/the-best-law-firms-for-lgbt-lawyers/).

UPDATE (8/25/2013, 10 a.m.): A commenter offers this clarification about Cleta Mitchell:

You got the Foley & Lardner story a little wrong. Cleta Mitchell did not quit working for NOM. Because of the controversy that arose from her representation of NOM, Foley devised a policy that any attorney that takes on work either for or against gay marriage may not invoke Foley’s name as a firm, but may still take on such work in their personal name. Foley didn’t force Mitchell to quit representing NOM — it merely won’t let attorneys represent either side of the gay marriage issue using the firm’s name.

Foley isn’t the only Biglaw firm that has ended a controversial client relationship under pressure from the LGBT community. Recall that King & Spalding famously [dropped its DOMA defense](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/04/paul-clement-quits-king-spalding-after-ks-moves-to-drop-doma-defense/), even though that move led former Solicitor General Paul Clement to leave K&S for the [Bancroft boutique](http://www.bancroftpllc.com/professionals/paul-d-clement/).

Speaking of Bancroft, that’s the kind of firm that would be better situated to defend a case like Freedom to Work’s. As Tico Almeida notes, Exxon Mobil is entitled to representation, but it might be better off with a boutique instead of Biglaw. The quality of lawyering would be just as high, but the risk of unpleasant entanglement would be lower.

Large firms like Seyfarth are arguably too big to handle such controversial cases comfortably; they have too many current and prospective employees and clients who might be upset by their defense of alleged anti-gay bias. In contrast, elite conservative boutiques like Bancroft or [Cooper & Kirk](http://cooperkirk.com/), which defended California’s Proposition 8 ban on gay marriage, don’t have such worries. They are small firms, with fewer clients and employees, and many of those clients and workers are social conservatives, who would be unfazed by defending a large corporation accused of anti-gay prejudice.

As word gets out about its involvement in the case, will Seyfarth Shaw stand stalwart in its defense of Exxon Mobil? Stay tuned.

Donald Trump tried to pay his lawyer with a horse. That’s it, that’s the tweet.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/sep/05/donald-trump-tried-pay-lawyer-horse-book-david-enrich-servants-of-the-damned) got its hands on an advance copy of “Servants of the Damned: Giant Law Firms, Donald Trump and the Corruption of Justice,” by New York Times reporter David Enrich, which contains a hilarious anecdote of the [famously tightfisted client](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/08/trump-files-time-trumps-lawyers-sued-trump/) trying to settle accounts by giving his lawyer the deed to a race horse.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Describing “a lawyer at a white-shoe firm” who worked for Trump in the 1990s, Enrich writes: “The bill came to about $2m and Trump refused to pay.

“After a while, the lawyer lost patience, and he showed up, unannounced, at Trump Tower. Someone sent him up to Trump’s office. Trump was initially pleased to see him – he didn’t betray any sense of sheepishness – but the lawyer was steaming.

“‘I’m incredibly disappointed,’ he scolded Trump. ‘There’s no reason you haven’t paid us.’

“Trump made some apologetic noises. Then he said: ‘I’m not going to pay your bill. I’m going to give you something more valuable.’ What on earth is he talking about? the lawyer wondered. ‘I have a stallion,’ Trump continued. ‘It’s worth $5m.’ Trump rummaged around in a filing cabinet and pulled out what he said was a deed to a horse. He handed it to the lawyer.”

Enrich describes the lawyer’s stunned and angry response, in which he threatened to sue.

Trump, Enrich writes, “eventually coughed up at least a portion of what he owed”.

As it is written, so shall it be.

Even now that Trump has infinity GriftBux through the Republican National Committee and various PACs to pay his attorneys, sometimes he still stiffs his lawyers just for the hell of it. As in the case of Rudy Giuliani, whom Trump refused to pay more or less on principal. The Guardian outlines another telling episode from an upcoming book on America’s Erstwhile Mayor, [Giuliani: The Rise and Tragic Fall of America’s Mayor](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/24/donald-trump-secret-mar-a-lago-stay-rudy-giuliani-drink-depression-wife-andrew-kirtzman-book), by author Andrew Kirtzman.

Kirtzman writes that Giuliani’s girlfriend/assistant Maria Ryan wrote a letter to Trump in January of 2021 requesting $2.5 million for “defending you during the Russia hoax investigation and then the impeachment,” a “general pardon,” and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. None of the above was forthcoming, with Trump saying that Giuliani would get “paid on the come,” a casino reference to craps indicating that the lawyer was SOL unless he managed somehow to keep Trump in office for a second term.

And so it is hardly surprising that the roll call of Trump’s many lawyers published this morning in [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/07/donald-trump-has-at-least-19-different-attorneys-00055084) is mostly populated by weirdos who spend their time hanging out on Newsmax and Fox vomiting out nonsensical untruths about federal law and procedure. But when you’ve been able to stack the bench with Federalist Society loyalists, sometimes nonsensical word vomit is [good enough](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/trump-appointee-judge-cannon-gives-him-every-little-thing-his-heart-desires-and-then-some/) to get you what you want anyway.

This summer will go down in associate lore as the summer of MoneyLaw, when the market leaders, followers, and also-rans made themselves known.

Given the intense attention that compensation has gotten from associates around the country, and with recruiting season just around the corner, if you were the Global Head of Legal Personnel and part of your firm’s Senior Management Team, you’d probably be used to answering, or at least artfully dodging, questions about associate compensation.

If your firm had been [criticized for ponying up the headline-grabbing money](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-firm-does-right-by-junior-associates-mid-levels-and-senior-associates-not-so-much/) for junior associates, while leaving midlevel and senior associates with a [poorly explained salary range](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/biglaw-firm-finally-reveals-compensation-for-midlevel-and-senior-associates-and-they-are-pissed/), you’d probably be used to questions about compensation. Especially when many insiders believe the firm’s new salary policy will lead to compression (i.e., [paying first-year associates market salary](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/no-you-are-not-matching-the-market-1st-years-to-180k-doesnt-tell-the-whole-story/) but giving more senior associates less money than the prevailing market amount so that the firm still has a dubious claim of paying “market rate”). If that was the job you had, and the questions you’ve probably heard multiple times since Cravath unveiled the new market standard for compensation two months ago, you’d probably have a really great answer for senior associates when they complained about their salary.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Reed Smith is just such a firm. And Global Head of Legal Personnel [Casey Ryan](https://www.reedsmith.com/casey_ryan/), in an associate meeting meant to discuss compensation issues, had a very clear message for lawyers who were upset that they’d likely see less money than their peers at rival firms:

If someone doesn’t think they are being paid fairly on the market, they can leave.

And don’t let the door hit you on the ass on the way out!

UPDATE (8/3/16, 2:13 p.m.): The quote above from Ryan is produced just as it was relayed to Above the Law by our network of tipsters. However, a representative of the firm has reached out to provide some additional context for how Ryan presented her comments:

While the full remarks may change the context, one thing that cannot be changed is the ire we are hearing from senior associates over their salary.

Every year, we compile a list of the [top law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/top-outside-counsel-rankings-2023/) in the country, and it’s time to start gathering data for 2024.

As always, to build our Outside Counsel Rankings, we turn to those whose perspectives matter most to law firms — the clients who hire them.

We invite all in-house attorneys to tell us about the firms you work with. Whom do you hire most often for routine matters? Which firms do you call when the stakes are highest?

# Biglaw Gaslighting 101: Blaming Layoffs On Associate Salaries
## Blaming employees for making too much money is always poor form but in Biglaw it's also complete nonsense.

Whenever Biglaw executes a round of associate salary raises, some partner at some firm — almost always an Am Law second 50 if not second 100 shop — will declare that it will all end in tears when firms have to lay off these high-priced associates the next year. And whenever there’s an economic speedbump, someone is going to proclaim that Biglaw would’ve gotten away with it without laying anyone off if it weren’t for you pesky kids earning higher salaries. It’s a finely tuned narrative machine. Honestly, it’s not even clear that these partners do it on purpose… it’s like they’re psychically compelled to spread this message.

Yesterday, the American Lawyer [featured the latest in this time-honored tradition](https://www.law.com/2023/06/20/layoffs-are-spreading-after-all-theres-only-so-much-work-to-go-around/):

Meanwhile, other law firm leaders in the Am Law 100 are confident that their more measured hiring and compensation practices will be enough to stave off layoffs at their own firms.

“You’ve got a lot of firms out there that from an image perspective believe they have to match the Cravath scale or at least get very close but they don’t generate the profit margins that those firms do,” said Cozen O’Connor CEO Michael Heller. “By overpaying their associates, they have to literally just lay those associates off.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In a word, balderdash.

On its face, the statement contends that the layoffs we’re seeing stem from firms paying market and cutting profit margins to the bone. Except… that’s not really indicative of the firms laying people off.

Orrick is delivering [north of $3M in PEP with RPL over $1M](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=227&name=Orrick). Same for [Cooley](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=65&name=Cooley) and [Fenwick & West](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=102&name=Fenwick-West). Gunderson doesn’t report that data to Am Law, but it’s hard to believe it’s fallen into pauperism. Stepping away from the tech-heavy layoffs, both [Goodwin](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=123&name=Goodwin-Procter) and [Dechert](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=81&name=Dechert-LLP) meet the $3M+/$1M+ threshold. Hell, Goodwin chased its layoffs by immediately [turning around and hiring more high compensation lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/sure-goodwin-just-laid-off-a-bunch-of-lawyers-but-that-doesnt-mean-theyre-going-to-stop-adding-laterals/) putting the lie to the idea that its layoffs are salary related. Of the high profile layoffs, only Reed Smith misses these financial numbers with [PEP at $1.6M and its RPL just a hair under $1M](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=250&name=Reed-Smith). So maybe those layoffs involve a little profit taking… though they aren’t fully matched with the Cravath scale anyway!

If the general rule for compensation is to pay attorneys roughly a third of what they bring in, then without knowing the distribution across class years, the Cravath scale would back of the napkin fit for all these firms. The average associate is making around $300K and producing about $1M. Perfecto.

So how do we always end up with this fantasy that rising associate compensation drives firm layoffs? And why does it always arrive like clockwork after a couple force reductions?

It’s posturing — both vertical and horizontal.

Cozen, at [$1.1M PEP and an RPL of $850K](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=1728&name=Cozen-O%27Connor), pays a step below market. The firm has to sell its [sometimes unhappy](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/cozen-raise-2021/) associates on the prospect that the grass is greener on this side of the fence. Layoffs afford an easy opportunity to spin lower compensation as doing the lawyers a favor. “Our fiscal conservatism may annoy you in the boom times but we don’t have to lay you off like some firms,” is a compelling if not entirely accurate message. That’s the vertical posturing.

Horizontally, firms competing for talent without the benefit of matching compensation always fear another round of hikes putting them even further behind their peers. When the conventional wisdom is that “raises beget layoffs,” it’s a passive signal to peer firms (and not-so-peer firms) to hold the line. Orrick isn’t struggling to pay Cravath salaries… but Cozen might struggle to compete when Orrick joins Cravath on another salary war adventure.

Again, I honestly don’t think these folks realize what they’re doing. It’s just an article of faith to some partners out there regardless of market reality.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
So, no Virginia, there is no such thing as a salary induced layoff. There are firms unwilling to pay associates in practice groups that aren’t currently busy. Maybe they’re right to save that expense, maybe they’re just compromising future success when those areas roar back and they’ve jettisoned needed capacity. But that’s what’s going on. Not a bevy of elite law firms scraping by with razor thin profit margins because of a bunch of greedy associates.

# Is Biglaw Using Early Partnership To Keep Valuable Associates From Jumping Ship?
## Worried about associates leaving? Make 'em partner NOW.

One of the unexpected reverberations from our pandemic year+ is just how well Biglaw fared. The top of the pack made quite the pretty penny, with a booming corporate market. That means that the [lateral attorney market](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/the-biglaw-lateral-market-is-fire-right-now/) has seen a ton of [action](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/no-t14-degree-no-peer-firm-work-no-problem-biglaw-firms-change-hiring-criteria-in-white-hot-market/), forcing Biglaw firms that want to [hold onto their talent](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/special-bonuses-are-just-another-way-to-keep-associates-hooked-on-biglaw/) to roll out the red carpet. So, suddenly remote-only work is an option (at least for the truly coveted) and those generous mid-year [special bonuses sweeping](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/will-all-of-this-bonus-money-be-enough-to-keep-associates-from-making-lateral-moves/) through Biglaw are looking like golden handcuffs meant to keep associates at their firms.

But the lateral market is savvy, countering with [staggering](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/kirkland-uses-its-immense-wealth-in-pursuit-of-associates/) — we’ve heard tales of six figures — [signing bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/lateral-associates-are-taking-home-gigantic-signing-bonuses-in-this-hot-job-market/) for associates. So what’s a firm anxious to keep their associates to do? Perhaps an unexpected partnership election is in order.

Cahill, Gordon & Reindel is one of the smaller Biglaw firms — at least by headcount, and their partnership classes are usually no more than a handful of folks. And, like a lot of Biglaw firms, the partnership elections come in the beginning of the year — we’re talking [early February](https://www.cahill.com/news/firm-news/2021-02-09-cahill-announces-new-partner-elections) or in [January, ](https://www.cahill.com/news/firm-news/2020-01-14-cahill-announces-new-partner-and-counsel-elections)generally [speaking](https://www.cahill.com/news/firm-news/2019-01-16-cahill-announces-election-of-new-partners). So, imagine everyone’s surprise when [the firm announced ](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/cahill-partners/2/)its second round of partner elections in 2021, these effective July 1, 2021.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
And those elevated to partner in this unusual move are [C. Anthony Wolfe](https://www.cahill.com/professionals/anthony-wolfe) and [Elizabeth Yahl](https://www.cahill.com/professionals/elizabeth-yahl). Two associates that just happen to work in the super hot capital markets practice area. Hmmm, this sure feels like a bid to keep valuable attorneys at the firm rather than risk losing them to the lateral market by waiting until 2022 to elect them to the partnership.

We reached out to the firm about the… noteworthy timing but have yet to hear back.

Congratulations to those elevated.

# Cloud-Based Subscription Software Or Desktop Version?
## Technology columnist Jeff Bennion discusses the pros and cons of renting your software versus owning it.

A few years ago, software companies started switching their pricing models to offer subscription-based software instead of the traditional desktop installation versions. Now, some of the core software I use in my practice has switched over to cloud/subscription-based ownership. Quickbooks is now Quickbooks Online. Office is Office 365. Adobe Acrobat is Acrobat DC (Document Cloud). It seems more companies are making this transition, so I wanted to discuss the pros and cons of renting your software versus owning it.

The Cons of Subscription-Based Software Ownership

The first obvious con is cost. If you buy a desktop version of Office 2013, you own it and you don’t have to keep paying for it every month. For those of you still running Office 2013, if you would have bought that as a subscription three years ago, that’s over 150 payments and an unforeseen number of payments in the future. In one of the colleges where I teach, they just recently upgraded from Office 2003. So, if they are upgrading every 10 to 13 years, that’s a significant cost increase if you are making mandatory monthly payments on your software instead of buying it outright and keeping it as long as you want.

The second con is that your system might not be compatible with updates. That’s one of the reasons why large firms and large companies are so slow to upgrade. When I was working in a large law firm, we had Word with built-in macros for preparing pleadings and correspondence with our firm letterhead and formatting styles. There’s no guarantee that those macros will be compatible with future versions of Office.

Large-scale upgrades also mean large-scale software training for employees. The interface between Adobe Acrobat 9 and 10 was significant. Likewise, small things are different in newer versions that can cause frustrations. For example, embedding a picture into an e-mail in Outlook 2010 is different than attaching an e-mail in 2013 and 2016.

The Pros of Subscription-Based Software Ownership

I’ll mirror the first con and say that the first and most obvious pro is cost. I use Adobe Creative Cloud a lot. I use it to build my websites, to prepare graphics for trial, to produce videos for trials and mediations, to edit audio files, and to Bates stamp and review documents. The last desktop suite version of the Adobe software was about $2,600 and that did not include upgrades. The software is upgraded every few years with significant upgrades. So, if I upgrade twice every six years, I’m paying over $5,000. If I’m paying $50 a month for the same software package, I’m saving about $1,400 every six years. You can get Office for about $8 a month. But, when you buy the subscription, you are getting added bonuses, like 1 tb of online cloud storage. Dropbox charges the exact same price for its 1 tb of online storage. So, it’s like getting 1tb of online storage for $8.25 a month and full versions of Office for free for use on up to five computers. Quickbooks would recommend upgrading every three years at least. So, if you upgrade your software regularly, it’s either cheaper or pretty comparable to pay the monthly price.

It’s also a cheaper upfront cost, which is significant for smaller firms. It also gives consumers the option to try software at a cheaper monthly rate and then cancel or change your plan later. For example, if I am debating between the $8.25 monthly plan and the $35 monthly plan for Office, I can try the $35 plan for a month and then cancel or change my plan. I don’t have to pay $700 to buy the software suite and then decide I don’t like it or don’t need all of those features and then have to deal with retailers’ software return policies.

One of the other biggest pros is the constant updates. Microsoft [has a site](http://fasttrack.microsoft.com/roadmap) showing consumers the status of the updates it is rolling out and what it has planned for the near future. Currently, it’s got 52 recently launched updates, 43 that are rolling out, and another 121 in development.



Adobe just released a major update for its Acrobat software a few weeks ago. Microsoft also gives you the option to throttle back your updates if you are in a large company or firm and are worried about compatibility with your systems.

Subscription-based software also allows you to easily manage your licenses. If I have Office installed on one computer and that computer breaks, I can’t just keep installing it on new computers because I have a limited number of licenses. Subscription-based software usually allows you to control your licenses online. So if a computer breaks, I don’t need to call Microsoft to get permission to load it onto another computer. I just log into my account and deactivate my broken computer and install it on my new computer. Likewise, if you work in a large firm and a secretary quits, you can just deactivate her license, freeing up a license for someone else to use.

Conclusion

For all of the complaints about subscription-based software, I think it’s a great model for law firms large and small. The lower upfront cost means that more firms are going to be able to try new software and have access to current updates, which can lead to greater efficiency.

# The 2024 Am Law 100 Ranking Is Here!
## 2023 was a pretty good year for Biglaw!

How did Biglaw fare in 2023? We’ve finally moved from anecdotal stories of highs and lows and gotten some real data with the announcement of American Lawyer’s [2024 Am Law 100](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/am-law-100/). And, overall, things are looking pretty good. Not the epic highs of the pandemic, but a pretty solid performance from Biglaw mainstays. As American Lawyer notes, “While not a wholesale return to the historic highs of 2020 and 2021, fiscal 2023 brought collective growth in revenue, revenue per lawyer and profitability metrics.”

Patrick Smith [details](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/04/16/showcasing-resilience-of-the-industry-am-law-100-firms-turn-in-strong-2023/) the industry-wide trends:

Overall, the industry rebounded from a difficult 2022 to post gains in virtually every measurable financial and operational metric. On a high level, gross revenue was up 6.8% to a new collective all-time high of $139.7 billion in 2023. (By comparison, it was up 2.7% in 2022, one of the few primary metrics to land in the black that year.)

In 2022, nearly all metrics for the Am Law 100 as a whole were in the red.

In 2023, Am Law 100 firms collectively reversed that. The 100 firms saw gains in revenue per lawyer (RPL), by 4.9% to $1.21 million; PEP (9.3% to $2.80 million); CAP (6.2% to $1.75 million) and profits per lawyer (6.2% to $517,821), according to firm data and American Lawyer reporting.

So, enough of the broad strokes — how did specific firms stack up? Here’s the top of some of the biggest categories.

Gross Revenue

Here’s the top 10 by revenue… which looks a pretty similar to last year’s top 10. Full 100 list [available here.](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/04/16/the-2024-am-law-100-ranked-by-gross-revenue/)

Rank	Rank Change	Firm			Revenue	Rev Change
1	(no change)	Kirkland			$7,208,000,000	10.65%
2	(no change)	Latham			$5,688,226,000	6.90%
3	(no change)	DLA Piper (verein)			$3,829,531,000	3.92%
4	(no change)	Baker McKenzie (verein)			$3,286,791,000	-0.41%
5	(no change)	Skadden			$3,270,091,000	8.25%
6	(no change)	Sidley			$3,100,458,000	6.08%
7	(up 2)	Gibson Dunn			$3,074,016,000	12.33%
8	(up 2)	Ropes & Gray			$2,992,831,000	10.10%
9	(down 2)	White & Case			$2,949,400,000	4.29%
10	(down 2)	Morgan Lewis			$2,898,514,000	5.58%
Revenue Per Lawyer

But, of course, there are other metrics that are important in Biglaw. Take, for example, revenue per lawyer. RPL provides a relatively accurate picture of a firm’s overall financial well-being, and here are the five big name player at the top of the list. Full list available[ here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/04/16/the-2024-am-law-100-ranked-by-revenue-per-lawyer/).

Rank	Firm				RPL	% Change
1	Wachtell				$4,272,000	20.58%
2	Susman Godfrey				$3,595,000	82.58%
3	Sullivan & Cromwell				$2,219,000	3.69%
4	Cravath				$2,200,000	11.85%
5	Kirkland				$2,051,000	7.49%
Profits Per Equity Partner

Wachtell retook their position at the top of this ranking, wresting #1 out of Kirkland’s hands. The full Am Law 100 profits per partner chart can be found [here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/04/16/the-2024-am-law-100-ranked-by-profits-per-equity-partner/).

Rank	Firm				PEP	% Change
1	Wachtell				$8,507,000	16.63%
2	Kirkland				$7,955,000	5.84%
3	Quinn Emanuel				$7,270,000	39.03%
4	Susman Godfrey				$6,989,000	103.46%
5	Paul Weiss				$6,574,000	14.83%
We will undoubtedly have even more to say as we dig into these numbers. But it’s good to see the Biglaw rebound is well in effect.

[[WSJ Law Blog](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/04/07/bankruptcy-judge-scolds-50-cent-for-courthouse-photo/)] * SCOTUS will hear oral arguments on the appeal of securities fraud case Salman v.

# Wow! Biglaw Firm Offers Parents MORE Pay For Doing LESS Work
## Which firm is offering this outstanding benefit?

When we last discussed parental leave policies at Biglaw firm, we mentioned that some, but not all, large law firms had risen to the occasion to make life easier for lawyers who were new parents. Now, a prestigious law firm is forcing us to eat our words by offering what may be the best benefit to be offered to lawyers returning to a firm after taking parental leave yet.

On top of its 18-week parental leave, Proskauer Rose is now offering a program that will allow primary caregivers returning to the firm after taking leave to work on a 75 percent schedule for six months while receiving 100 percent of the pay they got before they took the leave. The [Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202768375962/Full-Pay-for-Less-Work-Greets-Proskauer-Parents-Returning-From-Leave) has more information on Proskauer’s new program:

“What associates were telling us is it’s the transition back that’s so difficult,” said Joanne Ollman, Proskauer’s chief professional resources officer. “They have the pressure to keep their hours up when they’re trying to care for a newborn.”

Within 30 minutes of sending out the announcement on Thursday, Ollman said she got about a half dozen emails back from grateful lawyers, and some had already stopped by her office to offer their praise of the program in person.

Ollman wanted it to be known that the firm fully embraces flex-time working arrangements. Backing her up, Proskauer chairman Joe Leccese said: “Attracting and retaining the most talented lawyers is essential to our ability to deliver premier client service. Supporting our lawyers’ needs at key stages of their personal life is and will remain a critical component of our talent management strategy.”

Congratulations to Proskauer on going forward with this program that will surely benefit its attorneys and their families. Which Biglaw firm will be the next to step up and make life a little easier for attorneys who are working parents?

# Biglaw Firm Duped Into Wiring Money To Scam Account Loses $2.5 Million In Cyber Breach
## Even the biggest of Biglaw behemoths can be victimized by fraudsters without proper precautions.

It’s not just computer illiterate grannies who are conned into sending large sums of money to sophisticated internet scammers — it’s Biglaw firms too. This time, the largest law firm in the world fell prey to such a scam, wiring millions of dollars of client funds to a fraudulent account instead of closing a deal as planned.

Back in 2017, Dentons Canada was involved in a real estate transaction with Timbercreek Mortgage Servicing Inc., but when the time came to transfer about $2.52 million from the firm’s trust account to its client, they ran into some pretty big problems, and now the firm is stuck in court trying to an insurance company to cover its losses. Here are the details on what happened next, from [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/01/22/dentons-lawyer-wired-2-5-million-to-scam-bank-account-in-elaborate-con/):

Before the transfer, however, Dentons received emails from people who appeared to be affiliated with Timbercreek. The emails indicated that one of Timbercreek’s accounts was subject to an audit and asked for Dentons to send the money to an international account in Hong Kong, held by a third-party called Yiguangnian Trade Co. Ltd., according to Brown’s decision.

Following that, the Dentons side attempted to verify, leaving a voicemail at Timbercreek and seeking letters of authorization from the mortgage servicer and the Yiguangnian entity. Although Dentons didn’t receive a phone call back, it did receive what appeared to be authorization letters from Timbercreek and Yiguangnian. The law firm then went ahead with the transfer, sending the $2.52 million to the Hong Kong account, according to the court ruling.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Several weeks passed, and Timbercreek wanted to know what happened to its money. That’s when an associate realized that millions of dollars had been sent to a scam account. While Dentons was able to recoup a few hundred thousand dollars on its own, they’re relying on Trisura Guarantee Insurance Co. to cover the rest. Unfortunately, Trisura is denying coverage because they claim this sort of situation doesn’t fall under the computer fraud rider to the firm’s policy.

As a result of this massive scam, Dentons is making sure that all of its employees and attorneys participate in “extensive [cybersecurity] training.” Here’s more from Dentons Canada spokeswoman Neetisha Seenundun: “The training is updated and repeated annually. Participation is mandatory by all Dentons partners and employees. Although no firm policies were breached, we have however adjusted the training to highlight the hallmarks of this kind of fraud.”

This must be a little embarassing for Dentons, but even the biggest of Biglaw behemoths can be victimized by fraudsters without proper precautions. Be careful out there, lawyers. The internet is a scary place.

# Let’s Not Lose Ground During COVID-19 In The Fight For Gender Equality In Law Firms
## A basic premise of all leadership development is that transformation and change cannot happen until we can really see the problem.

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts on motherhood in the legal profession, in partnership with our friends at [MothersEsquire](https://www.mothersesquire.com/). Welcome Susan Dunlap to our pages.

The more time I spend with the hundreds of Biglaw women lawyers I work with as a leadership coach, the more I worry about the regressive effect this pandemic is having on gender equality in Biglaw. One of my clients said it best when she lamented that “Equality has been erased!” She was referring specifically to the fact that many of her male counterparts have the luxury of working single-mindedly all day, while she and many other women lawyers are working full time and also managing the mental, physical, and emotional labors of childcare, homeschooling, meal planning and preparation, cleaning, and a never-ending list of other essential household responsibilities. This is, of course, an existing struggle that COVID-19 only magnified.

In an effort to give you a better, more concrete glimpse into the world of a woman in Biglaw who has children, I’ve described my client’s typical day in detail below.

- What conversations does reading this snapshot provoke?
- What can we do to make sure this is not a regressive period for women?
- What are we not talking about that we need to be talking about?

I wake up at 6 a.m. with the kids. I immediately check my email to see what I missed overnight and what I have ahead of me. (The stress hits immediately, as I wonder how I am going to get everything done.) I can’t think about it too much now, because I have to get kids dressed and ready for breakfast. The kids’ sleep schedule is off due to the sheltering-at-home, so even getting dressed is a battle.

I feed them while spending time looking at my phone. Over breakfast, my husband and I argue about who will have the first shift — we are both feeling so much pressure to produce for work. We agree that I will take care of the kids until 9 a.m., and then my husband will take them until noon. I play with my toddler while getting my kindergartener set up for Zoom learning. We have to print materials for Zoom school, and I find our printer isn’t working -– more stress!!  I don’t want my child to feel unprepared for school. I am sure I’ll be judged as the “working mom.” While watching the kids, I am constantly monitoring work email and becoming anxious about not being able to start work earlier.

9 a.m. – noon

The minute my husband takes over at 9 a.m., I run upstairs with my laptop into a room and lock the door. The kids still think I’m actually leaving the house to work, which is the only way they leave me alone. I have about two to two and a half hours to work but I am constantly interrupted — today my husband needs to jump on an emergency call for 20 minutes, and I have a practice group check-in call.

While I am trying to work, my kids are yelling and screaming downstairs –- it is so hard to concentrate! My husband is doing the best he can, but when the kids fall down and hurt themselves, they still cry for me. I try to ignore it, and I feel like a terrible mother. I am worried my lack of concentration is affecting my work, but I can’t worry about that now — I just have to get it done. But I get distracted thinking that I might get fired if anyone knew how challenging this is for me. The firm has been really good about giving us feedback about its financial performance, but we definitely see in media reports the financial impact this pandemic is having on law firms generally. We all worry about what a slowdown means for us individually and for the firm in general.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Noon – 3 p.m.

After a couple of hours of distracted work (I haven’t had an undistracted block of two hours since WFH began), I go downstairs to prepare the kids’ lunches. They are both very needy right now, so they are crawling over me while I prepare the meal and constantly check emails. I feel guilt and shame for not being able to work exclusively — I am hoping no one notices. I also feel guilty because my stress is making me very impatient with the kids.

After lunch, I put them down for naps. When the kids are asleep, I sneak back upstairs and try to work for another few hours. But the kids are terrible nappers, so they usually wake up after an hour, and my husband has to take them again until 3 p.m. I feel so badly that he has to take them AGAIN — I know he understands, but he still finds it annoying. More guilt and stress. While I am working we get an email from the firm saying it is more important than ever to do non-billable work (WHAT?!).

3 p.m. – 6 p.m.

I go back downstairs and switch places with my husband so he can work. The kids really need to expend energy, as they have been cooped up all day. We like to play in our backyard when we can, but the weather’s been terrible. Everyone is getting on each other’s nerves, so there is constant squabbling between the kids. Even the TV isn’t working as a babysitting option, because my little one only has an attention span of five to ten minutes.

During this time, I am constantly checking my phone to see what I’m missing at work. The anxiety is crushing. At 5 p.m., I bring the kids to the kitchen and start making dinner, usually with at least one child attached to a leg or arm.  Yesterday, someone decided to schedule a conference call at 5:30 p.m., so I cooked dinner as fast as possible, and listened to the conference call on mute while at the table as the kids ate (terrible headache).

6 p.m. – 10:30 p.m.

After dinner, I play with the kids for another hour or so before I give them a bath and put my toddler to bed. After my toddler’s down, I get about 40 minutes of work in before I put my son down. While working, I get a call from my sister telling me how hard it has been since her husband was furloughed. This makes me so grateful to have my job, but also terrified what it may mean if I lose it!

After the call, I go back to work, wondering how I am going to get everything done tonight, when I am SO tired. After my son is down, I work for another one and a half to two hours until I feel like I’m going to fall asleep at my desk.  When I log off around 10:30 p.m., I’ve worked about six and a half hours but one hour was non-billable. I am completely exhausted and feel like I am failing at everything! I am worried people may see my hours as low and assume I have more time, so they will reach out to me with more nonbillable work. It’s hard to say no when I am billing way fewer hours than usual, but people don’t understand that right now, giving me more non-billable work means less time to put toward billable work (and toward sleep and taking care of the kids).

I love being a lawyer. I love my clients. I actually love my job. My identity is very much wrapped up in being a top performer, but now I feel like a complete failure as a lawyer and as a mother. I don’t think I can continue doing this, but I’m the primary bread-winner so I don’t have that many options. I think I am the only one of my friends who is still working. I go through the internal struggle every day: trying to balance putting in enough hours at work, caring for my kids, and getting some sleep. I want to have enough billable hours to not be put on the chopping block if that time comes, but I also need sleep to do my job and to parent effectively.

What Will Our Post-COVID-19 Future Look Like?

A basic premise of all leadership development is that transformation and change cannot happen until we can really see the problem. Awareness leads to choice, and choice leads to change. The pandemic and sheltering-in-place have greatly exaggerated the ever-present problem of gender inequity in law firms, making it impossible for anyone not to see it. My hope is that one of the silver linings of the pandemic will be a dramatically increased willingness to acknowledge the problem, then have bold conversations that bring about bold actions toward true gender equity, thereby creating a system that actually works for all lawyers.

# Biglaw Firm Hands Out Raises To New York Associates To Ring In The Weekend
## Exciting news!

It’s been a little less than six months since the great Biglaw salary scramble of 2022 began, and some firms are just now making good on the money for associates. Which is the latest firm to step up to the plate and increase wages for its hardworking attorneys?

That would be Kasowitz Benson Torres, which brought in $238,409,000 gross revenue in 2021, putting the firm in 142nd place in the most recent Am Law 200 ranking. Here’s what the new salary scale looks like at the firm.



That’s a Cravath match, and according to the memo, it appears that these raises are being applied only to associates in the firm’s New York office. If you recall, the last time Kasowitz [raised salaries in 2021](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/kasowitz-raise-2021/), it was a firmwide move across all offices. Not to worry, though, because a source tells us that most attorneys in the firm’s satellite offices are partners, counsel, or very senior, so limiting the salary increases to New York will “not likely [have a] huge impact.”

These salary adjustments are effective as of April 1, 2022, so associates will be receiving some true-up money in their June paychecks. Congratulations to all of the firm’s New York associates!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Kasowitz.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Biglaw Leaders Realizing They've 'Got No Leverage' When It Comes To Making Lawyers Return To The Office
## Lawyers just don't want to go back to the office -- and partners are having a hard time forcing the issue.

Habits have formed, and a lot of people have gotten very comfortable working remotely. They’ve gotten into a routine, and that routine offers a lot of things, like cost savings. The timing of these inflationary pressures is not good for people who want to get [personnel] back into the office. All these things are becoming issues.

— Paul Schmidt, chairman of Baker & Hostetler, commenting on Biglaw firms’ relative [inability to get lawyers to return to the office](https://www.law.com/2022/04/21/law-firms-lack-leverage-to-mandate-bustling-office-attendance/) on a regular basis following years of remote work due to the pandemic. Michael Heller, executive chairman and CEO of Cozen O’Connor, was even more realistic. “The only thing that’s going to change an employer’s ability to get people back to the office is frankly if there’s a recession and it changes the employment level,” he said. “Right now, we’ve got no leverage to get our lawyers back to the office on a consistent basis.”

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Unleashes A Brand New Salary Scale For Associates

It’s said that March comes in like a lion, and when it comes to the 2022 salary wars, it couldn’t be more accurate. Biglaw firms have been announcing raises left and right, and recently, more and more firms that we’ve yet to hear from are finally speaking out, announcing their own brand new compensation grids.

One of those firms is Sheppard Mullin. With $867,416,000 gross revenue in 2020, the firm ranks at No. 50 in the most recent Am Law 100, so we know they’ll be able to afford life on the Cravath scale.

Here’s what the firm’s new salaries look like, retroactive to January 1:



Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Sheppard Mullin.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Milbank) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Milbank”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

A highly regarded Washington DC law firm has asked [Kinney Recruiting](https://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/) for assistance in recruiting a senior litigation associate with six (6) or more years of bankruptcy litigation experience.

The litigation practice at this firm is well-regarded for its work in federal district and bankruptcy courts.

Most importantly for senior associates thinking about partnership, the litigation practice is extremely well-regarded and the partners have substantive involvement in making firmwide decisions.

Are you, like me, glued to the oral arguments in Moore v. Harper, terrified about what the independent state legislature theory being advanced by petitioners means for the future of American democracy? If so, you could probably use a break from angrily scrolling Twitter over the [whiplash treatment](https://twitter.com/ElieNYC/status/1600529828716941314?s=20&t=qYdw-hLUu_o7KQkjrPSYBA) conservatives are now giving states’ rights now that it no longer serves their political goals. Let me suggest some happy Biglaw bonus news.

Kramer Levin, a firm that took in $449,000,000 in gross revenue last year, announced their own bonus grid earlier today. As you might expect, the firm is matching the prevailing market standard, set by Baker McKenzie last month.

The scale, in case you’ve forgotten it, is as follows:



The firm also included those in their stump year — that is the class of 2022 — in the bonus news. They noted, “Members of the 2022 Associate Class, regardless of their actual start date, will receive a bonus of $15,000 prorated to October 1, 2022.” Also not left out of the bonus fun are counsel. In a separate memo, the firm announced counsel are “eligible for year-end bonuses in amounts up to $120,000.”

Bonuses will be paid by February 15th. You can read both memos [on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/amlaw-100-biglaw-firm-delights-associates-with-big-money/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Will You Have To Wear A Mask At Your Law Firm?
## Some firms will follow the new CDC guidelines, and others will not.

It’s a strange environment where you can walk into an office building and you don’t have to wear your mask in certain instances. But the minute you walk into your law office, you have to put it on. And then when you walk into your own office, you can take it off. So, it’s a very transitory stage right now, where there are no clear answers, or maybe even logic, behind the rules

— [Marcie Borgal Shunk](https://www.thetiltinstitute.com/who), a consultant to law firm management, commenting on the [varied mask guidelines](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/05/26/to-mask-or-unmask-in-offices-some-law-firms-are-updating-their-mask-guidelines/) that are present within the United States, and acknowledging that this may be why law firms creating reopening protocol have taken a “wait-and-see” attitude at this stage of the pandemic.

(What’s your law firm’s mask policy? [Email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Mask%20Policy) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Mask Policy”) or text us at (646) 820-8477.)

# Associate Bonus Watch: Bonus Season Is Coming...

‘Where’s my bonus?’

Thanksgiving is just days away, which means that bonus season is right around the corner. Wouldn’t it be nice if your law firm gave you a little something extra to be thankful for this year? We sure think it would be! As a little reminder (as if you really needed one), this is what [last year’s Cravath bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2016-associate-bonuses/) looked like:

Class of 2016 — $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2015 — $15,000
Class of 2014 — $25,000
Class of 2013 — $50,000
Class of 2012 — $65,000
Class of 2011 — $80,000
Class of 2010 — $90,000
Class of 2009 — $100,000
Class of 2008 — $100,000

For those of you who are wondering when your bank accounts will be a little more flush, here’s a list of the dates when year-end market bonuses hit Biglaw since 2006, the very first year Above the Law started publishing bonus news. Take a look:

- 2016: November 28 ([Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2016-associate-bonuses/))
- 2015: December 7 ([Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2015-associate-bonuses/))
- 2014: November 21 ([Simpson Thacher](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/bonus-season-comes-early-and-its-not-cravath/))
- 2013: December 2 ([Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/12/breaking-cravath-announces-year-end-bonuses-let-the-2013-bonus-season-begin/))
- 2012: November 26 ([Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/11/breaking-cravath-announces-year-end-bonuses-let-the-2012-bonus-season-begin/))
- 2011: November 28 ([Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/11/breaking-cravath-bonuses-are-out-welcome-to-the-2011-bonus-season/))
- 2010: November 22 ([Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/11/associate-bonus-watch-the-2010-bonus-season-is-under-way/))
- 2009: November 2 ([Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/11/breaking-cravath-bonuses-are-out-and-down/))
- 2008: November 19 ([Skadden](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/11/associate-bonus-watch-here-comes-skadden/))
- 2007: October 29 ([Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/10/cravath-announces-bonuses-special-and-otherwise/))
- 2006: December 11 ([Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2006/12/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announced-cadwalader-rumored/))
With visions of bonus dollars dancing in your heads, it’s time to check in on how people are doing with their billable hours. There are just about six weeks to go in 2017, and this year, with flat demand for legal services, [revenue per lawyer down](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/the-2017-am-law-100-a-turning-point-for-biglaw/) at many firms, and [expenses up across the board](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/how-well-did-biglaw-perform-financially-in-the-third-quarter/) thanks to [Biglaw’s base salary increase](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) from $160K to $180K, hitting your targets this year is very, very important. Some firms might make bank-busting payments that will generate sweet headlines, but not all associates will hit the hours mark necessary for the top payment.

Still, with a month and a half to go, there’s plenty of time to game your stats. Now that holiday season has arrived, attorneys may start dragging out their assignments — after all, some hours here and there could mean a world of difference to an associate.

Gone are the days when in-house lawyers can merely just do their jobs.

Among other skills, advocacy is a versatility perfected by many in-house lawyers. They increasingly advocate on behalf of others, for an
industry, or for change in the legal profession. In the process, they
build their own careers, contribute to their organizations, and even
change the world around them.

Unconscious Bias Against Women

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Increasingly, many in-house lawyers have shone a spotlight on biases
against women. Helen Yoon candidly discussed her experiences with
these biases and how they impacted her self-esteem and career, as well
as sharing some advice for women on how to deal with biases when they
face them.


Biotechnology And What It Means

Other in-house lawyers have increasingly spoken up about changes in
industries and the directions in which they’re heading. For example,
if I were to ask you about biotechnology, you might give me a look and
explain, “I studied law, not science!” Fair enough. But, remember, law
relates to all fields, and we should try to keep our eyes and ears
open, so we can become better attorneys.

the biotech industry and their own careers.


Do You Like Your Job?

Whatever your job may be, whether you’re a lawyer, a teacher, or a
waiter, chances are that you’ve stopped and asked yourself if you
liked your job. After all, life is full of choices, and we tend to
gravitate toward the ones that make us happy. Punam Kaji, assistant
general counsel at the Ben E. Keith Co., talks about how to keep
at it, even if you don’t really like your job, providing pragmatic
insights and sharing real-life experiences.

The in-house lawyers are increasingly well-rounded leaders. They
advocate for change, move their companies forward, and impact the
world around them. They openly and candidly share their experiences,
model the changes they want to see in the world, and nudge their
organizations toward doing the right thing. It is increasingly
apparent that opportunities open to in-house lawyers offer a place to
grow, contribute, and make an impact.

# Top 30 Biglaw Firm's Leader Thinks AI Will Help His Firm Soar To The Top
## Cleary Gottlieb's managing partner wants the firm to move up in the Am Law 100 ranking. Can AI help get the job done?

Biglaw firms are always looking for more — more money, more prestige, more power. But how can a firm achieve more without making any significant changes to its current model? That’s what Cleary Gottlieb is going to try to figure out.

Cleary is one of the most successful firms in the country. The firm brought in $1,393,989,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 30 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking. According to Michael Gerstenzang, the firm’s managing partner, being a Top 30 firm is no longer good enough for Cleary. [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/cleary-leader-confident-amid-law-firm-frothiness-ai-adoption) has more Gerstenzang’s “ambitious” plans:

Gerstenzang’s ambitious goal is to land Cleary among the Top 20 firms by gross revenue, a feat that would require a leap of roughly $500 million from last year. That would mean a 36% gain from last year, when Cleary ranked No. 30 among US firms in gross revenue.

One solution could be for Cleary to introduce a nonequity partner tier as a way to offer more money to its highest earners, but Gerstenzang said the firm had already turned away from such a plan back in 2020.

Cleary decided its “culture” wasn’t prepared to be as “disciplined or ruthless” to manage out non-performing income partners, he said. It also had concerns a large non-equity tier could deteriorate its reputation for consistent, high quality work across its practices.

Still, he said the financial data show “how successful managing a big pool of nonequity partners can be.”

Could times be changing at Cleary Gottlieb? Possibly. “I want us to be higher in everything, but we also have to recognize there are different models,” Gerstenzang told Bloomberg. “I’m not that worried about the competition for talent given where we are today. We need to do better, we can do better.”

Tabling the nonequity partner issue, for the time being, it looks like the model Gerstenzang wants to focus on moving toward is value-based billing over the billable hour, and he wants to use artificial intelligence to get there. “It will be beneficial for clients and law firms to shift toward value-based billing,” he said. “Generative AI is going to be helpful to move us toward that model.”

It looks like Cleary Gottlieb is putting a lot of faith into the power of generative AI. Can it help one of the most successful firms in the country move up 10 places in the Am Law 100? Can it help the legal profession leave the billable hour in the dust? It sure seems like this might be one big AI hallucination… but hopefully it’ll work.

# New York To $180K: What It Means For Partners And Firms

Michael Allen

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors. [Michael Allen](http://www.laterallink.com/about/team/1) is Managing Principal at Lateral Link, focusing exclusively on partner placements with Am Law 200 clients and placements for in-house attorneys.

While associates are ecstatic for their first nominal raise in nearly ten years, the outstanding question remains: Who pays for these raises?

After Cravath bumped first-year salaries at large firms to $180K in early June, 89 other firms have matched. Of those firms, 49 increased salaries at all of their offices nationwide, and 35 increased salaries at offices only in major markets. A total of 5 firms limited raises to just New York.

In the early ‘90s, David Maister wrote an article for the American Lawyer outlining the profitability model for law firms, where Profits Per Equity Partner are equal to the relationship between several variables or “levers,” with which firms have been constantly tinkering to maximize profitability. Chief among these variables are leverage (L), utilization (U), costs (TE), and blended billing rate (BBR).



In the past, firms have been able to pass increased costs on to clients by raising billing rates. But as billing rates continue to climb, we have seen general counsels push back.

The immediate fallout is fairly obvious. Firms with a large number of associates in markets that received salary increases will theoretically have diminished profits (among all profit-related metrics like PPP and PPL) because of increased costs.

Costs are not the only variable driving down profitability. As the divide between billing rate and collection rate continues to widen, profits decrease ([source](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/news/upload/2016_PM_GT_Final-Report.pdf)).

Productivity – the ratio between total billable hours and total attorneys, and analogous to U – has fallen in tandem. With U expected to decrease and total expenses expected to increase, it seems likely that firm profit margins will take a hit, unless firms are able to otherwise decrease variable costs such as office space, administrative support, marketing budgets, technology, and the like.

Billing Rate Progression

[](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lateral-Link-2.jpg)

Not surprisingly, out of the total overhead costs, attorney salaries make up the largest percentage of expenses compared to any other group, and with the new Cravath scale we would expect this trend to rise. Most firm overhead is largely fixed: firms sign lengthy leases that can lock them in for over a decade; professional staff is vital to a functioning firm; tech and marketing are now a requisite and not a luxury for a full-service firm. Regardless, firms actually have been diligent about curbing expenses since the recession.

Overhead Expenses Detail



As you can see, both direct and overhead expenses have normalized well below the growth rates we recall before the recession. Expenses are largely static when adjusting for firm growth and inflation.

Expenses Growth



Because there are so few areas to cut further, and partner compensation is one of the few highly variable costs law firms have, partners are wary that the associate salary bump has an obvious target in mind – their share of year-end profits.

Partners have long benefited from a model that has generously rewarded business generation. A partner at a Biglaw firm can typically expect to realize between 25% and 33% of their portable book of business with diminishing returns to increased size. A partner with a $6 million book of business may personally bill under $1.5 million, but ultimately may collect over $2 million, and possibly much more, depending on the firm’s compensation formula.

It seems that the majority of the Am Law 200 law firms will pass their associate raises on to their partners. The very few firms with institutional business, such as Wachtell Lipton or Paul Weiss, whose clients are less price-sensitive for unparalleled service, will be able to pass along the costs to their clients by increasing billing rates over time. Indeed, Wachtell’s mysterious compensation system already compensates associates well above market value.

Firms with low leverage have been reluctant to match Cravath’s new standard. The reasons behind this are clear. On a macro level, associates at low leverage firms have less leverage when it comes to their value in the firm’s profit model. Large firms with high leverage like DLA Piper and Baker & McKenzie, who derive a much larger percentage of their gross from associates, would be crippled by an exodus of associates and are, in essence, forced to play ball.

Leverage by Firm Type

[](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lateral-Link-5.jpg)

Highly leveraged firms also operate with a discrete understanding that there are very few partnership positions for their glut of associates. Consequently, they must keep their associates happy to keep lateral retention high. Firms with lower leverage can entice associates with the increased prospect of a partnership position, where they will reap the benefits of the existing compensation model.

Because associates have a high ROI, highly leveraged firms with high profit margins will face less pressure to redistribute the wealth from partners to associates. They will likely take a hit in Profits Per Partner, but they will try to keep their Profits Per Lawyer steady.

Leverage does not explain the entirety of each firm’s decision to match, and may be somewhat of a red herring for a more complex trend. The most interesting result of the salary wars was a clear demarcation between firms that have a revenue model that can support raises, and firms that don’t.

Firm Match by Profit Margin

[](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lateral-Link-6.jpg)

Unsurprisingly, the division was drawn by the profit margins of the Am Law 200—for which leverage has a pronounced correlation. The above graph, stepped in three shades of red, represents the extent to which a firm matched. Pink denotes no match, red signals a major market match, and maroon a full match. Incidentally, the critical mass for propagating the new Cravath model occurred right around the mean.

Firms under the mean will have a hard time matching, but may implement the new scale if they start experiencing significant lateral losses (which may be too little, too late). Profitable matching firms will opportunistically poach the top associates from these firms by offering competitive compensation packages, potentially causing firm collapses – or at the very least, mergers.

At Lateral Link, we are expecting to see even more lateral movement from both associates and partners within Am Law 200 firms. We have already witnessed the shift to a candidate-driven market for associates, as well as an increased concern from partners who anticipate bearing the costs of these raises at year’s end. It’s clear from studying these models that there are ways of maximizing your year-end profits, and we are always available to consult on your individual situation.

# Cravath Names New Partners -- And All Three Are Women

Worldwide Plaza, where the magic happens — or, at least, where Biglaw compensation levels are set.

Biglaw has big problems when it comes to gender equality. While [juicy](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/traci-ribeiro/) [lawsuits](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/kerrie-campbell/) generate [headlines](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/biglaw-partner-alleges-sexism-derailed-her-career-in-a-new-lawsuit/?rf=1), one need not rely on those cases — which at this point involve just allegations, after all — to make the diagnosis. Focus instead on the fundamentals — like the fact that women represent just [18 percent of equity partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/tracking-10-years-of-womens-progress-in-the-legal-profession/) in large law firms.

One possible response: that statistic covers partners at all levels of seniority, so there’s a lag time here, and the problem will naturally go away as the years pass. If women make up about 50 percent of law school students, they’ll eventually make up 50 percent of equity partners, right?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Alas, that might be a bit optimistic, at least if firms don’t make an effort to improve the retention and promotion of women lawyers. As reflected in recent partner promotion announcements, this remains a live issue. For example, just last week Cleary Gottlieb named [eight new partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/cleary-gottliebs-new-partner-class-where-are-the-women/2/), and only [one was a woman](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/cleary-gottliebs-new-partner-class-where-are-the-women/). Commenting to Above the Law, managing partner [Mark Leddy](https://www.clearygottlieb.com/professionals/mark-leddy) said, “There are no excuses; we must do better. We have undertaken a number of initiatives and are firmly committed to making the investments necessary to ensure that our culture is one in which all lawyers can thrive.”

Now, one shouldn’t put too much stock in any one firm’s new partner class. It’s more important to look at the big picture, which does seem to be improving. According to a [new report](http://dfalliance.com/research/new-partner-report/) by the Diversity & Flexibility Alliance, of those lawyers promoted to partnership at 134 large U.S. law firms over the last year, [37 percent are women](http://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/859294/number-of-female-partners-in-biglaw-hits-5-year-high?nl_pk=be0f8226-d5ba-43b9-bffa-9431e90fddc5&utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=corporate).

Thirty-seven percent, well above the overall representation of women in Biglaw partnership, is nice. But you know what’s even nicer? One hundred percent. From a tipster:

Partner election night at Cravath: Mungovan, Leraris, D’Amico. All women.

Yes, that’s right. Say hello to the three new partners at the firm that once again took the #1 spot in our [ATL Power 100 Law Firm Rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/2017-power-100-law-firm-rankings/), a place you might have heard of — Cravath, Swaine & Moore:

- Margaret D’Amico: An antitrust litigator, D’Amico joined Cravath in 2008, after finishing law school at Harvard (where she also obtained her undergraduate degree).
- Rory Leraris: Also a litigator (but focused on general commercial matters), Leraris arrived at Cravath in 2008, after graduating from the University of Chicago Law School. She earned her undergraduate degree from Amherst.
- Kara Mungovan: Like D’Amico, Mungovan is a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School. She is a tax lawyer.

Margaret D’Amico

Two litigators, one tax lawyer, and six degrees from top-flight schools. The trio will join the partnership on January 1, 2017.

What’s especially noteworthy (and heartening) about this news is that the Cravath partnership is one of the most meritocratic in Biglaw. It’s a small partnership, with fewer than 100 members, and when picking partners, the firm emphasizes excellence in lawyering above all else. Unlike most firms, Cravath doesn’t pay much attention to the vicissitudes of the economic cycle or the trendiness or power of particular practice groups (which makes the absence of general corporate lawyers from this list less surprising). The Cravath partnership process is also less political than at many other places (although it’s impossible to remove politics entirely from partnership decisions).

Rory A. Leraris

This is not the first good news on gender equity to come out of Cravath this year. In July, the firm announced that M&A maven Faiza Saeed will [take over from Allen Parker as presiding partner](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/cravath-elects-its-next-presiding-partner-ma-star-faiza-saeed/) next year. As we noted at the time, “it’s fair to say that as of January, Cravath will be the most prestigious, profitable, and white-shoe firm to boast a woman leader.”

Congratulations to these three outstanding lawyers on joining one of the most exclusive clubs in the legal profession — and congratulations and thanks to Cravath for setting an excellent example for its fellow firms. May they follow Cravath’s lead on gender equality as surely as they do on [base salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) and [bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2015-associate-bonuses/).

# Biglaw Firm Cuts Retirement Matching In Effort To Avoid Layoffs
## Suspending the 401(k) matching program won't even be enough to cover the firm's losses.

It’s only Tuesday and it’s already been a really long week for the legal profession. Thus far, we’ve seen associate [layoffs and salary cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-announces-associate-layoffs-and-other-cost-cutting-measures/), partners [slowing their cash distributions](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firm-cuts-back-partner-compensation-amid-covid-19-economic-upheaval/), and firms [pausing lateral hiring](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firms-put-lateral-hiring-on-pause-due-to-coronavirus-crisis/), all because of the coronavirus crisis. Some Biglaw firms are now scrambling to do all they can to avoid cutting personnel during a health crisis.

Marshall Dennehey, an Am Law 200 firm, has announced that effective May 1, it is suspending a 4 percent employer 401(k) match until next year. The firm’s matching program has an 80 percent participation rate among its 1,200 employees, but president and CEO Mark Thompson wouldn’t disclose how much money this financial maneuver would save — just that it wouldn’t be enough.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

The [Legal Intelligencer](https://www.law.com/thelegalintelligencer/2020/03/30/in-an-effort-to-avoid-layoffs-marshall-dennehey-halts-retirement-matching/) has more on what’s going on at Marshall Dennehey:

“We’re trying to offset these losses and live up to our family values and keep everybody together. This was a measure we could take as an alternative to layoffs and pay cuts,” [Thompson] said. …

Thompson and firm leadership have deep reservations about cutting head count or salaries. While suspending 401(k) matching will not fully cover the revenue the firm anticipates it will lose, Thompson said he does not anticipate firm layoffs. He said he prides the firm on having a family environment, and he loathes the idea of a laid-off employee losing their health insurance in midst of a public health crisis.

The response from employees, Thompson said, has been overwhelmingly positive in light of the cuts that have already been announced across the industry.

“We have received expressions of gratitude,” Thompson said. “People are scared and we’re trying to give them one less thing to worry about.” He expects the matching program will return to the firm in 2021.

Let’s hope Marshall Dennehey’s plan comes to fruition and the firm can save jobs.

# Standing Against Pandemic Profiteers
## International white-shoe firms continue to push corporations toward claims that threaten to undermine the public good.

During a 1997 investor-state dispute, a Canadian attorney noted that “it wouldn’t matter if a substance was liquid plutonium destined for a child’s breakfast cereal. If the government bans a product and a U.S.-based company loses profit, the company can claim damages under NAFTA.” The corporate lawyer’s statement summarizes the power of Investment State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) systems, which allow corporations to sue governments in secretive ad hoc tribunals. How depressing that international white-shoe firms continue to push corporations toward claims that threaten to undermine the public good. With the help of their lawyers, corporations are preparing to shake down governments around the world for adopting regulatory measures addressing the health and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

For decades, economists and human rights advocates have argued against the inclusion of ISDS clauses in free-trade deals. The tribunals allow foreign companies to extract dubious lost or expected profits from governments that have promulgated regulations involving water access, land rights, and labor disputes. The governments cannot exert their own claims to fight violations by corporations because the tribunals create one-way rights. Moreover, the ISDS system has often exposed weaker economies to the greed of investors involved in third-party litigation funding. No wonder that a [former European Union trade commissioner](https://www.politico.eu/article/isds-the-most-toxic-acronym-in-europe/) once declared ISDS as the “most toxic acronym in Europe.”

The efforts to reform investor-state legal mechanisms are too slow. As the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment (CCSI) [argued](http://ccsi.columbia.edu/2020/05/05/isds-moratorium-during-covid-19/) in May, we need an immediate moratorium on all ISDS claims during the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath. As autumn approaches, there is no doubt that governments need to continue directing their capital and legal resources to the public health emergency. Law firms, however, have ignored the alarm from the CCSI and [650 other civil society groups](http://s2bnetwork.org/sign-the-pen-letter-to-governments-on-isds-and-covid-19/). For example, Ropes & Gray has been working on [pro bono](https://www.ropesgray.com/en/newsroom/news/2020/08/Project-Citizenship-and-Ropes-Gray-Ask-Federal-Court-to-Rescind-Illegal-Rule) COVID-19 matters while [alerting](https://www.ropesgray.com/en/newsroom/alerts/2020/04/COVID-19-Measures-Leveraging-Investment-Agreements-to-Protect-Foreign-Investments) paying clients to consider actions under investment treaties. As Anand Giridharadas, who critiques the way elites treat philanthropy, [has said](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/22/18634612/anand-giridharadas-billionaires-philanthropy-zuckerberg-bezos-kara-swisher-decode-podcast-interview): the arsonists are not, in fact, the best firefighters.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Professor Robert Howse at the New York University School of Law tweeted that “we need to start getting the World Bank, IMF on side to establish that debtor countries w[ith] Covid-fragile economies should NOT be paying ISDS awards.” Enforcement jurisdictions, Howse argued, need to take legal actions to bar ISDS payouts. Similarly, we need major law firms to reconsider their international practices. It is difficult to imagine that corporations would sue and expect damages from governments over COVID-19 regulations without the aggressive and nauseating marketing from firms.

As a recent law graduate, I recognize that there is a role for law students and professors to play here as well. As the pandemic disrupts the fall semester and bar examinations, the legal academic community must speak up against the egregious ISDS practices. They can refuse to let ISDS profiteers recruit on-campus during the crisis. The [Me Too-related campaign](https://www.law360.com/articles/1027761/skadden-cites-metoo-in-nixing-forced-arbitration) that started on law school campuses to end the use of mandatory arbitration clauses at Orrick, Skadden, and other firms also serves as a practice guide for how law students can monitor corporate behavior.

As we reach almost 1 million deaths worldwide and 30 million COVID-19 cases, we cannot afford to let corporate lawyers weaken public health efforts. How lawyers shape their international practices over the next few weeks matters.

# Starting Your Law Career Remotely? Bridge-The-Gap Training Can Help

Finding your bearings as a newly minted attorney is always challenging – and even more so during an unprecedented pandemic year. While newbies aren’t expected to be experts in all areas of law, they are expected to learn quickly, communicate effectively, and act ethically and professionally. For those working remotely, this also means learning the ropes and building relationships on a screen instead of in person.

All of this makes 2021 a particularly essential time for Bridge-the-Gap (BTG) training. Practising Law Institute (PLI) is presenting its BTG programs through two live webcasts, each focusing on ethics and skills for newly admitted New York attorneys. These programs cover topics relevant to all practice areas and settings, helping new practitioners recognize tricky ethical situations, sharpen their communications, practice negotiations, develop confidence in their pro bono toolkit, and more. Speakers include an array of established experts, including law firm partners and others from private practice, legal services organizations, in-house, executive consulting, and the bench.

Stephanie Figueroa, Program Attorney for the first half of the BTG series, [Bridge-the-Gap I: Ethics and Skills for Newly Admitted New York Attorneys](http://bit.ly/2LULOtE), uses the word “grounded” to describe PLI’s approach to developing these programs. “It comes from conscientiously and seriously thinking about newly admitted attorneys and the tasks and issues they face. What do I wish someone had taken the time to explain when I was in their shoes? What lessons did I learn the hard way that could have been avoided? We aim to make sure that the advice and guidance given is pertinent and truly useful to someone beginning their legal career.”

Communication skills can be the most challenging to bridge between the theory of law school and the practice of law. “Whether it’s learning how to negotiate with someone whose natural personality is unlike your own, or discussing difficult questions with your supervising attorney or case matter team, knowing the best way to communicate and how to handle delicate situations don’t necessarily get discussed in law school,” Figueroa notes. With an understanding that all professionals can use pointers and practice to communicate more effectively, the BTG programs emphasize “common real-world scenarios and tough situations all attorneys find themselves in at one point in time or another,” she says.

A related topic of great concern for new attorneys is how to ensure their social media presence is compatible with their ethical obligations. Jesse Sands, Program Attorney for the second half of the series, [Bridge-the-Gap II: Ethics and Skills for Newly Admitted New York Attorneys](http://bit.ly/39Ajxku), notes that “there is a natural tension between junior attorneys’ need to establish their professional brand and reputation and the sometimes-opaque ethical rules around client confidentiality, communications with represented parties, and avoiding inadvertently providing legal advice.” Promoting yourself – or even just having a normal online social life – while avoiding those ethical pitfalls “is not something that is usually covered in law school but can be the easiest ethical trap for a new attorney to fall into,” Sands adds.

Recognizing these unprecedented times, PLI also makes sure to address issues of concern for new lawyers during the “new normal” of remote work. “In BTG I, we dedicate over two hours to the ethics segment, during which the panelists will discuss the nuances of being conscientious of where you are working remotely in terms of whether you are admitted to practice law,” Figueroa says, as well as a general discussion of how to be mindful of attorney-client privilege when working remotely.

Similarly, in BTG II “our pro bono skills session includes practical advice on tackling the unique challenges of remotely representing low-income clients,” Sands says, “and our interpersonal communications segment addresses the novel challenge of how to build productive relationships with supervising attorneys in a remote environment.”

All of this might seem like a lot to take in, but Figueroa offers some key words of wisdom: “First, even the simplest tasks can become complicated if they’re done carelessly. Always reach out to a senior attorney when you have a question or need help. Finally, always remember that you’re not alone in your situation – all lawyers were newly admitted at one point! – and there are answers available to you.”

[](http://bit.ly/35Ls3ff)Practising Law Institute is a nonprofit learning organization dedicated to keeping attorneys and other professionals at the forefront of knowledge and expertise. PLI is chartered by the Regents of the University of the State of New York and was founded in 1933 by Harold P. Seligson. The organization provides the highest quality, accredited, continuing legal and professional education programs in a variety of formats which are delivered by more than 4,000 volunteer faculty including prominent lawyers, judges, investment bankers, accountants, corporate counsel, and U.S. and international government regulators. PLI publishes a comprehensive library of Treatises, Course Handbooks, Answer Books and Journals also available through the PLI PLUS online platform. The essence of PLI’s mission is its commitment to the pro bono community. View PLI’s upcoming live webcasts [here](http://bit.ly/35Ls3ff).

# Lawyers With Side Hustles Are Becoming More Commonplace In Biglaw
## How do they even find the time? Maybe hybrid work has helped.

Now you can work at Baker and be a baker, all at the same time!

A Biglaw job comes with Biglaw hours, but more and more lawyers are somehow finding the time to dabble in alternative careers on the side.

Have you been moonlighting as a comedian? Are you an LSAT tutor in your free time? Did you start a side gig making charcuterie boards? You are not alone — in fact, the number of attorneys with side hustles has recently risen to “astonishing” levels.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
According to a recent study from Bankrate, side hustles have become a “growing feature” of the modern workforce. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/09/27/with-flexibility-and-changing-norms-side-hustles-may-be-on-the-rise-in-big-law/) had additional details on this new trend:

The Bankrate report, which featured a YouGov poll of more than 2,500 U.S. adults—nearly 1,000 of whom claimed a “side hustle”—found 53% of Gen-Z respondents and 50% of millennial respondents earned extra cash apart from their main source of income. The numbers were 24% for baby boomers and 40% for Gen-X.

That’s also led, or at least coincided, with a shift in the mentality at big firms, away from a norm in which every last minute is devoted to clients, said [Daniel Farris, partner-in-charge of the Chicago office of Norton Rose Fulbright].

“My view is we’re beyond the days of, ‘Alright, you’re doing a two-or-three martini lunch and golfing with your clients,’ and whatever. And that actually creates time that maybe people didn’t have,” he said.

Farris himself has a side gig of sorts: as noted by Am Law, he co-founded NMBL Technologies, the company behind the legal workflow management tool Proxy. “In a considerable way,” he said, “there are more and more lawyers who are looking to have a side-hustle.”

Perhaps the option to work from home during the pandemic allowed lawyers to be more creative with their time. John McBride, a litigation partner in the IP disputes group at Norton Rose, has his own side business (he co-founded a cocktail bitters company called Devil’s Retort), and attributes lawyers’ newfound creativity to the ability to work remotely.

He said he’s still a lawyer first and foremost, and puts client and firm needs first. But “I don’t think anyone necessarily wants to be limited to their professional job description,” he said. “It may be that with flexible work arrangements, work-from-home and the like, it may be a little easier to pursue these side projects when you have a more flexible work environment.”

# Toddler Tantrums No Match For Mom On Mission To Make Partner During Pandemic
## She says her colleagues were kind and supportive -- and no one seemed to mind when her toddler was laughing in the background.

In March 2020, I found myself locked inside a tiny bathroom, participating on an important conference call while my toddler banged frantically on the other side of the door. As I tried to time my participation—including careful use of the “unmute” button—opposite his interruptions, it began to set in just how challenging trying to make partner while working remotely would be.

I was suddenly responsible for so many tasks I’d previously had more help with, including daytime childcare, cooking, and cleaning. If someone had told me then that I’d succeed in making partner at the end of the year, I would have laughed.

Which 5-star restaurant should I try for lunch today… it’s so hard to summer.

Graduations are behind us, and it’s now time for legions of 2Ls (mostly) to descend upon law firms around the country to garner valuable work experience, lifelong memories, and wads of cash for attending free lunches. Hopefully, along the way, [someone will do something embarrassing](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/can-a-summer-associate-please-blow-a-goat-or-something/) and we can all have a good laugh about it.

But what are summers planning to do with their newfound largesse? We’re putting together a “Welcome To Summering” guide with cool products, events, or excursions for summers, like a [membership to a private jet club to the Hamptons](https://blade.flyblade.com/p/blade-gx-under-28) or something, and want your input. If there’s a good deal to be had, even better! It doesn’t matter how much it costs, just that it’s something a summer should do to earn the envy of their friends back at school. If you want to [tour spooky catacombs in New York](https://www.timeout.com/newyork/things-to-do/catacombs-by-candlelight-tour), that’s a cool idea too. And if you’re no longer a summer, but have a good idea based on your experience, let us know.

So no matter where you’re working this summer, let us know what you want to drop that summer cash on. It should go without saying, but, obviously, we’ll do this anonymously so no one knows you started your professional career tipping off Above the Law.

Just [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Summer%20Guide) (subject line: “Summer Guide”) or hit us up with a text (646-820-8477).

# Meet The New Document-Comparison Solution Lawyers Are Switching To
## Draftable Legal delivers an accurate, efficient, and reliable document comparison solution for legal teams.

Productivity throughout the legal industry requires reliable document-comparison software, but recent industry consolidation has reduced the options that law firms now have.

Fewer options have forced law firms around the world to reluctantly settle for existing solutions at inflated prices. But these struggles also sparked an opportunity.

Draftable, a global document-comparison provider, announced during ILTACon in August 2023 the release of [Draftable Legal](https://www.draftable.com/draftable-legal?utm_source=above-the-law&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign=article) – a brand-new document-comparison solution made specifically for legal professionals.

The result: Law firms now have a viable alternative for their document comparison software needs.

That’s because Draftable Legal was specially designed to fill in gaps and save legal professionals time.

Commenting on the launch, Brendan McGreevy, Commercial Director at Draftable, added, “We started seeing more lawyers reaching out to us, citing three key changes in the document comparison market: sharply rising prices, eroding customer support, and dwindling product choices.

“While the legal sector has always had high demand for our general-purpose document comparison software, we weren’t always able to meet lawyers’ unique needs. So we’ve spent the past two years developing Draftable Legal directly with lawyers; and we’re thrilled to have crossed the finishing line – or the starting line, depending on how you look at it.

“The response to our launch has been overwhelmingly positive, especially with the imminent termination of Workshare and DocsCorp support!”

Draftable’s original side-by-side comparison solution gained popularity over the past decade with more than 750 global brands, notably in the finance, tech, and insurance sectors. But it wasn’t entirely suitable for the unique needs of most law firms. Recognizing this gap, the Draftable team took action.

Draftable Legal was specifically created so that lawyers, paralegals, and other legal staff can effortlessly compare and highlight key differences between multiple versions of documents. The software also boasts seamless integration with Legal Document Management Systems like iManage. The software is powered by a proprietary comparison algorithm which generates highly accurate comparisons.

[Draftable](https://www.draftable.com/?utm_source=above-the-law&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign=article) happily serves a global clientele with a team spread across various continents and time zones, ensuring round-the-clock support, right from its headquarters in Melbourne, Australia.

Former Banking and Finance solicitor Yulia Gosper, one of Draftable Legal’s original testers, actually left her role at Herbert Smith Freehills, an international law firm, to join Draftable as a Product Specialist. Gosper went on to say: “During my time at the law firm, I’d go through loads of documents and see so many ways to boost efficiency. Draftable turned those opportunities into reality.

“Honestly, the caliber of Draftable’s team drew me in because many came from a professional-services background, making them empathetic to challenges faced by busy professionals like lawyers. I’ve seen the Draftable team repeatedly go to great lengths to understand and solve workflow-related problems experienced by our clients.”

Another recent addition to the Draftable team is Bob Moore, a legal-technology sales veteran, former VP Sales Americas at DocsCorp (provider of the CompareDocs software and acquired by Litera in 2021) and Regional Account Executive at Workshare (acquired by Litera in 2019).

When asked about joining Draftable, Moore said, “The decision was easy. I’d been part of a successful run with DocsCorp, another Aussie-run legal document-comparison company. But after seeing Draftable’s innovative product and getting to know their dynamic team, I immediately knew how successful the product was going to be, so I wanted in!”

Lauding the new additions to the team, Ben Toner, Co-founder and Chief Scientist of Draftable, stated: “We’re extremely lucky to have Bob and Yulia onboard. Their deep-rooted legal tech experience and understanding of what law firms require in software is invaluable.”

Even for lawyers who have largely made the switch back to the office, remote work elements remain a part of their tech stack.

Here, we visit Michelle Browning Coughlin, the GC and VP of legal affairs at the advertising technology company El Toro, who discusses her remote and on-site setups.

Our “Real Property” series includes the distractions, hobbies, and other activities that make up today’s workplace, to benchmark your own setup while gathering a few tips from your peers.

Want to share how you’ve adapted? [Click here to participate](https://breakingmedia.wufoo.com/forms/xiuybj21a48c2w/).

Describe your office decor in one sentence.

Casual and warm, welcoming, with exposed brick, hanging ivy, cute lights, and fun(ny) artwork. (My favorite is a framed quote that says, “Relax. We’re all crazy. It’s not a competition.”)

What office equipment do you use to complete your day-to-day work

Laptop, wireless mouse, [iPad](https://rstyle.me/+-97B6sBwDBUrGjAQLEynZw) with [Apple pencil](https://rstyle.me/+Xkc-BfAFBmf3EzCaJCskZA), cell phone, office chair, desk … Basic stuff! One really important thing for me — an ergonomic keyboard. I type so much that I started getting some carpal tunnel symptoms, but the [ergonomic keyboard](https://amzn.to/3fsDVI8) made a huge difference. Recently I started using the Apple pencil and I love it for taking notes in meetings and commenting on contracts. I also have to have my [wireless mouse —](https://amzn.to/3lx2WFU) I hate the built in tracker pad on laptops.

What key pieces of office furniture do you use?

Obviously a comfortable supportive office chair is important, but I spend a ton of time walking around the office and in meetings, so comfortable shoes are just as important!



What work adjacent equipment helps?

Not exactly work adjacent, but having duplicate work setups at home and in the office is super helpful. My other important work adjacent equipment is a selection of fun or inspirational coffee mugs — my latest is an RBG mug.

Any videoconference fashion must-haves?

I will admit that one of my favorite “fashion” must-haves is the “Touch Up My Appearance” feature in Zoom. Otherwise, my must-haves are just good lighting and proper camera angles. What you’re wearing is less important than proper camera placement and lighting.

I have definitely added a few new pairs of really cool earrings to my wardrobe, since that’s the jewelry that is actually visible in a videoconference.

What are your biggest meeting-bomb risks?

It used to be my husband walking behind me cleaning something … But now that I’m mostly back to working in the office, it is one of my colleague’s adorable dog (our office allows people to bring their dogs to work — so cool.)

What is your go-to publication or website for taking a breather?

What are your favorite physical books in your background (or nearby)

Books focused on gender equity and strong women leaders (I love “[Unfinished Business](https://amzn.to/3xlt7BC)” by Anne Marie Slaughter and “[That’s What She Said](https://amzn.to/3ipL1yQ)” by Joanne Lipman), books about intellectual property, Simon Sinek’s “[The Infinite Game](https://amzn.to/37p9CNO),” and the children’s book I wrote called [“My Mom, the Lawyer.”](https://www.mothersesquire.com/buyourbook)

# Reed Smith Partners Taking Another COVID-19 Financial Hit
## Austerity measures continue at this Biglaw firm.

Reed Smith was early to the COVID-19 austerity measures party.[ Back in March](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firm-cuts-back-partner-compensation-amid-covid-19-economic-upheaval/?rf=1) (damn, that seems like 12 years ago), the firm announced that they were slowing partner cash distributions, emphasizing that business is good, but made the move as a “precaution” and “bracing for the short-term and potential long-term economic impacts of COVID-19.”

Well, it’s nearly a month later and the firm is making even more changes to partner compensation. After [previously announcing](https://www.law.com/international-edition/2020/04/16/reed-smith-defers-bonuses-as-withers-weightmans-furlough-staff/) that staff discretionary bonuses would be postponed due to the coronavirus — a firm spokesperson said about that measure, “We can confirm that we are deferring decisions on discretionary bonus payments for our professional staff globally. Putting these compensation changes into effect is prudent as we continue to plan for the months ahead and the pandemic’s impact on our business” — partner bonuses are, at least in part, [being deferred](https://www.law.com/international-edition/2020/04/24/shearman-offers-sabbaticals-on-30-pay-while-reed-smith-takes-more-measures/).

The firm’s equity partners’ bonuses will be split into two payments, with the first half coming on the scheduled payment date, and the balance will come three months later. The good news is that income partners, counsel, and associates will still see their full bonuses as scheduled.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
A Reed Smith spokesperson said about the latest austerity measure:

“Fixed share partner, counsel and associate bonuses will be paid in full and on their regularly scheduled pay dates. Equity partners have agreed to receive half of their bonus amounts on the regularly scheduled payment date and the remaining half three months later.”

Before the Magic Circle, the elite UK legal landscape was a whole lot shadier. Back then, what moniker was used to describe Allen & Overy, Clifford Chance, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, Herbert Smith, Linklaters, Lovells, Norton Rose, Slaughter and May, and Stephenson Harwood?

Hint: The name wasn’t the only suspicious thing either. The firms had an agreement not to poach from each other.

# There's A Big Difference Between Lawyer Accolades You Pay For And Ones You Don't
## And state bars need to be careful that this line isn't blurred.

Congratulations to the 2023 UberMegaEsquires out there! Quite the honor, to be sure. To earn this award you had to rise to the top of your practice… and have your check clear. Not necessarily in that order.

Attorney awards can get a little sticky. For every organization with a solid reputation for keeping its assessment untainted by its business interests, there are others that bestow titles that raise eyebrows. State bars recognize this too, and many have promulgated rules over the past several years casting ethical judgment on attorneys advertising their services off the strength of questionable honorifics.

But these regulations introduce a whole new set of problems when they chill the celebration of deserved recognition, a development with uniquely negative repercussions for attorneys of color. Because in an industry that relies heavily on networking and connections, when attorneys without those privileges can’t tout their earned awards, it strips them of a critical avenue for distinguishing themselves to potential clients.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
[Lawyers of Color](https://lawyersofcolor.org/) president Yolanda Young explained:

Evaluating legal skills is a highly subjective endeavor, one that has been shown to be biased against [Black](https://www.findlaw.com/legalblogs/greedy-associates/confirmation-bias-against-black-associates-shown-in-memo-study/), [Asian American](https://www.winston.com/en/thought-leadership/the-broken-model-confronting-anti-asian-bias-in-the-legal-profession.html), and other lawyers of color. It is a bias that has caused an [exodus](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/law-firms-struggle-to-hire-and-keep-black-women) of minorities from the profession. Even as law school classes are increasingly diverse, with people of color making up about [35%](https://www.lsac.org/blog/incoming-class-2021-most-diverse-law-school-class-history) of the 2021 entering law school class, they comprise only [14.1%](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/young_lawyers/projects/men-of-color/lawyer-demographics/) of all lawyers. Much lower percentages ever receive honors and accolades. Indeed, Lawyers of Color began bestowing such recognitions only after years of reporting on the underrepresentation of minorities receiving them. Their omissions weren’t due to a lack of credentials or accomplishments, but from the legal profession’s well-documented [biases](https://www.americanbar.org/news/abanews/aba-news-archives/2018/09/new-study-finds-gender-and-racial-bias-endemic-in-legal-professi1/).

Lawyers of Color bestows a number of [honors](https://lawyersofcolor.org/publications-2/), but the most relevant ones for this discussion are its nomination lists, which include [Nation’s Best](https://lawyersofcolor.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nations-Best-web.pdf), [Top Black Congressional Staffers & Lobbyists](https://lawyersofcolor.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/CAUCUS-ISSUE-2022-digital-v1.pdf), and the [Hot List](https://lawyersofcolor.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Hot-List-2022-Digital_web-Edition-v1.pdf). All of these lists comply with the various state ethical opinions regulating attorney advertising based on lists and accolades. Young noted that the methodology behind each honor is transparent and exceeds state bar requirements, with “independent vetting review before concluding with a rigorous inquiry into attorney fitness.” Not only does the organization keep the duty of evaluating nominees separate from the fundraising side, Young informed me that, “95 percent of our honorees and their organizations have never purchased an ad or provided any other form of support.”

But a recognition is only as valuable as it is… recognized. When regulators pump out rules that leave lawyers unsure about publicizing their inclusion, it blunts the value of the honor.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
We continue to do this work because we believe such recognitions will maintain and increase diversity within the legal profession, which is imperative. The organizations that support us share this conviction. While state bars should require the utmost ethical standards for honors, they should take care to ensure there is no unintended and disproportionate impact on lawyers of color.

Lawyers embrace the maxim that it’s best to avoid the mere appearance of impropriety. Well, [except for the Supreme Court](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/clarence-thomas-is-taking-full-advantage-of-the-supreme-courts-lack-of-rules/). But generally attorneys err on the side of caution and state bars prefer to let lawyers embrace this tendency. It’s easier to keep everyone wary.

Yet, this impulse fails the profession when ethical standards impose a disparate impact on minority attorneys. When lawyers of color are left doubting if they should mention legitimate honors, it’s no longer about erring on the side of caution, it’s disadvantaging another legal professional.

It’s all well and good to stay silent on some of these rules, but this is one instance where state bars need to be proactive to make sure everyone knows exactly what is and is not allowed.

# Biglaw Partner Out Of A Job After Video Of Office Canoodling Makes The Rounds

A video clip of a Biglaw partner’s indiscretions with a colleague have gone viral. An unnamed Allen & Overy partner was caught on camera through the large glass windows of the firm’s London office in an amorous embrace — which the firm is characterizing as “inappropriate workplace conduct.” Which… points for the understatement.

The video has been making the rounds on WhatsApp, and Jamie Hamilton at[ RollOnFriday details](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-alan-all-over-me-ao-partner-quits-after-office-kneetrembler-goes-public) the footage — which was reportedly filmed months ago by a pedestrian walking through Spitalfields Market by the A&O office:

The camera zooms in to show a younger woman embracing the older, white-haired partner, who, in broad daylight, in a glass-fronted office, which opens onto a London market, proceeds to merrily move through the bases while rubbing against her.

“Oh. My. God”, remarks the cameraman, who spared audiences the worst of it by slapping a Parental Advisory sticker over the cursed footage before releasing it online. “Watch his hands, look at his hands”, mutters his companion.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The clip sports a joking parental advisory label and the caption :

UGHHH! SOMEONE IS STAYING LATE AT THE OFFICE ???? ???? ????

Now that unnamed partner is out of a job, as RollOn Friday says, he was “permitted to resign”:

But the cost has been high for the partner, who was not supposed to be in the office at the time, and was definitely not supposed to be in the office breaching social distancing guidelines by fumbling at a youngster, and was absolutely not meant to do it all on Instagram.

Once news of his indiscretion reached the wider partnership, he was permitted to resign.

A spokesperson for Allen & Overy provided the following comment about the incident:

“The video depicts inappropriate workplace conduct which is not in line with our Code of Conduct. The matter has been investigated and addressed in line with the firm’s internal processes.”

Hopefully the lawyer will learn what is and is not acceptable at work… and that you can, in fact, see through glass.

# My Thanksgiving Objection
## It’s easy to focus on things going wrong. It’s much harder to realize that things are going right.

I have an objection to Thanksgiving.

My beef with Thanksgiving (pun intended) isn’t about the holiday itself or its traditions. Heck, I love the delicious jellied cranberry insanity that slides out of a can, the cross-marketing advertising blitz that is the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, and Grandma’s green bean casserole as much as anyone does. It all warms my heart and makes me smile.

Making Every Day A Holiday

My objection is more abstract. My problem — or fear — is that Thanksgiving has the potential to interfere with giving thanks for what we have in our lives on other days. If we focus too much on a single event, what do we do the 364 other days of the year? Having a dedicated Thanksgiving Day lets us say to ourselves, hey, we got the family together, we ate the turkey, we gave thanks. Now let’s forget about all that gratefulness for a year and get back to complaining.

Lawyers in particular love to complain. We’re literally trained to pick things apart, find flaws, and attack our adversaries, so it’s no surprise we do the same when it comes to our personal lives. Think about all of the breath and effort we spend whining about the long hours we work to earn our six- or seven-figure paychecks, or commiserating over which firm is offering more over-the-top perks than ours. We skip right past all the good things we have and hone in like a laser on the things we wish were better.

So what do we do about this? I’d challenge you this year, dear reader, to make this Thanksgiving less of a speed bump and more of a springboard toward a greater daily appreciation for all the good things you have in your life. As lawyers, we have plenty to be grateful for, and much of what’s great about our profession is as great every other month of the year as it is in November. There’s no need to time-bound our appreciation for the benefits of our way of life.

Despite the endless lawyer jokes, we remain in an overall respected profession that’s well-compensated. Each of us by default is in possession of a deeply flexible mental tool kit. We are problem solvers by nature and by training, skills that lend themselves to most situations and needs. The continued march of automation that is likely to devastate so many job spaces in the coming decade will probably not have the same, far-reaching consequences for us. Being a lawyer has its stresses and pitfalls, but if you want to have control over your world and your career, there are few better places to start than being an attorney.

I’d wager that remembering how good we have it and carrying it with us in our everyday lives would be of great benefit to most of us.

 The Special Moments

Confining our giving of thanks to Thanksgiving also risks us failing to savor those special moments in our lives. Sometimes good things happen that are big or obvious, and easy to enjoy in the moment. You land a big client or make partner. Your toddler finishes potty training. You achieve some new personal best on Peloton.

But the truly special periods of our lives can be even more subtle. Sometimes the best times of our lives are the periods when there’s just nothing major that’s wrong or stressful. Maybe most of your clients are paying their bills, you’re really into one of your cases, and you don’t have an opposing counsel going after your head. At home, maybe it’s the kids and pets haven’t needed doctor’s appointments in weeks, nothing’s broken or needing replacement, and you and your partner have found time to reconnect. Those little rare periods of peaceful bliss can be some of the happiest of our lives, while also being the hardest to recognize until they’re gone.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It’s easy to see and focus on when things go wrong. But it can be very, very hard to realize that everything’s going generally right.

Special times like this are usually transitory. They might last an evening, or a week, or a few months, and then some new major life challenge appears that sucks up our bandwidth and mental health. Most of those special times aren’t going to happen on the fourth Thursday in November. If we’re only looking for them on Thanksgiving, we’re going to miss them.

Enjoy But Don’t Forget

Please don’t take this the wrong way. Enjoy your Thanksgiving. Gather together, eat some turkey, open some vino, watch the game, and avoid talking politics. Take some time to savor a special time of the year.

But when the long weekend is over, don’t tuck those feelings of gratitude away until next November and wind yourself up to start complaining. Carry that spirit of thankfulness forward and try to recognize the good in your everyday life. Enjoy those special moments while you’re living them, and the memory will be all the sweeter.

This year was an excellent year to be a summer associate. In early June, Cravath raised associate starting salaries to [$180,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/), and Paul Weiss [applied the raise](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/ny-to-180k-the-raises-spread-to-summer-associates/) to summer associates. In short order, many other firms followed, paying their summers around $3,500 a week for the privilege of going to lunches at nice restaurants and otherwise having fun. (For the full tally of firms paying summer associates at the new going rate, see our [Biglaw salary scorecard](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises/).)

Did Biglaw firms scale back on summer events to cover the pay raises? Anecdotal evidence suggests they did not. As far as we can tell, summer programs at law firms were just as much fun as they’ve always been.

But let’s hear from you, our readers, to get the inside scoop. It’s time for Above the Law’s annual [summer associate event contest](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/best-summer-associate-event-contest/).

Last year, Quinn Emanuel trounced the competition by taking summer associates on an all-expenses-paid [trip to Italy](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/best-summer-associate-event-contest-2015-the-winner/). But now that Quinn has [scaled back its summer program](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/biglaw-firm-decimates-summer-associate-program/) in favor of recruiting 3Ls and law clerks — which it woos with signing bonuses of [$35,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/biglaw-firm-offering-signing-bonus-for-3ls/) and [$75,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/clerkship-bonus-watch-will-75k-become-the-new-standard/), respectively — there’s an opening for another firm to take the crown.

So which law firm put on the best summer associate event of 2016? Please send your nominations to us [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Summer%20Associate%20Event%20Contest) (subject line: “Summer Associate Event Contest”) or by text message (646-820-8477, including the words “Summer Associate Event Contest” somewhere in your text).

We keep our tipsters anonymous. We’ll collect the best entries, let you vote on them in a reader poll, and then crown the best summer associate event of 2016. We look forward to reading all of your submissions!

Paul Weiss, you can’t hide. We can see your greedy side.

As long as you work for Exxon, we won’t work for you.

— students at Yale Law School yelled these chants [during a Paul Weiss boycott outside the firm’s first-year recruitment reception](https://biglawbusiness.com/exxon-climate-law-firm-paul-weiss-target-of-protest-at-yale) at the elite school yesterday. Students are targeting Paul Weiss for its representation of ExxonMobil, claiming that the firm has aided the oil and gas company in “decades of disinformation to obstruct climate action.” Last month, students at [Harvard Law protested at a Paul Weiss recruitment event](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/01/harvard-law-school-students-protest-paul-weiss-recruiting-event/), demanding that the firm drop Exxon as a client.

# Charlie Gard: The General Election Isn't The Only Important Decision On June 8

“[T]he power of the lawyer is in the uncertainty of the law.”
— Jeremy Bentham

Charlie Gard is ten months old and currently staying at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London (GOSH), where he has been for the last seven months. He has an extremely rare genetic condition known as mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDS), and he is one of only sixteen known cases in the World. In simple terms, MDS causes progressive muscle weakness, and in Charlie it has also caused structural brain damage.

Tragically, Charlie was born a healthy baby in August last year, and it was only after eight weeks that his parents took him to hospital to discover his condition. Since then his parents, Chris Gard and Connie Yates, have fought tirelessly to find a way to help their beautiful son. Their research presented a ray of hope when they came across a doctor based in the United States who provides nucleoside bypass therapy, an oral medication that can improve but not cure the condition. Charlie’s parents’ crowd-funded the $1.5 million needed to pay for the treatment for Charlie, but they have been blocked by GOSH from taking him to the United States. An agonising court process has ensued during which GOSH applied for permission to the High Court to switch off Charlie’s life support and allow him to die. Both the High Court and subsequently the Court of Appeal in the UK ruled in favour of GOSH, accepting the hospital’s assertion that the treatment is not in Charlie’s “best interests”.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
So on June 8th, three Supreme Court judges will determine whether Charlie’s case can receive a full Supreme Court hearing. The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal in the UK, and Charlie’s last chance in the legal battle.

The rarity of Charlie’s condition means the treatment is experimental, and it is not certain whether it will have any positive impact. The US doctor offering the treatment openly says that it would be uncharted territory and that Charlie’s case is severe. There are no false promises, nor are any miracles expected. Charlie’s parents acknowledge that their son won’t be cured, but they do not accept that he is beyond hope of improvement in some form, and there are documented cases of other children having received the treatment and having made improvement. Notably, Connie Yates is a carer for adults with learning difficulties and is more than qualified to understand what hurdles may lay ahead if her son has the chance of a life with disabilities.

I suspect for US readers of this article, the concept of parents being blocked by the State from taking their son to access medical treatment for which they can afford independently is unimaginable, unthinkable, cruel and unjust. As a parent of two children myself, there is a deep rooted ethical sense that the UK establishment is failing Charlie Gard. In the UK it is not uncommon for experts in a case like Charlie’s to have their identities protected. Those anonymous experts will not have spent hours, day’s weeks and months at Charlie’s bedside monitoring his every moment as his parents have done. They won’t have witnessed what he is and isn’t capable of. In Charlie Gard’s case, the true experts are his parents.

It echoes the case of Ashya King who, in 2014, aged five, had a brain tumour. His parents disagreed with the Southampton General Hospital on the most appropriate form of treatment for Ashya and wanted to have him treated with proton therapy, which they felt was less invasive than radiotherapy. Proton therapy was not available in the UK, although in some cases the National Health Service had funded the treatment abroad. In Aysha’s case, he was denied the right to travel to receive the therapy, and accusations were levelled at Aysha’s parents by the hospital that they were jeopardising his life expectancy by denying their child the treatment being offered in the UK. Aysha’s parents fled with Aysha to Spain, where they were subsequently arrested and put in prison. However, the UK prosecutors withdrew their arrest warrant shortly thereafter, and Aysha travelled to Prague’s Proton Therapy Center, where he received proton beam therapy. Three years later, Aysha is leading a cancer-free life in Spain. Naturally his parents are wary of returning to the UK, where they are sceptical of the institutional powers.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
In a testament to Aysha’s case, it was announced last month that the UK has just received its first proton beam therapy machine, which will be installed in a cancer treatment center in Wales. New research on proton beam therapy originating from a study at Massachusetts General Hospital demonstrates that it generates fewer side effects to the heart and lungs, carries less risk of secondary cancers, and reduces hearing loss and cognitive impairment factors.

Aysha’s parents made a decision in the best interests of their son and, despite medical megalomania, their son is now alive and healthy.

In English law, each case will be decided on its own set of facts, from the assumed point of view of the patient and their best interests. Charlie Gard’s case appears to raise fundamental questions about what “best interests” means when applied to rebut a presumption of a right to life. Case law indicates that an assessment of whether the patient’s life would be intolerable should not be dismissed as a factor in balancing best interests. Is the court certain Charlie’s life would be intolerable? Charlie’s parents are not convinced it would be. If, at law, Charlie’s interests are of paramount concern, that does not mean that the standpoint of a reasonable and responsible parent who has their child’s best interest at heart ought not to be given weight (Balcombe LJ in Re J [1993] Fam 33 at 52B-C). Chris Gard and Connie Yates appear to be exceptionally reasonable and responsible people who just want to give their little boy a chance of a life with the possibility of an improved existence to his current state.

Charlie Gard’s parents will await the decision on June 8th as to whether they may continue to fight against their treasured little boy’s state-ordered death sentence. They rest their final glimmer of hope for Charlie’s life on the eminent Richard Gordon QC and three Supreme Court judges.

To Chris and Connie – never lose hope.
To London and Manchester – we will never be defeated by terror.

Listen, I get it. The end of the year is a crappy time to be at work. The sun sets at 4:30, you’re expected to make nice at professional holiday functions, you’re stressed about hitting your billing target for the year, and the powers that be at your firm haven’t even disclosed the bonus scale. That blows.

Finding out how much you’ll be getting as a bonus for all your hard work this year is a bright spot of life in Biglaw — it makes you feel like all the billable hours were really worth it. So, with [market bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/breaking-cravath-announces-annual-bonuses/) topping out at the same levels as last year, why hasn’t your firm announced?

Sorry friend, I don’t have an easy answer to that question. I’m sure bonus announcements at most Biglaw firms are in the works, but as to exactly when they’ll be released… who knows?

- Take advantage of the fact [Cyber Monday has morphed into Cyber Week](https://www.amazon.com/Cyber-Monday/b) and [shop (online)](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/celebrate-hanukkah-with-these-8-ruth-bader-ginsburg-inspired-presents/) till you drop.
- Catch up on your [CLEs](https://abovethelaw.com/lawline-cle/category/free-cle-of-the-month/).

And then, when you finally do get your bonus memo, be sure to share with the rest of us! Here at Above the Law we depend on YOU — our readers — to keep us (and by extension the rest of the legal world) informed about what is going on at your firm with bonuses. On the surface, it may seem the only motivation is a bit of financial-tinged gossip, but there is a value in transparency. This is why (most) firms publish the schedule of bonuses and salaries. And giving more information to the actors with the least power — in this case, the associates, particularly junior associates — lets them know the [true value of the work they do](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/associates-at-cravath-make-more-money-than-partners-a-dozen-biglaw-firms/), and helps them assess possible lateral moves.

So, do your part and let us know what’s going on with bonuses at your firm. You can [submit a tip here](https://abovethelaw.com/send-tips/?rf=1), or just email us at [tips@abovethelaw.com](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com) or send an SMS/text message to (646) 820-8477. As always, we’ll keep your name strictly confidential.

“The first and greatest victory is to conquer yourself.”
–Plato

It is marathon season in London. My absolute favourite time of year as blossom starts to appear on the trees, the mornings and evenings get gradually lighter, and runners are out everywhere.

Whilst I work with a lot of Type A people who regularly do Iron Man challenges and Marathon Des Sables, the most endearing feature of the London Marathon for me is about seeing the first-time marathon runners who have created the discipline in the months leading up to the event to be able to run as far and as fast as they need to go on the day.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
It got me thinking in the work context about the types of things that people put off doing because those challenges are out of their comfort zone. Here are a few examples:

• Public Speaking
• Using the telephone instead of email
• Asking managers for new working terms
• Appraising other team members
• Asking clients for feedback and/or recommendations
• Talking to strangers at networking events

There is a theme amongst the examples listed, which is that all of them require us to put ourselves out there with the possibility of rejection or backlash. It’s easier not to put ourselves in those situations, but having the discipline to do so could create a chain of transformational positive reactions.

What if a phone call led to a new piece of work you’d never have gotten by emailing? What if that new piece of work led to some great feedback and a recommendation? What if that recommendation led to another new piece of work? That would be two pieces of new work from one simple phone call.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
What if providing your team members with open and honest feedback led to them becoming phenomenal lawyers instead of just average?

If, like me, you are a fan of the Karate Kid films (both old and new), then it’s probably because they are stories about self-discipline, perseverance, and mental strength. Mr Miyagi tells Daniel that it is ok to lose to an opponent, but that he must not lose to fear. Fear is what we have to combat in order to enhance ourselves. There was a fantastic example of that kind of mind-over-matter mentality recently in a London boxing match between heavyweights David Haye and Tony Bellew. Haye was suffering from a leg injury, which became more apparent as the fight progressed. By round six, Haye could barely stand and was clearly in agony. Nevertheless, he carried on and the fight went eleven rounds.

How we cope with challenges and how much discipline we apply to conquering our fears will be the greatest test of what we can achieve in our careers. For that reason, it is vital to factor in our fears to our business planning and career progression. Set yourself daily, weekly and monthly targets, such as:

1) I will pick up the telephone and make 3 phone calls to clients today.
2) I will attend 2 events this month and talk to at least 6 people I have never met before.
3) Before I allow myself to submit an invoice to any client, I will ask them for their feedback.

As your discipline improves, the tasks that you set become habits, and instead of focussing on whether you will do the task at all, your focus will be on how you can improve your performance in doing the things that have become second nature to you.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
This is the cycle of self-discipline moving to self-enhancement. Admittedly, I acknowledge that there are some amazing examples of talent that hard work alone may not explain, but a larger percentage of the time perseverance plays the crucial role in what is possible. We acquire skills, and it is our determination to realise our greatest potential that is the key, not some higher ordainment of talent.

Take, for example, George Mallory, who tried several times in the 1920s to climb to the top of Mount Everest without success. Such was his determination to scale the summit that he died trying in 1924 and his body was found in 1999 just two thousand feet from the peak. The eventual successful ascenders didn’t reach the top until almost 30 years after George’s stoic final attempt.

As a woman working in or towards a leadership role in the law, discipline will become your best friend and can help you set the kinds of goals that will make you stand out from your peers. It is important not to benchmark your goals against goals of others around you as this will lead you to aiming too low. Your goals (daily, weekly, monthly and annually) have to be set sky high and you’ll have to expend mammoth amounts of energy meeting them. There is no point underestimating what it will take. You will feel tired, you will feel drained, and you will want to give up. It will be exactly like a marathon.

Just like learning to run a long distance, when you finally achieve your targets, the sense of accomplishment will be overwhelming and you’ll know how hard you’ve worked, what you’ve sacrificed, and how much discipline it has taken you to get there.

In this episode, Kathryn welcomes Elizabeth Anne “Betiayn” Tursi, Global Chair and Co-Founder of the Women in Law Empowerment Forum (WILEF). Betiayn talks about how the legal industry has evolved, particularly in respect to diversity, during the course of her career. They also discuss what led up to the founding of WILEF and the work she’s most proud of. Betiayn also shares about why WILEF decided to change the Gold Standard criteria, and the main takeaways from the most recent Gold Standard List. She gives her thoughts on the most important diversity benchmarks for the profession.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

It’s no secret that it pays to be a Biglaw equity partner. A 2022 [survey](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/insights/research/2022-partner-compensation-survey?__hstc=152106854.4231454512ac5e2691282a20eb69f349.1665426670015.1666028391511.1666096844928.6&__hssc=152106854.15.1666096844928&__hsfp=1078827124) of partners in “NLJ 350- and Global 100-size firms” found average compensation of $1.12 million, a 15% increase over the average in the prior [survey](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/knowledge-library/research/2020-partner-compensation-report) conducted in 2020.

Seven-figure compensation is nothing to sneeze at, but as with professional sports teams, the real stars of Biglaw make significantly more than the average. Firms vary widely in their compensation ranges. At the most traditional end of the spectrum, a firm’s highest-paid partner might take home 4x the pay of the lowest-paid partner. In contrast, at a firm with a strong eat-what-you-kill culture, that ratio may be 10x or higher. Bloomberg [reports](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/the-worlds-largest-law-firm-thinks-youve-got-it-all-wrong) that the top earners at Kirkland & Ellis earn more than $20 million annually. Eight-figure pay packages remain uncommon in Biglaw, but with competition for partners with the strongest books of business as intense as ever, rainmakers at an increasing number of firms are [breaching](https://www.businessinsider.com/big-law-partner-pay-gibson-dunn-10-million-kirkland-effect-2022-3) the $10 million mark.

So the top tier of law firm partners are doing very nicely, indeed. But what about the leading in-house lawyers? In this article, we take a look at the pay packages of the top 100 highest-paid General Counsels, in comparison to partners of top Biglaw firms (as measured by profits per equity partner). We find that on a cash compensation basis, equity partnership is more lucrative than being a General Counsel. But the story is more complicated when taking stock options into account.

A quick note on sources. For general counsel compensation data, we look at the top 100 highest paid GCs as listed in the 2022 ALM Intelligence GC Compensation Survey. This data set is not comprehensive. For one thing, ALM compiles its data from proxy statements filed with the SEC, so only public companies are included. Our source for Biglaw partner compensation is the 2022 edition of the Am Law 200 ranking.

It’s hard to outearn a top Biglaw partner (in cash)

The General Counsel Compensation Survey ranks General Counsels based on total cash compensation. The top 100 highest-paid GCs earned total cash compensation of $2.7 million on average. We don’t know how much the 100 best-paid Biglaw partners earned in the comparable period, but as one benchmark, the 91 equity partners at Wachtell enjoyed profits per partner of $8.4 million.

Just one General Counsel took home cash compensation higher than $8.4 million: Alan Braverman of Disney ($8.8 million). Meanwhile, 42 Am Law firms had profits per equity partner in excess of the $2.7 million average General Counsel cash compensation.

What about cash compensation growth over the recent past? From a growth perspective, who did better in the two-year period from 2020 until 2022: the top 100 General Counsels or the partnership of the top Am Law firms? The table below shows the results, ranked by growth rate. The law firms in the table were the top 10 firms by profits per equity partner in the 2020 Am Law 200. We see that all 10 Biglaw partnerships outpaced the General Counsels, some by a substantial margin.

Group (equity partnership or GCs)	Compensation growth from 2020 to 2022
Davis Polk	55%
Kirkland & Ellis	42%
Sullivan & Cromwell	37%
Simpson Thacher	35%
Wachtell	33%
Cravath	31%
Paul Weiss	31%
Skadden	30%
Weil Gotshal	29%
Quinn Emanuel	26%
Top 100 GCs	25%
But stock options can make a big difference

It’s critical to note that the very highest-earning General Counsels receive a substantial portion of their compensation in the form of equity. Taking stock options into account, some General Counsel roles start to look considerably more attractive. For example, revisiting the 2022 surveys, when considering total compensation, the number of General Counsels topping Wachtell’s profits per partner rises from one to 16. Kathryn Ruemmler (Goldman Sachs) and Kate Adams (Apple) top the list, each earning total compensation just shy of $27 million. David Sorkin (KKR) also cracked the $20 million threshold. These examples illustrate the importance of equity: Ruemmler, Adams, and Sorkin earned total cash compensation of $7.9 million, $5 million, and $5.75 million, respectively.

Conclusion

There are a lot of reasons why an attorney might prefer to be a General Counsel than a law firm partner. But viewed strictly through the lens of compensation, high-performing lawyers are typically better off staying on the law firm track. Of course, that doesn’t necessarily mean they should stick with their current firm. With Biglaw partnerships increasingly diverging in their approaches to compensation, it’s a mistake to assume that a partner with a given book of business will be paid similarly at any comparably prestigious firm. Productive partners have a variety of options—and it pays to know about them.

# Biglaw Firm Increases Associate Salaries, Goes Over The Top On Bonuses For Highest Billers
## The biggest billers at this firm will be making bank in bonus bucks. Congrats!

News of raises and bonuses has been coming in hot across the Biglaw scene ever since [Cravath announced its new compensation scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/cravath-announces-raises-comes-over-the-top-of-milbank-scale-for-some-associates/) — and while many associates are out celebrating, others are starting to get antsy playing the waiting game with their firms.

Luckily, associates at this top firm no longer need to wait.

We’ve received word that Sheppard Mullin — a firm that brought in $1,052,812,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 48 in the most recent Am Law 100 — will be matching the Cravath compensation grid, meaning these are the salaries associates at the firm will see, as of January 1, 2024:



Sheppard Mullin is also matching the Cravath bonus scale, and just like in years past, the firm is handsomely rewarding associates who went above and beyond the call of duty when it came to their billable hours. This is what year-end bonuses will look like at the firm, to be paid on January 26, 2024:



As you can see, Sheppard Mullin awards base year-end bonuses at the 2000-hour mark, and those who go over on their billing will receive even more bonus bucks. Specifically, associates who record 2200 and 2400 hours will receive 110% and 120% of the market-based bonus.

Congratulations to everyone at Sheppard Mullin!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from the firm.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of compensation updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus/Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus/Matches”).

# 'The Fastest-Growing Law Firm In The History Of The World'
## Good thing the founder isn't prone to hyperbole.

What litigation powerhouse, founded in 2017 by former Quinn Emanuel partners, calls itself the “fastest-growing law firm?”

Hint: The founder says of the firm’s growth, “We are, by orders of magnitude, I am confident in saying, the fastest-growing law firm in the history of the world in terms of law firms that have started from absolute scratch.”
He also has his eye on his former employer, “I would say within five to seven years, we’re going to replace Quinn Emanuel as the next dominant global litigation firm, no question.”

# The Biglaw Attorneys Who Won Big On Election Night

Jenny Durkan and Justin Fairfax

Tuesday was Election Day — the first since Donald Trump ascended to the presidency — and the results are widely being interpreted as a repudiation of the Trump agenda. Buried in the Democratic onslaught are the victories of two Biglaw attorneys.

[Justin Fairfax ](https://www.venable.com/justin-e-fairfax/)is counsel at Venable with a practice that focuses on investigations, white-collar defense, commercial litigation, and government affairs. And he won his bid to be the next Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, as [reported by](http://www.law.com/sites/nationallawjournal/2017/11/08/biglaw_elections/) Law.com:

With his victory on Tuesday, Fairfax became the first African-American to be elected to a statewide office in Virginia since 1989—the year L. Douglas Wilder was elected governor. And Fairfax won alongside Northam after a gubernatorial campaign that some observers described as racially tinged in the wake of the deadly white nationalist rally over the summer in Charlottesville, Virginia.

The leadership of Venable congratulated Fairfax on his important victory:

“Justin’s commitment to public service continues a long tradition of Venable’s attorneys entering politics with both major political parties,” said Dan Moylan, co-managing partner of Venable.  “We congratulate him on his election.”

The job is only part-time, with a salary of $36,000 — paltry compared to a Biglaw payday. But the position of Virginia Lieutenant Governor is generally regarded as a key stepping stone to higher office — seven of the last ten LGs went on to be governor.

[Jenny Durkin](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/durkan-jenny#page=0&byChar=D&byProfileType=&bySearch=&byOffice=&byPracticeArea=&byLawCleark=&byFSFP=&byADP=), co-managing partner of Quinn Emanuel’s Seattle office and global chair of its cybersecurity and data protection group, also saw a victory Tuesday. After a sexual abuse scandal rocked the then-mayor Ed Murray’s tenure leading to his resignation, Durkin threw her hat into the mayoral ring.

Durkin, the former U.S. attorney for the Western District of Washington and the first openly gay attorney to serve in a top prosecutor role, took a leave of absence from Quinn to launch her campaign. She will be Settle’s first female mayor since the 1920s.

Congratulations to both Fairfax and Durkin on their impressive victories.

As more millennials join the partnership ranks, we want to know how unique — or not — the generation’s outlook on law firm life truly is.

Do shared generational attitudes transcend the partner-associate divide? What impact, if any, is that having on law firm policies?

In[ the final installment](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0pmAXno26be0r7o) in this year’s series of surveys conducted in partnership with our friends at Major, Lindsey & Africa, we’d like your views on such topics as compensation practices, associate workloads, bias in the legal industry, and firm leadership. 

Please take a few minutes to [share your thoughts here](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0pmAXno26be0r7o). As always, the survey is completely anonymous. (And please note we are not only interested in hearing from millennials; lawyers of all ages are encouraged to take the survey!)

If you have not yet completed the other two installments in this series, please take a few minutes to do so:

# Beyond Biglaw: Cooking Up Career Insights
## Three pieces of career advice from chef David Chang that apply to lawyers.

There is an entire industry built on giving lawyers advice on all aspects of legal practice. Some, even most, of that advice can be useful to at least consider. But I generally find it more interesting to listen to successful people from other industries, especially when they share lessons they learned on their path to path to success. It is always interesting to digest their comments and see if there’s anything that would be applicable to succeeding in the practice of law.

The most recent example of worthwhile career advice I have encountered actually came from someone in the category of “celebrity chef.” Even though I’m kosher and have never tried his food, I am familiar with the chef and restaurateur David Chang, which is a bit of a testament to his celebrity status. Even without actually eating his food, I’m sure he is a wonderful chef based on the success of his many restaurants. Maybe even one day he will do a special kosher tasting event so I can see what makes his restaurants so popular. In any event, I recently heard a very interesting podcast where Chef Chang discussed various aspects of his successful business approach with Bill Simmons. A link to that podcast is available [here](https://soundcloud.com/the-bill-simmons-podcast/ep-97-restaurateur-david-chang/). It is well worth a listen.

The podcast itself is a bit profanity-laced, but full of interesting observations by someone who has succeeded beyond all expectations in a brutal business. Other than the degree of difficulty attached to success in both the restaurant and law firm worlds, there were definitely a number of observations made by Chef Chang that I think are applicable to lawyers and worthy of further discussion.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
First, he drew an interesting contrast between creativity in the kitchen, in terms of ability to experiment with new dishes and flavors, versus creativity in a profession like law. His point was that chefs often peak creatively while they are still young, perhaps before even 30 years old. That is because many chefs, with or without formal training, often already have the technical skills necessary for success at a young age. In contrast, practitioners in professions that require skill development and experience to foster creativity — such as the law — often peak creatively much later in a career. So while chefs may need to showcase their creativity early in a career to get noticed, lawyers have the luxury of using their early professional days to develop their skills.

This observation rang very true to me, especially when I consider my formative experiences as a Biglaw associate. As with many other young associates at law firms, there really was not much opportunity for creativity in Biglaw. The focus was on struggling to excel in an unfamiliar and competitive business setting. Generally, young associates who need to simultaneously bill hours and develop basic practice skills as lawyers really do not have much time for creativity. Nor is creative thinking encouraged by many law firms. That is not to say that a young associate can’t come up with a creative argument or a worthwhile suggestion for improving legal practice. They can, though most lawyers peak creatively much later in their careers, once they have both the technical skills and experience necessary to take creative risks in their practices.

The next observation of interest made by Chef Chang was his description of his changing role. He noted his progression from someone whose only job was to cook to his current role, which centers on making sure his various teams are organized and executing his vision. This rang true with me as a fellow small business owner. Even in a partnership, lawyers are often called upon to do a lot of organizing, whether it be of junior lawyers on their matters, or regarding firm administrative matters. It may not be always fun or glamorous, but reaching that stage in one’s career is also a sign of maturity and (hopefully) success.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Implicit in Chef Chang’s comments, however, was a recognition that while exhibiting passion about your chosen field may be easy while things are fresh and you are younger, doing so as a senior manager may be more challenging. ‎Yes, reviewing bills or making sure insurance policies are renewed is not as much fun as crafting an outline for your first deposition. But in order for a firm to flourish, the senior lawyers have to have the same passion about making the firm a great place for colleagues and clients to work with as they had as younger lawyers. Success breeds additional responsibility, and lawyers need to rise to that challenge, even as they juggle legal and administrative roles.

Finally, and perhaps surprisingly, Chef Chang discussed the physical demands of his profession, and how important it was to maintain a level of fitness in order to meet those demands. He noted how his ability to perform at a high level in the kitchen has changed as he ages, and how maintaining physical fitness becomes more important for him as a result. This commentary brought to mind an observation from one of my mentors, who pointed out to me one day how all the lawyers in the room were either fit or looked terribly overweight or aged beyond their actual years. Yes, law is a demanding profession, and there often is not enough time to maintain optimal physical health. But having the awareness that physical fitness is something that can’t be ignored is important as well. Most lawyers spend a lot of time worrying about and attending to the needs of others. Part of being able to do so effectively requires making sure that we are in reasonable physical and mental shape to respond to the demands of our profession.

Ultimately, successful people who are willing to share their observations with others are often worth listening to. While Chef Chang may have mentioned lawyers only once in passing during the podcast, there are some very salient points he made that are of interest to our profession, especially to those who want to reach the same heights as lawyers as he has as a chef and restaurateur. More than anything, his insights are a reminder that maintaining success is just as big a challenge as achieving it in the first place.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
As many of you may know, last March I came down with a [severe case of COVID-19](https://www.businessinsider.com/david-lat-coronavirus-harrowing-story-ventilator-2020-4). I spent 17 days in the hospital, including almost a week in critical condition in the ICU, hooked up to a [ventilator](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/09/my-near-death-experience-ventilator/). I ran up a [$320,000 hospital bill](https://slate.com/technology/2020/06/covid-hospital-bill-insurance.html) (which I thankfully did not have to pay). Even after getting out of the hospital, I experienced a [painfully slow recovery](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-07-09/op-ed-people-ask-me-if-ive-recovered-from-covid-19-thats-not-an-easy-question-to-answer), including a terrible cough and shortness of breath that lasted for months.

And I consider myself lucky. Thanks to the valiant efforts of my care team at [NYU Langone](https://nyulangone.org/news/patients-recovery-covid-19-highlights-collaborative-care-nyu-langone) here in New York, as well as the prayers and support of [so many in the legal profession](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/coronavirus-and-me-david-lat-covid-19-journal/) and beyond, I survived my COVID-19 ordeal, and I feel fairly recovered today. Many Americans — more than [370,000 dead](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_casesper100klast7days), as of this writing, and an unknown number with [lingering health effects](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/health/covid-long-term-symptoms.html) — have not been as fortunate.

The coronavirus pandemic has not spared the legal profession. I suspect that many of us personally know, or are just a few degrees removed from, lawyers or judges who lost their lives to COVID-19. One thing I’ve learned from my years working in and covering the legal profession is that it’s a surprisingly small world — and it grows only smaller in grief.

I’d like to use this post to acknowledge some of those we as a profession have lost. I’ll mention two by way of example, but they are just two of many.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
One was someone I was proud to call a friend, [Stephen D. Susman](https://www.susmangodfrey.com/attorneys/stephen-d-susman/). Steve was one of the nation’s greatest trial lawyers, founder and managing partner of Susman Godfrey, one of the nation’s greatest law firms. On April 22 of last year, Steve — an avid cyclist, who every year biked [180 miles from Houston to Austin](https://blog.texasbar.com/2015/04/articles/news/houston-lawyer-raises-more-than-100000-for-charity-bike-ride-2/) to raise money for multiple sclerosis research — sustained a serious head injury in a [cycling accident](https://www.law.com/texaslawyer/2020/07/15/stephen-susman-a-father-figure-in-his-firm-and-dean-of-the-litigation-bar-revolutionized-trial-work/).

I had last seen Steve and his wife, [Ellen Spencer Susman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Susman), at a dinner party hosted by mutual friends in November 2019. It was shortly before Thanksgiving, and I remember chatting with Ellen in our friends’ foyer about our respective holiday plans.

Steve was, as usual, in fine form that evening — a great storyteller, as you’d expect from a legendary trial lawyer, with a mischievous glint in his eye. He could be a bit of a joker, and every time we crossed paths, he subjected me to good-natured teasing about something or other. Whenever I was with Steve, I somehow always wound up in the role of “straight man” (not my typical role).

Despite his ferocity in the courtroom, Steve was caring and compassionate outside of it. When I was in the hospital in late March, he emailed me a note of encouragement and support. When I belatedly responded to thank him in late April, after getting home from the hospital, his son [Harry Susman](https://www.susmangodfrey.com/attorneys/harry-p-susman/) replied from his father’s account, sharing with me the news of his dad’s bike accident.

Steve was unconscious for several weeks. Ever the fighter, he regained consciousness by mid-May and was recovering well in a Houston rehabilitation facility. He improved to the point where he was responding physically to verbal commands, talking, and even [singing some of his favorite songs](https://law.utexas.edu/news/2020/07/21/in-memoriam-steve-susman-65/), such as “I Walk the Line” and “Under the Boardwalk.”

On June 24, however, Steve was diagnosed with the novel coronavirus. He [passed away](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/profession-loses-steve-susman-to-covid/) a few weeks later, on July 14. Ellen announced his death on the CaringBridge website, where many of us had been following his struggle:

Our gallant Steve left us today. He fought a valiant battle, from his accident to rehab, but the combination of COVID and his weakened lungs were finally too much for his body. We are brokenhearted, but at peace with the fact that he is free and whole at last. He went peacefully, and we were by his side.

Rest in peace, Steve. You are sorely missed by so many of us.

Steve was a titan of the bar. A few weeks later, COVID-19 claimed a titan of the bench.

On August 7, Judge Stephen F. Williams, a longtime member of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, [passed away](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/obituaries/stephen-f-williams-dead-coronavirus.html) from complications of the coronavirus. Judge Williams was one of the most brilliant and highly esteemed members of the D.C. Circuit, the most powerful and prestigious court after the U.S. Supreme Court.

Chief Judge Sri Srinivasan [eulogized his colleague well](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2020/08/08/longtime-dc-circuit-judge-stephen-williams-who-fought-covid-19-dies-at-83/):

[Judge Williams] committed his professional life to teaching, writing, and serving the public, including service on our court for more than three decades. He had an uncommon love of ideas, an extraordinarily broad-ranging intellectual curiosity, an infectiously good-spirited demeanor, and a joyful sense of humor. We have been immeasurably enriched by the privilege of serving with him.

We will sorely miss our dear friend, and will long cherish fond memories of engaging with him on the work of the court, of sharing a smile with him about matters large and small, and of seeing him on his trademark bike rides to and from the courthouse. We extend our deepest condolences to Judge Williams’s wife Faith and their children, grandchildren, and extended family.

Judge Williams, rest in peace.

I would like to maintain a running list of people in the legal profession who have died in the coronavirus pandemic. It is fitting and proper for us to remember them, even if this list is just a small thing. I’ll include judges, lawyers, law professors, law students, paralegals, legal assistants, and anyone else who would be considered part of the legal community, broadly defined. If you have a name to add, please email me at davidlat@substack.com, subject line “In Memoriam.”

Please provide me with the person’s name and affiliation, as well as a link to a publicly available news article, obituary, or death notice. Out of respect for the privacy of deceased individuals and their families, I will limit my list to people whose passings are already noted online.

Here is an initial list, which I will maintain [here](https://davidlat.substack.com/p/in-memoriam-legal-lives-lost-to-covid) and update from time to time. I have listed the individuals in alphabetical order by last name, followed by their current (as of the time of their death) or former affiliation.

Each person’s name links to an article, obituary, death notice, or other confirmation of their passing. As you can see, the coronavirus has claimed lives from across the country and from so many different precincts of the profession — from the federal, state, and local benches, and from Biglaw to boutiques and beyond.

Please keep these individuals and their families in your thoughts and prayers. Thank you.

# Could Coronavirus Play A Hand In Biglaw Firms Canceling Summer Associate Programs?
## Law students are growing increasingly worried.

Thanks to the global pandemic that is the coronavirus, it’s beginning to look a lot like 2008. The stock market plummeted for the second time this week, both times triggering circuit breakers to suspend all trading. Law schools have canceled in-person classes and have shifted to online coursework, some for the rest of the semester. Some law firms have shuttered offices, with others encouraging attorneys to work from home until further notice.

All of this upheaval got us to wondering what would happen to Biglaw summer associates. Of course, as noted by the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/03/12/how-coronavirus-and-a-bear-market-could-upend-law-firm-hiring/), Biglaw firms have already interviewed law students and selected their incoming summer classes.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“We did our hiring for the summer [and] fall months and months ago,” said David Greenwald, managing partner at Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson. “That’s locked and loaded.”

Same for Washington, D.C.-based tax boutique Caplin & Drysdale, although the timing was closer.

“[On campus interviews] just finished, and the summer offers are out,” said firm administrator John Riggleman. “Three weeks back, it probably would have had a greater impact.”

But if the coronavirus sticks around, could we be facing a situation where upcoming summer programs are possibly postponed or canceled outright?

“On summer programs, while there may be some cancellations, I would be surprised to see mass cancellations due solely to COVID-19 concerns,” said Zeughauser Group consultant Kent Zimmermann. “The bigger issue in my mind is what happens to the macroeconomy. If there is a sustained macroeconomic downturn and it depresses demand for legal services, similar to what happened after Lehman Brothers, firms may cut back on their summer programs and other expenses, similar to what happened as a result of the financial crisis and its impact on the broader economy and the negative impact of that on demand for legal services.”

While [some think](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/03/12/how-coronavirus-and-a-bear-market-could-upend-law-firm-hiring/) they’re “going to get through this just fine,” law students who thought their careers were mapped out are growing increasingly worried. To that end, a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/fh6phi/i_dont_want_to_out_myself_or_the_firm_but_did/) that has since been deleted detailed $24,000 payouts for law students from law firm that allegedly cut its summer program due to the coronavirus outbreak.

While we genuinely hope that things will work out, we are but a few weeks into what could be a very long journey when it comes to containment of the coronavirus and a potential recession that could drive the legal market into chaos.

# Taking A Closer Look At Pro Bono With PLI
## It’s Pro Bono Week – and with individuals and businesses across the nation facing unprecedented challenges due to the pandemic and economic downturn, this work feels more urgent than ever this year.

Pro Bono Week, recognized at the end of October, is a time to celebrate the incredible difference pro bono can make. With individuals and businesses across the nation facing unprecedented challenges due to the pandemic and economic downturn, this work feels more urgent than ever this year.

Practising Law Institute (PLI) is known for providing CLE and other professional development nationally, but the 80+ year-old organization is also heavily invested in pro bono. Kara O’Brien, Vice President of Programs, and Janet Siegel, Director of Pro Bono Services, spoke about PLI’s mission and offerings.

Can you tell us more about PLI’s commitment to pro bono?

Kara O’Brien: PLI has long been committed to providing attorneys with the training they need to represent individuals in a pro bono capacity. It is really at the heart of our mission as an organization. We have a three-pronged approach to providing access to our programs for attorneys who are interested in serving underrepresented communities. With [widely available](https://bit.ly/2GaCaRm) scholarships, free Pro Bono Memberships for legal aid and nonprofits dedicated to providing pro bono legal services, and significantly discounted pro bono programs, our training is accessible and affordable.

Why is this so important to your organization?

KO: PLI has always supported the legal profession and, more broadly, the rule of law. We believe that increasing access to justice ultimately strengthens the rule of law for everyone and we are proud to play a part in that endeavor.

What does PLI’s Pro Bono department focus on?

Janet Siegel: Our Pro Bono team works to raise awareness of the great need for pro bono representation, especially now during this pandemic, and offers training to support attorneys so that they can better represent pro bono clients. We offer programs on a wide number of substantive topics including immigration, domestic violence, criminal justice, housing, nonprofit organizations, consumer bankruptcy and veterans’ issues.

How are these programs developed, and what does PLI do to ensure that its offerings are fresh and relevant to law firms and practitioners?

JS: We constantly follow legal developments and have a great team that can quickly produce and adapt relevant content for our audiences. We’re also very lucky to have highly experienced faculty from both law firms and legal services organizations who review our programs to ensure their relevance and timeliness.

With that in mind, how have you adjusted your program offerings in response to current events? How have those programs been received?

JS: This year, we offered a series of remote and on-demand programs on the impact of COVID-19 on immigration, nonprofit organizations, housing, and employment, as well as best practices and ethical issues in providing remote legal services, all of which drew very large audiences. In response to the protest movement in the wake of George Floyd’s death earlier this year, we quickly organized our civil rights, diversity and related programs so that they could be accessed easily at [pli.edu/accessjustice](https://bit.ly/3oBlmo4).

Because this is an election year, our program on [Voter Rights](https://bit.ly/2J8g6YA) (now available on-demand) was of great interest as well. We also have a large ongoing curriculum of immigration programs generally, which continue to attract large numbers of attendees.

What would you advise law firms and lawyers looking to get more involved with pro bono?

JS: If your firm has a Pro Bono Manager, that is always a good place to start. Many firms can match you with pro bono matters that meet your interests or help you with skills you wish to develop. Anyone interested in taking on pro bono representation but concerned that they need additional training should check PLI’s pro bono page at [pli.edu/probono.](https://bit.ly/2HMU4Kb) We offer programs for all experience levels, led by highly knowledgeable faculty who are deeply committed to access-to-justice issues. Our programs will also give you information about the many opportunities for pro bono and possible organizations to contact.

In addition to training on substantive law, we offer several skills training and ethics programs. Find something that matters to you and jump in. Lawyers have told us that their most rewarding work comes from their pro bono efforts.

Is there anything else you’d like people to know about pro bono at PLI?

If you’re interested in learning more about pro bono in action, [our podcast Pursuing Justice: The Pro Bono Files](https://bit.ly/37NDLI2) tells the “real-world stories” of attorneys taking on various types of pro bono representation.

Practising Law Institute is a nonprofit learning organization dedicated to keeping attorneys and other professionals at the forefront of knowledge and expertise. PLI is chartered by the Regents of the University of the State of New York and was founded in 1933 by Harold P. Seligson. The organization provides the highest quality, accredited, continuing legal and professional education programs in a variety of formats which are delivered by more than 4,000 volunteer faculty including prominent lawyers, judges, investment bankers, accountants, corporate counsel, and U.S. and international government regulators. PLI publishes a comprehensive library of Treatises, Course Handbooks, Answer Books and Journals also available through the PLI PLUS online platform. The essence of PLI’s mission is its commitment to the pro bono community. View PLI’s upcoming live webcasts [here](https://bit.ly/2Jgodm4).

# How To Become A Go-To Source
## I’ve noticed that all my good sources have traits in common that make me think of them first when deadlines are closing in.

Do a web search and you’ll find endless advice — from decent to total BS — about how to get media attention. There’s less emphasis on a critical part of that aspiration: Being a good source.

As a reporter and editor working in newspapers, magazines, and online spaces for many years, I’ve found good sources are more memorable than awards. I’ve developed long-term relationships with many of them. And I’ve noticed they all have traits in common that make me think of them first when deadlines are closing in.

I started paying closer attention to what makes a good source when I pushed my ABA Journal team years ago to seek more diverse sources for interviews and photos. Women and marginalized lawyers were underrepresented, and I needed at a minimum to see equity in the way we reflected the makeup of the profession we covered. I began auditing the pages of the magazine and kicking stories back to editors and reporters that didn’t meet my diversity expectations.

There’s plenty of discussion about why publications end up quoting older, white men more often than any other group. [Wisconsin Public Radio recently acknowledged the problem](https://current.org/2020/11/how-wisconsin-public-radio-is-using-surveys-to-track-diversity-of-its-sources/) and is taking corrective steps to diversify its source pool.

For the sake of better storytelling from diverse perspectives, I do what I can to reach out to and rely on experts that, for many reasons, remain under the radar and lesser-known. Yet when news breaks and I need a source right away, it’s hard not to rely on the usual suspects.

For those aiming to be the go-to expert that a reporter thinks of first, I’ve included a few attributes of a good source. Good sources make life easier for reporters juggling multiple stories on tight deadlines.

Good sources are:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Responsive. Quick to respond to requests for comment or background. The early bird gets the worm. If reporters have the luxury of long lead times, they may wait to hear back from the first people they call or email. Otherwise, the first to respond is likely to be given priority.

Flexible. They are flexible and make themselves available. If you’re playing hard to get, it’s likely that unless you’re already a superstar or a critical piece of a story, the reporter will just move on.

Tolerant. Complainers and second-guessers are the worst. At best they return to reporters asking for unnecessary adjustments, word changes, or quotes. At worst they claim the reporter misquoted or introduced an error. This triggers a set of internal reviews at news outlets and sometimes an enormous amount of work that can create bad feelings about a source. If there is an error of fact or clear misquote, it’s important to get that corrected. But if you don’t like the way you sound and think you could have articulated it better, use that as a lesson learned and move on. If there is an error, be respectful and kind when requesting a correction or clarification.

Understanding. By this, I mean that a source should know at least a little bit about the reporter’s job. Most journalists have professional ethics policies that preclude them from sharing articles in advance or allowing sources to negotiate language. Before an interview, it’s good to understand the reporter’s methods and ground rules. What is “background” for instance? And will the reporter allow you to review or will the reporter repeat back direct quotes?

Supportive. Good sources are grateful for the opportunity and let the reporter — and possibly the reporter’s superiors — know that they appreciate the work that went into a story.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The best sources:

Are generous. Reporters don’t forget when a source goes out of their way to help make a story happen. That can be helping gather or interpret documents or spend time helping a reporter understand an arcane aspect of the story.

Share. The best sources understand that the reporter isn’t a PR agency. Reporters have wide-ranging beats and assignments. When a source can offer newsworthy tips that don’t directly benefit the source, that source gains credibility.

Sponsor others. The very best sources promote those who don’t get as much ink or air time. They take the time to note others in the field with similar or, importantly, differing perspectives. This should be natural for many lawyers I know who enjoy surrounding themselves with peers who have viewpoints that can be civility debated.

Know when to pass. I can name sources who will be quoted on absolutely anything, even when they have zero experience in a particular subject. This is a disservice, especially to the publication. This also is a perfect opportunity for a go-to source to (see above) sponsor others or be a referral. This is a win, win, win, win. The reporter gets a better source for the topic, the source wins brownie points with the reporter AND the individual they promoted, and the previously unknown source gets a chance to speak.

When legal professionals ask me about how to get quoted, a good pitch is only a part of the equation. Being accommodating and reliable can help build credibility and develop a reputation as a go-to source.

# Why 'A' Students Struggle In Biglaw
## The skills that made you a great student are not enough to make you a great lawyer.

I’ve been thinking for a long time about a piece of advice I received back in my associate days. I was a freshly minted JD. Since I was a kid, I was always motivated to get that “A” in school, and doing so eventually helped me land my first law firm job. When I started practicing, I was confident those grades would translate into the success I could expect as a lawyer.

Then I heard an older partner musing aloud: “Ya know, if I was in charge of hiring, I’d only hire B students.”

This partner’s off-hand comment stopped me in my tracks. I’d spent my whole life struggling toward the front of the pack, and now this apparently successful senior attorney was telling me he would rather the firm hired the folks I’d worked so hard to beat out? I was perplexed. The partner continued.

“Your students who get Cs, you don’t want to hire them. They’re not gonna hack it. But we go out and hire all these law school kids with straight As, and all they know how to do is research, write, and watch Star Wars. They’re going to work a million hours, give you all this great written product, but they’re not going to be out there hitting the bars every night drumming up business. It’s your B students who are in the sweet spot. Smart enough to do the work, but social enough to bring the work in.”

The Right Kind Of Wrong

I’ve been mulling this partner’s concept since he uttered it over a decade ago, and I’m still not quite sure where on the spectrum between total nonsense to profound this theory lies. Early in my career, I convinced myself it was nonsense. The more I’ve practiced, however, the more I’ve come to believe that the partner may have been on to something.

One flaw in the theory presented is the stereotype that “A students” are all bookish nerds who suffer from social anxiety disorder and dress up like Chewbacca for fun. This is flat wrong (well, some may dress up like Chewbacca). I’m surrounded every day by brilliant, academically gifted attorneys who can absolutely crush it socially. Similarly, getting middling-to-poor grades isn’t a necessary indicator that you’re a fun time to be around. I don’t think it’s a hot take to say that some people are both anti-social and just lazy.

But I do think this attorney was circling a more basic tension that law firms place on their associates and many young partners: the tension between being a great attorney and a great business developer.

The Good Old Days

Join me on a brief mental journey. You’re a junior associate again. You had to be sharp to get where you were, but you’ve spent the first months and years of your practice starting to realize all the myriad things you don’t know how to do. You can almost taste your own ignorance. You’re trying to find a way to prove that, yes, you do deserve this great job you landed.

You’re told, either implicitly or explicitly, that your best bet is to throw yourself into your work. If you put in the time to generate great work product, you find more partners will want to work with you. If you bill gobs of hours, the firm stays happy and you’ll probably get a nice bonus. The incentives are all there, pushing you to keep your nose to the grindstone and spend your time working. Bill enough hours, invest enough into in improving your skills, and before you know it you’ll be a good enough attorney to carry the firm’s reputation on your back.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
You follow this path, and suddenly it’s 10 years later. Your skills are unimpeachable. You’ve pulled in millions of dollars in revenue. And you have zero book of business to call your own.

I’ve spoken to many attorneys over the years who suddenly ended up in this position, and it can be heartbreaking. Just when someone thinks they’ve mastered the game, the rules change on them. Suddenly good work product is assumed, and the questions all turn to what kind of clients are being brought in. And for someone who’s spent their evenings at a desk rather than out in the world planting the seeds of future engagements, those are hard questions to answer.

Billables Now vs. Billables Later

Time is the fundamental currency of a law firm, and like all currencies, it can be invested, and it can be spent. The short-term economics of a legal practice strongly incentivize spending our time in a way that maximizes the revenue earned. If you want a big check, you need to send out some big bills.

But if a firm’s immediate prospects are determined by how much revenue it can generate from its existing client pool, its long-term prospects are determined by how much it can expand the pool altogether. If you want to be rich today, bill. If you want to be rich tomorrow, you need to hustle, network, and generally get your face in front of all those clients who just don’t know they’ve hired you yet.

It takes practice and repetition to learn how to connect with strangers, make the ask for new business, and treat the process with discipline and purpose. My personal goal has always been to spend at least 20 percent of my working hours actively trying to bring in new clients. That’s one workday a week that I’m committing to bringing in zero actual dollars, in the hope of bringing in far more down the road.

What Exactly Are Associates, Anyway?

Every firm in Biglaw at least pays lip service to the notion that it wants to encourage its associates to develop their professional networks, build their books, and be the leaders of tomorrow. But I’ve known very few who are willing to recognize that encouraging associates to invest in themselves for long term gain means trading off some of the performance that they could be giving us by just chaining themselves to their desk and making the firm money now.

Associates can be tremendous profit centers for a firm. They work hard, bill at high rates, and have little-to-no participation in firm profitability. Associates can also be the leaders of a firm’s future, rainmakers in waiting. Sometimes, very rarely, they can be stellar at both. But more often, they’re going to be great at one thing, or just alright at two.

Law firms need to decide what they want their associates to be and communicate that expectation to everyone in the firm. It’s acceptable to expect your associates to bill 2,400 hours a year if you’re clear with them that billing is an associate’s only job, and business development is something they can pursue on their own time if they choose. It’s equally acceptable to expect a firm’s associates to be actively developing themselves and bringing in new business early, but doing that means understanding that the amount of hours those associates bill will (and should) go down in the process. Either way, the key is being transparent with associates so they can make informed decisions and not be surprised down the road.

Some firms — I hope many — will heed the call to do more than just encourage young associates to build their network. Formal mentoring programs, encouraging partners to bring associates along to networking events, and business development training are all good starts down this path. For firms that prefer short-term financial benefits, I hope they take steps to ensure everyone in the firm, from the senior partners down, shares the same expectations.

More important than anything is that firms realize the trade-offs between being a great biller and being a great business developer, and make a conscious choice of what they want to encourage.

Happy hour isn’t free, but go out to enough of them and they just might pay for themselves.

# Late Holiday Parties Are Better Than No Holiday Parties
## If your law firm did not have a holiday party in December, it's not too late to kick back and host some holiday merriment.

Was 2023 the year that holiday parties fully returned to the legal profession? More lawyers told me that their firms hosted holiday parties than had held parties in the previous few years, and Above the Law also finally hosted its first holiday since 2019 (which was an epic event!). If your law firm did not have a holiday party in December, it’s not too late to kick back and host some holiday merriment even though the season has passed.

Several weeks ago, I was speaking with a lawyer friend about plans law firms had for the holiday season. She told me that her firm decided that they would host a holiday party in January rather than the usual December. At first, I was taken aback. It seems odd that people would have a party even though the holidays had passed by, and this seemed to suggest that the firm was dysfunctional in some way. However, the more I think about it, the more I believe that law firms should consider hosting holiday parties in the new year.

The holiday season can be a stressful time for everyone, including individuals within the legal profession. People often have various holiday obligations — travel, hosting family members, and other activities that consume precious and finite time and energy. It might be difficult for people to also attend work holiday parties during the holidays due to those obligations. Delaying holiday merriment until the new year might mean that legal professionals are less stressed and have more free time during the holiday season.

Many law firms use the calendar year when evaluating whether attorneys satisfied their billable-hour requirement. Delaying holiday parties would be useful to people who still have billable hour deadlines to meet toward the end of the year. Some attorneys might be eligible for a larger bonus if they bill a certain amount of hours, and that too might create substantial stress around the holidays.

Any time that is freed up around the holidays is time that attorneys can use on client tasks in order to meet billable-hour expectations or qualify for a bonus. Attorneys are not as stressed out shortly after the holidays, and people are less focused on billing hours, so this could be a better time to hold a holiday party.

Delaying holiday parties can also save law firms a ton of money. Holding a holiday party is not cheap, and law firms often spend thousands or tens of thousands, depending on the size of the firm. Planning a holiday party for December can be more expensive than at other times of the year since many employers hold parties during this time which can drive prices up. Venue prices and other costs might decrease after the holiday season, which can impact a law firm’s bottom line. In some instances, the decrease in costs associated with holding a holiday party after the new year might be the deciding factor in holding a holiday party at all.

All told, if your law firm has not yet held a holiday party, it is not too late to schedule one. Indeed, there may even be a variety of benefits to holding a party after the typical holiday season.

# Let's Hear From The Furious Associates At Firms That Haven't Matched!
## These people are really peeved at their bosses.

The bulk of the Biglaw establishment has announced a salary jump of some kind. It may be a full match or fall short of associate hopes and dreams, but most players have made their move.

But some folks haven’t. Whether they’re just slow, in denial, or smooth don’t care, there are some big firms that haven’t said anything about raises yet. And you’d better believe we’ve been hearing from lawyers inside these firms. So we thought we’d just feature some of the loudest clamoring we’re hearing.

This is not an exhaustive list of firms that haven’t made raises. But hopefully this will clue a few firms in to the associate mutiny bubbling under their noses.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
First up, Jones Day. Apparently in between clubbing pregnant baby seals — or whatever nefarious activity [Donald Trump’s chosen representatives](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/jones-day-doubles-down-on-donald-trump/) get into for kicks these days — Jones Day can’t be bothered to work out a new compensation plan.

There has been a lot of chatter underground on whether the firm will match. Management remains tight lipped. Associates internally are starting to consider other options. The Jones Day fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30, so we will find out our salary probably Friday. Management might wait until then, but damage has already been done. Only us and Wilmer now left in the V top 30.

And, of course, [WilmerHale already matched](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-top-tier-firm-raises-salaries/).

Of course their excuse will be that they do black box compensation and no bonuses because of their amazing culture…blah blah. But incoming associates need to know that they will be compensated at market when they begin AND that they will not fall behind as time marches on. The timing is perfect for them to just give everyone more money because their normally scheduled salary adjustments are July 1 anyway. Once those adjustments happen, the firm’s practice of silencing their associates regarding compensation (hey… ever heard of [concerted activity?](https://www.nlrb.gov/rights-we-protect/protected-concerted-activity)) will prevent associates from properly comparing and analyzing their compensation to determine whether they are being treated fairly.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Well, our readers can help with that. The more intel we get from individual Jones Day associates — if a raise ever happens — the better we can provide an accurate picture of their overall salary structure.

Meanwhile, even though we generally feel around these parts that Dallas and Houston attorneys are getting the best of this deal, there are some Texas associates with a bone to pick:

Can you guys point out the fact that Haynes & Boone (Dallas-based, Am Law 100) has yet to match the new salary scale? PPP are over $900K/year and lower-ranked firms such as Locke Lord have already matched. In Texas, all of our peer firms have already matched (Baker Botts, V&E, Bracewell, Andrews Kurth, Locke Lord). We need some public pressure to get them to match the new salary scale.

Honestly, Haynes and Boone’s associates may be the most agitated. After Dechert, who eventually matched after we received a deluge of emails, I think we have more Haynes and Boone complaints than from any other firm.

Just wanted to remind you that Haynes Boone is also left, and a lot of us are following closely what’s happening — especially the NY office which matches market (and of which the firm routinely says that each office matches market for the market they are in …)

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Remember, Haynes and Boone associates were singing the firm’s praises [after last year’s bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-a-new-compensation-leader-in-texas/). Oh how the mighty have fallen. In fact, one tipster worries that shifting around compensation may be all that happens even if the firm matches:

Not to put the cart before the horse, but assuming we match, the real test will be bonus season where we will determine whether this is really a raise or just shifting compensation timing. I hope it’s the former, but suspect it will be the latter.

Then there’s Kasowitz Benson, which took the time to hold a meeting at least…

Radio silence from management here despite an all partner meeting yesterday.

Hopefully, they’re just working out the kinks.

Mega-firm Dentons is also lagging:

I feel like they’ve been able to avoid the public shaming as well because the recent merger with the Chinese firm took them off of the AmLaw list and thus off the radar in a sense. Have you guys heard anything that I haven’t? Correct me if I’m wrong, but at this point it seems that some of our peer firms have made the move. One would think they need to at least bump the NY associates’ pay…

Yes, one would think they’d need to do at least that. But buying 10,000-lawyer firms all over the world takes cold hard cash!

To the associates in this and other firms that still haven’t matched, we feel your pain ([mostly](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/crowell-moring-matches-wait-what-in-the-holy-hell-is-going-on-here/)).
