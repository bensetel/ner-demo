# The Perfect Law Firm For Donald Trump
## This is the law firm of Donald Trump's dreams!

President Donald Trump?

Donald Trump, our nation’s Republican nominee for president, seems to have a penchant for threatening to sue others for libel. He is typically represented by bigly big-league Biglaw firms in these endeavors, such as Kasowitz Benson. As you may recall, Kasowitz Benson has stepped in to send letters threatening suit to the New York Times twice in the past month — once for the publication of three pages from [Trump’s 1995 income tax returns](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/donald-trump-chooses-biglaw-firm-to-fight-new-york-times-over-publication-of-tax-documents/), and once for the publication of allegations made by two women that [Trump had sexually assaulted them](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/donald-trumps-biglaw-firm-threatens-to-sue-new-york-times-over-publication-of-sexual-assault-allegations/).

Kasowitz Benson’s representation is all well and good, but perhaps it’s time for Trump to explore an attorney-client relationship with another law firm — one that truly understands him, one that’s willing to “defend[] against baseless charges, such as facts, logic,” and more. At the conclusion of an entertaining segment on Trump’s libel law adventures that was recently featured on [The Daily Show with Trevor Noah](http://www.cc.com/shows/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah), we meet Jordan Klepper, the man behind the law firm of Trump’s dreams (beginning at 4:59).

# Biglaw Firm Reverses Course On Associate Raises, Is Now Onboard With $190,000 Starting Salary

Turns out patience really can be rewarded. The associates at Fish & Richardson were [peeved back in August](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/biglaw-firm-tells-associates-they-can-afford-to-raise-salaries-but-theyre-still-not-going-to/) when the firm announced that a firmwide bump in compensation was simply not in the cards — despite the firm’s boasts that they could, in fact, afford it. Last week, the firm announced that they were reversing course and raises were in the offing.

According to the firm-wide email, the powers that be at Fish “continued to monitor market conditions” and “listened to the reactions of associates throughout the Firm” and whaddaya know, and they’ve “reassessed” their position. Turns out hitting the $190,000 mark for starting associate salaries is good business.

Associates will be paid, effective October 1, on the following scale:

Fish & Richardson associates may have missed out on three months at these higher salaries (and those fun[ summer bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/) that were all the rage), but better late than never.

# Up Or Out: The 5 Things You Need To Do To Make Partner
## Becoming a partner is a strenuous but not insurmountable goal; to achieve it, associates must plan for it from the very start.

Michael Allen

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors. [Michael Allen](http://www.laterallink.com/about/team/1) is Managing Principal at Lateral Link, focusing exclusively on partner placements with Am Law 200 clients and placements for in-house attorneys.
Over the last 15 years, law firm leverage – the ratio between equity partners and all other attorneys – has increased every year, bar two. During this period, the number of equity partners has increased by 27 percent while the number of “all other attorneys” has increased by nearly 86 percent. This trend has tilted leverage to a new high of 3.122 – up 47 percent from 2.13 in 2000. Consequently, it’s never been harder to make partner.


These decreasing odds mean that you must decide, from the minute you step in the firm, what your career goals are. Making partner is the culmination of 7+ years of planning, not happenstance. So how does one become a partner? Here are five things you must do if you want to make partner.

1. Take a heat check. Peak marketability for associates occurs between their third and fifth year. The vast majority of all our associate openings are for midlevel associates, not junior or senior level. Any earlier than three years, associates won’t have much substantive experience; any later than five years, their runway is quite short if they don’t make partner. Associates should use their most marketable time to determine their odds of making partner at their current firm.

If the prospects for partnership are not good, this is the best time to make a lateral move to a firm where your shot at making partner is higher. Moving during the 3-5 year range allows associates to leverage their desirability to find a firm that puts them on track for making partner, while giving them a long enough runway to accrue the necessary goodwill and experience to cash in for a partnership in 3-5 years.

How can one determine their odds at making partner?

2. Look at the supply and demand. Firms are businesses that obey simple economic rules like any other business. There are a certain number of partnership positions available for a certain practice area before a firm experiences overcrowding and significant diminishing returns.

To calculate demand, you should look at the current stock of partners. If the partners are young and have a “lifer” mentality, your prospects are poor. If the partnership ranks are skewed older, your chances improve. Lateral moves can complicate this analysis; you can never be certain how long a partner will actually stay. Our calculations have shown most partners jump firms 3-5 years after making their first lateral move – possibly opening a spot when your partnership candidacy is approaching, assuming there is business sitting on the table.

However, demand is not the only variable. Who are your competitors? If your practice is filled with a glut of associates with the same year and similar credentials, the odds decrease. If you are stuck in this predicament, a lateral move is likely your best bet, to find a firm where you stand out relative to your peers, which brings us to our next point.

3. Find a smaller pond. If the supply or demand is not conducive to your partnership odds, consider seeking a firm that is both lower leverage and has more attractive billing rates for you to develop a book. Your competition will be less fierce, and the alternative is possibly staying for a perpetual senior associateship.

4. Find a growing pond. Growing practices are another advantageous environment. This principle operates in tandem with demand. If a firm is significantly growing a practice, they are usually at a disadvantage of demanding more than the market can supply. Moving into a growing practice is not only easier, but chances are, the partnership stock is thin – making your prospects greater in a few years. You will have the institutional memory for the expanding practice, making you even more indispensable.

5. Find the right platform. Not every firm puts an associate up for partnership. Highly leveraged firms often have less specialized work for any particular associate, denying the opportunity to specialize. If you are at one of these firms, and your goal is to make partner, you should be looking for a firm whose structure – supply and demand – and environment – experience and support – maximize your opportunities for becoming a partner.

Becoming a partner is a strenuous but not insurmountable goal. To achieve it, associates must plan for it from the very start. If you are an associate and need advice on how to make partner, feel free to contact my [fellow recruiters](http://laterallink.com/about/team) at Lateral Link.

# More Good News From Biglaw Firms Not Cutting Back
## Some firms are staying the course.

It’s been a few weeks since we did [a roundup of firms that aren’t implementing austerity measures](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-biglaw-firms-rolling-out-good-news-for-now/) and with bad news dominating our coverage, we thought it was time to remind everyone out there that not every firm finds themselves struggling during the downturn. Frankly, we don’t get enough of these stories, so if your firm has issued a note of reassurance, let us know [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Good%20News) so we can acknowledge the firms that weren’t living on the knife’s edge of margins. We’ll be updating this piece as we see stuff.

Covington & Burling: The firm sent out a video explaining that there are no current plans to conduct either layoffs or compensation cuts to attorneys or staff and that the firm is well-positioned to weather an economic downturn. The message went further and reminded everyone that the firm didn’t need to perform any cutbacks during the last financial crisis, bolstering its credibility on this point.

Sidley: The firm was early on the work-from-home train and carried that over to resisting austerity measures. No layoffs or cuts on the horizon at this point. Additionally, the firm says it will pay summer associates for the number of weeks they agreed to work at Sidley and continue to offer a summer program even if it has to be online.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Greenberg Traurig: Reports are that the firm is offering a good deal of transparency about the firm’s financial position and have assured attorneys that they will not lay off people there has been no word about salary cuts at this point. Greenberg Traurig got flack for not raising salaries in the past despite strong profitability numbers, but that also means the firm wasn’t operating on thin margins and can absorb the current hit.

Arnold & Porter: Oops. We forgot about Arnold & Porter. From [National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2020/04/17/arnold-porter-resists-pay-cuts-as-covid-19-crisis-follows-revenue-dip/):

No large cost-cutting measures at Arnold & Porter have been publicly reported. The Am Law 50 firm’s chairman, Richard Alexander, said in a statement it has “not announced any changes to our staffing levels or compensation.” A spokeswoman confirmed late in the week that no furloughs, layoffs or compensation cuts had been made among staff and attorneys, and there had been no reductions in partner draws or distributions.

Shearman: The firm informed everyone at the beginning of April that the partnership is not planning on cutting salaries or placing any staff/attorneys on furlough. This is made possible by the [voluntary leave program](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/shearman-sterling-rolls-out-covid-19-austerity-measures/), which is an “austerity measure” but one that’s designed to keep other cuts from happening, so there’s that.

# This Law Firm Invited Everyone To Work From Portugal And I Guarantee They Have A Better 'Firm Culture' For It

Better than your office.

For Biglaw firms trying to figure out how to entice associates back to the office, have you ever considered moving the whole firm to an amazing locale for a few weeks? Because one firm spent the summer in Lisbon, Portugal.

Texas-based boutique [Vela Wood](https://velawoodlaw.com/) previously established a “[Desk Independence](https://velawoodlaw.com/global-reach/)” program, allowing employees to take a month to work from anywhere. Fueled by the success of that program, the firm took it up a notch this summer with the VW Abroad program, offering the opportunity for the team to decamp to Portugal from July 10, 2022 to August 6, 2022. Folks could head to over for two to four weeks and the firm [offered a stipend](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/this-firm-is-planning-the-ultimate-workcation-trip-abroad-for-employees/) to defray the costs for employees and their families.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
This is very much in line with the Vela Wood philosophy of travel, summed up by managing partner Kevin Vela, “We believe that travel helps people become better global citizens. And we think with that comes understand, comes awareness, and comes self actualization.” This commitment to travel formed the basis of this video highlighting the firm as a [Clio](https://www.clio.com/) customer (and obviously highlighting Clio’s ability to facilitate this model).


So bringing folks together abroad was a logical move. And the firm got a great response per a memo sent earlier in the summer:

So far, over 20 employees are participating – approximately 50% of the firm’s employees. Many are bringing their spouses, partners, parents, and kids of all ages to bring the total number to more than 50 individuals. The firm has also invited clients to meet the team in Lisbon this summer. Vela Wood plans to host weekly events with members of the local startup community as it seeks to foster entrepreneurship around the world.

And it doubled as an opportunity to build business. Perfect all around trip.

Unsurprisingly, Vela Wood sees this as the first of many VW Abroad programs.

Not every firm is going to be able to do something like this, but whenever a firm complains about lawyers not showing up to the office, the justification is usually some song and dance about “building firm culture.” If that’s the purpose, consider sending a team or department to some cool, new location for a week or two. They’ll come out the other side more united from working in unfamiliar surroundings than their entrenched offices.

Not for nothing, a firm is much more likely to get people to come in on a random Wednesday when they know they’re going to see the folks they bonded with for two weeks in Prague or whatever.

Unless all that big firm talk about “office culture” is just a pretense to cover deep insecurities over feeling a loss of control… but I’m sure it’s not that.

# Biglaw Partners' Satisfaction With Their Pay 'Remains Robust'
## Only a tiny percentage of partners are 'very dissatisfied' with their pay.

Attorneys make a lot of money in [Biglaw]. And I think they’re well aware of that, and for the most part, feel good about it.

— [Karen Andersen](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/karen-andersen?byconsultantorauthor=karen-andersen), a partner in Major, Lindsey & Africa’s partner practice, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/10/19/partner-pay-is-up-but-pronounced-differences-remain-between-cities/), concerning MLA’s biannual [Partner Compensation Survey](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/insights/research/2022-partner-compensation-survey), which was published earlier this week. Overall, partner pay is up, but compensation differences across cities “continues to be pronounced.” When it comes to partners’ satisfaction with their salaries, around 29% of respondents said they were “very satisfied” with their pay, while 35% said they were “moderately satisfied,” and 11% said they were “slightly satisfied.” (Compare these numbers with the partners who weren’t as happy with their pay: about 8% said they were “slightly dissatisfied,” 6% said they were “moderately dissatisfied,” and 4% said they were “very dissatisfied.” Six percent of Biglaw partners surveyed were “neutral” as to their pay satisfaction.)

Earlier this month, we reported that it was only a matter of time before more Biglaw partners would be forced to cut their draws and distributions to stave off the pain caused by the novel coronavirus. In fact, law firm management consultant Patrick McKenna said he’d be surprised if [at least 80 percent of the top 200 firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/more-biglaw-firms-to-cut-partner-draws-before-resorting-to-layoffs-furloughs/) in the country hadn’t made such a move by the middle of April, noting that “a typical reduction is in the range of 30 percent.” We’ve got to give him a lot of credit, because his prediction continues to ring true.

Today, we have news on a firm ranked just outside of the Am Law 100 that’s decided to make a move on partner compensation for the benefit of all its employees.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

A confidential source tells us that Lowenstein Sandler is slashing its partner distributions so the firm can safely ride out the COVID-19 financial roller coaster that’s soon to come. Here are the details that we received:

At a video town hall meeting attended by over 500 employees last Friday, Lowenstein Sandler Chair Gary Wingens announced that the firm had a very strong March, yet had substantially reduced distributions to its equity partners in order to preserve liquidity for what it expected to be a bumpy second quarter. While he hoped to not have to make other cuts, Wingens made it clear that they were watching their metrics very carefully over the coming weeks.

When reached for comment by Above the Law, firm management confirmed Wingens’s comments, but did not specify the percentage cuts partners were taking. We hope this move is enough to guide the firm through what’s sure to be a rough time.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs/Salary%20Cuts) or text us (646-820-8477).

# Judge To Register As Sex Offender After Pleading Guilty To Stealing Panties

Next time a judge asks to review your briefs, keep in mind that he may mean it quite literally.

In March 2018, Suffolk County District Judge Robert Cicale was arrested after breaking into a former intern’s home, rummaging through her hamper, and stealing a pair of her panties. At the time of his arrest, the judge was found with other [“soiled female undergarments”](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Judge-Underwear-Thief-Home-Robert-Cicale-Arrest-New-York-478405363.html) in his pockets, “from other times [he] went into the house.” Cicale was charged with second-degree burglary and pleaded not guilty, despite having already admitted that he’d stolen the panties. He was immediately placed on leave suspended from the bench (with pay, of course).

Late last week, Cicale pleaded guilty to a lesser felony charge of second-degree attempted burglary. According to District Attorney Timothy Sini, considering the fact that Cicale “violated the law, the public’s trust and the victims’ sense of security,” the disrobed judge’s guilty plea “holds him accountable for his actions and serves justice.”

Cicale’s attorney says his client is a new man. [Newsday](https://www.newsday.com/long-island/crime/robert-cicale-pleaded-guilty-panties-1.36282106) has additional details:

“Judge Cicale accepted responsibility for his actions today,” [Michael J.] Brown said. “He has served the people of Suffolk County honorably for the last 26 years, as a Legal Aid attorney, Town of Islip attorney and a district court judge. He has dealt with his mental illness issues in a proactive manner and is a better person for doing so.”

Cicale will be sentenced November 15, and it’s expected that he will receive five years of probation under which he’ll have to register as a sex offender.

# What Will It Take For Federal Judges To Expand Their Clerkship Hiring Pool?

I have been hearing that certain federal judges will [stop hiring graduates](https://davidlat.substack.com/p/a-prominent-federal-judge-declares) of a name-brand law school whose alumni include trial judge extraordinaire [Chamberlain Haller](https://www.abajournal.com/gallery/favorite_movie_television_judges/1500). I am not going to discuss the events that led to this although I will suggest that if the dean wants to get back in these judges’ good graces, she must publicly use the raw power of her position to effectively and immediately put the house back in order.

Time will tell as to whether this will change the status quo, particularly since a feeder judge has not (at least not openly) announced a similar ban. But this would be a good opportunity for all federal judges to at least consider hiring graduates of other law schools outside of the usual suspects.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The hiring process for clerkships is complicated. I think it is safe to assume that every federal judge has more clerkship applications than they know what do to with. As a result, they can be selective about who to interview, even if it means excluding most law schools. On the other hand, the candidates they are seriously considering are probably going to be considered by other judges as well. So some federal judges will have to negotiate and wait while applicants consider their options. In the end, they may not hire their first or second choice.

A good number of federal judges want to be (or continue to be) feeder judges with records of sending their clerks to the Supreme Court. Being a feeder judge has its advantages, such as avoiding the hiring hassle described above. They will get more applications from highly talented applicants who want a Supreme Court clerkship. Also, they have a far better chance of hiring the people they want. In addition, being known as a feeder judge sets them apart from their colleagues and gives the impression that they are going places.

It seems like there are two ways to change the system. The first is to change the hiring process and, more importantly, the hiring culture. I do not think that judges should punish an entire law school by not hiring its graduates. Instead, judges should be encouraged, praised, and rewarded for giving underdog candidates a chance. For some reason, this is seen as a risk.

Those who don’t care about being a feeder judge are probably in the best position to widen the hiring net. Of course, they are still going to hire only the top students who come with demonstrated research and writing skills along with exemplary faculty recommendations. They will not likely get a clerkship at the high court, but at least they get a biglaw job as a consolation prize.

But what about feeder judges who may have [supreme ambitions](https://www.amazon.com/Supreme-Ambitions-David-Lat/dp/1627220461)? Is it worth it to give a solid candidate from an average law school an unprecedented clerkship opportunity if it means possibly lowering the chances that the Supreme Court will hire your clerks? Those who go with the status quo might rationalize their decisions by stating that they will make changes when they become a justice. Looking at the current track records, the odds of that happening seem low.

The other way to disrupt the clerkship hiring process is to appoint and confirm judges who will hire clerks from a broader range of schools. The president should nominate a graduate of a nonelite school if politically feasible. During the confirmation hearings, Senate judiciary committee members should get a promise from the nominee that he or she will hire at least one clerk from a nonelite school on a regular basis. This should start at the Supreme Court level so that judges from district and circuit courts can cater to each justice’s personal preferences in order to increase their chances of getting the coveted feeder status.

The late Chief Justice Rehnquist only hired three law clerks every term. And one of them came from a law school that isn’t from the usual 14. But no one has followed his example. I suppose that fear, loyalty, and even snobbery could be involved. It should not take a controversy for a judge to consider other law schools for clerkship opportunities.

# A Step Backwards For Financial Transparency In Biglaw

Closing the gates on financial disclosure?

In the legal world, as well as the world more generally, the trend is in favor of transparency. Technological advances, including but not limited to social media, make it much easier to share information — and much harder to hide it.

Here at Above the Law, we help bring greater transparency to the often opaque legal profession. This enables lawyers and law students to make more informed decisions about their legal careers and their lives.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
But the move towards transparency does not proceed uninterrupted. A few steps forward are sometimes followed by a step backward. For example, the ABA is thinking about requiring [less rather than more disclosure](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/first-monday-musings-by-dean-vik-amar-a-guided-tour-through-the-debate-over-changing-the-aba-employment-data-form/) from law schools when it comes to graduates’ employment outcomes (a move that it’s currently [reconsidering](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/08/14/aba-will-reconsider-recent-change-to-way-it-counts-law-grad-jobs/), after significant [criticism and public outcry](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/aba-takes-giant-step-backwards-on-transparency/)).

A similar development is happening in the world of Biglaw: [K&L Gates](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/kl-gates/), a firm that has long prided itself on financial transparency, is now moving in the opposite direction. After four consecutive years of [publicly posting its financial statements](http://www.klgates.com/aboutus/financials/), the firm has closed the gates on such disclosure.

An observant reader pointed out to me that K&L Gates posted its 2015 financials in March 2016, along with a [press release](http://www.klgates.com/files/Upload/2015_Firm_Financials.pdf). For 2017, we’re now in August, and the firm has yet to post its 2016 financials.

And don’t expect it to post them — ever. We reached out to the firm, which responded through a spokesperson: “K&L Gates did not issue a press release with its financial results for the 2016 financial year, and instead provided financial results for the year directly to Am Law.”

But sharing financial information with Am Law is not the same thing as sharing it with the public — including firm clients, employees, and recruits. The Am Law 100 rankings contain only specific pieces of information, such as revenue per lawyer and profits per equity partner, and do not offer the comprehensive picture of a firm’s financial health that full financial statements do.

Why did K&L Gates previously disclose its financials? Here’s its explanation, from the firm website page entitled [“Our Financial Transparency”](http://www.klgates.com/aboutus/financials/):

At K&L Gates, we believe that open and honest communication regarding a law firm’s financial health is an essential part of building strong and durable relationships with clients.

In an effort to achieve greater transparency, in 2013 our global law firm voluntarily disclosed a detailed account of the firm’s 2012 financial results, a first among U.S.-based law firms. In keeping with our commitment to release this information on an annual basis, we repeated this disclosure for the next three years. This dedication has led our firm to possess one of the most transparent business models of any law firm in the world.

Whoops, scratch that! During the time that I was writing this story, the firm took down the “Our Financial Transparency” page. Not so transparent! (But you can see what the page used to look like via [Archive.org](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.klgates.com/aboutus/financials/).)

Was K&L Gates’s move away from “open and honest communication” driven by a desire to hide bad news? The firm conducted [significant layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/nationwide-layoff-watch-150-to-200-jobs-is-a-lot-of-jobs/) in [February 2017](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/nationwide-layoff-watch-banished-beyond-the-gates/), which is never a good sign, and suffered [high-profile partner departures](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/why-are-so-many-partners-walking-out-the-kl-gates/) in 2016. But when you look at the firm’s financial results as reported in Am Law, K&L Gates actually had a fairly good 2016: revenue [grew by almost 11 percent](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202784880457/Pa-Firms-See-Mixed-Fortunes-in-2017-Am-Law-100-Rankings?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL), revenue per lawyer grew by 13 percent, and profits per partner [grew by 17 percent](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202784617547), breaking the $1 million mark.

It’s worth noting, however, that future years might not be so golden for K&L Gates. Its 2016 results were helped by a large, one-time contingency fee award of [$210 million](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/good-news-out-of-the-kl-gates/). So perhaps it was smart to cut back on disclosure this year, despite a strong 2016, in anticipation of an ugly 2017 (and maybe beyond).

And here’s another possibility: perhaps reduced transparency is part of the post-[Peter Kalis](http://www.klgates.com/peter-j-kalis/) era. The iconic Biglaw leader ended his two-decade tenure as leader of K&L Gates this past February, and he was a driving force behind the firm’s transparency. Check out this YouTube video of Kalis (while you still can), [The Importance of Transparency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEXWQw6fmyY), or read this great [2012 memo of his](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/09/everything-is-great-kl-states-peter-kalis-comes-out-swinging/), in which he shut down negative rumors about K&L Gates with detailed data about firm finances.

It seems that [Kalis’s successors](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/it-takes-two-to-fill-the-shoes-of-peter-kalis-at-kl-gates/), firm chairman [Michael Caccese](http://www.klgates.com/michael-s-caccese/) and global managing partner [James Segerdahl](http://www.klgates.com/james-r-segerdahl/), don’t share their predecessor’s commitment to candor. Maybe this will be good for K&L Gates — or maybe it won’t. As Justice Louis Brandeis [famously observed](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Louis_Brandeis), “Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.”

# Lawyers Should Delegate More Nonlegal Work To Nonlawyers
## It is important to create boundaries, and delegate matters to brokers or other professionals who are more qualified to take on a task.

When people attend law school, they have a fairly distorted view of what lawyers actually do on a day-to-day basis. Indeed, when I was in law school, I thought I would spend all of my days in court, kind of like the lawyers I saw on television and in movies. In reality, the practice of law can be pretty boring sometimes, and in many instances, lawyers need to complete nonlegal work that does not require any kind of legal training. In many situations, lawyers should delegate more nonlegal work to nonlawyers so that attorneys can focus on the legal work at hand in a representation.

One of the main reasons why lawyers should give nonlegal tasks to nonlawyers is because other professionals may be better suited to handle certain parts of a representation than a lawyer. Attorneys often need to rely on accountants, private investigators, and other skilled individuals in order to best serve a client, and it is okay to assemble a team so that a client’s interests can be best served during a representation.

For instance, I once had a case in which I had to track down and depose a witness to an incident who moved out of town. I tried my best to hunt this person down on Google, public records searches, and all of the other resources I had available to me, and only after a great deal of effort was I able to track this person down. The next time I had to track someone down like this, I hired a private investigator to complete the leg work for me. The private investigator was able to easily find this person, and it is likely that the private investigator charged less than the billable time I spent on the matter. By using the services of another professional, I likely protected the client’s bottom line and avoided some headache on my end.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In some situations, lawyers should delegate nonlegal work to nonlawyers to establish boundaries and ensure that they are dealing with matters that are in the purview of legal counsel. Like many attorneys, every so often I will handle a real estate closing. Usually, a variety of professionals are involved with closings, including title people, brokers, banking professionals, and others. Often, clients will ask their attorneys to arrange matters that should properly be handled by brokers, such as scheduling walkthroughs and other on-the-ground information about the property. When I first started handling this line of work, I was much more likely to handle this work myself.

However, it is important to create boundaries, and delegate matters to brokers or other professionals who are more qualified to take on a task during a deal. I am sure many of us did not think we would be arguing about air conditioning cleaning and other matters when we decided to be lawyers, and only certain discreet matters in real estate transactions and other similar matters involve legal issues that should be handled by lawyers. It is important to set boundaries so that a lawyer’s time is not wasted on matters that could be handled by others and ensure that the professional that has the best skill in an area is handling a task.

Even within law firms, lawyers sometimes take it upon themselves to perform nonlegal tasks even though other professionals are available to assist lawyers with this work. This may be because lawyers know that they can bill for the time spent on such administrative tasks to clients, or there is no other work available to more junior lawyers so that more senior lawyers give junior lawyers chores that do not involve legal training in order to pass the time.

For instance, I once worked at a law firm that did not have much legal work for a period to keep the lawyers in our office busy. What ended up happening is that partners started hogging work that should have been performed by senior associates, and senior associates started hogging work that should have been performed by junior associates. As a result, there was little left for junior associates to do other than administrative tasks. During this time, I spent days pulling and printing cases cited in an appellate brief we filed so the partner would have binders of cases with him at oral argument. Of course, these binders were never consulted once. I also did other administrative tasks that a paralegal or a legal secretary could have performed, and probably in a more efficient manner. All the while, our clients were at least partially billed for time that could have been completed by staff that had a much lower billable hour rate.

All told, lawyers often need to complete work that does not require a legal education, but attorneys should minimize such tasks as much as possible. This allows lawyers to be more efficient and bring more value to their clients.

# Biglaw Firm Makes Monday A Fun Day With Special Bonuses And Salary Increases
## This is a great way to start the week!

If you’re an associate who’s got a major case of the Mondays, there’s nothing that’ll boost your motivation like an announcement that not only will your firm be raising salaries across the board for all associates but it will also be doling out special bonuses (for some).

Kasowitz Benson Torres had a bit of a rough go of it in 2020, having taken out a PPP loan (one which the firm has [not yet disclosed](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/07/08/am-law-firms-get-210-million-in-ppp-loans-forgiven/) if it’s been forgiven), but finished up the year with $219,396,000 gross revenue, landing it in 142nd place in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking. The firm is just now getting around to joining peer firms for special bonuses and commensurate salary increases.

According to a memo sent earlier today, Kasowitz will be moving to a national firm-wide salary scale, and it’s a Davis Polk match. Here’s what it looks like at the firm:



The firm will also be matching the Davis Polk scale for special bonuses, ranging from $12,000 total for the class of 2020 to $64,000 total for the class of 2014 and beyond (plus counsel). These bonuses will be payable in two installments (one in September 2021 and one in January 2022), and apply only to New York attorneys.

As far as we’re concerned, it’s always better late than never when it comes to compensation matters. Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the next page to see the memo from Kasowitz Benson Torres.)

We depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

She’d love to hear from you, so please feel free to [email](mailto:staci@abovethelaw.com) her with any tips, questions, comments, or critiques.

# Biglaw Firm Does Good In A Big Way: Gibson Dunn Secures Major Win For George Floyd Protester Injured By LAPD Officer
## This is the first time a verdict has been secured against the LAPD arising from the George Floyd protests.

In the wake of George Floyd’s 2020 murder by a police officer, mass protests broke out across the country in response to police brutality and racism. Hundreds upon hundreds of peaceful protestors were injured by police through their use of excessive force during this time. One of them was [Deon Jones](https://twitter.com/deontjones), 31, who works in entertainment and brand consulting in the Los Angeles area. Jones was shot in the face with a rubber bullet by a police officer, sustaining injuries that save for the grace of a few millimeters, could have blinded or even killed him. Thanks to a Biglaw firm’s pro bono representation, Jones just won a first-of-its-kind verdict that may serve as a blueprint for future civil rights cases.

[Gibson Dunn](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/gibson-dunn/), a firm that’s currently ranked at No. 11 on the Am Law 100, took the lead in representing Jones, with lawyers from the firms New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., offices getting involved to help secure a win. [Orin Snyder](https://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyer/snyder-orin/) — one of the firm’s most senior attorneys, who is widely recognized as one of the country’s leading trial lawyers and litigators — guided the case to a landmark victory. Yesterday, a federal jury determined that LAPD officer Peter Bueno had violated Jones’s civil rights in the shooting, finding Bueno personally liable for Jones’s injuries. Jones was awarded $375,000 ($250,000 in actual damages and $125,000 in punitive damages).

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-03-09/jury-protester-injured-by-lapd-projectile) captured Jones’s reaction to the verdict being read:

Jones listened with his head bowed as a judge read the jury’s decision in a Santa Ana courtroom. Afterward, he said it was “a good day.”

“This victory isn’t just mine. It is for all the folks who historically have went out and protested,” Jones said. “It sends a message that … law enforcement cannot brutalize folks.”

“This is the first time anyone has sued and successfully obtained a verdict against the LAPD arising from the 2020 demonstrations,” Snyder said of his client’s victory. “The verdict sends a powerful message that the police cannot trample the constitutional rights of peaceful protesters. We hope the verdict will lead to meaningful reforms in how the police approach demonstrations in the future.” This is not just an exceptionally meaningful win for civil rights advocates in California, but all across the country.

Gibson Dunn’s pro bono representation of Jones in this case is part of the firm’s broader racial justice initiative, reaffirming its commitment to advancing racial justice and equity. In fact, Gibson Dunn’s largest client is its pro bono practice, and last year, the firm did about $135 million in pro bono work for causes and clients that include racial justice, free speech, immigration, LGBTQ rights, women’s rights, and international human rights.

[Katie Marquart](https://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyer/marquart-katie/), Gibson Dunn’s pro bono chair, offered this statement:

“This case and this client hold a special place in our hearts. It is cases like this that remind all of us why we became lawyers. We have been working on this case since June 2020. We have given all that we had to fight for Mr. Jones and for the rights of protesters to be free from excessive force. We are so deeply grateful for this jury verdict.”

Jones was featured as a vocalist in Glenn Kaino’s exhibition, [“In the Light of a Shadow,”](https://massmoca.org/event/glenn-kaino-in-the-light-of-a-shadow/) at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art. Please watch his incredibly moving performance of “Sunday Bloody Sunday” here:


“We have a powerful platform and we are privileged when we are able to use it to further causes we all care deeply about, like we did in the case on behalf of Deon Jones,” Marquart said.

# All The Attorneys We Lost In 2018... To Other Law Firms

One of the best parts of any awards show is the annual “In Memoriam” multimedia extravaganza where an industry honors those it’s lost over the last year. The human highlight reel of accomplishments demonstrates just how much of a debt the present owes to the individuals who’ve departed.

Similarly, there are more than a few law firms looking around their offices wondering whatever happened to the star talent that once populated the halls. Law360 took stock of [the firms most ravaged by attrition](https://www.law360.com/newyork/articles/1159070/the-firms-that-lost-the-most-attorneys-in-2018) — mostly lateral attrition — over the last year. Consider this an “In Memoriam” for these firms watching their human capital move on.

LeClair Ryan: Attorney headcount down 18.2 percent. Partner headcount down 14.2 percent.

If those numbers look bad, know that the equity partner numbers look worse. Law360 reports that LeClair Ryan’s equity ranks have dropped by 60 percent. Still, the firm just opened a Dallas office and seems committed to turning this crisis into an opportunity for a leaner practice. Time will tell whether or not that works out for them.

Winstead: Attorney headcount down 10.9 percent. Partner headcount down 1.9 percent.

For Winstead, the mantra might be that less is more. Even though the firm shed a number of attorneys in the ongoing assault of large national firms luring talent away from established Texas firms, Winstead posted its second-highest profits ever last year.

Knobbe Martens: Attorney headcount down 10.8 percent. Partner headcount down 7.2 percent.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Intellectual property law in America may be a mess overall, but one of its successes over the last few years is the advent of the PTAB process to streamline patent disputes. Unfortunately, this does put a dent in the need for armies of patent attorneys.

Lathrop Gage: Attorney headcount down 9.5 percent. Partner headcount down 11.4 percent.

Don’t let the numbers fool you, this firm is in growth mode, having expanded in Boston and Los Angeles and having added a Dallas office this year. It just happens to be that the losses have outpaced the growth over the last four years. Still, with revenue up, Lathrop might be getting the better end of the flow.

Jenner & Block: Attorney headcount down 9.1 percent. Partner headcount down 13.8 percent.

From Jenner’s perspective, 2018 was the exception that proves the rule. Beyond the snapshot of last year, the firm’s been growing and even expanded internationally in 2018 — something not captured by the U.S. headcount numbers.

# With Layoffs Looming, Associate Lateral Moves Have Practically Flatlined
## Biglaw's got some overcapacity problems.

As layoffs continue to plague Biglaw firms this summer, has anyone stopped to wonder why? Back in June, [Kate Reder Sheikh](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/kate-reder-sheikh), a legal recruiter for Major, Lindsey & Africa, [noted](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/reed-smith-cuts-50-lawyers-and-staff-as-big-law-layoffs-continue) that some firms were facing overcapacity among their ranks [due to a lack of attrition](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/the-biglaw-layoffs-are-far-from-over/) (or “bloated payrolls,” as she put it).

Now, we have even more hard evidence on Biglaw’s overcapacity: while lateral moves for partners have neared record highs, lateral moves for associates are almost at a standstill. Paired with a decrease in demand, of course this is leading to associate layoffs.

The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/08/01/associate-lateral-moves-remain-depressed-even-as-partner-moves-bounce-back/) has additional details on these lateral woes thanks to some newly released data from Decipher Investigative Intelligence:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The second quarter of this year was the second busiest for partner moves from 2017 to 2023, with 1,265 moves, just 4% below the 1,322 moves in the second quarter of 2022, according to Decipher.

On the other hand, the data shows associate moves in the second quarter were down 43% to 2,797 from 4,904 in the same period in 2022, and down 5% compared to the six-year average from 2017 and 2023.

Overall, lateral moves in the U.S. were off 41% year-to-date, mostly due to the reduction in associate moves, though the discrepancy narrowed a bit in the second quarter, as moves were off 50% after the first quarter, according to Decipher chief data officer Greg Hamman.

So, what’s going on here? “Firms are still in the midst of rebalancing their headcounts at the associate level,” Hamman told Am Law. “Rebalancing” is a really polite way of saying that many Biglaw firms are letting associates know that they’ve overstayed their welcome.

Hopefully things will improve soon, and more associates will not only be able to feel confident enough with market conditions to make a lateral move, but to remain with their firms without fear of being laid off.

It’s a good thing lawyers love law firm rankings, because there are tons of them. Every year, there’s a whole new crop of these rankings to obsess over. Aren’t you getting tired of them? No, of course not. Lawyers love rankings more than they love money (okay, maybe that’s taking it a step too far).

You’ve seen the [Am Law 100](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/a-deep-dive-into-the-2021-am-law-100-rankings/) ranking. You’ve seen the [NLJ 500](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/the-500-largest-law-firms-in-the-united-states/) ranking. You’ve seen the [ALM Global 100](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/the-global-100-the-richest-law-firms-in-the-world-2021/) ranking. You’ve seen the [Vault 100](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/vault-100-rankings-the-most-prestigious-law-firms-in-america-2022/) ranking. You’ve seen the [Vault Best Law Firms to Work For](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/vault-quality-of-life-rankings-the-best-law-firms-to-work-for-in-america-2022/) ranking. You’ve seen the [Working Mother Best Law Firms for Women](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/elite-firms-recognized-by-working-mother-magazine-2021/) ranking. You’ve seen the [Law360 Glass Ceiling Report](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/the-glass-ceiling-report-law-firms-say-they-support-women-but-are-nowhere-near-closing-the-gender-gap/) ranking. You’ve even seen the U.S. News Best Lawyers® Best Law Firms ranking.

But have you ever seen a ranking of the best law firms in the U.S. from two of Instagram’s top influencers on Biglaw associate culture? Here’s your chance.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Before we get to the [Industry Pulse Top 50 Law Firms](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVLn7O-vQjp/?utm_medium=copy_link), let’s discuss the creators of the new ranking, Biglaw meme connossieurs [Big Law Boiz](https://www.instagram.com/biglawboiz/) and [Non-Equity Partner](https://www.instagram.com/nonequitypartner/). Here’s what they say about themselves, in their own words:

Since their inception, @BigLawBoiz and @NonEquityPartner have existed primarily to entertain, distract and represent a voice of the shared experience of young professionals. In pursuit of that mission, we have been fortunate enough to use our platforms to provide much-needed transparency into an otherwise-opaque industry which has historically thrived on information asymmetry among its constituents. Our platforms grant us unparalleled access to many thousands of young lawyers across firms, practice areas, seniority levels and geographies. Our unique, personal access to associates allows us to measure the true “pulse” of the legal industry. It is a responsibility we do not take lightly.

And what is the methodology behind this new Instagram-based ranking? Here is a statement Big Law Boiz and Non-Equity Partner provided to Above the Law:

In our inaugural Industry Pulse List, which ranks the Top 50 Law Firms in the U.S., we attempt to provide visibility into the current competitive landscape of the legal industry. Our sincere hope is that this list provides our stakeholders — from practicing attorneys, to law students, to legal talent professionals — with a more clear picture of what to expect in the legal field so they can make more informed, empowered career decisions.

Our data-driven ranking methodology is a product of years of research based on user feedback, literature reviews, trends in our own data, availability of new data, reviewing other published rankings and engaging with leading industry professionals. We found that the rankings provided by traditional publications reflect a notion pervasive across the legal industry: “we do things this way because this is how it has always been done.” The same names continuously appear in more-or-less the same spots across all lists.

The Industry Pulse List seeks to reward firms that reject this mentality. The firms that saw the greatest variance from their entrenched positions among other ranking lists have demonstrated a willingness to innovate. Examples of influential factors include the adoption of legal technology, alternative fee structures like ‘flat fee,’ recognizing diversity of thought, authentic efforts to recognize and support attorneys’ mental health issues and a demonstrated commitment to attorney development. We hope the advent of this ranking system spurs law firms to adopt a more forward-thinking approach.

# Big Takeaways From The Am Law 100 Profits Per Equity Partner Ranking

The Am Law 100 doesn’t drop with the same fanfare as the U.S. News rankings of law schools, which is a shame because there’s actually a lot more interesting data lurking in the annual law firm rankings. The [“classic” Am Law 100 figure based on gross revenue](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/04/26/the-2022-am-law-100-ranked-by-gross-revenue/) revealed [a whopping 52 law firms topping $1B in revenue last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/all-the-billion-dollar-biglaw-firms-a-look-at-the-am-law-100/), but there are some hidden goodies in the companion partner profit ranking.

Profits Per Equity Partner, or “the artist formerly known as ‘PPP’ before law firms started assembly line minting income partners out of what used to be ‘Counsel,'” isn’t really a measure of partner compensation — firms use some profits to reinvest and, of course, we’ve officially reached [the twilight of the era of lockstep partnership](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/cravath-announces-major-change-to-partnership-model/) (that said, [we have notable holdouts](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/new-debevoise-leader-touts-value-as-firm-sticks-to-lockstep)). But it’s still a useful window into overall firm success.

So here are the big takeaways we found perusing the [Am Law PEP data](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/04/26/the-2022-am-law-100-ranked-by-profits-per-equity-partner/).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
That Looks Better!

The Am Law 100 revenue numbers may be the preferred Sorting Hat for law firm prestige, but they produce some janky results. Firms can elbow themselves into the top echelon of firms simply by getting very, ver(ein) big. Throw enough satellite offices at the problem and you can build a massive money-making Death Star that doesn’t necessarily reflect the firm’s gravitas in the legal market.

Likewise, the revenue numbers bury firms like Wachtell at 45 and Cravath at 52. No offense to the other firms in the 40s and 50s but, um, they’re not Wachtell or Cravath.

PEP shakes a lot of that out. Here are the top 10 in partner profits:

Firm	PEP
1. Wachtell	$8.4M
2. Kirkland	$7.388M
3. Davis Polk	$7.01M
4. Sullivan & Cromwell	$6.366M
5. Paul Weiss	$6.162M
6. Simpson Thacher	$5.980M
7. Cravath	$5.803M
8. Quinn Emanuel	$5.746M
9. Latham	$5.705M
10. Cahill	$5.533M
That looks a lot more like it.

Just How Good Was 2021?

The answer is [pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_05qJTeNNI). Average PEP was up 19 percent across the Am Law 100 in 2021 and some firms really blew it out of the water last year.

Cadwalader was up a whopping 71.6 percent, Dechert is up 49.6 percent, Fenwick up 31.5 percent, and Shearman is listed as up 58.4 percent. The Baker McKenzie verein is up 35.8 percent and Akerman is up 36.1 percent.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
It wasn’t as good for a few firms that went backward, though. Crowell Moring took a 25.1 percent dip, however that may be more of a reversion to the mean after posting the biggest jump in PEP among the whole Am Law 100 last year. The other firms posting negative year-over-year numbers were firms with specialist identities, IP firm Fish (down a mere 6 percent) and immigration giant Fragomen (down 14.4 percent).

The Big Bucks

A total of three firms have a PEP figure over $7 million, with only Wachtell topping $8 million. The top five firms are all over $6 million, top 14 over $5 million, 23 over $4 million, 38 above $3 million, 56 over $2 million, and 91 clock in over $1 million. The smallest PEP to make the top 100 is Littler with $621K.

Speaking of Lockstep

There may be a hot lateral market right now, but notable lockstep partnership firms are still out there and still doing reasonably well for themselves. Wachtell is obviously doing just peachy and Debevoise sits at 14 with PEP of $5,011,000.

Margins…

Finally, you have to go all the way down to 18th to find a firm with a profit margin below 50 percent and to 35th to find one below 40 percent (or 30 percent as Orrick is at 26 percent). Just going to show that when everyone frets about rising associate salaries, there’s still a LOT of slack at the top of Biglaw to cough up an extra few grand.

Anyway, there’s a lot more in these charts to unlock. Take a look.

# Elite California Firm Offers Market-Busting Bonuses To Associates
## Holy crap! These bonuses are bountiful!

Yesterday afternoon, we asked if any associates were [pissed off about this year’s bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/are-you-pissed-about-your-bonus-youre-not-alone/). Instead, we heard from some associates who were incredibly pissed about last year’s bonus, and thrilled out of their minds about this year’s bonus. The law firm we’re talking about is Irell & Manella, the prestigious California firm that was once known for its above-market bonuses.

Here’s what an associate had to say about the firm just [last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/associates-at-this-firm-are-really-pissed-about-their-bonuses/): “For years, Irell was dominant on the compensation front. People came to Irell because Irell could not be beat compensation wise. That is no longer true.” This year, associates’ gripes about compensation have likely changed, due in part to its market-busting bonuses.

This time around, Irell has matched the Cravath scale, and sweetened the pot by adding a “good year” bonus on top of that. Associates report that everyone seems pretty happy, with one remarking that “[t]here’s an expectation each year that Irell will beat market, but I don’t think anyone expected them to do it by this much.” So, just how much did Irell beat the market by? Check out the firm’s bonus scale:

Holy crap! That’s quite the bonus haul for Irell associates who were complaining about low morale and depression among their colleagues just year. Congratulations!

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. Remember: as soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. You can also text us at 646-820-8477. We look forward to hearing from you.

# The 2023 Biglaw Diversity Scorecard: More Progress Amid A War On DEI
## Biglaw firms continue to push forward when it comes to diversity.

Year in and year out, we watch law firm after law firm pay lip service to their commitment to diversity in the legal profession, with promises to recruit, retain, and promote more minority attorneys. If there’s ever going to be any real change in the legal industry, diversity has to be more than just a buzzword — it must be a priority at every law firm. And last year, it was. There is once again some news worth celebrating when it comes to law firm diversity, which is very exciting.

According to the American Lawyer’s 2023 Diversity Scorecard — a ranking that tracks racial and ethnic diversity across firm leadership, equity partners, and other attorneys at Am Law 200 firms and beyond — there was [quite a bit of progress](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/05/31/the-2023-diversity-scorecard-ranking-the-legal-industry/) over the past year. This is refreshing to see after 2021’s [record-breaking progress](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/05/31/big-laws-record-breaking-diversity-gains-show-industrys-commitment-to-progress/), which saw the biggest year-over-year improvement since 2001. Let’s take a look at 2022’s numbers:

For the second year in a row, minority lawyer populations grew at a rate that significantly exceeded the average annual growth rate of the past decade. Minority attorney representation grew 1.4% to 21.6% of attorneys at firms surveyed. Minority partners now represent 13% of all law firm partners, up 1.1% from 2021. Minority lawyers now represent 28.1% of nonpartners, an increase of 1.4%.

Underrepresented minority groups such as Black and Hispanic lawyers also saw some of the biggest year-over-year increases in representation in the past decade. Black attorney representation rose 0.3% to 4.2% of all attorneys, with Black partner representation up 0.2% to 2.5% of all lawyers and Black nonpartners gaining 0.3% to 5.5% of the total lawyer population surveyed. Hispanic lawyers also were up by 0.3% to 5.1% of the total with Hispanic partner representation rising slightly to 3.5% and Hispanic nonpartners up 0.4% to 6.8% total representation.

More than 1% growth may seem small, but it’s still something worth cheering for — especially during a time when anti-DEI laws are spreading across the country.

# Biglaw Firms Are Raising Salaries And Cutting Jobs At The Same Time
## It's not a good look.

I think firms should focus on revenue growth instead of cutting overhead. That is a better long-term strategy. But if they are going to lay people off, cutting staff while at the same time raising salaries for associates certainly sends a message.

If firms don’t part with people the right way, it opens them up to criticism. Law students are looking at sites like Glassdoor and seeing not just what associates are saying about the firm, but what the staff is saying as well. It is such a small and connected world.

— [Deborah Farone](https://deborahfarone.com/about/), legal consultant and founder of legal marketing firm Farone Advisors, commenting on the [rash of staff “rightsizing”](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/07/06/fewer-positions-younger-workers-how-law-firm-staff-changes-are-shaping-up/) that’s currently in progress across a number of Am Law 100 firms.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Tell The Scrivener The Intended Audience
## Things that are written for an ignorant public audience will be very different from things written for internal readers.
By [Mark Herrmann](https://abovethelaw.com/author/mark-herrmann/)

Shares[](https://twitter.com/share?url=https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/tell-the-scrivener-the-intended-audience/&text=Tell%20The%20Scrivener%20The%20Intended%20Audience)[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/tell-the-scrivener-the-intended-audience/&display=popup&ref=plugin&src=share_button)[](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/tell-the-scrivener-the-intended-audience/)[](javascript:void(""#ea-share-count-email""))
When you’re drafting a document, the audience matters. You say different things, in different ways, to different people.

Here’s a corollary: When you ask someone to draft a document, tell the person who the intended audience is. Otherwise, it’s inconceivable you’ll receive a useful draft.

Suppose another lawyer at your corporation emails you: “Please send me a short description of the [Jarndyce](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/3562292006481135279) case.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Easy enough. The lawyer knows generally about the Jarndyce case, so there’s no need to repeat the basic facts. The lawyer is by definition a lawyer, so it’s permissible to use words like “collateral estoppel” in your note. And surely the lawyer wants forward-looking information, so you’ll include some thoughts on what’s likely to happen in the case over the next few months.

You send the email and the lawyer writes back: “I think you should simplify this. I want to send a status report to business leaders, and this doesn’t hit the mark.”

Of course it doesn’t hit the mark! It wasn’t aimed at that mark because you didn’t specify that mark when you asked for the memo.

This time around, the email will be quite different. The email will remind everyone, in simple language, what the case is about, when it was filed, when it might go to trial, and other basic information. Not a peep about “collateral estoppel” in this document.

Or you receive this response to your original email: “I think you should simplify this. It’s for use as a press release.”

Oh! That’s entirely different!

A press release has nothing in common with either of the first two emails. Now, you need some information: Are we issuing this press release unprompted? Or are we using the statement only reactively, in response to a press inquiry?

In either event, things that are written for an ignorant public audience will be very different from things written for internal readers.

The words you write will vary depending on who the readers are.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Just as you would never write a document without thinking about your audience, never ask for a draft without telling the scrivener the nature of the intended audience.

There’s an old saying: “If you don’t know where you’re going, you’ll probably end up somewhere else.”

Here’s the corollary: “If you don’t know who you’re writing for, you’ll write the wrong thing.”

When you’re asking people to prepare written documents, tell them the audience for the piece.

# Performance Improvement Plans: The New Way For Biglaw Firms To Conduct Stealth Layoffs
## A new way of showing associates the door.

It may be the middle of summer, but many Biglaw firms are still trying to slim down (in terms of head count) in any way they can. Hence, the rise of the midyear review, which inevitably leads to associates being put on performance improvement plans (PIPs), a process that could later [leave associates jobless](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/the-rise-of-midyear-reviews-that-could-leave-associates-jobless/).

Is this Biglaw’s new modus operandi for stealth layoffs?

“Right now, I do think PIPs are being used in a way they haven’t been used in the past in giving firms a strategy to facilitate layoffs without having to call them that,” Summer Eberhard, a partner in Major, Lindsey & Africa’s associate practice group, said during an interview with the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2023/07/14/mid-year-reviews-performance-plans-create-pretext-for-future-layoffs/). Here are some additional insights:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In the same way Big Law firms evolved to use stealth layoffs in lieu of admitting overhiring and overcapacity, performance improvement plans have become another favored method of managing head count at some law firms.

“It used to be that, in pre-pandemic years, it was hard to get a review done. Associates would be like, ‘I was supposed to have my review in December and I haven’t had it,’ it’s because they’re doing fine. Everything is going at status quo,” said Jessica Chin Somers, managing director at Kinney Recruiting. “What we’ve seen here is more firm leadership calling or more reviews, a half-yearly review they would call it. … They’re letting people go based on those ‘performance reviews’ even if they’re performing fine.”

We’ve reported on several firms that have made associate cuts following so-called performance reviews ([Kirkland & Ellis](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/stealth-layoffs-strike-once-again-at-worlds-wealthiest-biglaw-firm/); [Ropes & Gray](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/top-10-biglaw-firm-is-conducting-merits-based-reviews-that-have-resulted-in-job-cuts/); [Goodwin](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/goodwin-is-conducting-performance-reviews-that-have-resulted-in-job-cuts/)), but associates are now being quite vocal on social media when it comes to PIPs and ensuing job loss — and they’re not happy about it.

“PIP might be one of the most terrible things law firms have come up with,” one associate wrote on Fishbowl. “How do we fire people in a few months if market conditions don’t improve while covering our ass from wrongful termination lawsuits and still extract as much sweat as we can from these people? PIP.”

Is your firm using performance improvement plans to show associates the door? We certainly hope not. Good luck out there, everyone.

# Kirkland Sends Announcement To Salary-Hungry Associates... About Office Return Date

The stand-off between Milbank and the firms that have adopted its new salary scale and the rest of the market sitting around waiting continues. This was all so easy when everyone just played follow the leader with Cravath, but now the legal landscape drags out these salary debates like [the end of a Morricone film](https://twitter.com/JosephPatrice/status/1491090995269746691) with every day another tension-building close-up.

Kirkland associates thought the wait was over this morning when they got a firmwide email from the Firm Committee. Alas, it was not to be, with the firm just telling everybody when to commence hybrid work.

Beginning Tuesday, March 29, we will move to a hybrid workplace model where attorneys and staff will be expected to be present in the office on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
With associates waiting anxiously to hear about their salary situation, it’s not the best time to send an all-hands email announcing anything other than a salary boost. If you need an example of why, consider that the firm is moving forward with a three-day in-office model and associates are, as one tipster put it bluntly, “displeased.” Imagine telling lawyers in the Fall of 2019 that they could work from home on Mondays and Fridays and associates being anything but deliriously overjoyed?

But it doesn’t matter how generally good the news is, when associates are mentally paying off their loans, nothing matters but the money.

Why is this so difficult for firms to understand? We covered this back in December when [Latham decided to announce gift baskets before bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/latham-still-hasnt-announced-bonuses-but-has-offered-associates-a-gift-basket/). The same principle applies: the only firm management subject on the table right now is money, so don’t blast them about anything but money.

A few firms have caught a little side-eye for sending “no raises now… but we’ll match whenever the dust clears” memos, but as far as I’m concerned these are the firms that GET IT. Until the firm settles the money situation — even if they settle it by not settling it — there’s no way to address any firm business without coming across as out of touch and a little insulting.

No one really thinks Kirkland is poised to stiff associates. They’ll ultimately make good on salary and then almost certainly offer a bit of a premium on bonuses (some years [it’s more of “a bit” than others](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/kirkland-bonuses-2021/)), but what’s the value in gliding by the 900-lb. money-flinging gorilla?

All it does is irritate people unnecessarily.

Biglaw firms have been matching new compensation schemes left and right since earlier this month, so associates at top firms that have been silent on salaries thus far are getting pretty antsy. Where’s the money, you mofos? Well, at one firm that literally goes by MoFo, the money has finally arrived.

We’ve now confirmed that Morrison & Foerster — a firm that brought in $1,264,600,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 38 in the most recent Am Law 100 — has chosen to use the Cravath scale for its compensation increases, meaning these are the salaries associates at the firm will see, effective January 1, 2024:



Congratulations to everyone at MoFo!

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of compensation updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus/Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus/Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks for your help!

# Am Law 100 Firm Rolls Back Salary Cuts, Pledges To Repay Employees In Full
## This is very welcome news.

Yet another Biglaw firm has walked back some of its COVID-19 austerity measures. Back in April, Pillsbury — a firm that came in 62nd place in the most recent Am Law 100 rankings, with $677,320,000 in gross revenue in 2019 — announced a series of pay cuts designed to avoid layoffs. First, the reduced partner monthly draws by a minimum of 25 percent. Then in May, the firm reduced associate and counsel compensation by 20 percent and cut all staff compensation by up to 15 percent for those who make more than $100,000 and by 10 percent for those making between $75,000 and $100,000 (with chief officers volunteering to take higher reductions, commensurate with those of partners).

Now, the firm is not only rolling back the cuts, but its repaying all employees who lost money during the height of the coronavirus crisis. From the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/08/20/more-firms-are-partially-restoring-pay-but-full-salaries-may-wait-until-2021/):

Pillsbury said in a Thursday statement that its financial performance in the first and second quarters was strong. “Consequently, all reductions in compensation incurred in the first half of 2020 are being repaid in full and we are reducing all temporary salary reductions,” the firm said.

The adjusted salary cuts for Pillsbury associates and counsel are now 15%, down from 20%. For staff making more than $100,000, the pay cut is 10%, down from 15%, and for staff making between $75,000 and $100,000, the pay cut is 5%, down from 10%.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
We believe that Pillsbury is the first firm to commit to repaying all of its employees in full for the money they lost due to the salary cuts. (Others have offered “bonus” payments as repayment, but not as an across the board policy.)

Congratulations to everyone at Pillsbury. This is great news for a great weekend.

# Biglaw Firm Hands Out Piles Of Special Bonus Money To Hard-Working Associates
## Wow. Exciting news!

As we wrap up a whirlwind week of Biglaw bonus announcements thanks to [Willkie Farr](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/willkie-spring-bonuses-2021/) and [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/), we’ll note that it’s not quite done yet, because Biglaw firms are still thrilling their associates with even more money.

It’s not just Friday at this firm, it’s more like FriYAY, because much to everyone’s excitement, special bonuses were just announced.

Gunderson Dettmer — a firm that you may recall as being the O.G. of Biglaw salary raises — has matched the prevailing Davis Polk special bonus scale. Here’s what that looks like at the firm (full memo available on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/gunderson-special-bonus-2021/2/)):

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  


Gunderson will be paying out its bonuses in May and September, for all U.S.- and Singapore-based associates and counsel who have annualized at least 1950 billable hours. If anyone misses the cutoff for either period, but finishes the year with 1950 or more hours, they’ll receive an amount equal to what their bonuses would’ve been back in the spring and fall. But wait, there’s more: these special bonuses won’t impact any forthcoming year-end bonuses at the firm.

What happy news. Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/gunderson-special-bonus-2021/2/) to see the full memo from Gunderson Dettmer.)

# Biglaw Firm Hands Out Raises For All -- But Keeps First-Years At $190K
## Interesting recruiting strategy....

Biglaw firms continue to race to raise salaries in the epic quest to secure some of the lateral talent that’s floating around in this incredibly hot legal job market, but unfortunately, not every firm is raising associates up to the Davis Polk scale and not every firm uses a lockstep salary scale. Arent Fox is one of those firms.

With $333,600,000 gross revenue in 2020, Arent Fox placed 107th in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking. During the height of the pandemic, almost everyone at the firm took some [pretty big salary hits](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/lawyers-at-am-law-200-firm-looking-at-pay-cuts-of-up-to-30-percent/), ranging from 25% for associates and staff all the way up to 60% distributon cuts for partners. But now, associates’ fortunes are changing when it comes to what they make.

From what we understand, the firm recently announced “market adjustments” to salaries for second- through ninth-year associates, and sources tell us that the “vague email” made it seem like any increases would be individualized. Even though the firm isn’t matching Davis Polk’s shiny new salary scale, our Arent Fox insiders tell us that the last time the firm raised salaries, folks received about $15,000 more in their wages. Here’s what one tipster from the firm had to say:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
I get that Arent Fox didn’t match, but after a lot of negativity following the salary cuts during COVID, I really appreciated the gesture from the partnership. And the gesture wasn’t hollow either. I’m generally satisfied with the raise I received — it was still five figures. I don’t want to reveal what my increase was, but I’m at least closer to Cravath scale for my year.

But sorry, first-years — according to the firm, you’ll be kept at $190,000 “for now.” That’s an interesting way to enter on-campus recruiting season in just a few weeks. Let’s see how that works out for the firm.

In other news, Arent Fox is introducing a big adjustment to its productivity bonuses, which will now range from $15,000 to $75,000 for those who bill at least 1950 hours this year. Sources seem pretty pumped about this.

Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

# ATL Holiday Card Contest: The Finalists! (2023)

Hanukkah is here, Christmas is nearly upon us, and everyone in the legal profession is ready to ring in the New Year, so it’s finally time to reveal the seven finalists for our fifteenth annual holiday card contest. But first let’s give shout-outs to some honorable mentions (click on each firm’s name to see its card):

1. [Armond Wilson](https://armondwilson.com/wp-content/uploads/2023HolidayCard.jpg): “Who says patent litigators don’t have a sense of humor?” our nominator asks. This firm’s Wes Anderson-inspired holiday card is certainly enough to make you chuckle.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
2. [Diaz Trade Law](https://diaztradelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Happy-Holidays-DTL.png): Our nominator has strong feelings about this firm, and tells ATL, “Each year CBP lawyers like the ones at DTL singlehandedly save Christmas by getting cargo ships FULL OF PRESENTS un-stuck at the border. If that doesn’t deserve a place in the finals, I don’t know what does.”

3. [Patterson Belknap](https://holidaycard.pbwt.com/2023): This firm is in a New York state of mind — and so is its holiday card. This year, the firm is making donations to [NYC’s Coalition for the Homeless](https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/) and [Children’s Aid](https://www.childrensaidnyc.org/), and you should too.

And now, the seven finalists, in alphabetical order. Again, click on each firm’s name to view its card. Please note that most of these cards have SOUND, so you might want to turn your sound off or down, or use headphones. Explanatory comments come from firm representatives unless indicated.

1. [Butler Snow](https://vimeo.com/892726321/47beaee810): “This year’s holiday card provides viewers with a behind-the-scenes look at what it would actually look like if you invited 400+ lawyers to provide feedback on a firm’s holiday message (or anything, really…). It’s the perfect example of why these sorts of things are best left to a firm’s marketing department.” To be honest, this is perfect, and the firm’s card earned a big laugh from us over the final editing comment: “Do you think we should submit this to Above the Law?” We also loved the lawyerific fine print at the end of the video, specifically, “No representation is made that the quality of this holiday greeting is greater than the quality of holiday greetings provided by other law firms.” This is truly excellent work!

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
2. [Davis Wright Tremaine](https://www.dwtholiday.com/): “Continuing the tradition of elevating our creativity game every holiday season, this year our in-house videography team headed north to a remote lake in Alaska, accompanied by British “snow artist” Simon Beck, who creates incredible (and evanescent) landscape drawings in the earth using only his snow shoes. Racing against time (and the setting sun), our team shot the spectacular footage you see here, in which Beck strode across the frozen lake to create a beautiful, filigreed version of our firm logo. Nothing here was created with AI or After Effects, it’s all natural light and straight photography. Except, of course, for the phrases rising up against the glaciers….” Beautiful!

3. [Faegre Drinker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNkT0Qa1Ibw): The firm’s holiday card offers a “lighthearted take on generative AI tools, that emphasizes the importance of certain things being done in person.” Very cute concept here that’ll help lawyers realize the robots won’t be taking over the thank-you card industry (yet).

4. [Falcon Rappaport & Berkman](https://highlight.xyz/mint/656e90b515f119b945152e17): “Our holiday card is compelling because it is a digital token that encapsulates the spirit of the season and serves as a token of our firm’s appreciation to our clients. Like our namesake falcon, our holiday card represents that we are here to help you soar above the blockchain industry’s changing winds.” Wow, this is definitely a first for the ATL holiday card contest. To mint your very own FRB Holiday Card NFT, click the link above.

5. [Larson • King](https://www.larsonking.com/larson-king-holiday-card-2023/): “This small but mighty Minnesota boutique litigation firm is proud of their great state and capital city. Despite being cold 9 months of year, the firm is able to enjoy the winter months and enjoys promoting fun in the snow. This year the story starts with AI telling the cast of characters where to go on a road trip. AI tells some them wonky route and some wacky roadside attractions to visit instead of the regular tourist destinations. The Minnesota cast includes the state bird – a loon, The University of Minnesota Gopher, a wolf, and a moose and the famous ox, Babe. The road trip winds through the state to the tune of Holiday Road from National Lapoon’s original vacation opening title sequence.” Yet another great entry from a firm that’s graced our finals 10 times.

6. [McBrayer](https://www.mcbrayerseasonsgreetings.com/): “This year, as we celebrate our 60th anniversary and look forward to the future of our firm, we asked our attorneys for their new year’s resolutions. What is assembled here are our individual wishes for the year to come: some sincere, some tongue-in-cheek, and everything in between.” Another strong entry from the McBrayer. From lawyers vowing to join the NBA and get NIL deals to lawyers promising not to print two one-sided copies of the state budget, this one has some surprise laughs.

7. [Rakower Law](https://vimeo.com/892006473?share=copy): “If this card does not make you smile, nothing will. It is creative, clever, and comical. Oh, and also charitable.” Rakower Law does it again with this amazing Cameo appearance from Kevin Pollack, who channels his inner Christopher Walken, William Shatner, and Christopher Lloyd. Recipients of the card can also [choose which charity](https://neeozihosting.com/ecard2023/) the firm should donate to this year. Great job!

Now it’s time for our audience to vote. We’ll keep the polls open through SUNDAY, DECEMBER 31, 2021, at 11:00 p.m. (Eastern time). This gives you ample time to campaign for your pick over the holidays (but don’t cheat).

VOTING HAS ENDED.

Thanks to all the entrants and nominators, good luck to the finalists, and happy holidays to all! Above the Law is happy to celebrate holiday cheer with you!

# Developing The Story Of Patent Litigation: Q&A With Cooley's Ellen Scordino

In law school, [Ellen Scordino](https://www.cooley.com/escordino) was drawn to the narrative aspects of the profession. Trained as a chemist, she originally planned to focus on regulation but quickly decided that, first and foremost, she wanted to be a trial attorney.

Trial lawyers, of course, have a story to tell. And Scordino brings to bear her experiences at Copley Pharmaceuticals and Purdue Pharma — her understanding of how both new and generic drugs get made — to bear on her practice. In 2014, Scordino joined Cooley LLP — recently named [one of the top life sciences patent law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/wilson-sonsini-wilmerhale-and-cooley-top-new-life-sciences-law-firm-index/) by Lake Whillans, Above the Law and MedCity News — in Boston.

Talk about your scientific background and how it has shaped your approach to the law.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
I started at a generic pharmaceutical company as an analytical chemist and learned how they go about development and identifying the right formulation that will match the branded drug’s profile. I then moved to a branded company, Purdue Pharma, and worked there for several years. Although it was technically the same job — supporting formulation development — the analytical methods and development work were very different.

Having a pharma industry background when you work on Hatch-Waxman cases or cases for that industry, you understand the technology very well, and you also understand what the story is. To be successful in litigation, you have to be able to convey a good story. Having experience in the industry allows me to flesh that out and go beyond the technical and scientific aspects of the patent, with a focus on the importance of the drug to a particular patient population and/or community.

You’ve been with Cooley for just over two years now. How is the firm’s life sciences practice different from other law firms?

Cooley has represented life sciences companies of all sizes for 35 years. They might be public, they might be private, but they’re all sizes and span a broad industry spectrum: folks right at the beginning of finding a new chemical entity that’s going to treat a certain disease state to someone who says, “There’s a chemical entity out there, and we’ve found either a new use for it or a new way to deliver it that will make a difference to patients.” That spectrum of clients is a little bit different from what I was used to at my prior firms.

What folks don’t know about Cooley is that it really does have a robust Hatch-Waxman practice. We’ve had several settled and several ongoing Hatch-Waxman cases where we’ve represented the branded pharmaceutical company. We’re involved in arbitrations and other disputes that come with representing smaller companies that may have out-licensed their molecules or compounds. We work with those companies from patenting at the R&D stage through the licensing stage, and if there’s a dispute about the license, we’re there as well. It’s a robust practice that has a lot of different tentacles that allow us to holistically approach our clients. That’s a distinguishing feature with Cooley.

It’s fun to be part of teams that really work hard from the infancy of the company. They could go public or they could be out-licensing, but we work with them from start to finish.

What trends do you see in the pharmaceutical industry?

There have been interesting trends with companies researching and developing new delivery systems for old drugs or new indications. Statistically we see many more of these types of filings with the FDA.

What about within patent litigation?

We are seeing more inter partes review proceedings. The pharma-biotech industry perhaps lagged a couple of years behind the high-tech companies in embracing the challenge procedures that were set forth in the America Invents Act, but now it is not uncommon. I’m involved in several IPRs filed by defendants in conjunction with Hatch-Waxman litigation. Those can be used as settlement leverage or simply to open the space when there’s no non-infringement defenses.  They do change the dynamics between parties and might make settlement discussions more forthcoming.

Biosimilars and the biotech industry are filing IPRs a little bit differently. Pharma and generic companies are filing them generally after the Hatch-Waxman case has begun. For biotech companies, the trend seems to be in favor filing the IPRs in advance of their own regulatory filing: Just by example, a biosimilar company like Coheris BioSciences is challenging a bunch of Humira patents before, or as, they’re doing their regulatory filing to help clear the path.

In traditional patent litigation in district courts, the average number of cases is still, at least for 2014-2015, increasing. There was a 68 percent increase in Abbreviated New Drug Applications compared to the previous five years. It’s still a fertile practice area. There was a period of time when people thought Hatch-Waxman cases would decrease and the world was moving toward biologics and biosimilars. I don’t think we’ve seen that.

# The Am Law 100: Biglaw Gets Bucked Off At Rough Revenue Rodeo
## Things are looking mighty different for Biglaw financials.

The past several years have been a roller coaster ride for Biglaw. First came the ups and many, many downs of COVID in 2020, followed by 2021’s “post”-COVID land of riches, including raises for associates coupled with a booming lateral market. Then came 2022, a time when law firms were coming off the highs of the year that was and realizing that what goes up — in this case, their revenue — was likely going to come down thanks to geopolitical turmoil, inflation, a possible recession, and ever-rising interest rates.

Today, the American Lawyer released its Am Law 100 law firm rankings — a closely watched list of the elite, prestigious, and highly influential law firms that represent the very best of what the legal profession has to offer. The highlights from the report reveal a mixed bag for the top Biglaw firms in the nation, with more than half of them seeing revenue percentage declines (59 firms in all). Compare this to 2021, when every single firm on the Am Law 100 had an increase in gross revenue over 2020.

While some firms came out on top, others were merely surviving. How did the Am Law 100 stack up?

Here’s an overview of how Biglaw’s best performed in 2022:

- Gross revenue: $131 billion, up by 2.7%
- Average revenue per lawyer: $1.15 million, down by 1.9%
- Average profits per equity partner: $2.56 million, down by 3.7%
How did we get here? Blame deal work, or the lack thereof. From [Am Law](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/04/18/a-step-back-but-still-ahead-an-analysis-of-the-2023-am-law-100/):

“Transactional practices softened for many firms,” longtime legal consultant at Zeughauser Group, Kent Zimmermann, says. “As early as the spring of 2022, and for other firms later in the year. Firms where their practice mix is heavily weighted towards transactional sales, those slowed down the most, with some excellent firms that missed their budget last year for the first time in years.”

The slowdown in deal work from 2021 was expected, and in some cases welcome, after a banner but exhausting year.

In order to handle that work, many firms brought on more talent (hence the increased headcount in a down revenue year for most firms) in 2021 and are still on the hook for compensating those additional bodies.

And when the work dried up, the firms felt it in their profitability numbers.

Now, the moment you’ve been waiting for: the top 10 firms in the gross revenue rankings, and the top five firms for the RPL and PPP rankings.

Gross Revenue

The top 10 firms by gross revenue appear below, with Kirkland remaining the kind of cash in the top spot for the sixth year in a row. The full Am Law 100 gross revenue chart can be found [here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/04/18/the-2023-am-law-100-ranked-by-gross-revenue/).

- Kirkland: $6.514B (no change)
- Latham: $5.321B (no change)
- DLA Piper: $3.685B (no change)
- Baker McKenzie: $3.300B (no change)
- Skadden: $3.020B (no change)
- Sidley: $3.922B (+1)
- White & Case: $2.282B (-1)
- Morgan Lewis: $2.745B (+2)
- Gibson Dunn: $2.736B (+2)
- Ropes & Gray: $2.718B (+2)
Revenue Per Lawyer

As for RPL, which provides a relatively accurate picture of a firm’s overall financial well-being, we’ve got five big name players strutting their stuff. As noted by Am Law, RPL “took a tumble” in 2022. The full Am Law 100 revenue per lawyer chart can be found [here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/04/18/the-2023-am-law-100-ranked-by-revenue-per-lawyer/).

- Wachtell: $3.54M
- Sullivan & Cromwell: $2.14M
- Cravath: $1.96M
- Kirkland: $1.90M
- Paul Weiss: $1.88M
Profits Per Partner

This is where all of the magic happens. We can see that Kirkland finally knocked Wachtell out of the top spot on this list. The full Am Law 100 profits per partner chart can be found [here](http://www.americanlawyer.com/home/id=1202758259924).

- Kirkland: $7.51M
- Wachtell: $7.29M
- Sullivan & Cromwell: $5.98M
- Paul Weiss: $5.72M
- Davis Polk: $5.55M
We will undoubtedly have even more to say as we dig into these numbers. But what’s clear is Biglaw had a a difficult year, and 2023 is looking rough as well. Best of luck to those who are able to stick it out.

# A Deeper Dive Into The Vault 100 Rankings Of The Most Prestigious Law Firms In America
## Where does your law firm fall -- and is it time for you to upgrade your platform?

Biglaw prestige is what economists (or law-and-econ types) would call [“sticky,”](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price_stickiness.asp#:~:text=%22Sticky%22%20is%20a%20general%20economics,input%20cost%20or%20demand%20patterns.) i.e., resistant to change.

(Why is this the case, and is it a good or bad thing? For a detailed discussion, see this excellent [post](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/alt-legal-the-stickiness-of-biglaw-prestige-and-the-disruptive-potential-of-technology-part-i-of-ii/) by the always insightful Joe Borstein — who will be interviewing me over at [Litera.tv](https://www.litera.com/litera-tv/) at 12 p.m. today.)

If you question the stickiness of Biglaw prestige, just take a look at the new [Vault 100 ranking](https://www.vault.com/best-companies-to-work-for/law/top-100-law-firms-rankings) of the most prestigious law firms in America, which Vault issued last week. Let’s start with the top 10:

- [Cravath, Swaine & Moore](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/cravath-swaine-moore-llp) (no change)
- [Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/skadden-arps-slate-meagher-flom-llp-and-affiliates) (+1)
- [Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/wachtell-lipton-rosen-katz) (-1)
- [Sullivan & Cromwell](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/sullivan-cromwell-llp) (no change)
- [Latham & Watkins](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/latham-watkins-llp) (no change)
- [Kirkland & Ellis](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/kirkland-ellis-llp) (no change)
- [Davis Polk & Wardwell](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/davis-polk-wardwell) (no change)
- [Simpson Thacher & Bartlett](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/simpson-thacher-bartlett-llp) (no change)
- [Gibson Dunn & Crutcher](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/gibson-dunn-crutcher-llp) (no change)
- [Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/paul-weiss-rifkind-wharton-garrison-llp) (no change)
Eighty percent of the top 10 firms stayed in exactly the same place as last year — and that’s not unusual. The general rigidity of the Vault rankings, especially near the top, is why Wachtell Lipton and Skadden Arps trading the #2 and #3 spots, to Skadden’s advantage, constituted [“historic drama,”](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/vault-100-rankings-the-most-prestigious-law-firms-in-america-2021/) to quote Staci Zaretsky.

Until this year, the #1 and #2 spots went back and forth between just two firms, Wachtell Lipton and Cravath, this year’s #1. Cravath has occupied the top spot [since the 2017 Vault rankings](https://www.vault.com/blogs/vaults-law-blog-legal-careers-and-industry-news/vaults-top-100-law-firms-for-2017), when it ended Wachtell’s 13-year reign at the top. (June 2016, when those 2017 Vault rankings came out, was also the month in which Cravath announced the [$180K pay scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) — but Cravath’s taking the #1 spot can’t really be attributed to gratitude from Biglaw associates for the pay raise, since the surveys used for calculating the 2017 rankings were completed much earlier in 2016.)

And it’s not just the top 10. Looking at the entire ranking of 100 firms, only 34 firms moved two or more spots in either direction — meaning that two-thirds of the firms in the Vault 100 either saw no change in ranking or went up or down by just a single spot (at least by my count; please correct me if I’m wrong).

There’s enough gloomy news out there in the world right now, so for purposes of today, let’s look at the positive side of the ledger: the biggest gainers in the 2021 Vault 100 rankings. Here are the 17 firms that moved up by two or more spots this year, ranked by the size of their jump (with the two newcomers listed at the end):

- [Mintz](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/mintz-levin-cohn-ferris-glovsky-and-popeo-pc) (+10, from #96 to #86)
- [Goodwin](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/goodwin-procter-llp) (+7, from #37 to #30)
- [Willkie](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/willkie-farr-gallagher-llp) (+7, from #51 to #44)
- [Perkins Coie](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/perkins-coie-llp) (+6, from #49 to #43)
- [Vinson & Elkins](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/vinson-elkins-llp) (+5, from #63 to #58)
- [Holland & Knight](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/holland-knight-llp) (+5, from #64 to #59)
- [Fenwick](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/fenwick-west-llp) (+5, from #78 to #73)
- [Cooley](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/cooley-llp) (+4, from #28 to #24)
- [Faegre Drinker (post-merger)](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/faegre-baker-daniels-llp) (+4, from #95 to #91)
- [Winston & Strawn](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/winston-strawn-llp) (+3, from #43 to #40)
- [Greenberg Traurig](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/greenberg-traurig-llp) (+3, from #56 to #53)
- [Norton Rose](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/norton-rose-fulbright-llp) (+3, from #66 to #63)
- [Davis Wright](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/davis-wright-tremaine-llp) (+3, from #90 to #87)
- [Foley Hoag](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/foley-hoag-llp) (+3, from #98 to #95)
- [Sheppard Mullin](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/sheppard-mullin-richter-hampton-llp) (+2, from #74 to #72)
- [Troutman Pepper (post-merger)](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/troutman-pepper-hamilton-sanders-llp) (from not ranked to #81)
- [Gunderson Dettmer ](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/gunderson-dettmer-stough-villeneuve-franklin-hachigian-llp) (from not ranked to #90)
What can we say in general about these firms? The Vault Law Editors made [this observation](https://www.vault.com/blogs/vaults-law-blog-legal-careers-and-industry-news/introducing-vaults-2021-top-100-law-firms):

The 2021 Vault prestige rankings saw the rise of West Coast firms—more than one-third of firms that moved up two or more spots in the Vault Law 100 were based in either California or Washington state: Cooley LLP (No. 24); Perkins Coie LLP (No. 43); Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton LLP (No. 72); Fenwick & West LLP (No. 73); Davis Wright & Tremaine LLP (No. 87); and Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian, LLP (No. 90).

I would expand upon this observation by noting that many of the firms with the most momentum, at least as reflected in the Vault rankings, are forward-looking and future-focused, no matter where they are located. They tend to be strong in growing and vibrant sectors like technology, life sciences, and healthcare. This is true of the West Coast firms mentioned by the Vault editors, but it’s also true of some of the firms on the list that did not originate on the West Coast — like Mintz and Goodwin, both Boston-founded firms, but known across the nation (and beyond) for their expertise in healthcare and life sciences.

The Vault Law Editors gave a special shout-out to Cooley, noting that “[i]n addition to its Top 100 jump, the firm also launched seven spots in the New York regional ranking to settle at No. 33 and moved into the top 30 in the Washington, DC, ranking.” And this isn’t the first year in recent memory that has been good for Cooley. In 2014, for example, Cooley [climbed 10 spots](https://www.cooley.com/news/coverage/2014/cooley-makes-major-move-on-vaults-100-most-prestigious-law-firms-list), more than any other firm, to break into the top 50. Now, just six short years later, Cooley is a top 25 firm.

And I’d expect Cooley to continue climbing next year. Associates tend to reward compensation leaders when filling out Vault surveys; last year, for example, after [leading the way to $190K](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/), Milbank [jumped 15 spots](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/milbank-makes-big-move-to-no-25-in-vault-prestige-rankings) and entered the top 25. So Cooley, which just led the way in announcing both [“appreciation bonuses”](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cooley-bonuses/) and 2020 year-end bonuses that won’t be lower than 2019 year-end bonuses, should be shown some love by associates filling out Vault surveys next year. (Even if Cooley’s scale was subsequently exceeded by other Biglaw firms, like [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/) and [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/milbank-bonuses/), as well as elite boutiques, like [Hueston Hennigan](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/another-elite-firm-affirms-their-commitment-to-the-top-of-the-bonus-scale/), it’s not clear that any of these other firms would have acted if Cooley hadn’t kicked things off.)

So that’s a look at the Vault 100 rankings from the firms’ perspectives. What do these rankings mean for associates who work at these firms?

In general, the more prestigious firms enjoy higher profits per partner, for those who make partner, and better exit opportunities (including in-house opportunities), for those who don’t make partner. So if you’re a star associate in a busy practice area, working long hours for lower pay at a firm that’s lower down on the prestige totem pole, you might want to consider lateraling to a firm that’s more prestigious and pays top-of-the-market compensation.

If you’re a star associate at a Vault 100 firm who’s interested in an “upgrade” in terms of pay, prestige, and exit options, please feel free to reach out to me by email at [dlat@laterallink.com](mailto:dlat@laterallink.com). In a time when some firms are paying mid-year bonuses while other firms are cutting compensation, the difference between the Biglaw haves and have-nots is only growing — and you want to be on the right side of that divide.

P.S. Biglaw prestige might not change much, but it seems that everything else in our world is changing, and quite rapidly at that. To learn about “change management” — [defined as](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/change-management-for-in-house-counsel/) “the process, tools, and techniques used to manage the human side of change for the achievement and sustainment of a desired business outcome” — and how it can help you and your organization navigate these tumultuous times, please [register](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_i7FthgyjQA2GAvjwuyqU-g) for this free webinar I’ll be moderating next week. It will take place this coming Tuesday, September 22, and it features an impressive panel of general counsels, chief executive officers, and other leaders. Hope to see you there!

# A Legal Crisis Is Right Around The Corner And Firms Need To Step Up Now
## A wave of evictions are coming and lawyers can help by offering their services pro bono.

Housing justice is racial justice—a truth that will become all too clear in the coming months as eviction moratoriums expire. As this civil rights crisis unfolds, lawyers must act: By assisting tenants facing eviction, lawyers can help keep families in their homes and prevent a looming disaster..

In the next 60 days or so, our country will see an unprecedented wave of eviction proceedings. And a tragically disproportionate number of tenants facing the loss of their homes will be those whose health and economic stability have been hit hardest by the pandemic: low-income families of color.  COVID-19 laid bare our nation’s legacy of systemic racism and historical discrimination, as Black, Latino, and Indigenous Americans contracted the often-deadly coronavirus and lost jobs at significantly higher rates than did whites. Now, those same communities will face additional fallout from the combined forces of the pandemic and decades of housing discrimination. A perfect wave of homelessness is coming, and low-income individuals and families, particularly in communities of color, are in its path of destruction.

Throughout our nation’s history, housing discrimination has made communities of color especially vulnerable to eviction and all the calamities it brings. The pandemic underscored, exacerbated and further stoked the flames of underlying historical racial inequities, disproportionately impacting those who live at the intersection of race and poverty.  Starting in the 1930s, government-backed redlining made it nearly impossible for families of color to get mortgages, much less at the favorable rates and low down payments available to whites. The Federal Housing Administration in the 1930s and 1940s excluded Black Americans from participation in the Home Owner’s Loan Corporation programs, which helped white families buy homes they might otherwise have found unattainable. When Congress passed the G.I. Bill, which provided unprecedented post-World War II opportunities for veterans to purchase homes and build family wealth, it largely excluded Black veterans. Restrictive covenants likewise kept people of color out of white neighborhoods, further limiting their opportunities to participate in the postwar real estate boom. In all of these ways, our country blocked Black families from acquiring homes and building the kind of wealth that could be passed to succeeding generations. Shut out from home ownership, Black Americans and other people of color were left to rent their homes — making them victims rather than beneficiaries of the near-constant rise in property values. Eviction is the leading cause of homelessness, and it is no coincidence that homelessness disproportionately affects communities of color.  In Los Angeles, just nine percent of the population is Black, yet of the more than 1,200 people who die on the streets each year for lack of shelter, about 35 percent are Black.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Now, with millions of families of color behind on their rent amid the pandemic — a crisis that, again, has disproportionately affected people of color — a wave of evictions threatens to further devastate these communities and put countless more families on the street. But we have the power to combat that threat. Lawyers can and must step in to represent tenants facing eviction, ensure that landlords follow the rules, and help tenants navigate the complicated maze of emergency rent-relief programs — many of which remain awash in undistributed funds.

This will benefit tenants and landlords alike, helping tenants stay in their homes while also using these undistributed funds to make landlords whole.   It would be the height of irony, inefficiency and cruelty for tenants to be evicted and for landlords to lose access to all that back rent while $46 billion of Congressionally allocated rent relief funding remains undistributed. Effective representation makes it far more likely that those funds will be used for their intended purposes, avoiding pain for all involved.

Lawyers can help avert disaster in other ways, too. They can help prevent ruinous default judgments, represent tenants in mediation proceedings, work out payment plans, turn past-due rent into consumer debt rather than grounds for eviction, and prosecute landlords who engage in illegal lockouts and other unlawful pressure tactics. And all of this will have incredible follow-on effects: Health outcomes will improve, children will perform better at school, and families will have the chance to find new jobs — all because a good lawyer got involved. A robust pro bono effort alone will not solve homelessness or our housing crisis, but it is one of many important ways to start the effort.

So the message to our community of attorneys is simple: volunteer. Seek out a local legal-aid provider and get to work. By doing so, you can keep families in their homes, keep families off the street, and ultimately save lives.

The Los Angeles legal aid community has produced a video that is being distributed among lawyers across Southern California. Celebrity voices urge attorneys to see the connection between racial justice and housing justice, asking lawyers to lend their skills by volunteering to correct these injustices.  Mayor Eric Garcetti and actors and athletes synonymous with Los Angeles are calling upon all attorneys in the region to volunteer to defend people’s ability to stay housed. It is the best and most effective way to fight the racial injustices we have seen so tragically played out for so very long. [Here is the link to that video](https://youtu.be/hyaEVKC5bzE), which concludes with a list of, and contact information for, legal services organizations where you can volunteer.

Lawyers, get ready to step up. This is your moment.

# How To Lateral To 2 Different Biglaw Firms On The Same Day

May I present to you the curious case of Angus Duncan.

On January 17th, Hunton & Williams[ proudly announced](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180117005128/en/Hunton-Williams-Adds-Angus-Duncan-Partner-London) the hire of Angus Duncan, formerly of Winston & Strawn, to join their structured finance and securitization practice in their London office.

Also on January 17th, it was [reported](http://www.legalweek.com/sites/legalweek/2018/01/17/mayer-brown-london-insurance-practice-continues-to-shed-partners-as-duo-leave-for-clydes/) that Clyde & Co. picked up two new insurance partners in its London office from Mayer Brown: Mandip Sagoo and… Angus Duncan.

There were no typos involved and no glitch in the matrix (least not as far as we can tell). Just two Biglaw partners in the same city with the same name that, through some crazy cosmic happenstance, changed firms on the exact same day. As Law.com [reports](https://www.law.com/sites/americanlawyer/2018/01/19/dueling-angus-duncans-hit-the-london-lateral-market/) — it really was just a coincidence:

But in London, there are only two men in Big Law sharing the Angus Duncan name—and they changed firms on the same day. Surely, this was a coordinated strike.

Alas, it was nothing of the sort, said Angus James Duncan, now of Hunton & Williams.

“It’s a funny coincidence,” said Duncan, who prior to joining his new firm, Winston & Strawn and Cadwalader, also spent a decade as a partner at Allen & Overy and more than five years as an associate at fellow Magic Circle shop Slaughter and May.

The Anguses will now work a short five-minute walk away from one another. The pair have never met, and Angus James Duncan says the only other issue with his name-twin was a brief case of mistaken identity when checking into a French hotel. Fortunately, their different practice areas keeps confusion to a minimum.

Until that one time when they both planned major career moves on the same day. Weird.

# Blinded By The Benjamins?
## Keeping Biglaw lawyers happy takes more than money.

Law firm managers, take note: [yet another study](https://hbr.org/2018/02/people-want-3-things-from-work-but-most-companies-are-built-around-only-one) has come out telling us that compensation can’t be the only measure of workplace happiness.

In this instance, Facebook published the results of hundreds of thousands of answers to its semi-annual workplace survey, where all hands are asked to tell the company what they value most. The answers generally broke down into three buckets: Career, Cause, and Community.

Career is pretty self-explanatory. People love autonomy, and the feeling of being challenged, growing their skills, and driving their own professional development. And, yes, salaries and bonuses are part of that career satisfaction.

Cause is the sense of purpose behind a company. It’s what I’ve talked about in this column as [the “why”](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/why-are-you-a-lawyer-and-why-are-you-here/) of a firm. People want to have a reason for coming to work, a reason why their company exists at all. Clients want to know their work is in the hands of people who have a vision beyond generating accounts receivable.

Community is that sense of belonging, of being respected and valued. It’s that [law firm culture](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/the-culture-card-in-law-firms/) that’s so hard to create, but so invaluable to any firm that pulls it off.

Facebook asked its employees to weight the importance of all sorts of various wants and desires, and those three buckets all ended up at the top of the list. Career had a slight edge, but not enough that either of the other two categories of needs could be ignored. Career, Cause, and Community, it turns out, are a three-legged stool. Take one away, and the whole thing collapses.

Law firms are pretty good at providing their attorneys the Career leg, but let’s face it, the industry struggles mightily at providing the other two. Far too many firms have a true sense of Cause beyond making money for the partnership, which is a lousy tool for either marketing to new clients or wooing potential incoming attorneys. Some firms fare a little better at the Community-building aspect of employee retention, but too many firms’ cultures still fall in the range of non-existent to stifling.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As an industry, we are failing to consistently develop Causes and Community within our firms. Instead, too many firms focus entirely on the Career bucket, which results in either burned-out associates fantasizing about abandoning the industry to [sell fad food](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/international-lawyer-swaps-her-six-figure-job-for-a-career-in-cake-pops/2018/03/16/a33030f6-26ea-11e8-874b-d517e912f125_story.html?utm_term=.850dbd377e42), or the development and promotion of billing- and business-generating tinmen and women, devoid of heart. I like Huey Lewis as much as the next guy, but do we really want an industry staffed entirely by [Patrick Batemans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzN3qO-qc8U)?

I love numbers. I use data in my practice constantly, to refine marketing, to understand our cases better, and to generally make good decisions. Depending on what think piece you’re reading, we’re either entering, in the midst of, or leaving the era of Big Data. Data analytics are helping lawyers make better decisions, and that’s a good thing. Despite all the good that data-driven law has cultivated, though, it pains me to say that I believe a big part of the problem is that our notoriously math-averse profession has come to love numbers too much.

The problem is that we’ve become too used to using numbers as a substitute for thinking about what being at a firm means. Numbers are too easy to find, and too simple to think about. When first-years are comparing their job offers, the first thing they’re going to think about is how the salaries and billable-hour minimums match up. Laterals look at overhead figures, guaranteed salary, and bonus structures. When legal periodicals write about the major Biglaw players, we write about gross revenues, profits-per-partner, salaries, locksteps, bonuses, etc. I do it myself in this very column, since facts and figures are useful jumping-off points for discussions. Law firms are complex beasts, and the experience of being a lawyer in any particular firm is hard to describe. The default to comparing and contrasting numbers is entirely understandable. In too many cases, however, we make that both the beginning and the end of the inquiry.

I can’t count the number of times I’m spoken to senior lawyers in firms across the country the past few years who’ve lamented the shift from a people-focused industry to a numbers-focused one. Whatever the reasons behind it, an obsessive focus on billable requirements, receivables, dollars collected, and other concrete metrics can make other intangible, people-centered virtues get overlooked or affirmatively ignored.

When firms focus exclusively on the bottom line, they run the risk that lawyers will sacrifice relationships and community at the altar of money. I’ll be the first to admit I’ve been guilty of falling into the all-about-the-Benjamins trap many times myself. It’s a place that’s easy to find yourself given the availability of market financial data and dearth of data about how firms stack up when it comes to the intangibles. Compensation and cash obviously matter, and all other things being equal, attorneys are happier and more likely to stick around with higher salaries than with lower. But if cash is the only lens you use to view the world, you push further down a path toward the Gordon Gekko model of law, where greed is good, and anything else is just a distraction.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But here’s the dirty little secret of Gordon Gekko: Greed isn’t good. Greed isn’t even all that smart. Greed is an abdication of responsibility, a philosophy of deliberate tunnel vision. And as we see time and again, most recently in the Facebook study, is that pure greed doesn’t work in the long term.

Law firms are collaborations, and there’s no collaboration that can survive if key collaborators are all leaving. We need to retain critical attorneys and staff, and the only way to do that is to provide them something more than money. We need to keep developing our firm cultures, creating pockets of social trust and investment that both entice people to stay and encourage them to develop into better versions of themselves. We need to figure out reasons for our firms to exist beyond racking up billable hours.

Not many of us got into law to be the next Gordon Gekko or Patrick Bateman. I imagine most of us got our start thinking about becoming the next Atticus Finch or Erin Brockovich. At its best, law the profession does more than any other to advance justice, to cultivate relationships, to build new projects that make the world better for everyone. We’re not all going to end up doing social justice work, but we abandon that sense of purpose at our peril.

Believe it or not, lawyers are people too, and we need more than money thrown at us to keep us happy. Now, more than ever, we need to ask ourselves where our industry is going, and where we want it to actually end up.

## Kirkland & Ellis enters the associate compensation war.

Kirkland & Ellis is the richest law firm in the world. Last year, the behemoth made a staggering $6,514,300,000 in gross revenue. So they definitely have the cash on hand to keep up with the Cravaths of the world when it comes to associate compensation. And, indeed they have.

Today, Kirkland announced raises for associates. Note, unlike many of their competitors, bonus information was not shared in the raise memo, but they did indicate that would be forthcoming in the next few weeks.

This is the new salary grid at Kirkland, effective January 1, 2024:



Though the firm’s compensation grid only goes up to the class of 2018, the memo (available below) did clarify that income partners whose compensation is tied to the grid will also get raises in line with the market rate for their class year.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks for all of your help!

# Biglaw Partner On The Red Flags Of Toxic Workplaces
## Partner track and parenthood are not mutually exclusive.

In this episode, I speak with [Anne Cortina Perry ](https://jenner.com/people/AnneCortinaPerry)of Jenner & Block, and how she balances her work at the firm, her personal life, developing her practice area, and even growing her book of business. Anne shares her transition from going to law school to her road to partnership, and her own advice to people who want to take the same path. She also runs down the different red flags in a toxic work environment and how the development of the culture risk and sensitive investigations practice can help a firm.



The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

# Biglaw Mega Merger Between Quinn Emanuel and Williams & Connolly Not To Be
## W&C: There's nothing to see here!

Rumors swirled [earlier today ](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/major-biglaw-merger-news-quinn-emanuel-and-williams-connolly-are-in-talks/)hinting at a potential Biglaw merger between Quinn Emanuel and Williams & Connolly, but it seems the dream is not to be.

Despite John Quinn himself claiming that talks were underway — though in the preliminary stages — it seems to have been an epic (and awkward) misunderstanding. Think of a lovelorn singleton who believes they’re on a first date, while the target of their interest is only there for networking.

Williams & Connolly is now assuring the world they’re “just friends” with Quinn, according to a Law.com [report](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202794430659/Williams--Connolly-Denies-Plans-to-Pursue-Merger-with-Quinn-Emanuel):

“While Quinn Emanuel is an excellent law firm, we are happy just the way we are. We have no plans to merge with them or any other law firm,” Dane Butswinkas, chairman of Williams & Connolly, said in a statement after news reports of the talks Tuesday.

No one knows exactly how the misunderstanding happened. Perhaps W&C felt Quinn was a little too nouveau riche for their tastes; after all, aren’t profits per equity partner over $5 million, fueled by a penchant for contingency work, just a smidge gaudy? Or maybe W&C loves being on their own (they’ve even resisted setting up a formal second office in New York), and they’re happy to wear a [purple dress and red hat](https://www.redhatsociety.com/) whenever they want.

We may never know what really happened behind the scenes, but that won’t stop the speculation.

# Conan And The Vanishing Copyright Trial
## Will this stolen joke case actually go to trial, or is a settlement in the works?

Copyright infringement trials are rare birds. Conducting such a proceeding is very expensive. And extremely risky. And to do them right you need skilled trial attorneys who know the rules, both written and unwritten, and can present a case with enough flair to keep the jury engaged. As the last generation of lawyers, many of which who regularly tried cases, ages out of practice, the experienced trial attorney is becoming even more rare than the jury trial itself.

Verily, many copyright attorneys go through their entire careers without once darkening the doorway of a courtroom with a jury empaneled inside. Cases are filed, discovery is completed, and cases are resolved on motion or through settlement. So the opportunity to try a case to a jury, the most revered of the legal skills, is presenting itself less and less. Court records show that less than 1 percent of all copyright cases that are filed actually proceed through trial and to verdict. That is a vanishingly small percentage and an even more extreme reflection of the “disappearing trial” phenomenon that has swept the nation and is either a [tragedy](https://nyti.ms/2aNeei4) or a welcome [efficiency](https://www.law360.com/articles/1151117/jury-trials-are-in-decline-for-good-reason) depending on whom you query.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
If you were to query me, you’d find I stand with the majority, those wringing their hands, or at least languidly shaking their heads while gazing navalward, at the fact that the jury trial is now an exceedingly uncommon occurrence. Those who lament the decline of the jury trial mourn the disinclination to embrace a cherished and historic right, one important enough to be guaranteed through, and enshrined in, the Seventh Amendment. The result has been that many skilled and lauded copyright litigators in today’s landscape are more facile with a summary judgment motion than a jury instruction.

Which is a shame. The very best experiences of my own career have come during the more than a dozen jury trials that I have been lucky enough to present. Connecting with the jury, reacting to the numerous variables and unforeseen events that tend to arise during trial, and putting on a cogent and persuasive trial presentation are priceless experiences and invaluable to an attorney’s growth. So any time we see a copyright infringement case that looks like it will actually be tried to a jury, it is a cause for excitement.

In that regard it looks like we are in for a real treat later this spring, when Robert Kaseberg, a writer and comedian, will face off against late-night host Conan O’Brien and his writing team in a copyright infringement jury trial in San Diego. The case, which we [first discussed](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/surely-you-jest-copyright-and-comedy/) way back in the hazy days of 2017, includes allegations that the Conan crew stole jokes that Kaseberg had published on Twitter. The trial on Kaseberg’s claims of infringement will provide a fantastic lens for examining the the breadth of protection for jokes and the application of the Ninth Circuit’s sometimes slippery “extrinsic and intrinsic” test for substantial similarity.

Judge Janis L. Sammartino, who will preside over the big event, recently cleared the pre-trial underbrush by deciding a number of procedural issues. Her stage-setting included the rejection of a last-second motion to amend the pleadings and an attempt by the defense to bifurcate the trial proceedings.

And, in a notable pair of decisions, she also granted motions in limine seeking to bar the testimony of two of Kaseberg’s experts. One of these experts, David Barsky, Ph.D., was being proffered “to examine the pattern of jokes published by the Plaintiff that appeared in Conan monologues, and specifically whether this pattern suggested that this might be a chance occurrence[.]” This expert’s testimony did not meet the threshold for admission because it was based too heavily on unsupported assumptions and “there [wa]s simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered.” So, Dr. Barsky, who was to testify that there was no real chance that the similarities between the jokes could be coincidental, will not be addressing the jury next month, when the case is set to be tried.

Nor will Elayne Boosler, who Kaseberg hoped to present to testify as to the substantial similarity between the bits at issue. It was contemplated that she would offer “her opinion that the jokes are the same objectively, based on the fact [they have] the same premise and same punchline.” But Boosler, who is the first female to have her own one-hour cable comedy special, was rejected as an expert witness because her opinion did not properly address the Ninth Circuit’s extrinsic/intrinsic test for similarity and offered conclusions without adequate analysis.

The witness list now appears set and the trial documents are in the hands of the court. All that appears to remain are a few outstanding housekeeping decisions and then the main event, trial by jury, which is currently set to commence on May 28, 2019. Hopefully, the parties resist the urge to limit risk and exposure by settling the case — an in-person settlement conference has been set for a couple of weeks before trial — and try this engrossing dispute to a jury of their peers.

Ben Ginsberg was the go-to election lawyer for the Republican party for decades. He’s since retired from Jones Day, but he’s using his voice as a conservative expert on elections to call out the Trump campaign for sowing doubt over the sanctity of the election process. He told Rolling Stone over the summer that [Trump was lying about the prevalence of voter fraud](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-vote-by-mail-absentee-ballot-election-fraud-ben-ginsberg-1056913/). Yesterday, he put out a Washington Post op-ed titled, “[My Party Is Destroying Itself At The Altar Of Trump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/11/01/ben-ginsberg-voter-suppression-republicans/)” blasting voter suppression efforts. Ginsberg is doing everything he can to be the media-friendly model of a principled Republican.

And while it’s laudable that he’s taking this opportunity to tell an audience of liberals exactly what they want to hear, let’s just stick a pin in this rehabilitation effort.

Ginsberg never really trafficked in the nonsense conspiracy theories that the Trump 2020 campaign is peddling every morning. Or in the middle of the night, depending on whenever the candidate wrests control of his Twitter account from terrified staffers. But Ginsberg spent his entire career prominently serving candidates that have systematically eroded confidence in American elections to the point that Trump’s rantings sound plausible to the slice of the electorate he’s trying to whip into a frenzy.

He was at Jones Day when Trump 2016 hired them to work on that campaign. [What was being said under the Jones Day aegis back then](https://www.factcheck.org/2016/10/trumps-bogus-voter-fraud-claims/)?

Trump claimed “people that have died 10 years ago are still voting,” citing a report that found 1.8 million deceased people remain on voter registration rolls. But the report did not find evidence of wrongdoing, and numerous studies have found such voter fraud is virtually nonexistent.

Trump claimed there is a massive problem with “illegal immigrants [who] are voting,” citing research by Old Dominion professors who say noncitizen voters may have benefited Democrats in 2008. But a Harvard professor who manages the data used in the Old Dominion study said the data was misused and the study’s conclusions are wrong.

Finally, Trump broadly claimed that “voter fraud is very, very common,” and he has called for poll watchers to look for people impersonating voters or voting numerous times. However, numerous academic studies and government inquiries have found in-person voter fraud to be rare.

Ginsberg was already showing signs of discomfort even then. While his firm was lending its name and credibility to these ramblings, [Ginsberg did tell the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gop-braces-for-trump-loss-roiled-by-refusal-to-accept-election-results/2016/10/20/6e1de6aa-96dc-11e6-9b7c-57290af48a49_story.html?postshare=6181477004078991&tid=ss_tw) that:

“There will be Republican candidates who are winning by narrow margins and losing by narrow margins,” Ginsberg said. “The party as a whole has a collective interest in having the results upheld.”

A lovely sentiment.

At the time Jones Day was doubtless already preparing a number of challenges based on the expectation that Trump would narrowly lose. In 2012, Ginsberg was running Romney’s legal team when it was shutting down early voting locations in the hopes that it might depress poor and minority turnout in states like Ohio and coordinating the legal aspects of “ORCA” the party’s much ballyhooed voter intimidation initiative. He worked for the Swift Boat SuperPAC at the same time he worked for the Bush campaign in 2004 which was… not great.

Most notably, in 2000, Ginsberg worked for the Bush campaign that plunged America’s confidence in elections directly into the toilet by getting the state of Florida declared prematurely for Bush and getting himself played by Bob Balaban in the movie Recount. In his recent Post op-ed, Ginsberg has the gall to suggest that Democrats in 2000 hurt their credibility when they asked for one site’s results to be disregarded over “administrative error” when in actuality, the county had allowed a Republican to just put voter registration numbers on ballots that didn’t have any, which seems like a lot more than an administrative error.

The guy is the architect of a thing he personally branded as [Project Ratfuck](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/how-gop-resegregating-south/) that re-gerrymandered the South to give Republicans the massive local advantages they enjoy today. Got to admit, that one was kind of a clever long-con — a tactical alliance between the Congressional Black Caucus and Republicans to district white Democratic districts out of existence in favor of majority-minority districts and Republican districts. There really has never been as much of a reckoning over that error as there probably should be within Democratic party circles.

Still, this is the guy who’s now scolding Trump for suggesting that elections may not be trusted? Rather than patting him on the back as the latest “Welcome to the #Resistance” cosplayer, what someone needs to ask Ginsberg is “after a career of gerrymandering and voter suppression tactics, what the hell did you expect was going to happen?” Everything he’s ever done has entrenched the mindset among Republican officials and voters that there are problems with the voting process and that maps need to be drawn to minimize the will of the voters. And while he almost certainly maintained a puckish, internal “this is just how you play the game” mentality that never envisioned someone actually believing this nonsense, at a certain point you have to reap what you sow. The inmates run the Republican asylum now and every hand-wringing Project Lincoln type needs to be forced to take a long hard look at what they did to build the braying masses of QAnon nuts out there.

But, yeah, read his op-ed I guess. Just remember most of what he’s complaining about didn’t materialize out of thin air.

# Dan Snyder Ducking Subpoena In A Yacht And If This Is What It Takes To Keep Him From Ever Coming Back To America, I'm All For It

Dan Snyder, the owner of the Washington Commanders (f/k/a Washington Football Team, née Boston/Washington Racial Slurs), is currently somewhere in the Mediterranean on his $100 million yacht (it has an IMAX theater on it!). There are many reasons to tour the Mediterranean, but probably the biggest one for Snyder is the fact that his tour of international waters allows him to duck a congressional subpoena.

He’s basically a Bond villain if Bond villains failed to win a playoff game in 16 years.

The House Oversight and Reform committee would like to talk to Snyder as part of its investigation into the NFL’s handling of [workplace harassment and abuse claims](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/07/16/redskins-sexual-harassment-larry-michael-alex-santos/) against Snyder’s organization. You might remember that the NFL brought in [Beth Wilkinson](https://www.wilkinsonstekloff.com/who-we-are/beth-wilkinson/) to dig into the allegations and she reportedly walked out of it [recommending that the league force him to sell](https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/commanders/report-eroding-support-nfl-owners-commanders-daniel-snyder). Spoiler alert: the league did not force him to sell.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
He was, however, fined $10 million and stripped of day-to-day responsibilities which he handed over to his wife who almost certainly runs things completely independently.

Hence the House investigation. Snyder has agreed to a video interview with the committee, but pointedly refused to accept a subpoena and intends to remain in international waters to make sure the Marshals can’t give him one. There’s one significant distinction between showing up voluntarily and showing up pursuant to a subpoena. [From ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/34237247/attorney-washington-commanders-owner-dan-snyder-testify-subpoena):

There’s a difference between whether someone testifies voluntarily or under a subpoena, according to Dave Rapallo, Georgetown University’s Federal Legislation Clinic director and the Democratic staff director of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform from 2011 to 2021.

“If you’re under subpoena, you have to answer the question posed,” Rapallo said. “If it’s voluntary, and you’re not under subpoena, you don’t.”

CONVENIENT!

You might think Snyder has an attorney kicking around willing to accept the subpoena. And he does! [Karen Patton Seymour](https://www.sullcrom.com/lawyers/KarenPatton-Seymour) of S&C. But she’s not agreeing to accept service, making her just the latest Snyder employee incapable of receiving.

While the committee is likely eager to hear from Snyder, on behalf of NFL fans, perhaps we can put aside getting to the bottom of this matter in favor of the unintended good fortune of forcing Snyder into functional exile over this subpoena. Usually justice delayed is justice denied, but wouldn’t keeping him away from his team more or less solve every issue — both allegedly off-the-field and most definitely on it?

Just throwing it out there.

Welcome to my new column for Above the Law. I have written two columns in the past for ATL. The first was entitled “Reinventing the Law Business,“ and the second was entitled “Power Niche Marketing.“

Now I think I have some thoughts that will be very useful to anyone running a law firm or working in a law firm, so here goes.

My new column is called, “The Law Firm of the Future — What a Law Firm Should Be,” and the purpose is quite simple; namely, to help us lawyers figure out what we are supposed to do in order to:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

- Find fulfillment, meaning, and excitement in what we do
- Be well paid for our work, and
- Do good things for the world
If we can hit these three goals, I think it is quite clear that we lawyers work in by far the most exciting and thrilling profession in the world. Yet strangely enough, even though we lawyers have access to the foregoing goals (designed to please almost anyone), many of us are kind of miserable and depressed. Hopefully, my column will redirect that thinking from Mope to Hope!

I will start by asking the question, what is a law firm?

When you get right down to it, a law firm is (mostly) just a collection of lawyers who are together because they wish to be together. If they stop wishing to be together, then they leave, and the law firm ends. That end can come quickly (with, say, a dissolution) or slowly (with lawyers gradually departing until the law firm can no longer sustain itself).

Therefore, the leadership of a law firm should have front and center the realization that all of their assets go down the elevator every single night, and the heart of their job is to make sure that those assets return in the morning.

Thus, the primary function of law firm governance should center around keeping the lawyers engaged and feeling like those goals stated above are being achieved, without which they will likely leave their current law firm for another law firm.  Notably, there are no noncompetes ethically permitted to pen lawyers into a particular law firm, so the door is always open. And in today’s world, every lawyer is getting almost daily calls from headhunters. It is a scary time for anyone trying to hold a law firm together, for sure.

As you read this — and if you are not in firm leadership — you might be tempted to conclude that firm leadership had better make you happy, or you will jump ship — and that is a perfectly natural view to have — but it is totally wrongheaded!

To paraphrase JFK, I would say this:

Ask not what your law firm can do for you, but instead ask what you can do for your law firm.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Any law firm that relies upon its managing partner, or firm leadership, to keep everyone happy doesn’t have a chance of succeeding. It has to be a lot deeper than that. If everyone — or at least most of the lawyers — doesn’t believe in the firm and step up to take the role that it is everyone’s job to look out for everyone else, the firm will fail. Top down alone won’t do it.

Okay, so the culture plays a role — as we know.  So you might then conclude that what is needed are espresso bars — flexible work — and all those touchy-feely things that make people happy. Admittedly, those are great things, but if you think that will do it, then once again, you would be totally wrongheaded!

Very few people of high talent will stay at a law firm on a long-term basis solely because the culture is friendly and warm. Of course, an unfriendly place will drive people away, but niceness isn’t enough. So what else is needed?

Okay, it must be the money then, right? Well, that would make it easy, wouldn’t it? But no, that won’t do it either. If all that there is holding a firm together is money, then they are just sharing offices until someone gets a better job offer — and then off they will go. Don’t get me wrong here either — money matters — a lot! But alone, it doesn’t do it either.

So what would do it then?

I spent a lot of time thinking about this and have concluded that a law firm, in order to have a long-term chance of success, needs to stand for something. There needs to be a mission or a plan or a goal or a purpose.

It has to be more than a nurturing managing partner, a friendly, welcoming culture, and good compensation. Those are all quite necessary ingredients, without which failure is indeed quite likely, but without a purpose, I think long-term failure is a very likely conclusion.

There was a book I read that opened my eyes to this a few years ago. It was from a Marine guy — Pete Blaber — who wrote a book called, “[The Mission, the Men, and Me](https://www.amazon.com/Mission-Men-Me-Lessons-Commander/dp/0425236579/ref=sr_1_2?gclid=CjwKCAiAv_KMBhAzEiwAs-rX1OyAzvCTzVZO56Oh_Od7ZIuYFH923FCUDbze14v0R0aqIvqvLSBAzhoC6f0QAvD_BwE&hvadid=409953563992&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9067609&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=11901043974324500863&hvtargid=kwd-8809570751&hydadcr=24628_11409971&keywords=the+mission+the+men+and+me&qid=1637688490&qsid=131-5076858-7234243&sr=8-2&sres=0425236579%2C0578876744%2CB015TM0RM4%2C1544507852%2C0593135202%2C1591846447%2CB0082EH80G%2C0451224957%2CB07L17BBC9%2CB08LMH7K9H%2C1793928495%2C1955690138%2CB06XX181X4%2C1951056779%2C1250158613%2C125030170X&srpt=ABIS_BOOK).”

I started reading it thinking he would put the team first, then the mission, and finally himself, but he didn’t. Instead, he put the mission first. I was intrigued as it seemed, well, wrong to me, but as I read it, I realized he had a point.

This didn’t mean he didn’t love his men dearly. He did — and he put them ahead of himself even to the point of risking his life for them. But he realized that what energized his men and made them want to outperform was having a mission — a goal — that was even more important than anything else.

That is the spice. That is what makes coming to work an adventure rather than a job. The fact that the organization you work for has a purpose and a plan to do something. Hopefully, something cool and interesting and thrilling and exciting, so that at the end of the day you can’t wait to tell your spouse, your parents, your buddies, what happened that day “at the firm.”

I think you will see this more and more as a separation of the firms that have long-term viability from those that flame out over time.

In future articles, I will be writing about what a law firm might stand for to create the necessary spice.

# More Biglaw Firms Reveal Their Own Gender Pay Gap
## More data on the Biglaw gender pay gap.

The U.K.’s Equality Act of 2010 is really a great law. It requires all employers with more than 250 employees to report on the differences between what male and female employees make. As a result, there are quite a few Biglaw firms that have been forced to disclose their own pay gap.

[All of the firms](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/gender-pay-gap/) that have reported thus far exhibit some manner of a compensation disparity. As has become a trend in analyzing these reports, women tend to the occupy support roles at the firm, and a big part of the discrepancy can be chalked up to that difference. This trend continued with the release of Kirkland & Ellis’s pay gap numbers. At that firm, women made up the majority of the two lowest-paying quartiles, while men made up more than 62 percent of the highest-paid employees. As [reported by Legal Business](https://www.legalbusiness.co.uk/blogs/different-origins-same-excuses-kirkland-bakers-weil-gotshal-and-mayer-brown-reveal-uk-gender-pay-gap-stats/), this translates into a 33.2 percent average pay gap:

Kirkland’s report showed that male employees are paid on average 33.2% more than women, a gulf which widens to 68.2% on a median basis. Men took home on average 62.3% more in bonuses with the median pointing to a 74.3% advantage to male bonuses.

The good news was that at K&E, women had a slight advantage (77.9 percent of women versus 77.4 percent of men) when it comes to taking home bonuses.

Similar discrepancies were seen at Weil Gotshal & Manges — including a slight advantage in the percentage of women receiving bonuses:

Weil’s report, published on Wednesday (28 March) revealed the firm pays its female staff on average 38% less than males, a disparity which widens to 53% when calculated on a median basis. Male employees received an average 50% more in bonuses, while the median figure puts male bonuses 55.8% ahead of women’s bonuses.

That firm’s report even goes on to directly point to the amount of women in support positions as the primary factor in the shocking pay gap:

‘If we exclude those in secretarial roles from our gender pay calculations, our mean gender pay gap reduces to 24.95% and the median to 7.28%’, the report states.

Though the firm also released a statement stating the firm’s commitment to efforts designed “to retain women in senior positions, particularly amongst our lawyers.”

Two firms reported slightly better numbers. Mayer Brown’s numbers are somewhere in the middle — a 15.3 percent average pay gap overall, which translates to 34.2 percent on a median basis. Men there also had an eight percent advantage over women when it comes to receiving bonuses.

At Baker McKenzie, male employees average 17 percent more than females — and the gap rises to 32 percent when looking at the median numbers. But the firm also calculated the pay gap specifically to associates, and one blessing of lockstep pay scales is the elimination of a pay gap:

The firm said the hourly gap ‘disappears altogether when associate roles are examined on a standalone basis’. But it conceded there is a ‘small hourly pay gap’ in its business services roles reflecting the fact it has too few women in the most senior positions.

# Tech Savvy Firms More Likely To Retain Attorneys
## The Fall of the Luddites.

Maybe staying on top of the latest developments in legal technology does matter!

Yesterday, [we broke down](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/the-difference-between-keeping-lawyers-and-losing-lawyers-its-more-than-money/) some of [the new report](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/legal/law-firms-stay-go-report-2022/?cid=9061230&chl=pr&sfdccampaignid=PR) from the Thomson Reuters Institute and Georgetown Law’s Center on Ethics and the Legal Profession. The long and short of it is that, even in an across-the-board sizzling lateral market, there’s a clear distinction between the firms losing attorneys and the firms holding attorneys. And money isn’t the key factor.

Most of the findings point to critical cultural differences between the broad categories of “Stay” firms and “Go” firms, but one chart late in the report highlighted a retention factor you might not have considered:



With the exception of the “innovator” tag — which would admittedly favor giant firms with in-house incubators and the like — the Stay firms outpace the Go firms at every level. And even the “innovator” gap is tiny. Generally speaking lawyers at Stay firms say they’re more likely ahead of the curve on technology and less likely to be behind it.

In addition to a tendency to be out in front of new technology, standout lawyers at Stay firms viewed collaboration technologies and knowledge management systems as being more useful to them than lawyers from other firms. This could be the result of Stay firms having better systems in place, of course, but it could also be that Stay firms have done a better job of integrating those systems into attorneys’ workflows such that lawyers feel these tools are more useful.

The latter observation is significant. Investing in technology isn’t the same as achieving buy-in with technology. To the extent Stay firms skew a little smaller, they have more opportunities to tailor the experience to the team. They have a better handle on what they want, fewer outlier stakeholders gumming up the works, and an easier training path.

But firms don’t have to be small to genuinely commit to making lawyers’ lives easier. Attorneys that feel more empowered to get the work done efficiently and without frustration are going to want to stay.

Not for nothing, but a more user friendly tech landscape might also help explain why these Stay lawyers tend to work more than their Go compatriots. It’s a lot easier to keep working and perform that last triple-check when using your computer doesn’t feel like a root canal.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

What I’m hearing from firms is while they are cautiously optimistic, they’re almost just looking into 2024 and planning for that, because a lot of their clients aren’t doing any deals right now. While they may have aspirations to do something, they’re just on hold for the foreseeable future.

— Heather McCullough, partner and co-founder of professional services counseling firm Society54, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2023/10/02/with-q4-underway-large-and-smaller-firms-see-deal-market-through-different-lenses/) on Biglaw firms’ thoughts on the fourth quarter and beyond, given the fact that the legal profession is still dealing with a slowdown in corporate work. As noted by Am Law, the biggest of Biglaw firms are more “bullish” about the year to come.

# 'Leave Britney Alone': Biglaw Partner Says Britney Spears Is Being Bullied And Harassed By Her Father's New Lawyer

Pop star Britney Spears may finally be free from her conservatorship but that doesn’t mean she’s free from the ongoing court case with her father, Jamie Spears, concerning the payment of his legal fees as well as allegations of eavesdropping and electronic surveillance.

As it turns out, the father-daughter duel has turned into a contentious battle — with one Top 50 Biglaw firm making its entrance into the Los Angeles entertainment law market in a rather curious way, with litigation tactics that have raised a number of brows after taking on a reviled client. Hot off the heels of the Gordon Caplan scandal, the firm we’re speaking about is Willkie Farr & Gallagher, which is currently ranked at No. 39 on the most recent Am Law 100.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Willkie opened its Los Angeles office less than a year ago, and [Alex Weingarten](https://www.willkie.com/professionals/w/weingarten-alex), who serves as chair of the firm’s entertainment litigation practice, represents Jamie Spears, who stands accused of conflicts of interest and financial mismanagement during his daughter’s conservatorship. Like Willkie’s Los Angeles office, Weingarten’s representation is in its infancy (with the elder Spears formerly represented by Holland & Knight). Prior to lateraling to Willkie, Weingarten worked at Venable, where he was sued in 2019 for sexual harassment and accused of being a “known office bully.”

It’s been widely reported that things have gotten quite heated in court between Weingarten and [Mathew Rosengart](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/professionals/r/rosengart-mathew-s), the Greenberg Traurig partner who took home the title of Above the Law’s [Lawyer of the Year](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-partner-who-set-britney-free-is-the-ringleader-for-2021s-lawyer-of-the-year/) for freeing Britney Spears from her conservatorship. In fact, the judge on the case, Brenda Penny, once told the pair they needed to “bring the temperature down” during a hearing.

It was during that fateful hearing when Weingarten not only claimed the eavesdropping and surveillance allegations — which were well-documented in a New York Times investigation and corroborated by an esteemed former FBI agent who worked with Robert Mueller during his time as special counsel — were somehow planted by Rosengart, but that they “didn’t happen.” At the time, Liz Day, one of the journalists on the bombshell Times report, said this:

Wow- in a bizarre outburst at Britney Spears’s hearing today, Jamie’s lawyer suggested that our NYT investigation exposing Jamie & Black Box’s surveillance of Britney…was planted by Britney’s lawyer

Said surveillance “didnt happen”

This claim is false, offensive & nonsensical

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Rosengart countered that if the surveillance and eavesdropping “didn’t happen,” then “let’s see what Mr. Spears says under oath when he is deposed.” Months have now passed and a deposition still hasn’t taken place.

In a new motion to compel, Rosengart claims that Britney’s father has been “running and hiding” from being deposed and “stonewalling” the case by refusing to comply. Not only that, but the motion claims that Jamie Spears, through his attorney, has been harassing and bullying Britney by dumping more than 200 document and discovery requests on her, all while evading deposition and failing to timely supply his own documents.

The fiery filing (available in full on the next page) concludes thusly:

Because it is impossible to sum up in one paragraph, or even in a full motion, the myriad reasons Mr. Spears can no longer avoid answering for his deeds, we conclude simply with this: since childhood and certainly over the past decade, Britney Spears has been forced to live under her father’s thumb, even as she gave him an identity and supported him financially; yet he has never been required to answer for his conduct, including his gross, self-interested misuse of his fiduciary position. For Mr. Spears to contend that he will answer for his actions if (and only if) his daughter’s personal, private life is further exposed demonstrates just how misguided he is as a fiduciary and as a father. Enough is enough. Britney Spears will tolerate it no longer, and with respect, neither should this Court.

Finally, we once again ask and implore, in all sincerity, that Mr. Spears and his counsel do what is right, voluntarily. Be decent. Please, stop harassing and bullying your daughter. Please, leave your daughter alone.

Chris Crocker couldn’t have said it better himself. LEAVE BRITNEY ALONE — AND THIS TIME, LEAVE HER ALONE AS A MATTER OF LAW!

In the latest episode of The Jabot podcast, I talk with Donna Wilson, recently elected managing partner and CEO of Manatt. We talk about why developing your emotional IQ is one of the best things you can do for your career, what the future holds for the legal industry, what Biglaw firms must do to embrace diversity, and so much more!

The podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Let’s be real — it can suck out there. So we want to create a space where our community can come together share stories, find support and devise strategies.

Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wears when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that — even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

# Judge Really Bummed Biglaw Discrimination Suit Probably Has To Go To Arbitration
## It looks like the Biglaw firm might be right.

Traci Ribeiro

Traci Ribeiro may not get her day in court. The Biglaw partner at Sedgwick [filed suit](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/biglaw-partner-files-class-action-lawsuit-over-male-dominated-culture/) against her firm earlier this year, alleging gender bias and pay discrimination. The firm responded to the suit [rather sassily](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/biglaw-gender-discrimination-case-gets-to-name-calling-phase/), and argued the arbitration clause in Ribeiro’s partnership agreement should control.

After a hearing in from of Judge William Alsup, it looks like the Biglaw firm might be right. The judge indicated he thought the case would have to go to arbitration, as Law.com [reports](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/10/13/sedgwick-partners-pay-bias-suit-likely-headed-to-arbitration/):

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
U.S. District Judge William Alsup of the Northern District of California said he thinks it’s “a shame” that questions of “statutory rights” would be decided in a forum with limited discovery and appellate review. But Alsup said his opinion on arbitration’s effectiveness as a forum  “doesn’t matter.”

“The Supreme Court has spoken. Congress hasn’t changed it. The Ninth Circuit has spoken. What am I supposed to do?” the judge said.

Though the hearing may have been disappointing, Ribeiro put on a brave face, and promised to keep fighting. And, yes, she did note the recent Major, Lindsey & Africa [survey quantifying the pay disparity ](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/from-the-obvious-files-male-biglaw-partners-make-more-than-female-ones/)between male and female law firm partners:

Speaking to reporters after the hearing, Ribeiro cast her dispute with Sedgwick as part of a wider struggle for equal pay across the industry, noting the recent report that women partners are paid 44 percent less than their male counterparts. “We plan to keep fighting whether it be in court or in arbitration,” she said.

The way that Ribeiro deftly links her lawsuit to the larger trend of Biglaw partner pay disparity is definitely interesting, and just may indicate we haven’t seen the last lawsuit on the matter.

# Trump's Biglaw M&A Enforcer
## Is this a win for mainstream Republicans?

Makan Delrahim

What approach will the Trump administration take with respect to the approval of mergers and acquisitions? That question has come closer to an answer: Makan Delrahim, formerly a partner at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, was recently nominated to lead the DOJ’s antitrust review of mergers and acquisitions.

The appointment requires Senate approval, and Delrahim’s experience — both at Brownstein Hyatt and as deputy assistant attorney general for antitrust in the George W. Bush administration — is expected to be a real asset in that process. However, if confirmed there are several potential landmines waiting for him in the form of high-profile mergers on the agenda, including AT&T’s proposed purchase of Time Warner. That merger has a lot of political repercussions associated with it, as [reported by](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/business/makan-delrahim-justice-department-mergers.html) the New York Times:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The review of AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner has drawn speculation because of promises Mr. Trump made on the campaign trail to block the deal. Mr. Trump’s disdain for news coverage by CNN, which is owned by Time Warner, has raised questions over whether the president may try to influence the deal. Jeff Sessions, Mr. Trump’s attorney general, has promised to block any political influence on Justice Department decisions.

Mr. Delrahim, whose nomination will go before the Senate for confirmation, is expected to take a more free-market approach to his job of antitrust enforcement, according to analysts. His style is expected to be in line with mainstream Republicans.

Whether or not this appointment is a true win for mainstream Republicans remains to be seen. It will be interesting to see the tack that Delrahim takes, should he receive Senate approval.

# It Happened AGAIN -- Another Biglaw Partner Falls For Internet Prank

Another day, another email scandal. WilmerHale partner [Jamie Gorelick](https://www.wilmerhale.com/jamie_gorelick/) — who represents presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner for his ethics and security-clearance needs — fell for an internet prankster. Yes, the same folks behind the Twitter handle @sinon_reborn that previously [tricked Abbe Lowell](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/abbe-lowell-falls-for-internet-prank-still-gives-good-advice/) and goaded [Ty Cobb into a flame war](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/ty-cobbs-hilarious-emails-and-what-they-say-about-biglaw/). This oughta be good.

As first [reported by Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/10/03/email-prankster-targets-another-jared-kushner-lawyer/), Gorelick got drawn into a conversation with the prankster about White House counsel Don McGahn

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Starting the evening of Sept. 30, a person using the email Kushner.jared@mail.com sent Gorelick a one-sentence email: “Our mutual friend Mr. McGahn is really stirring things up.”

“What is he doing?” Gorelick replied, referring to current White House counsel Donald McGahn II.

After the phony Kushner expressed more frustration with McGahn, Gorelick wrote back: “I can speak with him as I need to call him anyway.” Gorelick then told the emailer twice that the rest of their communication would have to wait until Monday. Gorelick stopped responding after 1:30 a.m. Sunday, after she got five emails from the address.

Right around then is when Gorelick finally caught on that she wasn’t emailing with her client. And she has an excuse ready to go: she responded while on her iPad which only displays the screen name, not the full email address. Which is fair enough, I guess, but it really isn’t an ironclad excuse.

As these things go, Gorelick did pretty well. She said nothing embarrassing for her client, didn’t divulge any privileged or [confidential information](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/a-brand-new-email-screw-up-for-abbe-lowell/), and figured out she was emailing a fraud relatively quickly. Given what other Biglaw lawyers with Trump administration clients [have done over email](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/marc-kasowitz-writes-angry-emails-and-everyone-completely-overreacts/) — frankly, that’s a win. But let’s not play, she could have done better.

See, she should have learned from Abbe Lowell’s experience. Remember, he not only got fooled by the same prankster, they used the exact same spoofed email address. That story made a splash in the legal community, and should have served as notice that she could also be targeted by the prankster, and appropriate precautions needed to be put in place.

So while Gorelick’s response wasn’t terrible (and certainly a helluva lot better than, ahem, inadvertently [sending revealing and privileged memos to the media](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/wilmerhale-and-the-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-day-of-leaking-client-whistleblower-docs-to-the-wsj/)), like Lowell’s experience previously, it should serve as a wake up call to Biglaw lawyers everywhere. If you have high-profile and controversial clients, you need to be on alert for all manner of cyber threats.

And please, everyone: block Kushner.jared@mail.com.

# U.S. Firms In The UK: Overpaid, Oversexed, And Over Here
## It's like the Beatles, but in reverse and with lawyers.

You know who has a little dusting of special magic for the Magic Circle? It’s the U.S.-based Biglaw firms setting up outposts in London. A [new ranking from Law.com International](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/07/17/us-firm-strength-showcased-in-inaugural-uk-revenue-rankings-405-125562/) reveals that American firms are packing on the extra Pounds in Great Britain.

USA! USA! USA!

Non-U.K.-based law firms make up almost half of the largest legal institutions in the U.K., according to inaugural rankings by Law.com International.

Ranking the largest global firms by only their U.K. revenue, the research shows 12 of the top 30 are U.S.-based, meaning they have more lawyers in the U.S. than in any other single country, while a further two are Asia-based.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
This isn’t exactly a shock. Late last year, we wrote about the increasing pressure on UK firms to [take bold action to keep up with American firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/magic-circle-firms-must-pull-rabbit-out-of-hat-to-stay-competitive-with-u-s-firms/) invading their shores. Allen & Overy [tried to tie up with O’Melveny](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/09/after-over-a-year-allen-overy-and-omelveny-call-off-merger/) for over a year and now appears poised to [make things happen with Shearman](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/shearman-sterling-allen-overy-merger/).

Latham & Watkins and Kirkland & Ellis clock in at sixth and eighth by UK revenue, placing them on par with stalwarts like Slaughter and May, CMS, and Eversheds Sutherland according to the report.

But for the traditional powerhouses, aggressive US marketing to UK clients presents an existential threat as firms carve you larger slices of the pie offering trans-Atlantic service.

One Freshfields insider commented that their position, and that of many U.S.-based competitors ”is actually unsurprising” adding: “The coming years for law will constantly be more and more global. That means that the elite will have to perform well both in the U.K and in the U.S., regardless of where they’re based.”

A lawsuit has been filed against a former partner at noted Biglaw firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. The case, filed by Transperfect Global Inc., involves a dispute over the legal fees racked up by Robert B. Pincus, who was a partner at Skadden at the time of the representation.

In 2015 Pincus was appointed the tiebreaking director of Transperfect after a Delaware court ruled co-founders Liz Elting and Phil Shawe were not capable of running it together (their business relationship soured after their romantic one fizzled). As a result, the company was forced into a modified auction where Shawe bought Elting out.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Now Transperfect is disputing the legal bills in the matter, which ranged from $58,000 to $90,000 a month. As [reported by](https://biglawbusiness.com/skadden-partner-who-ran-transperfect-sale-hit-with-fee-dispute) Big Law Business, the redacted filing complains over the tasks that were done, that the fee request was granted without Transpect having an opportunity to review it, and that they don’t have access to the particulars of the legal work done:

Those bills contained misrepresentations, including a request covering time spent as a witness that’s “not properly chargeable to the custodianship,” Transperfect says.

The judge “unwittingly” granted Pincus’s fee requests without realizing Transperfect hadn’t seen them, the suit says.

Because those reports were filed under seal, Transperfect doesn’t have specific information about what work was done, who did it, how long it took, or what the hourly rate was, the Aug. 12 complaint claims. Absent that information, the company can’t “assess the reasonableness of the amount of fees,” it says.

Neither Skadden nor Pincus have commented on the ongoing litigation.

Read the redacted complaint below.

[S]he’ll be a partner soon. No firm would allow her to have a role in a big trial like this if she wasn’t on the partner track. There are two factors that go into making a partner — your quality of lawyering and ability to attract business. She can probably go anywhere and make a nice deal for herself.

— Celebrity lawyer [Judd Burstein](https://www.burlaw.com/biography), who represents Nicki Minaj, commenting with a hint of clairvoyance on the star power of Brown Rudnick’s [Camille Vasquez](https://brownrudnick.com/people/camille-m-vasquez/), whose zealous representation of Johnny Depp in his defamation case against Amber Heard not only earned her a huge fan following online, but a favorable verdict for the actor. When the trial took place, Vasquez was a senior associate, and sources told the [New York Post](https://nypost.com/2022/06/05/hollywood-law-firms-battling-to-hire-camille-vasquez-after-johnny-depp-trial/) that law firms were “fighting to be the highest bidder for Camille to join their team.” Brown Rudnick had this to say: “[The firm is] thrilled that so many people are seeing what we’ve known for years: that Camille Vasquez is a star. We were always confident that she had what it takes to succeed on this stage. That’s why she is a key member of the trial team and has a bright future with us.” As it turns out, [Vasquez’s bio page](https://brownrudnick.com/people/camille-m-vasquez/) now lists her as one of the firm’s partners. Congratulations to Camille Vasquez on this accomplishment!

# Its About Time Team Players Get Paid Better For It
## Not only does teamwork make the dream work, it pays!

Fair pay is fair play.

Ever read the bonus newsletters and feel like there was something missing? Sure, it feels nice to be rewarded for billables and all, but work is more than grinding out hours — what about the social component? And no, I don’t mean a thank you card and a thumbs up in the (virtual) hallway. I mean money! Thankfully, a couple of firms have gotten that message and are compensating their talent accordingly. From Law.com:

Law firm leaders and analysts say firms are trying harder than ever to recalibrate traditional revenue metrics beyond billable hours to emphasize collaboration and more subjective criteria. Even office attendance is being considered.

The centering on collaboration and soft skills is picking up steam. At first glance, Debevoise and Weil’s [anomalous acting program for their associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/firms-are-using-acting-to-get-their-associates-to-write-better-emails/) may end up becoming an industrial standard! Bottom dollar aside, I would imagine that programs directed toward developing meeting coordination and civility would make the work-funded obligatory holiday parties a lot more bearable. Better teamwork could also have the effect of changing how praise gets doled out.

When it comes to traditional metrics, such as origination, law firms are also trying to better align them to incentivize teamwork. In some cases that might mean giving credit to the partner who originally brought in the work, as well as partners who supervised the work, or partners who collaborated in some other way at some point.

“A lot of firms are revisiting those revenue credits and how to recognize the different roles those partners play in generating the work, expanding the work and executing on the work. All of those roles are important—not just who might have gotten the initial calls 20 years ago,” Smith said.

I can almost hear the dudebros and… what is the female equivalent of a dudebro? As much as I’d like to be as even-handed as possible with my gender bashing, the equivalent escapes me. Anyway, you know the type — the type A personalities who’ve been biting at the bit to prove themselves, you’re up! Just be warned that showing up will likely include actually showing up. Was beautiful while it lasted, Zoom.

What has changed in the last year or so are the subjective aspects: promoting diversity, mentoring, planning partner retreats and even showing up to the office. Simmons said while the firm doesn’t require a number of days in the office, firm partners are trying to ensure there’s a “critical mass” of people who are present in each office who can help train and mentor, and that it does come up in compensation discussions.

While there is yet readily available information on how firms are implementing the financial rewards to increased socialization and mentoring, you can guarantee that when the time comes to rank firms based on their networking bonuses, we’ll be here making the list. I hope your email box is prepared.

### [ The Digital Transformation Journey: Lessons For Lawyers Embracing AI ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-digital-transformation-journey-lessons-for-lawyers-embracing-ai/)
The journey from the days of leather-bound law books to the digital age -- and now toward an AI-driven future -- offers valuable lessons for embracing change.

It’s the final work day of 2017, and before you clock out for the year, we thought we’d look back on the year that was here at Above the Law and revisit the most popular stories that graced our pages in 2017 and talk about the broad themes that marked this wild year in the legal industry.

In some ways, this was pretty typical year in the legal industry. The market continued to [disappoint for all but the top firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/2018-looks-like-another-year-of-blah-for-the-legal-industry/), law firms still have a [devastatingly poor grasp of cybersecurity](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/global-biglaw-firm-paralyzed-by-new-ransomware-attack/), and [porn remains a better career than the law](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/woman-abandons-law-degree-to-become-porn-star/). And while the practice itself generally stayed the course, law schools may be seeing a return to normalcy, with attendance seeing a bump and [applications and LSAT test-takers on the upswing](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/maybe-you-shouldnt-go-to-law-school-because-of-donald-trump/) (not that you may [need the LSAT for long…](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/the-gre-is-plotting-to-take-over-law-school-admissions-see-also/)). The ABA has started [cracking down on law schools](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/aba-continues-to-crack-down-on-law-schools-that-admit-students-who-cant-pass-the-bar-exam/), while [Whittier](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/whittier-law-school-will-close-leaving-disaster-in-its-wake/) and [Charlotte](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/charlotte-law-finally-gets-around-to-telling-students-the-school-is-closing/) closed and [Valpo decided to stop admitting students](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/valparaiso-law-school-will-close-its-doors-thanks-to-low-enrollment/).

In other ways, this was an absolutely bonkers year in law. The Department of Justice, run by a man who Republicans rejected for a federal judgeship because they were concerned [he just might be too racist](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/i-survived-john-ashcroft-ill-probably-survive-jeff-sessions/), went on a tear: [threatening immigration rights lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/doj-threatens-immigration-rights-lawyers-demands-they-drop-their-clients/), announcing a [new “defense” of free speech from within a no free speech zone](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/law-school-snowflakes-demand-safe-space-over-jeff-sessions-talk/), refusing to commit to [not jailing journalists](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/jeff-sessions-vows-to-make-journalists-famous-by-jailing-them-for-protecting-sources/), and kicking off a [new war on affirmative action](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/justice-department-attack-on-affirmative-action-is-the-most-predictable-white-man-thing-ever/). Meanwhile, law professors who dared criticize Sessions [found themselves targeted by records requests](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/law-professors-that-spoke-out-against-jeff-sessionss-nomination-subjected-to-records-request/), which, honestly, was inevitable.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Oh, and the White House is embroiled in a probe and its defense has largely resembled the Keystone Kops. From [crazy press conferences](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/marc-kasowitz-takes-break-from-partying-at-trump-hotel-to-talk-to-the-press/) to [confidential strategy talks in front of the press](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/maybe-ty-cobb-just-doesnt-get-this-whole-client-confidentiality-thing/) to [Jay Sekulow doing Jay Sekulow things](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/hey-yall-jay-sekulow-may-have-no-fking-clue-what-hes-doing/), it’s not exactly been a well-oiled machine over there at 1600 Pennsylvania. And that’s not counting famed attorney Abbe Lowell accidentally releasing confidential material when he [mistakenly emailed an internet prankster](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/a-brand-new-email-screw-up-for-abbe-lowell/).

But all of that is “paint-by-numbers” compared to the year the judiciary had. Neil Gorsuch joined the Supreme Court and [promptly pissed off everyone](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/neil-gorsuch-isnt-the-justice-we-need-but-hes-the-justice-we-deserve/). Judge Posner [f**king retired](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/richard-posner-is-retiring/) out of the clear blue! David Lat chatted with the legal giant to [learn more about his decision](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/judge-posner-uncensored-i-dont-really-care-what-people-think/) and his plans, which are largely focused on helping pro se litigants like [William Bond in the Fourth Circuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/judge-posner-taking-on-pro-se-case-after-fourth-circuit-did-something-incredibly-stupid/). [Judge Alex Kozinski is also stepping down](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/breaking-judge-kozinski-is-retiring/), though under very different circumstances, after a wave of sexual harassment allegations came to light. Meanwhile, the Trump administration and the Senate aggressively sought to fill scores of open judiciary seats with nominees ranging from [unqualified ghosthunters](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/trump-judicial-nominee-is-a-ghost-hunter-proving-the-bar-can-always-go-a-little-lower/) to political appointees [incapable of grasping basic legal concepts](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/if-your-problem-with-a-judicial-nominee-is-a-lack-of-trial-experience-youre-missing-the-point/). And those were the ones that didn’t make it. Did you [watch now-Judge John Bush’s hearings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlQBuO-IV9Q)?

At least the [ACLU is still there to make us laugh at their adversaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/aclu-brief-in-john-oliver-case-is-stone-cold-hilarious/).

So in honor of a year of unexpected twists and turns, this year’s top 10 goes to 11. Let’s countdown the stories with the most unique pageviews from 2017:

From Pilot and Above The Law  
11. [California’s Bar Exam Results Are Absolutely Abysmal](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/californias-bar-exam-results-are-absolutely-abysmal/): Yeah, this wasn’t a good year for aspiring California lawyers, with nearly two-thirds of all test-takers failing the February exam, further fueling complaints that the state’s cut score is woefully out of whack. The Above the Law editorial staff enjoyed more than one internal debate on this question all year, with most [sharply critical](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/california-one-step-closer-to-having-a-mediocre-bar-exam/) of lowering the score and me all by my lonesome [siding with the deans](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/law-schools-rip-bar-exam-cut-score-recommendations/) who argue the cut score is out of sync with the rest of the country and is nothing more than a protectionist measure that disadvantages minority law grads and indigent clients.

10. [Roy Moore’s Lawyer Pens Demand Letter As Embarrassing As His Client](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/roy-moores-lawyer-pens-demand-letter-as-embarrassing-as-his-client/): To borrow from Clark Griswold in Christmas Vacation, if I woke up tomorrow with my head sewn to the carpet, I wouldn’t be as surprised as I was to see a Democrat win Jeff Sessions’s Alabama Senate seat. Sure, Roy Moore was a disgraced jurist before we heard some disturbing stories about targeting 14-year-olds, but I still never believed Alabama would let that stand in the way. In the waning days of the campaign, Moore elicited attorney Trent Garmon to write threatening letters to news outlets — and be the [worst racist cable news surrogate ever](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/stephanie-ruhle-shows-how-white-allies-are-supposed-to-act-by-live-dragging-trent-garmon-roy-moores-lawyer/) — to get them to back off the pedophilia stories. This letter was, to use the technical legal term, “bad.” But it did make for some uproarious laughs around the Above the Law office.

9. [The 2017 Am Law 100: A Turning Point For Biglaw?](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/the-2017-am-law-100-a-turning-point-for-biglaw/): On the surface, the Am Law 100 this year didn’t reveal any major surprises. The group as a whole grew — slowly — despite declining demand, while the elite firms widened their gap over the rest of the field. But a new twist in this year’s report suggested a new potential problem on the horizon for firms, with that stratification manifesting itself in a key indicator that could spell doom for a lot of the Am Law 100 in the next year.

8. [It’s Official — There’s A New T14 In Town! (2018 USNWR Rankings Are Here)](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/its-official-theres-a-new-t-14-in-town-2018-usnwr-rankings-are-here/): We’ll have more on this year’s U.S. News rankings later on this list (that’s why we went to 11 — these rankings are basically on this list twice), but let’s revisit the fight this headline set off in the Above the Law offices. [Is there a new T14?](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/is-t14-dead-is-it-t15-t13-was-t14-an-arbitrary-ranking-all-along/) Or was the “T14” exclusively reserved for the 14 schools who never fell out of the top 14 until this year? And if that’s all it ever meant, then wasn’t it a pretty terrible rubric for identifying the elite schools all along?

7. [Associate Bonus Watch: Cravath Announces Its 2017 Associate Bonuses!](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2017-associate-bonuses/?rf=1): The holiday season brought more of the same to Biglaw, with Cravath setting the bar for annual bonuses — as usual — and opting to go with the exact same schedule as last year — as usual.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

6. [Ruth Bader Ginsburg Claps Back At Neil Gorsuch](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/ruth-bader-ginsburg-claps-back-at-neil-gorsuch/): Neil Gorsuch getting smacked down at oral argument was entertaining enough, but the way Justice Ginsburg does it quietly blasts him into silence. Damn, that’s cold. That’s “[let a trucker die in a winter storm for his company](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/the-frozen-truck-driver-case-democratic-senators-are-hanging-on-neil-gorsuch/)” cold.

5. [White & Case Has Built The New ‘Modern’ Law Firm Office — And It’s Awesome](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/white-case-has-built-the-new-modern-law-firm-office-and-its-awesome/): When White & Case decamped for new offices, we all wondered what the firm would do with its new space. Over the summer, I got a chance to tour the offices — and take a bunch of pictures — and they’ve really put together something fantastic. While some more traditional types might balk at the “fishbowl” effect of so much glass or the focus on communal working areas, the openness and abundant natural light make this the sort of office that embraces you as an attorney. White & Case should raise the bar for any firms contemplating a 2018 move.

4. [California Bar Examiners Stripped Of Authority To Determine Passing Score On State Bar Exam](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/california-bar-examiners-stripped-of-authority-to-determine-passing-score-on-state-bar-exam/): After the trainwreck of a February exam, the California Supreme Court told the Cal Bar Examiners to take a hike and took on the role of deciding this issue themselves. They considered all the reasoned arguments available and decided… [to do nothing](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/california-supreme-court-issues-decision-on-bar-exam-cut-score/). Thanks!

3. [Leaked: Are These The 2018 U.S. News Law School Rankings?](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/leaked-are-these-the-2018-u-s-news-law-school-rankings/): So yeah… new T14. Time to [Make Georgetown Great Again](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/tiffany-trump-has-picked-her-law-school/).

2. [That Awkward Moment When Your Twin Brother Is A U.S. Citizen At Birth, But You’re Not](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/that-awkward-moment-when-your-twin-brother-is-a-u-s-citizen-at-birth-but-youre-not/): As an editor, when I saw this headline, I knew this story would make the end of year top 10. It’s just too enticing not to. How can that happen? Well, that’s why the tale of the Dvash-Banks family “at the cross-section of assisted reproductive technology (ART) and immigration law” intrigued so many this year.

1. [Trump Selects Law Grad For Housing Job — Law School Says She’s Not A Law Grad](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/trump-selects-law-grad-for-housing-job-law-school-says-shes-not-a-law-grad/): This may come as a complete shock, but Donald Trump nominated a wedding planner to run a critical government office and it she might not have been qualified. And a quick examination of her résumé got her law school a little curious.

And so we conclude the year that was in law.

# Biglaw Firm Reportedly Funneled Money To Spy On Suspected Enemies Of Donald Trump

The New York Times came out with a[ blockbuster of an article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/13/us/politics/mcmaster-fbi-trump-project-veritas.html) yesterday detailing the work of Project Veritas during the Trump administration. According to the report, the fear of a so-called “deep state” seeking to undermine the agenda of Donald Trump led to involved surveillance plans against suspected enemies.

It’s truly some through the looking glass shit:

A network of conservative activists, aided by a British former spy, mounted a campaign during the Trump administration to discredit perceived enemies of President Trump inside the government, according to documents and people involved in the operations.

The campaign included a planned sting operation against Mr. Trump’s national security adviser at the time, H.R. McMaster, and secret surveillance operations against F.B.I. employees, aimed at exposing anti-Trump sentiment in the bureau’s ranks.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
It’s an unsettling look at late-stage American democracy that details the proposed sting operation against then-national security adviser H.R. McMaster, designed to get him to resign since it was suspected he was disloyal to Trump. Project Veritas also reportedly set up surveillance ops to target FBI employees that harbored disparaging feelings towards the president.

The operations against the F.B.I., run by the conservative group Project Veritas, were conducted from a large home in the Georgetown section of Washington that rented for $10,000 per month. Female undercover operatives arranged dates with the F.B.I. employees with the aim of secretly recording them making disparaging comments about Mr. Trump.

The campaign shows the obsession that some of Mr. Trump’s allies had about a shadowy “deep state” trying to blunt his agenda — and the lengths that some were willing to go to try to purge the government of those believed to be disloyal to the president.

While documenting the slo-mo fall of the republic is fascinating, what really caught the attention of Above the Law was Biglaw’s involvement, specifically Atlanta-based Alston & Bird.

In 2019, [Project Veritas] received a $1 million contribution made through the law firm Alston & Bird, according to a financial document obtained by The Times. The firm has declined to say on whose behalf the contribution was made.

Yikestown. While obviously firms do all sorts of stuff they may not agree with at the behest of clients, this really goes beyond. I mean who, besides other nation-states, organizes spying of members of the American security apparatus? Well, I guess Alston & Bird knows the answer to that question.

And at least now the kind of work A&B is down for is out there. Potential first-year associates, laterals, and firm clients can do what they will with that intel.

# Maximizing Law Firm Profits: The Impact Of Expert Legal Recruitment Strategies
## Discover how expert legal recruiters significantly boost law firms' profitability by enhancing productivity, reducing turnover, and elevating customer service.

Recognizing the pivotal role of legal recruiters is a game-changing strategy for law firms. No longer just an operational necessity, we at [Lateral Link](https://laterallink.com/) understand that our role as legal recruiters makes us profit-making catalysts. Our value in increasing productivity, lowering turnover, and elevating customer service underscores our critical role in boosting a law firm’s profits.

Enhancing Productivity: The Advantage of Experienced Legal Recruiters

Productivity in a law firm correlates directly with billable hours. With the right attorney matched to the perfect role, productivity skyrockets, significantly driving up the firm’s profitability. This is where our deep expertise comes into play, an eighth-year attorney, leveraging their skills, can generate a daily profit of $4,510. A fourth-year attorney, at $3,469 per day, isn’t far behind. Pinpointing such talent and connecting them with the right roles contributes meaningfully to a law firm’s daily profitability.

Year	1st	2nd	3rd	4th	5th	6th	7th	8th
Daily Profit	$3,113	$3,312	$3,411	$3,469	$3,777	$3,911	$4,041	$4,510
Yearly Total	$1,136,250	$1,208,750	$1,245,000	$1,266,250	$1,378,750	$1,427,500	$1,475,000	$1,646,250
Turnover Reduction: A Profit-Saving Strategy

Turnover brings financial burdens, particularly for the legal sector. Every day a role stays vacant, profits drop. For example, a fifth-year attorney role left unfilled for 20 days could cost around $75,548 in lost profits. Using our skills in quickly identifying and retaining long-term attorneys, these losses can be mitigated.

Customer Service Enhancement: A Revenue Driver

Superior customer service in law firms directly impacts revenue. A sixth-year attorney role vacancy over 30 days could lead to around $117,329 in lost profits. Prolonged vacancies can escalate losses to $351,986 over 90 days. Our team at [Lateral Link ](https://laterallink.com/)can help stem these losses by promptly filling these positions with apt attorneys, ensuring high service standards and client loyalty.

The Financial Impact of Effective Recruitment

Examining the financial implications of unfilled roles, the strategic role of a legal recruiter is clear. A 180-day vacancy for a fourth-year attorney could lead to a potential $624,452 loss, escalating to $832,603 over 240 days. We at [Lateral Link](https://laterallink.com/) aim to prevent such losses. By trimming an average of 20 days from the recruitment process, the financial gain can be substantial. For example, expediting a second-year attorney placement could lead to $66,233 profit recovery. Even after recruiter fees, the net profit stands at $21,233.

Resilience through Rapid Hiring: A Profitable Formula

Faster hiring is key to profit recovery. If a firm could expedite the placement of two fifth-year attorneys by 20 days each through our efforts at [Lateral Link](https://laterallink.com/), it could recover an estimated $151,096 in profits. Even after accounting for recruiter fees, the net profit stands at $13,096.

Navigating the Legal Talent Market: Our Data-Driven Approach at Lateral Link

In the highly competitive legal industry, our data-driven insights at [Lateral Link](https://laterallink.com/) can provide a crucial edge.

# Silicon Valley Powerhouse Announces Bonuses For Associates
## This seems to be yet another Cravath match.

Another hour, another bonus announcement from last week. Hooray!

We were just alerted by a source who was “surprised” the news hadn’t made it to us yet that on November 28, Fenwick & West announced bonuses with what seems to be a full match for all of its U.S.-based associates who hit their 1950 billing targets. Fenwick’s bonuses differ slightly in that they’re based on tier levels instead of class years, but they appear to echo the Cravath scale. That being said, here’s the Fenwick bonus scale for Fall 2018:

- T1/L1: $15K
- T1/L2: $25K
- T1/L3: $50K
- T2/L1: $65K
- T2/L2: $80K
- T2/L3: $90K
- T3: $100K

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Congratulations to everyone at Fenwick & West on this year’s bonus haul!

That’s our take on associate bonuses from Fenwick & West. If you’re a lawyer at the firm, what do you think? Feel free to let us know how you feel [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

Remember: as soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. You can also text us if you prefer, at 646-820-8477.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

# Partners Shouldn't Expect Associates To Be In The Office At 9 Each Morning
## Requiring attorneys to be in the office at 9 a.m. is regressive and can create hardships that may make it more difficult for associates to fulfill other responsibilities in their lives.

Back in the Mad Men (and Dolly Parton) era of office culture, most professionals were expected to arrive at the office no later than 9 a.m. every day. In the past, many people could not work from home, and it was important that everyone be in the office at the same time each day to start completing assignments. Because employees were less accessible after hours years ago, employees also needed to show up to work at a set time so managers could keep track of their workers.

However, people are accessible pretty much all the time in the present day, and most attorneys can complete almost all of their work in the comfort of their homes. As a result, it rarely makes sense for associates to be in the office at 9 a.m. each day, especially when attorneys can finish work later if they arrive at the office later in the day. Nevertheless, some partners insist on establishing artificial expectations for when associates must be in the office, and those requirements can create unnecessary hardships.

Most of the partners I worked for at various firms did not really care when associates arrived at the office every morning, so long as an associate billed enough hours. Indeed, at most firms at which I worked, attorneys usually arrived at the office around 9:30 a.m., and some associates did not arrive at the office until 11 a.m. most days. Of course, attorneys who came to the office later in the day usually stayed later, and there were few downsides to those associates showing up for work after the traditional 9 a.m. start to the workday.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
However, [I once worked at a firm](https://www.rothmanlawyer.com/jordan-rothman/) that decided to crack down on people arriving late to the office. The managing partner of this firm sent out a stern email to everyone at the office requiring that all attorneys and other employees be in the office at 9 a.m. each day. The partner said that having all employees arrive at the office around 9 a.m. would help us provide good service to our clients. It was also mentioned once that it would be easier for attorneys to collaborate on assignments if everyone was around the office at the same time each morning.

However, requiring everyone to be at the office at 9 a.m. every day was completely unnecessary and created burdens for associates and other employees. Clients knew they could email us whenever they wanted and receive a response around the clock. I think I only had a handful of conversations with clients on the landline at my office while working at that firm, and being accessible to clients is a poor excuse to require associates to be at the office at 9 a.m. In addition, since many firms require associates to be accessible around the clock through email, it is extremely unfair to also require these attorneys to be in the office at 9 a.m. each day.

Furthermore, requiring attorneys to be in the office at 9 a.m. is regressive and can create hardships that may make it more difficult for associates to fulfill other responsibilities in their lives. For instance, many parents have difficulty getting to the office that early due to childcare needs, and being more flexible with when associates must be in the office can make it easier for parents to contend with childcare issues. In addition, being flexible about when associates need to start their day can make it easier for employees to attend doctor’s appointments, deal with car troubles, or fulfill any number of other responsibilities people have in their lives. Such flexibility can boost morale and show associates that their employer cares about them and is not establishing artificial expectations that can get in the way of employees fulfilling important obligations in their lives.

In addition, requiring associates to be in the office at 9 a.m. each day so attorneys can collaborate and communicate face to face is also a poor reason to create a hassle in the lives of associates. Most associates today collaborate through text, email, gchat, and a variety of other tools. Indeed, at many of the firms at which I worked, associates had robust group text message chains where all of the attorneys spitballed ideas and supported each other as we completed assignments. Since attorneys use various means to collaborate, it is unfair to use collaboration or face-to-face interactions to justify a 9 a.m. start to the workday.

All told, requiring associates to be in the office at 9 a.m. each day is so twentieth century! Most partners who have such expectations need to get with the times and afford associates greater flexibility. Of course, sometimes there are powerful incentives to get to the office early. One time, I worked at a firm where an important partner was in the office at 8 a.m. each day, and I wanted to be in the office early in order to receive assignments from him. If there is an important enough reason to be in the office early, associates will use their discretion and arrive at the office at an appropriate time.

However, a 9 a.m. start to the workday is usually an artificial hassle that can get in the way of associates completing necessary life responsibilities. Since associates are accessible pretty much all the time through email and other means, partners should be more flexible about when they expect associates to arrive at the office each morning.

# Top Am Law Firm Starts Diversity Pipeline Program For Incoming Talent
## And the firm will look to law schools outside of the Top 25 to recruit new graduates for this program.

Biglaw’s efforts to address the need for diversity and inclusion among their ranks continue to be of great importance to firms across the country. But thus far, only one firm has partnered with Legal Innovators, an alternative legal services provider focused on innovative talent management solutions, to drive systemic change in its recruitment and training strategies. Only one firm will use Legal Innovators’ ingenious methodology to create a diversity pipeline for incoming associates.

That firm is Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe.

The firm brought in $1,158,537,000 gross revenue in 2019, putting the firm in 31st place in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking. Under Orrick’s diversity pipeline pilot program with Legal Innovators, recent law school graduates will have the opportunity to join the firm as fellows, and may be offered full-time associate positions after two years. Legal Innovators will also offer training to other diverse attorneys who are joining the firm this year. Here are some additional details from Orrick’s [press release](https://www.orrick.com/en/News/2021/02/Orrick-and-Legal-Innovators-Team-Up-to-Pilot-a-New-Approach-to-Developing-Junior-Legal-Talent):

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“We’re focused on applying science-backed insights to the way we recruit and develop lawyers in a way that’s inclusive and attractive to top, diverse talent,” said Orrick’s Chief Talent Officer Siobhan Handley. “While we’re experimenting with a number of approaches, we’re especially impressed by Legal Innovators’ methodology and excited, not only to welcome the two Orrick Legal Innovators’ Fellows, but also to learn from their creative thinking and curriculum to ensure we improve the way we support diverse talent.”

Legal Innovators moves beyond traditional hiring metrics. Utilizing predictive analytics, they look at more than 20 factors, such as accolades and work experience in undergrad, to determine the potential success of a candidate.

The program will also help the firm expand beyond the law schools it traditionally hires from to recruit diverse candidates. “[W]e know there are extremely talented individuals that are outside of the top 25 or 30 schools and we know that there are many systemic barriers that prevent really qualified, amazingly talented individuals from ending up at a top 25 or 30 law school,” Siobhan Handley, Orrick’s chief talent officer, said in an interview with [Bloomberg](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/orrick-partners-with-startup-to-pilot-diverse-pipeline-program).

Legal Innovators currently works with more than 25 law schools, many of which are ranked outside of the schools Biglaw firms traditionally hire from — including Howard University, University of Connecticut, and New York Law School. “If you’re going to take that approach, the law firms or even corporations are always going to be fighting over the same 200 Black associates,” said Bryan Parker, a former Shearman & Sterling lawyer who co-founded Legal Innovators.

Diversity pipeline programs like the one that Orrick has set up with the help of Legal Innovators could change everything for Biglaw firms when it comes to their D&I initiatives. Orrick was brave enough to be the first to give it a try. Which firms will join Orrick in its quest to create a more equitable and inviting workplace?

# Biglaw Attorney Reengineering The Defense Of Mass Tort Claims
## Could unbundling legal services be the new reality for the practice of mass torts law?

Twenty years ago, I terminated my firm’s Westlaw subscription and outsourced our legal research. How so? Law clerks attending law school whom I met on AOL message boards.

A clerk did the research, using free Westlaw, drafted a motion, memorandum, or brief, forwarded it to my assistant to be put on a case caption and reviewed by my associate.

In a contingency fee case, a big savings of time for us. My associate could work on more valuable things. On hourly work, clients got a bill for a clerk’s time at $40 an hour while we paid them $15 an hour. Clients loved the savings and the innovation.

Without the Internet and a willingness to be different, none of that would have been possible.

Now I hear that a friend of mine, Attorney [Steve Embry](http://www.frostbrowntodd.com/professionals-steve-embry.html) is doing a little bit of the same — except on a much larger scale that is likely to have a lasting effect on large law.

For years, law firms have defended mass torts the same way. Put an experienced mass torts lawyer on the case to lead strategy and execution and have legions of younger lawyers and in house staff do most of the work.

By leveraging the hourly rate, the defense of mass torts became wildly profitable for law firms, while terribly expensive for clients.

I should have known that Embry was onto something different when I first met him hanging out at legal tech and innovation conferences, even conferences dedicated to small law. You don’t see guys from large law ([Frost Brown Todd](http://frostbrowntodd.com)) who have been defending mass tort cases for years at these conferences.

Embry was in fact out noodling on ways to be innovative in the defense of mass tort claims.

The problem with how mass torts have historically been defended is that, while the client can get great value and a great defense where there is an experienced lawyer engaged in what he or she does best, that is such things as strategy, handling and creating joint defenses, negotiations and even trial, most of the underlying work has been done by those who frankly are over qualified for what they are doing. There are better and cheaper ways to get most of the work required by mass tort cases done.

The answer, talking to Embry, is unbundling services. Unbundling legal services can be a dirty word to some bar associations and regulators, who’d like to require a lawyer do all the work from beginning to end.

But Embry believes that the work in a mass tort case can be “unbundled” so that much of the commodity type work is done by alternative legal service providers at flat fees. The more creative work is best done by a seasoned lawyer.

To make this work — and get over any unbundling issue — Embry says that the lawyer must remain in charge of and responsible for all the work and that there needs to be a partnership between the lawyer and any service providers.

The lawyer and the insurance provider have to trust each other, work together and have each other’s back. This can only be done on if there is a long term relationship between the two.

Embry is now walking the talk, something most lawyers would be scared to death to do. He reached out to [Elevate](http://elevateservices.com), an alternative legal service provider employing lawyers, engineers, and technology and medical professionals to study the idea. If viable, Embry wants them to help propose it to insurance carriers.

Elevate suggested getting my friend (small world) [Dan Linna](http://www.legaltechlever.com), a law professor and director of [LegalRnD](http://legalrnd.org) at Michigan State University College of Law, involved. Elevate had worked with Linna and LegalRnD on other projects over the past few years and Embry was familiar with Linna through legal tech events.

Linna likes the idea — and sees it as a bit of self preservation for large law.

Law firms need to proactively work with clients to disaggregate legal matters. Why wait for clients to disaggregate matters and tell you, the law firm, what’s left for you—if they keep you around? Law firms need to demonstrate how they can provide greater value to clients. Greater value goes well beyond efficiency and lower costs. By creating a culture of innovation and continuous improvement, improving processes, getting the right people doing the right tasks, becoming data driven, and embracing technology, law firms can improve work quality and obtain better substantive outcomes.

Linna’s a bit like author, speaker, and adviser, Richard Susskind, who finds it hard to convince a room full of people making a million dollars a year that they have a problem that needs correcting.

Most law firms cannot get beyond short-term thinking. They’re get stuck on the idea that improving legal-service delivery likely means less revenue in the short term. But they’re missing opportunities to become more profitable while at the same time generating greater value for clients. Going down this path strengthens relationships with existing clients and creates opportunities for law firms to differentiate themselves. It positions them to land more work and develop new ways in which to provide value for clients.

The team has already secured the agreement of one of Embry’s insurance carrier clients. The carrier is intrigued by Embry’s approach and is looking to be a case study that Linna will do so that differences in results and costs can be measured.

As he should be, Embry’s optimistic.

I think we will find that the case could be handled just as well if not better and the transactional cost less using this model.

The group recently spent a day at Frost Brown with lawyers, paralegals and other professionals to map out getting work to the right people, improving processes, using data, and implementing technology. Linna tells me that rather than being defensive and territorial about the work, as I have personally seen in large tort claims with multiple parties, the group realized the benefits of collaborating to identify opportunities to improve the value provided to clients.

Embry, as expected, was concerned his firm would see this whole approach as a threat. But his firm acknowledges it as the new reality.

The practice of law is changing. While clients don’t mind paying for bespoke work, they are no longer willing to pay top dollar for commodity work that can be done cheaper someplace else. If we don’t accept that reality and try to meet our client’s needs, we risk losing the whole ball of wax.

Embry’s firm may have less work in the short run. But Embry believes that clients will see the benefit of the model and engage him and Frost Brown for future work.

Now we just need to have Embry out blogging what he’s learning and doing along the way — soon.

# Workplace Monitoring Is Commonplace In The Legal Industry

Last week, I was listening to an episode of “The Daily,” which is one of my favorite podcasts (besides Above the Law’s “Thinking Like a Lawyer,” of course!) The episode discussed how more employers are implementing monitoring software to track and surveil their employees who may not be working in an office as much as they were before the COVID-19 pandemic. The episode made it seem like there has been an explosion of monitoring efforts since the work-from-home movement took off after the COVID-19 pandemic hit because employers had a greater need to keep track of workers who might not be in offices. However, many law firms have implemented surveillance and monitoring software against workers for years, and employers should likely be more open about such tactics.

At my first Biglaw job, I really did not know if the firm tracked employees. I do remember that associates and staff were pretty paranoid about trashing management in emails sent from work accounts and using their computers for personal reasons while they were on the clock. It is probably a good practice to just assume that there is at least some monitoring at work, so a healthy amount of paranoia about having messages and internet searches discovered might be beneficial.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The first time I saw overt monitoring of workers was at a medium-sized firm at which I worked. The firm used contract attorneys to complete various projects, and I did not have too much contact with the contract attorneys since they worked for a practice group that was different from the group with whom I worked. However, there was one contract attorney who I really liked. The attorney was always super friendly, and I bonded with this contract attorney at the holiday party and other social events at the firm.

One day, the contract attorney did not show up for work, and I wondered what had happened. I asked another contract attorney if this contract attorney had quit or if something else occurred. I was told that this contract attorney had been terminated due to performance issues. Apparently, the software that the contract attorneys used to complete projects kept track of each of the attorneys. The software could tell when keyboards went idle and if the contract attorney was not as productive at reviewing documents as others. Apparently, the software showed that this person was not as focused on the job they were completing and was not as productive as others according to the metrics that the software tracked, and accordingly, that person was terminated.

Another time I had a work colleague that worked at a smaller shop before he worked at a larger firm. He said that his boss was very paranoid, and since he was the only associate at that firm, the boss was really involved in monitoring and managing my colleague. This friend related that his boss started to make weird comments about his personal life and work product and that the boss would not know such facts unless he had snooped into his private affairs.

The former colleague of mine told me that he spoke to the office manager who informed him that his boss had installed a keystroke tracker on his computer. This boss was basically able to see anything that was typed into the computer, including instant messaging applications, social media, and the like. My friend never confronted his boss about this because he was scared about losing his job, but he felt betrayed that he was not told there would be this kind of monitoring.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Clearly, workplace monitoring is commonplace at law firms. If law firms decide that they need to implement some kind of monitoring programs, there are a few rules law firms should follow. For one, law firms should be completely transparent about how they monitor employees. Workers should have an opportunity to know what an employer can see in order to maintain privacy and get a better sense of how they will be evaluated by a firm. This is especially true if the monitoring occurs on personal devices. Many law firms ask that attorneys and staff install applications on their personal phones so they can access firm documents and emails while away from the office. I am not sure if these applications can monitor workers, but if they do, employers should be extremely transparent about what they are doing with the workers’ own devices.

Moreover, law firms should give employees a bona fide way to opt out of monitoring. This can be accomplished by coming to the office more often, checking in with bosses at regular intervals, or other compromises. Monitoring policies might be more palatable for employees if they know that they have a means for opting out of this.

All told, workplace monitoring has been a fixture of the legal profession for some time, and it seems like this trend is likely to continue as the work-from-home shift keeps gaining momentum. Law firms should be transparent about monitoring and should give employees a way to opt out of such monitoring in certain situations.

# Former Biglaw Managing Partner Blames Alcohol For Sexual Misconduct
## He lays the blame on Biglaw culture.

Gary Senior is the former London Managing Partner at Baker McKenzie, and he’s embroiled in a sexual misconduct scandal. He’s already admitted he acted inappropriately with a junior associate in 2012, but the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal is conducting hearings over the alleged sexual harassment investigation.

The prosecution in the case says that in the incident in question, Senior was “seeking to initiate intimate activity” with a junior associate which he was in a position of “authority and responsibility over.” They went on to note Senior “knowingly caused [the junior associate] to be alone with him and told her he was attracted to her” and “attempted to embrace and kiss” her and that Senior “persisted in said conduct despite [the junior associate] indicating that such conduct was not appropriate.”

During testimony this week in the tribunal, Senior was questioned and said that if he wasn’t drinking during on the 2012 night in question, the incident would “probably never have happened.” He [also said](https://www.ft.com/content/30d33496-169d-11ea-8d73-6303645ac406) he “operated in the drinking culture that you find in all big law firms,” and that there are “many examples of partners willing to drink late into the night with all kinds of employees.” He went on, “I have done more of that than I should have done as managing partner and realize that’s an error on my part,” he said, “and the night [of the alleged incident] was an example of that.” And as [reported by Law.com](https://www.law.com/2019/12/05/baker-mckenzie-restricted-seniors-alcohol-consumption-after-complaint-tribunal-told-292-58104/), the firm attempted to restrict Senior’s alcohol consumption going forward, though exactly how they did that was unclear.

# Associate Bonus Watch: To Play In The Big Leagues, Pay Like The Big Leagues
## Associates at this firm are ""ecstatic"" about their bonuses.

Last year, we [posed the following question](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/a-lateral-partner-mess-down-in-texas/) about [Vinson & Elkins](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/vinson-elkins/): “The real issue for V&E going forward is how it can convert itself from a Texas market leader into a national or even international firm, along the lines of a Kirkland & Ellis or a Latham & Watkins. Will Vinson & Elkins succeed in that transformation?”

One must give V&E credit: if it doesn’t enter the Kirkland/Latham tier, it won’t be for lack of trying. If you want to play with the big boys (and girls), you must pay like the big boys — and that’s what Vinson & Elkins appears to be doing.

The firm recently announced bonuses, and associates are, as one tipster told us, “ecstatic.” It had a record year, and V&E partners decided to share the wealth — across all offices, employing a national bonus scale. Here is one source’s concise explanation:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Vinson & Elkins announced associate bonuses [last] Friday. Cravath match at 2,000 hours across all offices, with supplemental bonuses of 1.10x – 1.35x for high billers (2,150+). In addition, all first-years – regardless of hours – received the standard $15,000 market bonus (again, with supplemental bonuses for higher billers).

The Management Committee should be lauded for this change to the bonus structure. In previous years, market bonuses were paid only to associates with 2,300+ hours – a high bar particularly given the number of national firms that have opened offices in Texas in recent years and pay market bonuses at 1,850-2,000 hours. This was the primary complaint of associates, and now it has been addressed. Associate morale is very high.

The firm’s tremendous year was probably the main motivator behind the strong bonuses, but as suggested above, the role of competition in the Texas markets can’t be overlooked. As a second source said, “There is obviously significant pressure from the New York carpetbagger firms, and so the firm has stepped up to meet what the market has demanded.”

Here are a few more reactions:

- “Big bonus news at Vinson and Elkins. Moved to a national scale, as opposed to having to bill 2300 hours to get market bonus. Now paying like Latham or Kirkland, where associates can earn anywhere from 1.1 to 1.35 times market. Very fundamental shift for the firm.”
- “Lots of very happy people at Vinson & Elkins today…. Most people I’ve talked to received well more than the Cravath scale, with most productive earning more than the highest earners at Latham, Kirkland and elsewhere.”
- “Midlevel corporate associate with high hours – [over $80,000] bonus. Very excited about bumping the max bonus to 1.35x.”
- “Received a full market bonus in D.C. at 2,000 hours for the first time. According to the memo, high billers could have beat market. In the past, the D.C. office was treated differently than New York and San Francisco for bonuses, which caused some hurt feelings. Management stepping up this year shows that the associates have been heard and management finally made it right.”
- “Vinson & Elkins announced bonuses today, and the firm went all out! We were extremely busy in 2016 and appear to be on pace for an even hotter 2017, so the firm showed that when the associates help with a record year, they get record bonuses…. Although pro bono was not counted toward the supplemental [as opposed to first-level] bonus, people seem extremely happy. Up to 35% above the NY bonus in Texas? No complaints here. Big thanks to the partners at V&E.
- “V&E bonus information is currently being delivered to all associates, and the universal consensus is that associates are ecstatic…. V&E leadership continually expresses its gratitude to its associates. Thankful that compensation and bonuses remain consistent with this message.”

And wait, that’s not all! V&E also paid a “special bonus” to staff — a bonus on top of the [normal annual bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/03/staff-bonus-watch-open-thread-kicked-off-by-orrick-and-vinson-elkins/) awarded to staffers. It’s great to see the firm recognizing the contributions of all its employees, across all departments.

Vinson & Elkins was founded in Houston in 1917, which means that this year, the firm will celebrate its 100th anniversary. Based on its 2016 performance, its 2017 outlook, and the generosity it has shown to associates and staff, it looks like V&E’s birthday will be very happy indeed. Congratulations to the firm on reaching this milestone, and best wishes as it enters its second century.

We hope you had a happy Thanksgiving. While associates at some Biglaw firms were enjoying their socially distanced feasts, they had something to be extra thankful for: up to six figures of bonus bucks soon to be deposited into their accounts.

One of the firms that made associates happy is Proskauer Rose, which recently came in at No. 41 in the Am Law 100 rankings, having raked in $1,004,942,000 gross revenue in 2019. On the day before the holiday, the firm announced that it would be matching the prevailing market bonuses (i.e., the [Baker McKenzie year-end bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/) that were later [adopted by Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/cravath-bonuses/), plus the [Davis Polk special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/) that were also [adopted by Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/cravath-bonuses/)).

Here’s what Proskauer’s 2020 bonus scale looks like:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  


Not everyone will be receiving these bonuses, though. The file name on the firm’s PDF is “2020 Bonus – BN,CH,LA,NY,DC.” Associates working at the firm’s Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and D.C. offices will get the full scale bonuses, while those in the New Orleans and Boca Raton offices will receive bonuses on reduced scales. Bonuses for associates beyond the class of 2012 will be individualized.

All bonuses will be paid out to associates on December 22. Congratulations!

# The Personal Trainer Who Whips Biglaw Attorneys Into Shape
## Lawyers are 12(b)(6)ing their flab thanks to this guy.

The majority of my clients come to me because they want to see changes in how they look and feel. They hit a big birthday like 30 or 40 and all of a sudden notice that along with the late nights and takeout dinners the pounds have packed on, they can’t move how they used to and generally feel stressed and anxious all the time. While they love their jobs, and most say they do, their practices are slowly killing them. Those who learn to incorporate a basic fitness program into their lives not only look, feel and move healthier, they also tell me they become better lawyers from it.

— [Jonathan Jordan](http://www.jj-fit.com/meet-jj/), a personal trainer at Equinox in San Francisco, California, explaining what his typical lawyer-client is like in an [interview with Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/05/08/when-firm-life-makes-them-flabby-lawyers-call-this-trainer/). Lawyers make up about 25 percent of Jordan’s client base, and they hail from firms like Nixon Peabody; Keker Van Nest & Peters; and Morrison & Foerster. His lawyer-clients usually suffer from loose glutes, collapsed cores, and hunched shoulders from all of the time spent sitting at their desks.

Earlier this morning, police received a report of a [suspicious package](http://wjla.com/news/local/pennsylvania-avenue-closed-for-report-of-suspicious-package) near the Warner Theater in Washington, D.C. — near many of the city’s Biglaw offices, including Hogan Lovells, Morgan Lewis, [Ropes & Gray](http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/breaking_ground/2015/06/another-big-d-c-law-firm-is-setting-thestage-for-a.html), Alston & Bird, and several others.

We learned of this news from a tipster at Hogan Lovells, where the following message went around:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
How did folks at the firm react? “Attorneys are carrying on,” said our source. “Staff are more nervous.”

The suspicious package report caused the [evacuation of area buildings](http://wjla.com/news/local/pennsylvania-avenue-closed-for-report-of-suspicious-package) and some [street closures](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2016/09/19/suspicious-package-closes-9th-street-and-pennsylvania-avenue-in-northwest-d-c/).

Thankfully, the police just completed their investigation and [issued the all-clear](http://wjla.com/news/local/all-clear-after-police-investigate-suspicious-package-near-white-house). But one can understand the need to take such reports seriously. In the wake of bomb incidents in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, one must pay attention to risk — which is, after all, a big part of what lawyers do.

# Dear Biglaw Firms, Please Don't Raise Salaries

Here’s a frightening fact: two out of the last three [major Biglaw pay raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-who-will-lead-the-charge/) were followed in a year’s time by recessions. Think of law firm salary hikes as a leading economic indicator.

In February 2000, Davis Polk took starting salaries in New York from $105,000 to $125,000. In [March 2001](http://www.nber.org/cycles.html), the post-dot-com recession started.

In February 2006, Sullivan & Cromwell took starting salaries from $125,000 to $145,000. The economy kept on chugging for a bit. In January 2007, less than a year later, Simpson Thacher took starting salaries from $145,000 to $160,000. By [December 2007](http://www.nber.org/cycles.html), the Great Recession began.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Biglaw associates, we’re happy for you and your pay raises (and our traffic). Indeed, in our [NY to 190](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/ny-to-190/) series of articles, we [argued in favor](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-5-arguments-in-favor-of-a-biglaw-pay-hike/) of a pay raise that was long overdue. We published the first column in the series [on May 5](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-5-arguments-in-favor-of-a-biglaw-pay-hike/); one month later, on June 6, Cravath [raised starting salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/).

That was the right move — for Cravath, and for Cravath’s (true) peer firms. It’s not the right move for everyone.

Good news eventually gets followed by bad. We’re enjoying summer right now, but as they say, [winter is coming](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Winter_is_Coming_(motto)). Law firms need to be prepared for the inevitable economic downturn that Biglaw pay raises often usher in.

And some industry observers argue that firms aren’t prepared for the next recession. For example, according to law firm consultancy Altman Weil, too many firms have excess capacity and [should be conducting layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/biglaw-firms-must-conduct-more-layoffs-before-its-too-late/?rf=1) — but aren’t.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
If certain firms need to be cutting headcount to save money, they definitely don’t need to be raising associate salaries. They don’t need to be paying more money for the same lawyer labor. Trying to [keep up with the Cravathians](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/12/keeping-up-with-the-cravathians-the-ten-most-generous-or-foolish-law-firms/) if you can’t afford it is just a recipe for disaster. Raising salaries now will just mean more layoffs, more partner defections, and more risk of firm collapse later, when the next recession arrives.

Are you a firm that should be raising salaries, or are you a firm that should be keeping your powder dry? Managing partners, you know your own firms better than we do, obviously. You have the data — information on profits and revenue, billing rates, and utilization rates — that we don’t. Make the best decision for your firm and its people.

Depending on your firm’s position — where it sits in the Biglaw hierarchy, where it operates in the legal market, who your peer firms are and what they have (or haven’t) done — the best decision might be to keep salaries where they are. There’s no point with trying to match Cravath if you don’t play in the same league as Cravath, if you’re not competing for the same clients, matters, and lawyer talent.

Paying on the $180K scale if you’re not in the Cravath tier won’t help you with recruiting anyway. You’ll increase your overhead, but still lose recruits to Cravath-level firms in the end. Cravath and its peers have more prestige, sexier work, and superior exit opportunities, and those factors will serve as the “tiebreakers” if comp is the same.

It might pain you to admit that you’re not in the top tier of Biglaw, but we all need to be honest with ourselves. I’m 5’7″ (on a good day), so I don’t try out for the NBA.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
If you decide not to raise associate pay, will we here at Above the Law [mock](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-salary-hike-not-all-offices-are-created-equal/) or [shame](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/which-vault-top-25-firms-have-not-yet-announced-raises/) you for your [cheapness?](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/ny-to-180k-the-bad-news-who-wont-be-matching/) Yes. We have a job to do.

But so do you, managing partners. Don’t let us, a bunch of former practicing lawyers, tell you how to run your practice. Ignore the carping and stay the course. Do what’s right for your law firm and your lawyers — even if they might not like it.

This is so obvious as to not be worth saying, but we’ll say it anyway: a job paying $160,000 a year is better than no job at all.

After [Milbank announced their 2019 bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/breaking-biglaw-bonuses-are-here/) scale last week, and [Cravath matched it](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/cravath-announces-bonuses-now-the-2019-bonus-season-can-really-begin/), the die has pretty much been cast for the top of the compensation market. Though we’d love to be wrong and see a firm take the leap to become the new compensation leader, that doesn’t seem likely, particularly with Biglaw in [defense mode ](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/law-firms-trying-not-to-go-bankrupt-this-next-recession/)over the coming recession.

Still, there’s a certain cache for the truly elite of Biglaw firms to make their bonus announcements as quickly as possible, once the market rate has been set. So, which firm is the latest to match the Milbank scale on bonuses? Why it’s none other than Paul Weiss, who sent around a memo (available in full on the next page) yesterday announcing the following bonuses:

Class of 2019 – $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2018 – $15,000
Class of 2017 – $25,000
Class of 2016 – $50,000
Class of 2015 – $65,000
Class of 2014 – $80,000
Class of 2013 – $90,000
Class of 2012 and senior – $100,000

There was [some grumpiness initially](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/biglaws-reactions-to-same-bank-bonuses/) from associates at the market bonus scale being the same as last year’s. However, with multiple elite firms now on board, this scale will likely dominate across Biglaw.

With commencement now in the rearview mirror, recent law school graduates will soon take the bar exam before moving on to their first jobs in the legal profession this fall. As with all new things, these fresh-faced lawyers will have many, many questions — some of which they may be afraid to ask — about what their lives in Biglaw will look like, and how they can make the most of what may be a challenging experience.

Who better to answer these questions than the leader of one of the top firms in the country?

I recently had the pleasure of chatting with [Jon Van Gorp](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/people/v/van-gorp-jon-d?tab=overview), chairman of Mayer Brown, a top 20 Am Law firm, to get his thoughts on what incoming associates need to know about how they can succeed in Biglaw. Here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our lively conversation on how first-years can learn, grow, and build meaningful careers with their firms.

Staci Zaretsky (SZ): Hundreds of recent law school graduates will soon be joining Biglaw firms as first-year associates. What’s the most important thing they can do to ensure they start their careers off on the right foot?

Jon Van Gorp (JVG): Focus on connecting with colleagues, preferably in the office. And not just with the partner giving you work, but also with a wide range of people including business services staff teams, IT experts, and fellow associates. Not successfully building and maintaining internal relationships from the outset can hinder your development, so make these connections early and often. The relationship skills you develop by building internal relationships are essential tools for working with clients and generating new business later in your career.

SZ: Working well with others is the key to a successful law practice. What would you recommend they do to promote meaningful relationships with their fellow associates and partners?

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
JVG: I am a disciple of The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey. The book makes two important points about relationships. The first point is about emotional bank accounts. If you help somebody, you make a deposit in your account with that person and the relationship grows. If you don’t help somebody when they need help, or if you continually ask for help but rarely give back, you make withdrawals from your account with that person and the relationship shrinks. Relationships are symbiotic and need to work for both people, so be aware of that fact and make a big effort to help others. Commit to building positive balances in your emotional bank accounts right from the start.

The second point is about listening. Covey’s rule is to seek to understand before being understood. Biglaw is complicated. As a new associate you will be required to address a wide range of intricate issues. Good listeners are a valuable commodity. Too many people like to hear themselves talk and therefore they often try to address issues before they understand them.

At Mayer Brown we have a free-market system where associates can work with whom they want, and partners can work with whom they want. We value this system not only because it creates incentives for positive behavior by both partners and associates, but also because it mirrors the reality of how partners build relationships to attract and retain clients. Associates who make an effort to give more than they take and who strive to develop a deep understanding of key issues typically succeed in this system. They build strong connections with the right people and stay busy.

SZ: Relatedly, what do you think is the best way to develop a relationship with a mentor, be it a senior associate or a partner?

JVG: Like many firms, at Mayer Brown we have programs that help mentees connect with mentors, but first-year associates should intentionally seek out mentors. It’s perfectly appropriate to be forward and ask somebody to be your mentor. I can’t recall a partner ever turning down a mentor request. It’s flattering to be asked.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
As an associate at Mayer Brown, I had several mentors, and they all played a key role in the development of my career. I still have several mentors and mentees today. I find those relationships very rewarding, especially when the mentees reverse-mentor me! I hope my mentors and mentees feel the same way.

SZ: How can a first-year associate figure out what their legal specialty should be? 

JVG: This is an important issue. Associates sometimes come to a firm with the idea that they can’t change their mind. More new lawyers should approach Biglaw with an open mind about finding the best career path for them. Practicing law is much different than studying law in law school. Law schools teach you how to think and expose you to various areas of law, but it’s hard to get a true understanding of private practice until you are at a firm doing the work. Life is too short and the work is too hard to practice in an area that you don’t find interesting and motivating.

Summer programs help with that process, but even after that experience, it’s common for associates to start in a particular practice area and not feel fully engaged and excited about their work. This is a hard job, and you really don’t want to get stuck in an area of law that you don’t find intellectually satisfying. The most successful people enjoy their work. If you don’t like what you are doing early in your career, be brave and consider making a change.

SZ: Once they’ve decided the area of law they’d like to practice in, is there a secret they should know about how they can succeed? 

JVG: During your first year at a law firm, there will be a lot of things you don’t know how to do. Your more experienced colleagues understand that. When faced with a particularly challenging project, get it as far down the road as you can, but don’t torture yourself to get it all absolutely right. Sometimes first-years get so overwhelmed by the challenging tasks that they end up making errors on the simpler tasks they really should get right, such as avoiding typos, taking good notes on a call, and being on time for meetings.

Get right what you should get right, and give yourself a break on the more challenging tasks. You’ll get better the more you practice.

SZ: Even in a post-pandemic world where hybrid work schedules are prioritized, it can be important for newer associates to go to the office. Why is in-person work so valuable for first-years?

JVG: Law firms still have the apprentice/mentor training model. It’s similar to medical school. It’s sometimes described as the “learn one, do one, teach one” approach. You first learn how a task is done, then you develop your skill by doing the task yourself, and then you refine your talent by teaching others how to do it. That process works best when you are working collaboratively with others in the office. It can happen virtually, and we all appreciate the value of workplace flexibility, but this process happens more quickly and organically when working together in the office. And relationships with other associates and partners also clearly develop more organically when interacting in person.

SZ: With strenuous billable-hour requirements, working as an associate can sometimes be overwhelming. What’s your number-one tip on how new associates can manage the Biglaw grind and achieve a sense of work-life balance?

JVG: This can be a wonderful career, but you need to conscientiously take care of yourself. At Mayer Brown, we focus on mental health. One of the most important things you can do for your mental health is to make time in your workweek for healthy activities. The legal industry has progressed a lot in terms of addressing work-life balance issues. Yes, you often will need to work long hours and sometimes with little to no notice, but it is acceptable to tell a partner, for example, that you have a yoga class at 7 p.m. on Wednesday nights and expect to consistently get there. During a deal closing or a trial you might miss that class, but you’ll probably be able to make it most of the time. We are better lawyers if we can find a sustainable balance in our lives.

SZ: Biglaw is certainly a rewarding career path (financially and otherwise), but not everyone is cut out for it, despite what they may believe. What should new associates do if they discover that Biglaw isn’t the job they dreamed of?

JVG: Definitely don’t make it just about the money. The right job is out there for everybody, though not everybody finds their perfect fit. It’s important to always be aware of alternatives and have the courage to explore. We see people leave for in-house positions or shift to another industry. When I hear about it, I’m typically happy for them because change can be scary, and they have overcome fear and taken the initiative to forge a new path that might be more professionally satisfying. Biglaw is not for everyone.

On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, we’d like to thank Jon Van Gorp of Mayer Brown for taking the time to help answer some of the most pressing career questions for incoming Biglaw associates.

# Dershowitz Seeks To Bring Unknown Sketchy Dude Into Defamation Case
## It just keeps getting weirder.

If you didn’t think the ongoing defamation suit between Harvard Law’s Alan Dershowitz, Jeffrey Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre, and Giuffre’s now-disqualified former attorney David Boies couldn’t get any more dramatic, there’s now a computer guy who’s maybe a hacker and almost certainly a con man that no one can identify smack in the middle of it all.

For some reason, Dershowitz wants to make this guy’s role a tentpole of his case.

At [a hearing yesterday](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article237958989.html), Alan Dershowitz’s attorney Howard Cooper told Judge Preska that they intend to use discovery to explore the relationship between Boies, a different Giuffre attorney named Stanley Pottinger, and this unknown, now disappeared, computer guy.

While not making any hard-and-fast decisions on the issue, Judge Preska seemed less enthusiastic about an open-ended expedition:

“We are not doing all this stuff. This is not going to be a book for my dear friends the reporters to write on this whole matter. We need to narrow it down and get to the issues quickly,” Preska said.

This whole computer affair came to light over the weekend, when the New York Times told the story of a guy calling himself Patrick Kessler. Kessler — which is what we’ll call him even though the Times was unable to confirm his identity — apparently presented himself as having gained access to Jeffrey Epstein’s video records when he was hired to encrypt them. He claimed that he had secured photographic evidence of prominent men taking part in Epstein’s underaged sex-trafficking operation and tried to present his supposed evidence to Boies and Pottinger, who hoped to use the evidence to support legal claims brought by victims they represented.

According to the Times article, after being unveiled as a possible source in the case, Kessler told reporters privately that he’d grown disillusioned with the Giuffre team, believing that it wouldn’t use the evidence to expose the perpetrators publicly — supposedly Kessler’s paramount interest as a means of preventing future abuse — and that he wanted to work with the media instead. The article asserts that Pottinger had made a series of sketchy statements to Kessler that led Kessler to believe the attorney wasn’t on the level, including statements about securing settlements to pay Kessler out of legal fees and agreements to become attorneys for the alleged abusers.

Of course, the NY Times source on this was… Kessler. That means the guy the paper ultimately suggests was a con man was also their source? That doesn’t raise any red flags?

Non-lawyers jump to conclusions [about how lawyers are paid all the time](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/yes-this-is-how-much-a-biglaw-partner-working-for-one-week-bills/), imagining every agreement to be some sort of corrupt bargain instead of just how the industry works. And representing the other side after a settlement — something the Boies firm attests in a statement was never considered — isn’t unheard of as a settlement condition. If a non-lawyer heard that and didn’t know any better they could easily assume it’s a shady double-cross of the victim instead of functionally a retainer not to sue the defendant again post-recovery. Maybe Pottinger did say and mean some crazy stuff, but years of reading non-lawyers report on the legal industry makes me skeptical, especially when they’re just reporting based on the tale of someone they openly doubt throughout the rest of the piece.

It’s almost as though the Times tried to connect dots that weren’t there, trying to draw parallels with the infamous Trump Tower meeting, suggesting that trying to secure evidence in a civil lawsuit is the same as entertaining kompromat from a foreign power in an election. They are, you know, different.

For its part, BSF released a statement addressing the Times narrative that Boies or any of his partners were trying to keep Kessler’s revelations secret:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
By way of example, the NYT knew all of the following: David Boies only attended two meetings with the NYT’s source (on September 9 and September 14, the latter of which was also attended by the NYT reporters), nothing was said at either meeting that supports the NYT’s narrative, no one from BSF had any other communications of any kind at any time with the NYT’s source, and no one from BSF participated in, or was contemporaneously aware of, the text messages exchanged between other parties that the NYT references. The NYT also selectively elided or omitted from its reporting key facts, documents, and interviews inconsistent with its chosen narrative. The fact that the FBI and U.S. Attorney’s Office were informed of these contacts belies the NYT’s assertions of wrongdoing.

Informing the authorities would make for a really difficult blackmail operation, which after all, is Dershowitz’s claim. And obviously the lawyers brought in the FBI and prosecutors because if this Kessler person was telling the truth, he had access to images of child exploitation which the government would absolutely need to know about.

But the craziest part of the Times article is when it explains that Kessler then went to Dershowitz and told him, in a recorded conversation that the reporters suggest may have been rehearsed, that none of Kessler’s supposed evidence showed Dershowitz. It’s not particularly clear why someone trying to publicly expose people would ever go to another guy accused of this stuff. Even if he had no evidence showing Dershowitz involved, this Kessler guy would have no reason to think that was dispositive. He couldn’t have believed he had the entire universe of every Epstein encounter ever, so under the most generous theory, Kessler’s basically telling Dershowitz, “I can’t prove you definitely did anything, so I’m assuming that my not having a photo of it is more believable than a woman’s testimony.”

That’s… not particularly compelling.

What is the point of dragging Kessler into this case? Does Kessler’s statement supposedly exonerate Dershowitz? Because that would involve believing Kessler was the genuine article. Or did Boies taking a meeting with Kessler support the claim that people are trying to blackmail Dershowitz with false claims? Because that would involve believing Kessler was a con man. If Kessler was a fraud then the lawyers got duped but that also means everyone’s back at square one. If Pottinger crossed the line in the stuff he told Kessler — which we can only really back up with Kessler’s story to reporters — it may be unethical but also not end up having much bearing on the truth of the claims at hand.

The only thing more astounding than the fact that a random mystery man has managed to troll a high-profile litigation is the altogether depressing idea that we may still be talking about him for months on end.

# Biglaw Firm Bumps Up Salary For Junior Associates -- More Experienced Attorneys Feel The Pinch
## To add insult to injury, they have to wait months to see any extra money.

The associate compensation arms race can be fickle. Sure, it’s great if you’re at a firm that wants to be seen as elite, one that blindly raises associate salaries to whatever standard the firms at the top of the rankings have determined. But, sometimes firms just want the recruiting advantage of being able to tout the sexy first-year associate number — $190,000 — and they let their most experienced attorneys languish behind the market standard.

That’s what [Mintz Levin did in 2016](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/biglaw-firm-finally-raises-salaries-but-will-make-associates-wait-until-fall-to-see-more-cash/?rf=1) when the last round of associate raises made its way through Biglaw. And it appears as though they’re doing the same thing this go around, with the compression of the salary scale starting with fourth-year associates. As [reported by](https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2018/07/26/mintz-to-raise-associate-salaries-rethink-bonus.html) Boston Business Journal:

First- through third-year Mintz associates will see pay bumps of $10,000, matching the salaries first established by the New York firm Milbank Tweed Haldey & McCloy LLP in June. However, fourth- through eighth-year associates will not make as much as their peers at top-paying firms, though many of them are also getting raises. The salary difference for those lawyers is anywhere between $5,000 and $40,000 a year.

Oh, and the raises take effect several months after most Biglaw associates got their money, on January 1.

Even before the firm announced raises for the junior associates, Above the Law was hearing from senior associates who are frustrated their own salaries aren’t keeping up with the Cravaths:

[Compression] is a growing point of frustration for me and my colleagues at Mintz Levin. When we raised salaries in 2016, the raise phased out at the 7th year – meaning that associate base salaries are capped at $300k and the lockstep doesn’t continue. This already puts Mintz Levin 8+ years at least $15k behind its “peer” firms. But now the gap is getting bigger – and we will soon find Mintz attorneys lagging $25k-$50k behind their peers at other firms for doing the same job. Meanwhile, Goodwin and Ropes have already raised, and I bet other Boston firms aren’t far behind. This must be even more frustrating for those in NYC where cost of living is higher. Do something, ML!

Now that their fears have been confirmed, I can only imagine how receptive to headhunters they’ll be.

Plus, there’s no special summer bonuses for Mintz Levin associates. Though managing partner Bob Bodian said they’re considering how associate bonuses are allocated so top billers get more money, the firm won’t be increased the overall size of the bonus pool, so that extra money (if they make changes to the structure) has to come from another associate’s pocket:

Mintz associates will not be receiving the same $5,000 to $25,000 summer bonuses that some firms have announced along with the salary increases, Bodian said. He told the Business Journal that the firm is reviewing its overall bonus program. It’s not considering changing the total annual bonus pool, so much as it’s rethinking how it distributes that pool of money both across and within associate classes, he said.

“We’re considering altering it so that the highest-performing associates are able to get bonuses equivalent to the top tier of Wall Street firms,” Bodian said.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff.

# Informed Advice: A Law Firm Strategy To Maximize Value For Clients

About 10 years ago, three siblings in my extended family decided to have their oldest brother, Joe, added to the brokerage account of their aging, widowed mother. It seemed like the most pragmatic solution to help manage their mother’s finances, so they agreed to have Joe added. A couple of years later, their new financial advisor told them, “You know that having your brother Joe on the brokerage account means that all the money will go to him when your mother passes.” That single sentence was the sum of the advice.

The new advisor was correct and could cite the rules: the money in the joint account would legally transfer to Joe when their mother passed – but the advice was incomplete, leaving out important facts and did not address the family’s needs. The sons’ mother was lonely and in another part of the country, and care workers who were supposed to help her had taken advantage of her in the past and became her “friends.”  More importantly, she had a gambling problem; a “friend” had once taken her to a casino where she lost $9000 in a single evening.

The siblings needed more comprehensive advice from their financial advisor that addressed their needs more completely and provided visibility into their mother’s finances. While their solution was not perfect, the siblings did understand that “the money would go to Joe” and knew they could work it out because they trusted each other. But the financial advisor simply stuck to technical advice, missing the opportunity to help his clients come up with a better solution that met their needs.

Needless to say, the family found another financial advisor that was able to set up a trust and work with an estate expert to address the issues at hand.

The story above illustrates an issue that surfaces in a number of professions – including legal services – that provide advice, specialized knowledge, and counsel. Professional management consultants can make the mistake of providing advice that is technically correct, but misses the needs and desired outcomes of a client. And at a time when gaps have continued to surface between[ law firms’ performance and corporate legal departments’ expectations](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/know/future-ready-lawyer-2021), it’s more important than ever for law firms to find more ways to bridge that gap and provide as much value as possible for their clients.

Many factors go into how a trusted advisor engages a client, including emotional intelligence and the ability to manage the nuances of complex engagements and challenging client situations. Here are three ways that law firms and aspiring attorneys can acquire those skills and provide better outcomes and increase satisfaction for clients.

Deepen your understanding of a client’s business.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Ask questions and understand your client. What is their business strategy? Key operating initiatives?  What is their operational footprint, and what laws are most relevant to them based upon where they operate? What does success mean for your client?

Law firms are being asked to “see around corners” and provide guidance on regulatory changes that may impact their clients. Even with a limited budget for an engagement, a savvy attorney can relate pure legal advice back to the business needs of the client. Perhaps that wasn’t included in the engagement, but by understanding more about a client’s business – including the context of an engagement with them – you may get permission to go deeper or ask questions that help a client understand how to use your advice in the context of their business to achieve better outcomes.

Perhaps you are an associate working on a new engagement. Be strategic and do your homework. When opportunities present themselves, ask your partner for more background or to tell a story about the client. If you can learn as much as you can about your key clients, you’ll be better able to help them as well as your partner.

Understand what other advice has been provided.

I’ve heard of situations in other consulting industries where one part of a firm provided advice that was inconsistent with advice provided to other clients (or even the same client). A strong knowledge management process can help minimize this.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
You can leverage your knowledge management system by making sure that information about engagements and prior engagements are captured in the system to help provide more context and history that can inform future advice. This best practice has less to do with technology itself and more about how you use it to capture information and then balance client confidentiality with the “need to know.”

As an associate, you can become an expert in your firm’s knowledge management system. If you have permission, set alerts and monitor news about your most important clients, and wherever possible, seek to develop relationships with those who can help you learn more about your clients and from other perspectives.

Consider scenarios when providing advice.

Compliance with laws and regulations can be challenging. When providing advice, it may be helpful to frame the advice in the context of the business and use that context to walk through alternatives. This can help stimulate thought and guide clients to better assess how to comply.

To illustrate, let’s take the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that was designed to protect the privacy of European citizens and their data. GDPR was adopted in 2016, but was not enforceable until May 25, 2018. IT and management consultants, accounting firms, and law firms everywhere were drumming up business because the vast majority of impacted businesses were highly likely to be unprepared for compliance with the regulation on Day 1.

I’ve heard some crazy advice that lacked context around the likelihood of penalties and enforcement. Some businesses moved their focus away from very important data security tasks that might have been more important and material than the risk of non-compliance on Day 1 for GDPR. On the other hand, some organizations leveraged the GDPR issue to upgrade infrastructure and processes that solved for more than just GDPR.

The point is that having a discussion around alternatives and the likely outcomes of advice can help a client make a more informed decision that can benefit them beyond solving the issue at hand.

The relationship between clients and law firms is changing, and clients are looking for more and more from outside counsel every day. Law firms can strengthen their relationships and help support better outcomes that increase client satisfaction by looking for more value-adding ways to contextualize the counsel they provide. Technology tools can play an essential role, but the processes to deploy those solutions are perhaps more important than the technology itself. And just like the financial advisor that advised the siblings about how to handle the complexities of their elderly mother’s situation, law firms and attorneys have an opportunity to tailor their counsel by acquiring a better understanding of their clients’ needs. Helping a client to understand the full picture can ultimately help them comply with law, achieve their business goals – and grow the client’s trust in your firm to ensure a long-term, beneficial relationship in the future.

# Remember That Raise We Told You About... We Have Some Bad News

UPDATE (7/1/16, 12:09 p.m.): Uh-oh… associates are going to be even madder. Read on….

Oh, June 16th… It seems so very long ago. Back then, Morgan Lewis associates were delighted to hear that their firm was [matching the celebrated Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-associate-pay-raise-from-the-largest-firm-yet-to-hike-salaries/). Firm chair [Jami Wintz McKeon](https://www.morganlewis.com/bios/jmckeon) let everyone know via an after-hours (technically… I mean, as if anyone is actually gone before 7 p.m.) voicemail and promised a full memo would follow.

And then we waited.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
And waited.

Now, on July 1st, the date everyone expects to see their new raises take effect, the other shoe drops:

The firm chair sent us a voicemail last night finally disclosing the “additional details” she left out of her voicemail from two weeks ago (most notably, when the raises would actually go into effect).  We were told that the firm’s raises wouldn’t be implemented until 10/1, the beginning of our fiscal year, “because it would be easier administratively” — but not to worry, because they would be giving all associates in good standing a true-up bonus catching up what we should have been paid between July and October. They also said this would give them time to figure what they should pay their 8th years who, unlike 99% of our peer firms, are not staying on the Cravath scale and instead are having their salaries determined on a case by case basis. Oh, and not addressed in the voicemail was the fact that, apparently, unlike pretty much everyone else we’re not giving the raise to our summers (or if we are, associates weren’t told that – perhaps because it would piss us off that they could get theirs immediately but we can’t).

Waiting until October for raises? Placing eighth-years on “case-by-case” compensation? Not paying summers? These are a whole lot of details to leave out of the first message. UPDATE (7/1/16 12:09 p.m.): We’ve been advised that the summers ARE getting raises now, meaning they’re currently getting paychecks bigger than first-years, which is… I mean, wow.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Unless the first message was designed to reap all the positive PR of a match and then hope everyone is off the subject by July. But we wouldn’t want to believe any firm could be so cynical.

At least there’s this vague promise of a bonus to cover the gap (months in the future), but some associates aren’t too confident:

Morgan Lewis just heard that our pay raise won’t go into effect til the next fiscal year on October 1, with a “make whole bonus.” Embarrassing. Morgan Lewis was basically dragged complaining and screaming into the pay raise. No wonder we are having problems with recruiting.

A make whole bonus for “associates in good standing,” whatever that means.

And it sounds like the firm is already resorting to the unfortunate, entirely ominous warnings — as if to scold their own associates for having the audacity to continue working in a world where Cravath’s partners have changed the rules:

Steven Brown, a member of firm management, held a town hall prior to announcing the raises and made some pretty scary comments indicating that if the firm raises salaries they’ll have to “consider what to do about under-utilized associates” as well as raising the firm’s minimum billable hour requirement. So the fact that they’ve pushed the raise effective date out to the beginning of the next fiscal year has a lot of people nervous that layoffs are coming.

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

According to data collected by Leopard Solutions, in the first nine months of 2022, what percentage of women who left a firm in the top 200 actually lateraled to another Biglaw firm?

Hint: Last year only 35 percent circulated back to Biglaw, but Biglaw’s retention of women has gotten even worse.

A new study from Leopard Solutions shows just how high this lawyer demand is spiking. 

Leopard announced on Tuesday that its database shows over 8,000 openings for lawyer jobs, marking 150% growth since the start of the pandemic and higher levels than before COVID hit.

Leopard data also reveals 70% growth in open attorney jobs in 2021 (as of May 14), along with a 106% increase in open attorney jobs since Oct. 1.  

“The challenge for law firms will now be how to source candidates in a competitive market as well as how to retain their people,” Leopard’s announcement says.

# How Global Biglaw Titans Are Demolishing Local Firms... And How To Survive The Onslaught
## When global firms step into smaller markets, the old guard face tough times. But the challenges aren't insurmountable.

While the legal world hangs on every salary announcement, wondering when the windfall will hit them, one of the most significant developments in the industry over the last decade — one that’s largely responsible for the explosion in [associate salaries across the country](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/) — is the ruthless expansion of global Biglaw firms into smaller domestic markets.

Through acquisitions, mass lateral hires, or simply hanging a multi-million dollar shingle, the Biglaw elite are moving in on local and regional markets that they’ve long overlooked and revolutionizing the practice of law across the country. It’s why firms like [Cravath don’t necessarily speak for the Biglaw landscape anymore](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/screw-cravath-whats-kirkland-going-to-do/) — the overwhelming bulk of elite firms are galavanting across the globe, discontent to stay at home in New York. It’s a different business model and firms are starting to wake up to that reality.

But when we say, “galavanting across the globe” this downplays Biglaw’s aggressive invasion of domestic markets. In [Barbarians at the Gate](https://www.alm.com/intelligence/solutions-we-provide/business-of-law-solutions/analyst-reports/barbarians-gate-report/), a new report from ALM Intelligence, Nicholas Bruch examines the Biglaw assault on local markets since 2001. The NLJ 250 — the Spinal Tap of rankings in that they primarily differentiate themselves from the same company’s Am Law 200 on the strength of the claim “these go to 250” — have opened more than 1400 new offices globally over the past two decades. Since 2001, a whopping 71 percent of new offices have been domestic.

What does all this mean? More lateral partner moves for one. “Eight of the top 10 markets for lateral hires since 2001 are also included in the list of the top 10 markets for law firm market entries over the same period.” It shouldn’t come as a shock that those laterals were mostly exiting established local firms, bringing an influx of local connections to the interloper firm. It’s also driven a more competitive recruiting market, with global firms often shelling out New York salaries to young lawyers in historically cheaper markets.

But mostly, this has meant hard times for the formerly big fish in these little ponds. Bruch’s report zeroes in on the Houston market, arguably the market that’s transformed the most over the last 17 years. Back then, Houston was dominated by local firms:

In 2001, the Houston market was, in many respects, a typical local legal market. Despite being host to a large number of law firms, Houston was largely dominated by eight firms. These firms accounted for 66 percent of Houston’s total lawyer headcount. They were also largely local firms. Vinson & Elkins, for example had 50 percent of its total lawyers in Houston and 80 percent of its lawyers in Texas. Fulbright & Jaworski, Baker Botts, Andrews Kurth, Bracewell, Locke Liddell, Haynes and Boone, and Winstead were also, largely, local firms. Each had a majority of their lawyers in Texas, large Houston offices, and offices in other key Texas business centers….

A trip to Houston today would find a much more crowded landscape, with a 135 percent increase in the number of NLJ 250 firms playing in the Houston market since 2001. It goes without saying that this growth wasn’t driven by a boom among local firms. Global players rolled in and started drinking the proverbial milkshake:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Altogether, Houston’s eight leading firms have lost 390 partners to lateral departures in Houston since 2001. Even after adjusting those losses to account for lateral hires that these firm engaged in, leading local firms lost a net total of 101 partners in the Houston market since 2001. These departures, combined with slower growth due to the increased competitive pressure, has resulted in significant headcount reductions at all eight leading firms…. Vinson & Elkins’ Houston office lost 155 lawyers, including partners and associates, between 2001 and 2017. Fulbright & Jaworski, which merged with Norton Rose in 2013, is 83 lawyers smaller in Houston. In total, Houston’s leading firms have lost nearly 500 local lawyers since 2001, reducing their share of the Houston market from 66 percent in 2001 to 40 percent in 2017.

Yet the local firms have held on. Battered, bruised, but still holding on. Bruch points out that some of Houston’s old guard may have taken big hits in headcount, but some have managed to actually improve profitability, adjusted for inflation, over this period. He points to a number of strategies, from Baker Botts adopting a “regional plus” strategy to Winstead attacking costs (though that firm is [rumored to be in merger talks](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/are-we-looking-at-a-texas-sized-biglaw-merger/)) to Vinson & Elkins narrowing its practice area focus. Could they provide a blueprint to local firms in other markets staring down the next invasion? Perhaps.

On the other hand, maybe Houston is just unique. Houston’s metro area grew by around 43 percent over the last 17 years. That’s actually a slightly bigger bump than the bump in NLJ 250 firms in town. To borrow from the mythical Westerns that Texans like to pretend they embody, this just might be a case of the town really being big enough for the both of ’em. Rapid growth and an expansion in industry beyond a singular energy focus have meant there’s enough business to go around, even in a more competitive environment. Could Seattle pull that off if Biglaw brings its Galactus act to the Northwest in earnest? Based on analyzing trends in San Francisco, Chicago, and Boston, Bruch doesn’t think Houston is unique in this regard, so the Texas experience may resonate throughout the country. But it’s a tough question that we’ll just have to see play out over the next few years.

Unless the coming recession puts all this on hold next year.

# Biglaw Firms Pledge To Help Lawyers Struggling With Substance Abuse, Mental Health Issues
## Far too many lawyers and legal professionals have suffered in silence for far too long. It's time to do something about it.

Thanks to a recent study by the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation and the American Bar Association Commission on Lawyer Assistance Programs, [we know](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/biglaw-managing-partner-opens-up-about-alcoholism/) that between 21 and 36 percent of licensed, employed attorneys qualify as problem drinkers, about 28 percent struggle with some level of depression, 19 percent demonstrate symptoms of anxiety, and 23 percent have difficulties with stress. This has been the case for years, and we fear that these startling numbers may be on the low end of the scale — after all, not everyone with a mental health or substance-abuse problem is willing to admit it to themselves or others.

The ABA is now offering law firms a way to bring greater awareness to these issues and help attorneys in need.

The ABA rolled out this initiative today, and its leaders hope that all law firms will adopt its seven-point framework by the start of 2019. Thus far, more than a dozen leading law firms have pledged to become part of the inaugural class of employers for this compassionate campaign. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/09/10/aba-sounds-new-alarm-on-substance-abuse-and-law-firms-pledge-action/) has some additional details:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Am Law 100 firms Akin Gump, Duane Morris, Latham & Watkins, Morgan Lewis & Bockius, Nixon Peabody, Perkins Coie, Reed Smith and Seyfarth Shaw have already signed on to be part of the inaugural class of employers. They are joined by Am Law 200 firms Honigman Miller Schwartz and Cohn, Schiff Hardin, Snell & Wilmer, Wiley Rein, along with Butte, Montana-based Corette Black Carlson & Mickelson. The ABA is also asking all entities that employ lawyers, including corporate legal departments, to make the pledge and join the group.

The framework, developed by lawyer and alcohol and drug counselor Patrick Krill, seeks to reduce the level of substance abuse in the profession.

Krill’s framework involves firms providing “enhanced and robust education” on healthful living to all attorneys and staff; decreasing the number of drinking-based law firm events and providing non-alcoholic alternatives; developing partnerships with lawyer assistance programs and other experts with an eye toward reducing substance abuse; pledging to provide confidential access to addiction and mental health experts; adopting back-to-work policies for employees following treatment of substance use and mental health problems; offering programming to improve mental and emotional well-being; and highlighting the availability of these programs as a recruiting tool.

“I wholeheartedly support this important effort to assist and improve the health of lawyers in this country,” said ABA President Bob Carlson. “Many lawyers have struggled with alcohol, other substance-use or mental health disorders, and many more of us have watched friends wrestle with them. This pledge campaign will give these issues the attention they deserve by raising awareness throughout the profession and making help available to lawyers in need. I hope all law firms consider taking the pledge.”

Far too many lawyers and legal professionals have suffered in silence for far too long with mental health and substance-abuse problems. The more law firms that adopt this worthy pledge to offer their employees the assistance that they need, the better.

# Some Clients Might Like To Pay Higher Legal Fees
## Although cheaper counsel likely could do the trick, the optics of hiring an expensive law firm might be important in some cases.

There is a well-understood notion that the price of something might impact the perception people have of that good or service. For instance, studies have shown that people might perceive colleges that have high tuition costs as being more well-regarded than colleges that have lower tuition costs because it is apparently believed that the [higher cost means that there is a higher quality](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/12/education/12tuition.html) associated with the expense.

Similarly, some clients may feel that, if they are paying higher hourly rates for their counsel, then they are getting better legal services than if they had selected attorneys who charged less. Accordingly, it seems that some clients might actually feel more comfortable hiring counsel who charge higher rates than equivalent counsel who has a lower billable-hour rate.

I first encountered this perception earlier in my career when I was speaking to a partner about how he originated a client whom we charged higher-than-usual rates. The partner discussed how he pitched our firm to the prospective client and then stated our hourly rates. The client seemed shocked at how low our rates were and seemed to suggest that we would be a good fit for this portfolio of work but that the lower rates conveyed that our firm might not be the type of shop that could handle the complex matter our future client had. The point person we spoke to said that he had to pitch our firm to other people at the business who might think he was cheaping out by hiring our firm which had lower rates.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The partner said that he thought on his feet quickly, and told the client that those “introductory” rates would only be charged for a certain period. Afterward, the client would be charged a higher rate for the work our firm performed on the client’s business. The client apparently seemed content with this arrangement and that is how our firm allegedly originated this client. Of course, I am unsure of the ethics of this all, and the story might have been embellished some by the partner (and misremembered by me nearly a decade after I heard the story) but this example is prime proof that some clients might feel more comfortable paying higher rates.

More recently, I was talking with a group of professionals at a party, and it quickly became known that I was an attorney. One of the people in the group mentioned that he had recently hired an attorney to look at a complex employment agreement his employer had asked him to sign. This person asked me the hourly rate that my firm charged, presumably to see if he got a good deal, and I told him my firm’s typical hourly rate.

This person related that his attorney charged him nearly double what my firm charged to perform his legal work. However, rather than sound outraged, it was almost like this person was bragging about this fact. This person I talked to sounded like he wanted others to know that he was the kind of guy who could afford a more expensive lawyer and that he was the kind of guy who would spend extra money to make sure he got top-notch services. It seems paying higher legal fees can sometimes project some kind of image to others, and for this reason, certain clients might not be too upset paying higher costs.

Sometimes clients may prefer to pay higher rates so that they can cover themselves or show someone that they are going out of their way to give them the most premium representation possible. One time, I was representing a client who was convinced to take a course of action that would be beneficial to the client and a third party, but which could result in litigation. This third party agreed to indemnify my client and set him up with extremely expensive counsel that the third party was going to pay for itself, subject to all the conflict-of-interest waivers being in order. I wondered why the third party had gone out of its way to hire an extremely expensive law firm that easily charged double or more than what my firm charged, but I think they did it just to give the client confidence that this party had his back. Although cheaper counsel likely could have done the trick, the optics of hiring an expensive law firm might have been important in this case.

# Will Partner Poaching Stop This Rumored Biglaw Merger In Its Tracks?
## Neither firm has commented on their reported trip down the aisle.

Remember the supposed merger between Andrews Kurth Kenyon and Hunton & Williams that was being whispered about this past fall? Back then, it was a bit of a [“will they or won’t they” situation](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/will-they-or-wont-they-rumors-abound-about-potential-biglaw-merger/), but the fact that Andrews Kurth partners were parading toward the exits seemed to indicate that merger talks may have been in progress. Sources say there will be news by late February as to whether the deal will go through, but in Biglaw, you know things are serious — and that the firms are wishy-washy about their new combined name — when domain names like andrewshunton.com and huntonandrews.com get registered (as they both were last month).

Considering the fact that even more Andrews Kurth partners are fleeing the firm, it seems like things are getting very serious — but these partner defections, especially from the Dallas office, could pose some problems. Christine Simmons at the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2018/01/26/andrews-kurth-hunton-deal-inches-ahead-amid-texas-market-moves/) has the details:

Those familiar with the talks said Hunton, founded in Richmond, Virginia, is eager to swallow Andrews Kurth’s Houston office in order to gain a toehold in the energy industry’s Texas epicenter. Currently, Hunton’s Houston office, which opened in 2005, lists only five attorneys, including three who are full time in Houston and two partners focused on labor and employment.

In comparison, Andrews Kurth boasts that its Houston base has about 220 lawyers—its largest office by head count—and it is a heavyweight in litigation and deals related to energy and oilfield services, energy infrastructure and private equity investments, among others. …

If the deal were to go forward, other law firms’ poaching of Andrews Kurth’s Dallas office, which has about 54 attorneys at last count, could leave a much-diminished office for Hunton.

If one of the biggest things Hunton was looking for in a merger partner was a major presence in Texas, would the firm be willing to accept AKK’s depleted attorney footprint? Neither firm has commented on their reported trip down the aisle, but since we have fairly reliable sources at our disposal, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Andrews%20Kurth/Hunton%20&%20Williams%20Merger) or text us (646-820-8477) with any information you might have.
