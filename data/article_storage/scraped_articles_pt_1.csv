# In A Punishing Profession, Too Many Lawyers Are Paying The Ultimate Price
## The difference between heeding the warnings and missing the signals can be life and death.

“Best friends with the thing that’s killing me / Enemies with my best friend, there’s no healing me.”  — [Macklemore](https://genius.com/10726430)

Yesterday, Robin Young, host of National Public Radio’s (NPR) Here and Now radio show, interviewed [Eilene Zimmerman](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510051/here-x26-now), who recently penned an article on drug use in the legal profession and the death of her ex-husband, a well-known patent lawyer. Last weekend, Zimmerman’s New York Times article, [“The Lawyer, the Addict — A high-power Silicon Valley attorney dies. His ex-wife investigates, and finds a web of drug abuse in his profession,”](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/15/business/lawyers-addiction-mental-health.html) was the top trending story on the Times website.

Zimmerman did a superb job of talking to various lawyers about the stress and toll of the legal profession, as well as detailing the [disturbing statistics](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/06/05/the-real-reasons-for-big-laws-mental-health-problem/) in our industry. Our own ATL columnist [Brian Cuban](https://abovethelaw.com/author/bcuban/) — who writes and speaks on recovery topics, and who has a new book out, [The Addicted Lawyer](http://amzn.to/2uhFIs8) (affiliate link) — was featured in the NPR interview as well as the NYT article. Zimmerman’s story was reminiscent of a worrisome CNN column I read awhile back, [“Why are lawyers killing themselves?”](http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/19/us/lawyer-suicides/index.html)

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The NPR feature on Zimmerman really brought her poignant NYT article to life. After listening to her interview, I had to read the article again. Zimmerman wrote this feature as a map of her ex-husband’s descent and a commentary on the stresses and abuses of the legal profession. I could not help but also think of her writing as a warning for those who are about to enroll in law school, sit for the bar exam, or begin their careers as attorneys.

Her story about her ex-husband and the data she shares on the various types of drug use in our profession also serve as a reflection of how brutal being a lawyer can be. Here are the most harrowing excerpts from Zimmerman’s NPR interview and NYT article:

- I think what was the most shocking is that there were all these glaring red flags. I think that because he was wealthy, white, well-educated, and lived in this posh neighborhood, IV-drug abuse never even entered the mind. We had every other explanation for it. Maybe he had an eating disorder. Maybe he was hiding AIDS. Maybe he was bipolar. We just couldn’t think of it. [NPR Interview]
- Lawyers are using lots of substances to prop themselves up in an incredible punishing profession, especially at Biglaw firms. [NPR Interview]

- Lawyers and judges have twice the addiction rate when it comes to opioid abuse than the general population does…. I did talk to other attorneys and I talked to a judge, who had been a heroin addict, and several had been opioid addicts. They all said they would have never admitted it if they hadn’t been caught. One guy said to me: “If you admit you have a problem, there’s ten guys standing behind you ready to take your place.” [NPR Interview]
- People enter law school with a certain set of values and a certain level of passion and humanity. They come out the other side without it. It gets stripped out. [NPR Interview]
- It is a shame that Peter had to die for someone to be able to say what he was saying for so long, “I can’t keep doing this, I don’t want to do this for the rest of my life, it is going to kill me working like this.” He sort of missed the whole point of working hard in any profession is for “the life” — to have a life. He kind of missed “the life,” he missed so much of stuff with his kids because he didn’t make it or he was working or he was on a business trip. It is hard to imagine anybody who worked more than he did except other attorneys. [NPR Interview]
- Peter was really dedicated to his clients. Almost to the point where it was a pathology. If they called, he left whatever we were doing. He would miss any meeting for a client, you know he would work on a vacation. I think that single-minded dedication really served his firm and his clients well. He was really good at what he did, but at what price? [NPR Interview]
- Of all the heartbreaking details of his story, the one that continues to haunt me is this: The history on his cellphone shows the last call he ever made was for work. Peter, vomiting, unable to sit up, slipping in and out of consciousness, had managed, somehow, [to dial into a conference call](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/drug-addicted-biglaw-partner-dies-during-conference-call/).

- The further I probed, the more apparent it became that drug abuse among America’s lawyers is on the rise and deeply hidden. [NYT Article]
- According to some reports, lawyers also have the highest rate of depression of any occupational group in the country. [NYT Article]
- “Being a surgeon is stressful, for instance — but not in the same way. It would be like having another surgeon across the table from you trying to undo your operation. In law, you are financially rewarded for being hostile,” according to Wil Miller, an attorney in Bellevue, Washington. [NYT Article]
- Peter was intelligent, ambitious and most of all hard-working, perhaps because his decision to go to law school was such an enormous commitment — financially, logistically and emotionally — that he could justify it only by being the very best. And he was. In law school he was editor of the law review and number 1 in his class. He gave the speech at graduation. [NYT Article]
With the [bar exam quickly approaching](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/law-school-graduates-terrified-of-failing-bar-exam-contemplating-suicide/) for many future attorneys, I thought it was appropriate to talk about the [importance of mental health](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/bar-exam-suicides-are-disturbingly-common-among-recent-law-school-graduates/) in our profession and how critical it is to [keep your sanity](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/keeping-your-sanity-during-the-bar-exam/).

If you find this article insightful, be sure to check out the posts from my fellow columnists [Brian Cuban](https://abovethelaw.com/author/bcuban/) and [Jeena Cho](https://abovethelaw.com/author/jeenacho/), both of whom have written extensively about mental health for ATL.

I hope law school candidates, law students, and lawyers take Zimmerman’s message to heart. As our columnists have written [many times before](https://abovethelaw.com/?s=mental+health), the difference between heeding the warnings and missing the signals can be [life and death](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/the-struggle-two-suicides-in-two-months-at-the-same-law-school/).

# Remote Roles May Be Going Extinct For Biglaw Associates And Staffers
## Is it time to bid adieu to remote work arrangements?

Thanks to the pandemic, Biglaw firms were forced into a whole new world of remote and hybrid workplaces. For more than two years, many firms specifically instructed and encouraged associates and staff to work remotely. But now that worries over COVID-19 seem to be subsiding even amid an uptick in reported cases, remote work as an attorney or legal professional may be coming to an end — and for associates and staff, that’s a very daunting concept.

[Law.com](https://www.law.com/2022/06/08/remote-roles-are-vanishing-as-law-firms-struggle-to-replicate-an-open-door-experience/) has some expert analysis on the issue:

The conversation is most strained at the staff level, according to several industry sources, who note that the balance of power plays a large role in firms’ attitudes and policies.

“Associates to a degree can still go where they want. If they were forced to appear at the office in the flesh, they’d probably vote with their feet,” says Kate Reder Sheikh, a Northern California-based associate recruiter at Major, Lindsey & Africa.

By comparison, “the power dynamics are much harder for staff,” she says. And after all, many lawyers rely on staff to respond to impromptu challenges at a moment’s notice.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Reder Sheikh went on to tell Law.com that while “[associates] hired remote will remain remote,” attorneys who are looking to be hired for remote work jobs “will find fewer and fewer opportunities.”

That said, if you were lucky enough to have found a remote position within the last year or so, then count yourself as one of the lucky, because these jobs seem to be going out of style. If you’re still on the hunt for remote work as an attorney or staffer, may the odds be ever in your favor.

# Associates Get The Raises They've Been Clamoring For At This Biglaw Firm
## Good associate! Here's your raise!

In reality, it hasn’t been *that* long since Milbank upended the Biglaw compensation model and even less time since Davis Polk came over the top of those numbers. But, based on some of the complaints Above the Law has received on our tips line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises) — it *feels* like an awfully long time for associates waiting on salary news. And I’m sure law firm leadership — particularly those in the Top 50 — are aware that associates pretty much expect raises and if they don’t get them, well, the lateral market is calling.

Apropos of, well, exactly that, Covington & Burling — a firm with over a billion dollars in gross revenue ($1,321,296,000 to be exact) and ranked 25th on the Am Law 100 — just announced associate raises this afternoon.

The new salary scale at the firm is as follows:

The new associates (class of 2021) and summer associates will clock in at $202,500 — matching the DPW scale. You can read the [full memo on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/covington-raises/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

The Philadelphia office of Reed Smith has lost 12 attorneys — 11 partners and one of counsel — all of who are heading to the warm embrace of Holland & Knight. The team of lawyers will be opening a Philadelphia office for Holland & Knight and have practices in the areas of executive compensation and employee benefits, banking and financial services, environmental law, employee stock ownership plans, intellectual property, and commercial litigation.

As [reported by](https://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2018/07/10/holland-knight-philly-office-reed-smith-bernstein.html) Philadelphia Business Journal, Reed Smith is losing its office managing partner in Leonard Bernstein as well as partners John Martini, Kelly Bley, James DelBello, Robert Frank, Kerry Halpern, Daniel Mateo, David Pardys, Nipun Patel, Tracy Quinn, Matthew Siembieda, and counsel Robert Jaworski.

Martini will become the executive partner of Holland & Knight’s Philadelphia office. He said the lawyers weren’t looking to make a move, but, in the end lateraling just made too much sense:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“The conversation became more substantial over time,” Martini said. “They had an interest in Philadelphia and we became more interested over time as we realized the synergies that existed with clients and practices.”

For their part, Holland & Knight is pleased with the acquisition. Steven Sonberg, Holland & Knight’s managing partner, noted this is part of the firm’s strategy:

“We try not to set specific targets numbers for lawyers when we open offices,” Sonberg said. “We rely on the local lawyers in those offices to formulate plans. They know best what makes sense. We have had a lot of success in starting offices with teams of lawyers [rather than with one or two lateral additions].”

Congrats to Holland & Knight as they expand to the city of brotherly love.

# On Being A Black American Biglaw Associate
## Being a black Biglaw associate is uniquely difficult. Here are just a few reasons why.

Ed. note: Please welcome Lauren E. Skerrett to the pages of Above the Law. She will be writing about her experiences as a black Biglaw associate.

I am generally a bit hesitant to speak up, especially when there are so many competing voices echoing similar sentiments in the social media chambers we all occupy. But I cannot be silent any longer. I have seen a number of articles addressing the plight of black professionals fighting to exist in corporate America, but I have yet to see any commentary that specifically addresses the demographic to which I belong — the black junior associate attorney working at a large corporate law firm aka “Biglaw.”

I think black attorneys such as myself are in a uniquely challenging position. In addition to being forced to maintain the same semblance of composure and level of productivity as our non-black counterparts (a level which, for a whole host of reasons, is already difficult to replicate), the potential repercussions for vocalizing our frustrations (about society, about management, about anything, frankly) are often far more subtle than an immediate dismissal. Rather than being viewed as a valued team member offering earnest feedback with the goal of making contributions to enhance your work environment (thereby leading to happier and more productive employees, increased minority retention, and a healthier bottom line for the firm), the overly vocal black associate is likely viewed as a complainer — judgmental and difficult.

And, if these sorts of mischaracterizations are not enough, there is always the ever-present threat of not being able to generate enough work. If you fail to bill an appropriate amount of hours, the writing for your future career at ABC firm is all but written on the walls. Of course, as an associate, you are not expected to generate your own client billable work. Your clients are your practice group partners and your senior associates. These are the people tasked with training you in the art of lawyering and the majority of the time, these “clients” are also your managers — the people with whom said junior associate would be expected to raise any issues or concerns.

Surely, dear readers, you can understand the inherent tension with this arrangement. It leads to black associates carrying the very real fear of being “blackballed” (wherein partners and senior associates no longer wish to work with you and rather than explicitly tell you this, they seemingly begin to not have assignments available when you ask for work, or they continually promise to “keep you in mind for the next one” but that matter never arrives). What your clients do not say is that the reason you are no longer being selected for work (and therefore no longer being invested in and trained) is because your clients are more comfortable working with Josh, your white male colleague who never really has any negative feedback to make about the firm or his clients. So, as time goes on, Josh continues to generate multiple times the amount of work you do. Your clients like working with Josh because he is psychologically easier to engage with and for many of your clients (who are also white men), Josh reminds them of themselves — eager, talented, hardworking. Next thing you know, it’s the end of the review period and your hours pale in comparison to Josh, who, let us not forget, has generated multiple times the amount of work as you. As annual reviews approach, these numbers will serve as a clear indication, immortalized in black and white ink, that you simply aren’t cut out for this line of work. You clearly weren’t dedicated enough to the work. After all, if you were, your numbers would be better. And after the low hours are unveiled, there will be meetings to discuss how you aren’t a good fit for ABC firm and that you will need to find a new job.

The aforementioned scenario happens routinely in Biglaw. It is a known contributor to Biglaw firms’ poor retention rates of black junior attorneys and one of the key reasons black attorneys are not promoted through the ranks to partnership. It is also the exact reason that being a black Biglaw associate is uniquely difficult. Anyone with a basic knowledge of the social, cultural, and historical context of the United States and the nature of human psychology can quickly understand how a junior black associate verbalizing concerns and offering valid criticisms (even asking pointed questions) can lead to undesirable outcomes for said black associate. There’s no safe and polite way for the black junior associate to express frustrations to white leadership. These are uncomfortable conversations and the potential downside is often deemed too great a risk to take.

Of course, this is the reality of the black junior associate whether there is a pandemic or not — and whether there is a highly publicized black murder or not — so it’s not that recent events have changed anything. But the lack of support that some firms’ leadership have demonstrated with their deafening silence towards their black attorneys is astounding.

Additionally, Biglaw firms are not immune from the economic impact of COVID-19, and in spite of the fact that right now black attorneys are undoubtedly feeling the most exhausted and vulnerable that they have felt in recent history, everyone recognizes the importance of being grateful for retaining your job during a recession. Few of us are interested in risking our financial security for the sake of being “authentic” or feeling “heard” or even “valued” at our firms of employment. This truth is disappointing and disheartening, and it is entirely understandable.

To be fair, not all firms have fumbled this opportunity to fight the narrative that Biglaw is another heartless faction of corporate America. There are certain firms and leaders who have made respectable efforts to acknowledge the weightiness of this moment, suggesting that their black junior associates will not be forced to carry these burdens alone. Still, there are plenty of firms that have effectively done no more than wave at their black associates who are drowning and offer them a half-deflated life vest.

# Lateral Attorney Hiring Trends In 2023: Adapting To A Shifting Economy
## Despite economic challenges, certain law practice areas are observing renewed hiring activity as the economy progresses in 2023.

Trends in the Lateral Attorney Hiring Market in 2023

Certain practice areas have maintained consistent hiring or experienced a modest increase as the economy hints at recovery entering the latter half of 2023.

General State of the Economy and Law Firm Financial Stability

Though foundational components of the U.S. economy, like steady GDP growth and historically low unemployment rates, show strength, depressed corporate activity levels are affecting the demand for legal services. The situation worsened due to law firms over-hiring in 2021, leading to decreased productivity, especially among junior associates. However, certain practice areas remain in demand, signifying an increase in deal activities in some corporate sectors, which, in turn, is boosting law firm requirements and attorney recruitment.

Law firms have seen a rise in demand over the past quarter, aligning with the broader economic recovery. A recent Q2 2023 report by the [Thomson Reuters Law Firm Financial Index (LFFI)](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/press-releases/2023/august/2023-recovery-for-the-law-firm-market-continued-in-q2-thomson-reuters-law-firm-financial-index.html) revealed a 1.5% demand increase for legal services. This was a significant jump from the 0.1% rise in Q1. The study also highlighted an impressive 5.9% surge in client-agreed rates, the most substantial in over a decade. Demand mostly catered to countercyclical areas like bankruptcy and employment and less economically sensitive fields like litigation and antitrust.

However, the path to economic recovery isn’t devoid of challenges. Law firms grapple with overcapacity and efficiency issues. A survey by Wells Fargo’s Legal Specialty Group indicated a 4.4% revenue growth for law firms in the first half of 2023 but pointed out struggles related to an oversupply of attorneys hired during 2021-2022. Additionally, according to a [Decipher Investigative Intelligence report](https://decipherintel.com/q2-moves-show-a-hot-market-for-partners-associates-frozen-in-place/#:~:text=Q2%20Moves%20Show%20A%20Hot%20Market%20for%20Partners%2C%20Associates%20Frozen%20in%20Place,-August%2016%2C%202023&text=Lateral%20lawyer%20moves%20in%20Q2,dropped%20more%20than%2040%20percent), lateral hiring in Q2 2023 dropped by 33% year-over-year. Interestingly, partner hiring dipped by just 4%, while associate hiring plummeted by 43%.

Busy Associate Hiring Practice Areas

Even with many law firms overstaffed, certain areas continue to recruit. These sectors range from those traditionally countercyclical to ones less influenced by economic shifts or aligned with recent economic enhancements.

Labor & Employment

This sector has remained active over the last two years, particularly in employment litigation and counseling. Companies, still navigating a backlog of L&E investigations from the pandemic era, coupled with a rise in class action suits against employers, means L&E associates are highly sought after.

Data Privacy and Cybersecurity

The increasing number of corporate data breaches and evolving regulations have created a demand spike for experts in data privacy and cybersecurity.

Restructuring

Aligning with the rise in U.S. corporate bankruptcies, restructuring has seen predictable growth. Yet, it hasn’t reached the spikes typically associated with significant economic downturns.

IP

With courts clearing the backlog of patent litigations from the pandemic period, there’s a surge in hiring patent litigation associates.

Litigation

Litigation, typically less affected by corporate activity slowdowns, has seen consistent demand, especially in areas like consumer protection and public nuisance state attorney general actions.

Corporate and Transactional Practice Areas Experiencing a Rebound

Despite the setbacks in the past year, corporate transactional sectors are witnessing a revival in hiring. Recent data on M&A activity showcases this trend. As more economists predict an upbeat trajectory for the upcoming quarters and with recent firm hiring patterns, optimism surrounds the prospective increase in associate recruitment as we move through 2023 and into 2024.

# Yet Another Biglaw Firm Joins The Raise Race, But It's Not A Total Match
## Associates still seem to be happy.

No one wants to be left behind when it comes to this summer’s associate salary wars. It’s all about trying to look the part, because when it comes to retaining and recruiting associate talent, money talks.

Goulston & Storrs, ranked at No. 155 in the most recent Am Law 200, with $196,380,000 gross revenue in 2020, recently decide to enter the associate raise game. Sources report that new salary information, effective July 1, was announced during a recent all-associate call, without an accompanying memo.

Yet again, we’re seeing exact matches for younger attorneys — first- through third-year associates, to be exact (plus summers!) — but for midlevels and senior associates, the firm is doing something a little different. Fourth-years on up will receive raises commensurate with the market, but on an individualized basis (i.e., +$20K for the class of 2017, +$25K for the class of 2016, etc.). Counsel will not be receiving raises right now, but like at most firms, their time will come at year end.

Few things bring joy like a bit of unexpected cash! And while bonuses are expected at this point… it’s still pretty nice to read that your pockets will have a bit of extra lining. If you’ve seen an Orrick associate with a some additional pep in their step, this is probably why. Check out the bonus scale!



Now that’s a reason for some Christmas cheer! It is also worth mentioning that Orrick’s annualized hours expectations for bonuses is set at 1950 hours. And while that’s only a few days’ less worth of work compared to firms with a 2000-hour expectation, it is also a few days’ less work. Comparable pay and a functional extra couple days off? Talk about the holidays coming early.

Happy Holidays!

(Turn to the next page to see the Orrick memo.)

We like hearing about bonuses almost as much as you enjoy spending them. As soon as your firm’s memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Salary & Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Lawyers Need To Be More Careful About What They Say In Public
## Whenever a lawyer is in court or in any other public place, they should assume that people can hear what is being said and act accordingly.

A few days ago, I published a piece about how lawyers often need to do more to protect attorney-client communications. Upon reflection, lawyers do not merely need to do more to protect discussions between lawyers and clients but also need to protect other communications and information as well. Indeed, whenever a lawyer is in court or in any other public place, they should assume that people can hear what is being said and act accordingly. Many times in my career I have witnessed lawyers having sensitive conversations with different stakeholders to a deal in ways that would hurt a client if an adversary had knowledge of the communications.

I once represented one of two defendants in a lawsuit. Another lawyer represented the other defendant. The defendants had informally agreed to team up so that both I and the other lawyer had a better chance at defending them against the plaintiff’s claims. One time, we were due in court to argue a given motion. I had never met any of the lawyers on this case before, and I arrived in court early, and sat in the courtroom with all of the other lawyers waiting to have their cases called by the judge.

Some time later, I overheard two of the lawyers talking about resolving a given case. It didn’t take long for me to realize that they were talking about my case, and the lawyers represented plaintiff and the other defendant in the matter. To my surprise, instead of wishing to mount a joint defense against the plaintiff, the co-defendant’s lawyer was talking with plaintiff’s lawyer about cutting a separate settlement with the plaintiff that would only relate to claims against one of the defendants. When the attorneys realized that I was among the lawyers in the courtroom, and that I overheard everything they said, they were extremely embarrassed and tried to play off the incident as not being a big deal. However, my client was not too pleased with the co-defendant’s desire to cut a separate settlement in the case, and the lawyers’ recklessness made it more difficult to reach a mutually agreeable resolution in that matter.

Sometimes, lawyers should be more careful when they speak badly about other attorneys they are dealing with on a given matter. As many legal professionals already know from firsthand experience, attorneys and clients often talk badly about one another. There is much friction between stakeholders in the legal arena, and matters are usually resolved by neither party getting everything they want. It is natural for people to take out their frustrations about the legal process, counsel fees, delays in the legal system, and other matters on the people involved with a deal.

On multiple occasions, I have witnessed attorneys saying disrespectful things about other lawyers, and the subject of the comments hearing everything that was said. One situation especially comes to mind. I was once at a deposition that involved dozens of defense lawyers and one plaintiff’s counsel. The deposition had been delayed due to scheduling difficulties, and this resulted in the defense lawyers remaining at the deposition site for a longer period.

One of the lawyers started saying rude things about the plaintiff’s attorney and even mimicked that lawyer’s voice. As if we were on a television show, the plaintiff’s counsel entered the room, and it was clear that this attorney heard everything that was said. This made it extremely difficult to continue the deposition on cordial terms, and I do not think that the relationship between the lawyers involved in the ordeal ever healed, which impacted their ability to achieve results for their clients.

Sometimes, disrespectful comments about counsel do not need to be said in person to have a negative impact. One time, I was on an email chain for a number of lawyers involved in a given matter. One of the lawyers typed out an email to the group that was derisive of one of the other lawyers. It was clear that this email was not intended for everyone on the email chain, including the lawyer who was the subject of the criticism. The lawyer who had the “reply all” accident tried to backtrack his comments, but the damage was already done, and this hurt his connection with a colleague on a matter.

Of course, the best course of action is to not speak ill of another legal practitioner, but we all know that in the real world, this is a difficult ask. However, lawyers should at least be more discreet to avoid experiencing the fallout of accidental communication.

# Biglaw Behemoth Raises Salaries For All Of Its US Associates
## It's time to get paid at Piper.

As the old adage goes, “March comes in like a lion and out like a lamb.” Not only was this correct as far as the weather but it was right on the money as far as Biglaw salary increases. Even the biggest of Biglaw behemoths are now on board with Cravath’s generous new compensation system.

Speaking of which, DLA Piper — the No. 3 law firm in America according to the most recent Am Law 100, with about $3.1B in 2020 revenue — has upped salaries for associates once again. The firm was quick to make a [match on Milbank money](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-salary-hike-extends-to-one-of-the-largest-firms-in-the-world/) back in January, but since then, has remained quiet concerning more cash. But now, the mega-firm has adopted the Cravath scale.

This is what DLA’s Cravath cash infusion for associates looks like:



DLA Piper’s US associates will see their raises reflected in their paychecks on April 8, retroactive to January 1. Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from DLA Piper.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Meet The Biglaw Working Mom Defending Traditional Gender Roles
## Despite all appearances, she insists she believes in traditional gender roles.

Julie-Anne Lutfi

From all outward appearances [Julie-Anne Lutfi](https://m.foley.com/Julie-Anne-M-Lutfi/) lives a throughly modern existence. A corporate associate at the Biglaw firm of Foley & Lardner, Lutfi is also mom to two small children who’s written a book, [Diapers, Date Nights and Deadlines: A French Working Mom’s Guide to Success and Survival](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KSGSVHN?pf_rd_p=c2945051-950f-485c-b4df-15aac5223b10&pf_rd_r=GBWYPERM8FQ5E03FF9PG), about balancing the different — and demanding — spheres of her life. So it’s surprising about halfway through her book, the cover of which features a caricature of her husband cooking dinner while she simultaneously works and breastfeeds, when she describes her marriage as “traditional” and says she’s “subservient” to her husband.

In the latest episode of The Jabot podcast, I interview Lutfi and we discuss her unique take on marriage, surviving in Biglaw, feminism, guilt, and having it all.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wears when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

One by one, Biglaw firms continue to announce their plans for the reopening of their offices across the country. While some firms expect all employees to return on a specific date for full-time office work, others are taking a more moderate approach by offering a return in phases, with plenty of room for remote work. Today, we have news from a top 10 Biglaw firm, and it looks like all employees in its Washington, D.C., office will be back at their desks on “a regular basis” sometime soon.

Yesterday, Noel Francisco, former U.S. Solicitor General and partner in charge of Jones Day’s D.C. office, emailed all lawyers to let them know that thanks to the lifting of local restrictions and capacity limits, the firm is considering “how and when we will bring our office back into a regular working environment.” Here’s a relevant excerpt from Francisco’s email (full email on [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/top-10-biglaw-firm-encourages-lawyers-to-return-to-office-starting-next-week/2/)):

[A]t some point in the future, we will be providing specific guidance and timetables for returning all attorneys and staff to the office on a regular basis. But for now, I would like to encourage all lawyers, who are able to do so, to begin returning to working from the office starting Monday, May 24th. To assist in these efforts, we will also begin rotating necessary staff into the office as well so you will have all the tools you need to serve our clients.

In addition, I plan to host a series of get-togethers on the rooftop to welcome lawyers back to the office starting the week of June 13th. Invitations will be sent out in the next week or two.

Although lawyers are not yet expected to be in the office, a little more notice for an “encourage[d]” return probably would have been nice.

Francisco noted that safety will of the utmost importance for Jones Day’s return to its D.C. office, and that the firm will continue to follow all mandated COVID-19 guidelines. To that end, masks will be required in all office common spaces.

Welcome back to [The Pink Ghetto](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-pink-ghetto/), a series where we take a look at some of the most appalling stories from one of the most sexist industries in the world: the legal profession. Today, we have a story from a woman who wishes that the #MeToo movement had existed when she was sexually assaulted as an associate at her Biglaw firm. These are real emails that we’ve received from real readers.

When you see things like this happening, say something. Together, we can inspire the change necessary to stop this disturbing behavior from being so prevalent in the law. We owe it to ourselves and to future generations of women in the law.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
This is not a new story as you know. The “Me Too” movement is long overdue. I graduated from law school in 1978 and have been practicing law in California for 40 years. My law school class was about 30% women. As a first-year law student, I got a summer associate position at a large and prestigious law firm in Los Angeles. They had a very well-established summer program with law students from all over the U.S. Each summer intern was assigned to a “reader” who was generally a mid- to senior-level associate. That reader would read all of the intern’s written work and report back to the hiring committee at the end of the summer about the quality of the intern’s work.

My “reader” was a mid-level associate who was married. I was single. One day when we were in my office, he closed the door and pushed me up against a wall in the office and tried to kiss me and put his tongue in my mouth. I pushed him away and he left the office. I was so upset because he had power over me and whether I would get a permanent job offer. I did not report it to any of the partners because I was afraid of retaliation. Instead, I told a friend from my law school who was also a summer intern at the same firm, but was a year ahead of me. He in turn went to a partner in the firm and reported it. I was reassigned to a different reader, and later was offered a position with the law firm, where I remained for three years following law school. Many years later, that “reader” apologized to me for his behavior.

With so much publicity in the news about powerful men finally being held to account for their misbehavior, I was curious about what had happened to my tormentor. It turns out that he is now a partner in a large white-shoe NYC law firm, and ironically was previously a prosecutor at the USAO specializing in white-collar crime. He now defends large companies and their principals. I have recently thought about sending him an email saying simply, “Remember me? #MeToo.” I haven’t done it because I am so far past that event and don’t want to expend the negative energy.

I have told my daughters about this and what I expect of them when they enter the workforce. They are in college now. I am heartened by the advice that one of their high school teachers gave them (a male teacher) when he told them to always defend themselves, to never be victims, and to always carry a “badass” in their back pockets.

# The Best Biglaw Firm For Paternity Leave
## The babies of Biglaw attorneys appreciate firms that allow both parents to take time off for bonding.

Thanks to the rise of the Millennial lawyer, many Biglaw firms have started offering shiny new benefits packages to their associates, including generous parental leave policies. Thanks to our own research on [family leave and related policies](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/family-leave-and-related-policies-by-firm/), we know that on average, female lawyers at these firms receive 16.33 weeks of paid maternity leave, while male lawyers receive 6.46 weeks of paid paternity leave, less than half of that their female counterparts receive. In fact, it seems like men are [generally stigmatized](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-pink-ghetto-paternity-leave-horror-stories-from-dads-working-in-law-firms/) by their firms when they become new fathers and opt to take parental leave. But according to [Fatherly](https://www.fatherly.com/about-us/), a parenting resource for men, one Biglaw firm is the best place place for new dads to work.

For the past two years, [Fatherly](https://www.fatherly.com/work-money/50-best-companies-new-dads-ranking-2017-parental-leave-childcare/) has ranked the 50 best places for new dads to work, and in its 2017 ranking, only one Biglaw firm made the list. Which one could it be?

According to Fatherly, Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer is the 38th best place for new dads to work in 2017. Because it’s still assumed that women are the primary caregivers in their families, Fatherly ranked the firm by its secondary offerings. Ranked among companies like Netflix (which offers 52 weeks of paid paternity leave) and Etsy (which offers 26 weeks of gender-neutral paid parental leave), Arnold & Porter gives its lawyers and its support staff the same parental benefits, which seems to be a rarity in the world of Biglaw. That having been said, APKS offers 18 weeks of paid leave for primary caregivers and 6 weeks of paid leave for secondary caregivers.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
With respect to Fatherly, we beg to differ with its assessment. For its 2018 rankings, we suggest that the website take a look at offerings from both Orrick and Winston & Strawn.

Orrick offers associates [22 weeks of paid primary caregiver leave](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/05/which-biglaw-firm-has-the-best-parental-leave-policy/), with the option of taking up to nine months of total leave before returning to work full-time. When we asked Orrick’s Chairman Mitchell Zuklie about the policy, he said that it was “crafted to make sure that people are not stigmatized regardless of their gender. We’re not living in the days of Leave It to Beaver — families have different constructs as to who is in charge of taking care of the children.” A woman or a man can be a primary caregiver at Orrick.

Winston & Strawn, on the other hand, has a completely gender-neutral parental leave policy. The firm offers associates and of counsel attorneys up to [20 weeks of paid parental leave](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/biglaw-firm-makes-big-waves-with-gender-neutral-parental-leave-policy/) for child care and parent-child bonding, which may be taken in one or two increments within the first year after a new child arrives. The firm also has a Parental Leave Transition Support Program to assist attorneys who take a parental leave.

There are slews of other Biglaw firms that offer generous leave times for presumable new fathers. Firms like Baker Botts (12 weeks), Cravath (12 weeks), Debevoise & Plimpton (10 weeks), DLA Piper (16 weeks), K&L Gates (12 weeks), Kirkland & Ellis (10 weeks), Morgan Lewis (12 weeks), Munger Tolles (12 weeks), Nixon Peabody (10 weeks), Reed Smith (10 weeks), Vinson & Elkins (9 or 4 weeks), Weil Gotshal (10 weeks), and WilmerHale (14 weeks) are all ahead of the game when it comes to paid secondary caregiver leave.

Congratulations to Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer for its inclusion as the lone Biglaw firm on the Fatherly ranking, even if there were many additional firms that deserved to be so honored. Perhaps such credit will be given where it’s due next year?

The babies of Biglaw attorneys appreciate firms that allow both parents to take time off for bonding. What is your law firm doing to promote gender equity in its parental leave policies? Please let us know so we can update our database. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Biglaw%20Parental%20Leave%20Policy), text us at (646) 820-8477, or tweet us [@atlblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog).

# How The Diversity Movement Is Helping Legal Organizations Leverage DEI Principles To Unlock Business Excellence
## For legal organizations and law firms taking a 2021 inventory of their human capital and aiming to improve diversity among their workforces in 2022, this may be the Q4 conversation you’ve been looking for.

“The movement is a rhythm to us / Freedom is like religion to us / Justice is juxtapositionin’ us / Justice for all just ain’t specific enough.” —[ Common](https://www.thedailybeast.com/john-legend-and-common-on-bringing-glory-to-the-grammys-with-a-little-help-from-beyonce)

In the past few quarters, I’ve teamed up with [The Diversity Movement](https://thediversitymovement.com/) (TDM) on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programming for [The Society for Diversity](https://www.linkedin.com/company/society-for-diversity-executives-&-professionals/), Duke University, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina, and Morrisville and Durham Chamber of Commerce events.

TDM provides the tools, methods, and perspectives that businesses need to spark lasting culture change and evolve into more diverse, equitable, and inclusive organizations. It also helps its clients shift individual behavior, so those individuals can form high-performing teams that deliver better business outcomes.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
This week, I had the opportunity to catch up with Jamie Ousterout, certified diversity executive and head of client services at TDM. She helps clients move forward and take action on their diversity, equity, and inclusion journeys. Jamie has served clients across various industries, including legal, healthcare, pharmaceutical, financial, technology, and non-profit. She is an alum of Cornell University in 2009 with a bachelor of arts in English and history.

I’ve learned a ton over the last year from TDM and during this week’s conversation with Jamie. For legal organizations and law firms taking a 2021 inventory of their human capital and aiming to improve diversity among their workforces in 2022, this may be the Q4 conversation you’ve been looking for. Without further ado, here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation.

Renwei Chung (RC): What drew you to this type of work?

Jamie Ousterout (JO): I have always had a desire to help create teams where everyone feels welcome and included and to work with organizations to optimize their processes and procedures so they can better serve their customers and communities. DEI is a natural extension of this work.

At The Diversity Movement, we know that DEI can help unlock business excellence — and my hope is that individuals will take what they learn at work and bring it back to their friends, families, and communities to create a world where everyone feels safe and welcome.

RC: TDM has worked with legal nonprofits like The American Health Law Association (AHLA) and law firms like Bricker & Eckler. What have you learned about DEI issues and opportunities at organizations like these?

JO: Law is such an important field that has a broad impact on our society. We are very fortunate to have the opportunity to work with both AHLA and Bricker & Eckler. In working with associations, and specifically with AHLA, there is a unique opportunity to have a broader impact across things like healthcare equity to help create a better world.

RC: Are there any issues in the legal industry that you’ve noticed that are unique to the profession?

JO: I have observed that our clients in the legal profession have incredibly well-documented processes and procedures. The challenge becomes applying these processes and procedures consistently and equitably across the organization.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
RC: TDM and The AHLA have a case study coming out later this month, can you tell us what this focuses on?

JO: We are very proud to have worked with AHLA over the past several months. AHLA has been on their DEI journey for many years, but we helped bolster their journey by providing training — both in eLearning and virtual formats — as well as doing a comprehensive assessment of their organization.

One of the areas for improvement that we identified in the assessment was around creating a more transparent board nominating process: one that mitigated unconscious bias and allowed the best candidates to be selected for board service.

By working with AHLA staff and the nominating committee, we revised the nominations process, which was recently approved by the board. You can view the forthcoming case study at: [https://thediversitymovement.com/case-studies/](https://thediversitymovement.com/case-studies/). We’re excited to continue working with AHLA and other organizations in the law profession.

RC: How can legal organizations and law firms assess their DEI competency?

JO: With all clients, we suggest starting with an organizational assessment. This assessment includes surveys, listening sessions, and a review of processes and procedures.

Through the survey, we are able to gather quantitative data on the current state of DEI competency within an organization, and we are able to gain additional, qualitative data through listening sessions — small group settings where participants are asked to share openly about the culture of the organization. This helps us establish a baseline for the organization and understand its unique issues and challenges.

We can then suggest strategic goals and initiatives to address these issues in a comprehensive DEI action plan. And importantly, we help our clients track against progress and help hold the organization accountable.

RC: As we near the end of 2021, what steps can legal organizations and law firms take to ensure they are fostering diverse and inclusive cultures?

JO: It is imperative that diverse and inclusive cultures are championed by leaders within the organization. However, everyone can play a part in creating a more inclusive and welcoming culture.

One simple way to do this is to recognize other voices at the table and encourage their participation, to use inclusive language for other people’s identities and backgrounds, and to provide forums for all people to share their unique perspectives and opinions.

RC: What else do you want people to understand about diversity, equity, and inclusion?

JO: Too often, people feel that DEI may not apply to them. They think it’s just race or gender. They don’t understand that inclusion involves everyone within an organization. Everyone brings a unique and valuable background, with a range of perspectives and experiences to help us make better decisions.

Additionally, too many people fail to understand that DEI is a continuous practice. The point is to create a work environment where people feel comfortable admitting when they are wrong, can make mistakes, learn to correct them, and keep moving forward. We try to practice this kind of culture at The Diversity Movement where we emphasize progress over perfection with one another and with our clients.

RC: Do you have some favorite or recommended resources for those who are interested in learning more?

JO: The Diversity Movement has a [MicroVideo platform](https://thediversitymovement.vhx.tv/), which offers one-to-three-minute videos on various DEI topics to provide quick, learning moments for all busy professionals. This platform is available for free as a beta program through the end of November 2021. My other favorite resource is our [inclusive language guide: Say This, Not That](https://www.thediversitymovement.com/say-this-not-that).

On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, I would like to thank Jamie Ousterout for sharing her story with our audience. We wish her continued success throughout her career.

[Renwei Chung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taichung/) is the DEI Columnist at [Above the Law](https://abovethelaw.com/author/renweichung/). He currently serves as a Board Advisor for [The Diversity Movement (TDM)](https://thediversitymovement.com/dei-navigator/), whose integrated approach enables law firms to build and strengthen culture by tying real-world business outcomes to DEI initiatives via a scalable subscription-based employee experience platform. And he is excited to host TDM’s and Footnote 4’s new podcast Charge the Wave — focused on entrepreneurs, executives, and icons who are assiduously building companies, cultures, and communities.

# Biglaw Firm Ponies Up Cold, Hard Cash To Help Associates Repay Law School Loans
## This firm isn't just providing options and info; it's giving associates direct financial support for servicing loans.

Around the time that Cravath announced its [great associate pay raise](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/), it also provided its associates with information about various organizations that help associates refinance their student loans. Similarly, firms like [Latham & Watkins](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/biglaw-firm-helps-associates-latham-their-law-school-debt/) and [Sullivan & Cromwell](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-announcement-youve-been-waiting-for-sullivan-cromwell/2/) have made arrangements with finance companies to provide refinancing of law school debt on favorable terms. But these moves didn’t get quite as much attention as the move to $180K because, unlike the pay raise, they didn’t involve law firms taking money out of their own coffers and putting it right into associates’ pockets.

At least one Biglaw firm, however, is providing direct help to its associates when it comes to eliminating educational debt. Here’s a report from the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/15/business/dealbook/firms-offer-cash-to-help-new-lawyers-pay-student-debt.html):

Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, a large firm founded in San Francisco that specializes in technology, energy and infrastructure law, plans to announce on Friday that it will contribute a monthly amount to its new associates to offset accumulated education debt….

Orrick, which has more than 1,000 lawyers, is offering $100 a month for starting lawyers for 18 months. After that, the junior lawyers will be eligible to receive a bonus from the firm. The program, which starts Sept. 1, is being offered to associates who are on the track to becoming partners as well as to those who choose the less intensive career associate track.

One clarification. An Above the Law reader (not at Orrick) interpreted this as Orrick replacing its bonuses for first-years with this loan repayment benefit. While understandable given the NYT’s wording, that’s not correct. When I reached out to her about this, Orrick chief talent officer [Siobhan Handley](https://www.orrick.com/People/A/9/1/Siobhan-Handley) explained that Orrick has not changed its bonus program and that the loan repayment benefit supplements rather than replaces bonuses:

This doesn’t change our bonus program at all and yes, it is on top of our existing bonuses. We pay first year-associates bonuses in January or February after their first year with Orrick (depending on the timing of decisions). As you’ll recall from our annual memo, our bonus year starts December 1. So, there are a couple of months period when associates are not yet eligible for a bonus (from whenever they start in September through the end of November). We provide the loan repayment benefit until they actually get their bonus payment as opposed to when they become bonus eligible. You’ll also recall, our program offers associates the opportunity to earn above market bonuses, based on merit and performance.

We believe that the above-market bonus potential, after the first year of work and every year thereafter, is far more valuable to associates than a stub period, pro-rated bonus for the first several weeks. We’ve gotten very positive feedback on this new benefit (and our overall bonus program, which we have no plans to change).

One can quibble with Orrick over whether a pro-rated, stub-year bonus is better than getting $1,800 toward loan repayment (for eligible associates; some associates might be fortunate enough to arrive at Orrick without debt). But the key takeaway here is that this doesn’t change Orrick’s existing bonus program and nobody at the firm is worse off (because associates weren’t getting stub-year bonuses anyway). And note also that the value of paying down principal is greater than just the cash contributed when you take into account the reduction in interest costs over the life of the loan.

Why is Orrick making this move? Here’s what it told the Elizabeth Olson of the Times:

The firm views the debt relief as another benefit, along with flexible work arrangements and parental leave, to attract young lawyers.

Orrick has long been a leader when it comes to Biglaw perks and fringe benefits. See, for example, its [industry-leading parental leave policy](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/05/which-biglaw-firm-has-the-best-parental-leave-policy/), which provides 22 weeks of paid primary caregiver leave to Orrick attorneys in the United States.

“With fewer students choosing law schools, fewer law school grads choosing big firms, and women leaving the profession faster than men, we wanted to distinguish ourselves in the market,” Ms. Handley said.

“This will help our associates reduce the level of financial stress so they can focus on their training, development and client service,” she added.

Now, as my colleague Staci Zaretsky noted in [Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/morning-docket-07-18-16/), $1,800 isn’t a huge amount — especially when, as noted in the Times piece, graduates arrive at law firms with an average of $185,000 in student debt. But $1,800 is still, as far as we know, $1,800 more than what Orrick’s peer firms are giving to their associates to help break the shackles of law school loans.

Will other Biglaw firms follow Orrick’s lead? If you’re aware of a major law firm that’s providing direct financial assistance to its associates in servicing their educational debt, please feel free to [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Biglaw%20Loan%20Repayment) or text us (646-820-8477). We’ll be tracking this trend closely — and hoping, for the sake of our associate readers, that more firms jump on the bandwagon.

P.S. If you’d like to learn more about how law school loan refinancing works, see [Conquering Law School Debt And Buying A Dream Home — How SoFi Member Dan Brady Made It Happen](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/conquering-law-school-debt-and-buying-a-dream-home-how-sofi-member-dan-brady-made-it-happen/), a sponsored post by [SoFi](https://www.sofi.com/), the company that designed Orrick’s tuition benefit (and, full disclosure, an [ATL advertiser](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/thanks-very-much-to-our-amazing-advertisers/)).

UPDATE (4 p.m.): Additional info about Orrick’s initiative, via [Nell Gluckman of Am Law](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/07/15/in-latest-pitch-to-indebted-associates-orrick-promises-direct-help-on-loans/?kw=In%20Latest%20Pitch%20to%20Indebted%20Associates%2C%20Orrick%20Promises%20Direct%20Help%20on%20Loans&cn=20160718&pt=Am%20Law%20Daily&src=EMC-Email&et=editorial&bu=The%20American%20Lawyer&slreturn=20160618155313):

With 40 to 50 new associates a year, the commitment amounts to between $64,000 and $80,000 for Orrick. That’s just over half what it pays a single first year now that it has joined other top firms in raising first-year associates’ pay to $180,000.

The contribution may seem like little more than a rounding error for the firm, where profits per partner reached $1.79 million last year. But the move still drew praise from associates and industry observers.

“This is an important signal that law firms recognize that law school is too expensive,” said Kyle McEntee, executive director of Law School Transparency, a nonprofit that tracks tuition rates and student debt. “Even when a firm pays $180,000, the graduates still need help repaying their loans to live comfortably.”

…. Associates who graduated from law school in 2015 will be the first to benefit from Orrick’s program, which goes into effect Sept. 1. Handley said the payments can go toward undergraduate debt as well as law school debt, and are available to both partner-track and career associates.

# Dechert Lets Multiple Associates Go After Performance Reviews
## We may be entering a rough spell for the legal profession.

When Seyfarth Shaw [announced layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/huge-layoff-report-biglaw-firm-lays-off-associates-staff-and-partners/) earlier this month — cutting associates, staff, and even partners — we wondered if the sluggish legal market might finally be catching up to some firms. Perhaps the flurry of salary increases last year had pushed firms to the point where a bad quarter here or there elicits swift and unfortunate action.

So when we started hearing reports that Dechert had also commenced layoffs in multiple offices, we worried that Seyfarth may have just been the beginning of a new wave of cutbacks.

As it turns out, Dechert’s layoffs pale in comparison to Seyfarth’s. Indeed, a firm spokesperson noted that headcount is actually up from a year ago. Last week’s performance reviews just took a toll, and several people were let go:

The Firm continues to do well. We regularly review and give feedback to our associates as well as evaluate the needs of our clients in different practice areas and locations. There have been no major layoffs at the Firm; in fact, our headcount is higher today than a year ago. Moreover, since the beginning of the year we have had major high profile hires in New York, London, Paris, Brussels, Dublin and Asia.

But even if the firm is still pursuing headcount growth and only excised some attorneys for underperforming this cycle, this is still a worrisome sign. Standard operating procedure in the law firm world would drag out these firings — especially given that it doesn’t seem to be a big number — slowly over several months to keep them from registering as a “layoff.” That not only maintains morale, but staves off outside attention. Some associates wouldn’t even be fired so much as passive aggressively pushed out of the nest. Perhaps those lawyers were just having a dry spell and could even turn around their billables over the next few months.

When a firm decides it’s going to cut several people loose in the same week and place itself on the radar of legal industry observers, that says something. It’s proof that we’re entering harder times for attorneys, where firms don’t have the patience to wait around on attorneys.

And that’s bad news for folks at a lot of firms because the market doesn’t look like it’s getting better any time soon.

Gabe MacConaill

There’s a [heartbreaking piece](https://www.law.com/2018/11/12/big-law-killed-my-husband-an-open-letter-from-a-sidley-partners-widow/) in today’s American Lawyer from Joanna Litt, the widow of Sidley Austin partner Gabe MacConaill. MacConaill [died by a self-inflicted gunshot in October](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/10/biglaw-partners-death-due-to-self-inflicted-gunshot-wound/) in the parking garage of the firm’s Los Angeles office. In today’s piece, Litt has some harsh words for the stress that working in Biglaw put her husband under, and which she believes worsened his mental health issues.

I never thought in a million years that he could or would do that. And I keep going back to one thought: “Big Law” killed my husband.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In the article, Litt describes a series of “ill-fated events at work,” which contributed to ramping up the stress MacConaill faced. Other partners in his department left which put him in a leadership role, he was tasked with heading the office’s summer program, and he started working on the Mattress Firm bankruptcy case. In prepping to file that company’s bankruptcy in Delaware, MacConaill worked himself to exhaustion, but he was still primarily concerned about the ramifications for his career:

[I]t was clear he was in distress and had been working himself to exhaustion. He told me his body was failing him. I picked him up and we decided he should go to the emergency room. He actually said to me on the way there, “You know, if we go, this is the end of my career.”

I’ve never felt so helpless in my life. I didn’t know whom to reach out to or to tell my husband was in crisis. I called his closest colleague and asked if she had noticed anything unusual with his behavior at work. She said he was working more with his door closed, and then she said something I’ll never forget: She said his sense of humor had been gone for a while. I asked her to keep an eye on him at work and then I just brought him home. I tried to make sure he slept and was rehydrating and eating so he could make the trip to Delaware.

As one might imagine, the piece also contains some self-recrimination as Litt laments what more she could have done to prevent her husband’s death, wishing she’d “held him just a little longer, loved him a little harder.” But she’s also keenly aware of the role the stress of Biglaw — plus a work culture that makes it difficult to seek help — played in MacConaill’s suicide:

So as I write our story and think about it more and more, I know “Big Law” didn’t directly kill my husband—because he had a deep, hereditary mental health disorder and lacked essential coping mechanisms. But these influences, coupled with a high-pressure job and a culture where it’s shameful to ask for help, shameful to be vulnerable, and shameful not to be perfect, created a perfect storm.

Another interesting part of Litt’s piece is her perception of Sidley’s handling of MacConaill’s death, which she refers to as “damage control.” She says she attended the firm’s memorial for her husband because she “needed to see what kind of narrative they were creating.” It’s always challenging to deal with the unexpected death of a partner and colleague, but when the widow comes away with the impression it is all part of a calculated PR move, you’re doing it wrong.

There is a mental health reckoning coming in Biglaw. The[ issue is too important](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/biglaw-managing-partner-opens-up-about-alcoholism/) and the profession is losing too many talented lawyers. Some firms have begun the process by [signing a pledge](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/biglaw-firms-pledge-to-help-lawyers-struggling-with-substance-abuse-mental-health-issues/) to provide a mental health framework that includes education, awareness, and resources for their employees. However, it is far from being the industry standard. Tragic deaths, like that of MacConaill, serve as a reminder of how essential it is for Biglaw to deal with the issue.

If you or someone you know is depressed or otherwise in need help, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline ([1-800-273-8255](http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/)) or a [lawyer assistance program](http://www.americanbar.org/groups/lawyer_assistance/resources/lap_programs_by_state.html) in your state.

Mr. [Lincoln] Bandlow has a professional responsibility to refrain from acting as counsel in more cases than he can handle at one time… Mr. Bandlow’s conduct constitutes willful disobedience of court orders, which is tantamount to bad faith.

—U.S. Magistrate Judge Carolyn Delaney, [deciding to sanction](https://www.law.com/2019/02/28/judge-sanctions-fox-rothschild-partner-in-porn-copyright-cases/) Fox Rothschild partner, [Lincoln Bandlow](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/lincoln-bandlow/), to the tune of $750 for missing deadlines in [numerous copyright cases filed by the Biglaw firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/fox-rothschilds-representation-of-porn-client-lands-them-in-hot-water-with-judge/)on behalf of their porn studio client, Strike 3. Judge Delaney said the missed deadlines were not “mere inadvertence or recklessness.” She also rejected Bandlow’s proffered excuses — that the firm had technical issues related to a calendaring program and that they were short staffed over the holidays — saying “the practice of law predates the computer,” and that a Biglaw firm blaming missed deadlines on staffing woes was “inexcusable.” [Strike 3 filed 2,185 copyright cases last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/biglaw-firms-staggering-work-on-behalf-of-a-porn-studio/), and this isn’t the first time Fox Rothschild [has gotten benchslapped over the representation](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/biglaw-firm-gets-benchslapped-over-controversial-representation-of-porn-company/).

# How Lawyers Can Stop Being Risk Averse In Their Careers
## Learn when it's time to just do it: make a decision and act on it.

Since childhood, I’ve had an intense fear of the ocean. Part of that fear stems from watching Jaws one too many times, but another part is a result of not being able to see or touch the ocean floor the further out you go from the shore. I acknowledged and recognized this fear about nine years ago when I was training for a race and decided to do an open water swim in Biscayne Bay in Miami on a Saturday morning. I still remember the panic I felt in not being able to see the bottom of the bay or what lied below my feet.

The fear of swimming in the ocean or bay is only one example of a seemingly obvious risk aversion. I’ve always weighed options to a fault and agonized when making decisions that present an “unknown.” When I pack for a trip, I think about every possible scenario that can happen, so I overpack toiletries, medicines, and clothing items, 75% of which don’t get used. Sometimes, my own anxiety about making decisions creates “analysis paralysis.” All the “what ifs” play over like a broken record in my mind.

Where did all this stem from? Since when did I become so hyper-focused on the fear of the unknown?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Lawyers, by their very training, are conditioned to be risk averse. From the time we enter law school, we are confronted with issue spotting hypothetical scenarios (i.e., the piano falling out of the window of the 80th floor of a building), delving further into seeing things from many angles, and always answering with, “It depends.” I chuckle as I think about the time in the bar exam prep course when the instructor said, “You will reach a point when you’re down to two choices, A and B. You agonize over which one to pick. A? B? A? B? Circle one and move on.” In theory, he’s right, but if you’re anything like me, you will agonize for a good five to seven minutes in the timed exam, select one, analyze that choice, analyze it some more, and contemplate changing it before you’re ready to move on.

I grappled with the fear of the unknown for many years into the practice of law and in my legal career — the uncertainly of not knowing what was on the other side of law as well as the uncertainty of what people would say if I left law to do something else. Yet, I had lots of mental roadblocks for nearly 12 years that hindered my happiness. What if this happens, then what do I do? What if I go this route, where will I end up? What will I be giving up instead?

My overanalytical nature prepared me well when I made my departure plans to leave law.

What if I didn’t bring in enough monthly cash flow from client projects? I created a nest egg to keep me afloat. I looked at where I was spending extra money and started to get honest with my finances. I began to live more frugally and made a financial plan before I would leave law. I gave myself a time frame to save up before taking the leap.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
What if a recession hit and I stopped getting my target clients? I made an action plan on how I could pivot and leverage writing for new clients or leveraging my writing in new ways. It forced me to continue building up my writing portfolio and diversify it.

As time went on and I made my plans to leave the practice of law, all the “what ifs” started to feel less heightened. I thought of potential situations and I wrote solutions out. I made lists of pros and cons. I cross-referenced a checklist of goals. I had my life jacket ready for the next open water swim. Then I just did it. I stopped being so risk averse because I knew that if I didn’t take the leap in my career, I would always be left wondering what could have been. I would have rather failed and said at least I took the leap, than sat with paralyzed fear wishing I had done it.

If you’re at the point of wanting to leave law or wanting to take your legal career in a different direction such as going from Biglaw to in-house, here’s my advice: make your plan and act. The only thing that’s holding you back is your risk aversion.

Trillions of dollars are like light years.

Suppose a star is four light years from earth. Or 100 light years. Or 1,000. Or a million. Or a gazillion. It’s all the same: “Gee, that’s further away than Jersey City.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Even the most sophisticated people don’t really understand what light years mean. The human mind is incapable of comprehending the concept.

(A light year is actually about 6 trillion miles. And that’s just one of ’em. Put a thousand together and then start thinking about it. You can’t. You just can’t.)

It’s the same thing with the arguments about the human infrastructure bill that has the Democrats up in arms. Progressives thought we should spend $10 trillion on infrastructure. That’s probably further than Jersey City.

Progressives compromised down to $3.5 trillion. That’s a couple of exits closer than we were originally thinking.

And now, at least as of Friday, October 1, some moderates say the price tag is too big: We can’t go a penny over $1.5 trillion.

This is foolishness.

None of us understands what we’re talking about, so why are we quibbling?

Once the government spends a few trillion dollars, there will probably be some impact: There will be some good (somebody has to benefit from all that money); there will be some evil (surely spending trillions causes inflation or has some other unintended adverse consequences); there will be massive fraud and waste (because that’s the way things work when you’re spending unfathomable amounts of money). I’m not even sure there would be three times the waste if you spent $3 trillion instead of $1 trillion. Waste might go up only incrementally, or it might go up logarithmically. Who knows?

If Congress pumps a trillion, or several trillion, into the economy over a decade, there will surely be some consequences. Some of the money will be well-spent and help people. Some will be wasted. But we’re really guessing and hoping before the money is spent, and even after it’s spent, we’re probably not measuring all of the effects.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Whether it’s $1 trillion or $3 trillion, in 2022, the Democrats will claim a massive political victory, and the Republicans will insist that the Democrats foolishly spent like drunken sailors. Again, there will be no difference between $1 trillion or $3 trillion — the arguments will be precisely the same, and, even if the arguments were different, no one would understand the difference.

Why are Democrats quibbling?

And how much longer ’til we get to Jersey City?

# The Biglaw Raise Wave Goes International
## Raises are catching on like wildfire.

Raises are sweeping through Biglaw, thanks to Milbank and Cravath.

You don’t even have to be based in the United States to get caught up in Biglaw raise-mania. UK-based Herbert Smith Freehills, a firm that made $1,467,201,000 in gross revenue last year, is raising associate salaries in its New York office.

The new compensation scale — and bonus grid — at the firm is as follows:

Class year	2024 Base Salary	Year-End Bonus
2023	$225,000	$15,000 (pro-rated)
2022	$235,000	$20,000
2021	$260,000	$30,000
2020	$310,000	$57,500
2019	$365,000	$75,000
2018	$390,000	$90,000
2017	$420,000	$105,000
2016	$435,000	$115,000
You can read the full memo on the next page.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Latest Raise: This Little Associate Gets More, This Little Associate Gets Less, And This Little Associate Gets Just Market 
## This memo isn't entirely transparent, but people are making some amount more than they used to at this firm.

In 2016, Lowenstein Sandler matched the prevailing market scale for its young associates, and here we are again. The firm just announced that it would jump first-year salaries to $190K in its New York, Palo Alto, and Washington offices. Its New Jersey office will see a bump to $170K.

Before we get back to compensation though, it’s worth pointing out that Lowenstein also made news today with managing partner Gary Wingens and Paul, Weiss chairman Brad Karp writing a joint op-ed highlighting the good work that their firms and many others are doing [to fight the unlawful efforts of the administration at the border](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/opinion/zero-tolerance-trump-asylum-family-separation-lawyers.html). It’s a poignant reminder that in these times, there are more pressing issues than compensation.

And, if you’re an associate making more, maybe you should consider giving to a good cause… like [coming to tonight’s Above the Law fundraiser](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/a-culture-of-political-civility-probably-doesnt-include-torturing-kids/). You can still buy tickets at the door. Details in the linked post.

Meanwhile, the firm is also offering summer bonuses. For associates in the first three years who are on pace to make their 1800 billable-hour requirement (based on the last 8-month period), the firm will pay $5,000 and for older associates, the firm is offering $10,000. That puts the firm a bit behind its peers for summer bonuses, however, the firm is offering a bump for those associates “working substantially harder than the threshhold pace” that would put everyone in their first five years ahead of the pace (with the exception of third years, who would only match the market with this special bonus), with more senior attorneys matching the market with the special bump.

That’s a jumble to follow. Let’s break it down visually:

Class	Market Bonus	LS Base Bonus	LS Max Bonus
2017	$5000	$5,000	$10,000
2016	$7500	$5,000	$10,000
2015	$10,000	$5,000	$10,000
2014	$15,000	$10,000	$25,000
2013	$20,000	$10,000	$25,000
2012	$25,000	$10,000	$25,000
2011	$25,000	$10,000	$25,000
2010+	$25,000	$10,000	$25,000
Associates in the first three years will be getting a $10,000 increase in lockstep. Beyond that, associate compensation is more fuzzy, with associates earning between a $10,000 and $25,000 salary increase based on numerous factors.

So… people are making money. How much more or less than everyone else in the market is a little fuzzy, but everyone’s making some amount more than they used to and the firm [does right by its associates and staff when it comes to benefits](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/which-firms-are-doing-right-by-their-staff/), so congratulations to the Lowenstein team.

Dear future colleague,

Spring is here, and your last semester of law school is winding down. The next few months will be a series of crunches. You’ll be crunching for your final exams. Then you’ll crunch for the bar. Then you’ll probably get back to the gym for the first time in three months and do some crunches there, too.

After that, you’ll be starting out your career as a newly minted associate at a prestigious law firm. Congratulations! Your newest professional journey is about to begin. With that in mind, I’d like to offer some unsolicited advice for navigating those first few years.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Nothing you did in the last three years matters any more. Graduating summa cum laude as the editor of the law review might have helped you land this gig, but you’re starting out with a clean slate. Your work product, your professionalism, and your growth as a practicing attorney are what you’ll be assessed on for the next few years. I hope you take that as good news, because it is. You’re not being graded on a curve against your peers any more. You’re not following a curriculum set out by the school administration. Starting in a few months, you’re in charge of your career. You get to make yourself into the lawyer you want to be. You can seek out the kinds of work you want to do and skills you want to develop. You get to choose your adventure.

You’re gonna feel dumb. Don’t stress it. The first few months basically feel like drinking from a firehose. You’ll be learning substantive law, the day-to-day of your practice, the personal preferences of the senior attorneys you work for, and local customs of the region you practice in. Almost everything you need to know isn’t written down anywhere. This kind of on-the-job training can brutalize your ego if you let it. Don’t let it. Trust that you’ll end every day feeling slightly less incompetent than you were when you started it. Make an appointment on your calendar for six months from your start date to go grab a coffee with your other first-years and reflect on how far you’ve come.

You’ll never go wrong making friends. You’re a fresh face in the office. There are going to be plenty of people interested in getting to know you. Take advantage of those opportunities at every level. Make friends with your fellow first-years, and you’ll keep each other going. Make friends with senior associates. They’ll be your best advocates, mentors, and guides. Develop personal relationships with partners you work for, and those you don’t. And make time to get to know the staff you work with. They can make your life infinitely easier, or infinitely harder. We’re in a business that centers on people. Every warm relationship you can build is going to make you a better person, and you never know what relationship might be the key to some major career success down the road.

Build relationships that will last outside the law firm. Fifty years ago, the business model was to join a firm, make partner, stay at the firm for 50 years, and die at your desk. Today, there is more lateral movement and attrition happening in the industry than ever before. You will be approached at some point, whether by a headhunter, another firm, a client looking for an in-house lawyer, or by a business looking for a lawyer to bring into the executive ranks. Attorneys you care about will move to other firms. You’re not going to be seeing the same people every day for the rest of your career. If you want to keep both your personal and professional lives thriving, you’re going to need to build real relationships that can continue on even when you’re not seeing each other at the office every day.

Speak up. You don’t have much experience yet, but you wouldn’t be where you are if you weren’t sharp. You were hired for your brain, so use it. If you’ve got an idea, let it be known. You’ll spend plenty of time being told it’s not a great idea, and most of the time your first year, it won’t be. But every idea you throw out is another piece of evidence that you’re thinking, learning, and creating. You’re not just a machine awaiting input. I’d rather an associate at our firm share 10 terrible ideas than have one great idea they keep to themselves. Prove that you’re trying, and you’ll keep getting opportunities.

Maintain your personal life. It’s easy in the first few months of your practice to shut everything down and focus solely on grinding out hours in the office. There are some law firms that practically require it. I’m happy to say that my firm isn’t one of them, and we see that kind of strategy as a long-term dead end. You need a social life. Without it, it’s just a matter of time before you’re burned out and looking for either a new firm or a new career. Plus, socializing is good for business. As you move up the ranks, you want to be generating business. Keeping those social networks alive and growing is the best way to do that. So stay in touch with your friends. Make time to hit the gym or go see a movie. You’ll be better off in every way.

Embrace new technologies. Tech is revolutionizing the practice of law, yet many partners across the industry remain hidebound. I’ve had partners at other law firms email documents from word processing software so old that I couldn’t even open it on my computer. New technology is an opportunity for you to jump to the head of the class in terms of experience. If you’re the only person in the firm who’s used the new trial presentation software, you’re suddenly indispensable. Contracts law is hundreds of years old, but blockchain expertise didn’t even exist before a few years ago. Lack of experience is your biggest weakness right now. If you can find a more level playing field, take advantage of it.

Pay attention to how work gets delegated. For the first few years, every scrap of work you get will be handed down by senior associates or partners. Once you get a few years under your belt, though, you’re going to be expected to do some of that delegation yourself. Pay attention to the projects that you succeed on, and which ones you struggled with. Note the ones that taught you skills, and the ones that had you spinning your wheels. Figure out how you want to be treated as a junior associate, and use that to make you a better boss when it’s your turn to hand work off.

Make this place yours. Don’t be an employee punching a clock. You’re a part of an ecosystem now. With hard work and some luck, you’ll own a piece of this law firm in a few years. So why not start making it a better place to work right now? Be kind. Help others. Figure out what you want and fight for it. Let the firm know the kind of place you want it to become, and put in the sweat to make it happen. It’s hard. It doesn’t always work. But an investment in other people is always a smart investment. Maybe you’ll change the firm for the better today. Maybe you’ll plant the seeds for a better firm tomorrow. But whatever you do, at least try.

# Another Firm Splits The Associate Compensation Baby, Giving Raises But No Bonuses
## A sexy $190,000 starting salary gets all the attention.

With Biglaw recruitment season just around the corner, firms are in a rush to prove that they too belong at the top of the industry by meeting the new market compensation scale. Firms are hoping to impress the best of the best law students, and a sexy $190,000 starting salary gets attention.

Now it’s possible the penny-pinching firms out there are hoping that when law students are busy evaluating firms, they’ll only clock the impressive first-year salary. This way, compressing the top of the scale (say, the Class of 2010 getting paid $15,000 less than at competitor firms) or skipping out on the mid-year bonuses may go unnoticed.

Now, I’m not saying that’s what’s happening at Brown Rudnick, but here’s the new base compensation scale they announced yesterday (note the compression at the Class of 2010 level and compare it to the $340,000 other firms are paying that class):

And no, there are no mid-year bonuses coming their way. But the announcement leaves the door open that maybe, just maybe, when it comes to end of the year bonuses they’ll get a bump to compensate for peer firms’ special bonuses.

We are evaluating the impact the increase to associate salaries will have on our more senior lawyers, including income partners. We will communicate any increases individually.

We are aware that some firms are paying interim bonuses based on various factors, including annualized hours to date. We will continue to follow our discretionary annual bonus program, in which associates may, and often do, earn higher bonuses than the published market scale, based on their actual year-end hours and annual performance. In making our annual bonus determinations following the end of our fiscal year, we will take into account all market movements throughout the year, including those relating to year-end and interim bonuses.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

— Brad Karp, chairman of Paul Weiss, in a memo sent earlier this week, informing employees that they can [work remotely through at least January 24](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/paul-weiss-extends-remote-work-to-jan-24-on-omicron-threat) due to the spread of the COVID-19 omicron variant.

Hanna Kim

“A simple trip to the market, thought the streets were safe / Turned targets, I speak up for my people’s sake / From this pandemic, I’m hopeful that we’ll see escape / Until then, love’s the only vaccine for hate.” — [MC Jin](https://time.com/6048685/stop-the-hatred-mc-jin-wyclef-jean/)

This week, I had the opportunity to catch up with [Hanna Kim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanna-kim-4a3b34b0/), [Punam Kaji](https://www.linkedin.com/in/punamkaji/), and [Ann Chao Sheu](https://implementer.eosworldwide.com/us-implementers/listing/sheu-ann).

The Podium aims to amplify voices, advance and support careers, and create authentic connections for APA women lawyers.

Over the past year, I have witnessed COVID-19 pods for socializing and engagement pods for LinkedIn, but I haven’t seen a professional pod quite like The Podium bloom during this pandemic era. The rise and success of this group as well as its embrace of an intimate community and authentic relationships during these trying times is a testament to their charge and the organization’s charter.

Kim, Kaji, and Sheu are key members of the local Dallas and national AAPI legal communities. I continue to be impressed by each one’s career journey and personal maturation. And I left our conversation inspired and hopeful that our community will maintain its momentum long past AAPI Heritage Month.

Without further ado, here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation:

Renwei Chung (RC): Can you share with our audience a bit about your backgrounds and why you became attorneys?

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Hanna Kim (HK): I am a first-generation immigrant from Korea. I was the first in my family to have the opportunity to pursue a higher education due to the sacrifices of my parents. I acted as my parents’ translator and advocate from an early age, and there are clear moments I remember of them being frustrated and defeated.

I attribute these moments as the reason I wanted to become an attorney. However, what really motivated me to become an advocate was seeing my parents help others in need even with their own limitations. My parents illustrated the impact of being an advocate for others, and I believe that has shaped the person I am now.

Ann Chao Sheu (AS): From a very young age, I loved being an advocate for others, always fighting for what I thought was just and fair. In my legal career, I practiced business and employment law and then went to the Collin County DA’s office to lead the diversion program. We created a probation path that worked with local entrepreneurs to provide life and job skills training to program participants.

While I’m no longer practicing law, I am continuing to work with entrepreneurs and advocate for others through my work as an [Entrepreneurial Operating System](https://implementer.eosworldwide.com/us-implementers/listing/sheu-ann) (EOS) Implementer. Now, I work with entrepreneurial leadership teams, and I advocate, teach, and coach them to lead a better business and build a better life.

Punam Kaji (PK): I am from San Antonio, Texas, and the daughter of immigrants from India who immigrated here in the 1970s. From a young age, I wanted to be an attorney.  I would stand on a dining table chair at 4 years old and orate about something or another, it was comedic but also a calling of sorts.

In college, I focused on government and policy and decided to go to law school to see where further studying the law would take me.  I have always wanted to use my power as an attorney for good. I work now as an in-house labor and employment attorney.

RC: What makes The Podium different from other legal professional organizations?

AS: I knew we could create something special in the APA legal community by cultivating a sisterhood where I’m truly seen, heard, and understood; a sisterhood where we support each other through it all — the good and bad.

Our members serve as each other’s personal Board of Directors — a safe place where we could be vulnerable and authentic and share both our struggles and our wild-crazy dreams.  The Podium is that and so much more! It is completely unique, and we are very intentional about keeping it that way.

HK: The Podium is an intentional space for Asian women lawyers to amplify and support one another’s growth. The goal is not to grow the organization, the goal is for members to build authentic connections in order to support each other in a tangible way.

The Podium is a network that supports Asian women lawyers to reach their “full potential” as personally set and defined by each member. It is a space for Asian women lawyers to feel comfortable taking the stage through this intimate network. The Podium provides a platform for members to achieve their individual goals, and I think that makes us pretty special.

RC: What motivated you to launch The Podium?

HK: The name of the organization sheds light as to our “why.” Asian women tend to be stereotyped as meek, unassertive individuals who don’t necessarily seek opportunities at the top.

We saw a space that was both necessary and missing — The Podium is a platform for Asian women lawyers to feel empowered to take the stage, use their voice, and receive the support necessary to achieve their goals.

PK: APA Women Lawyers give so much to the legal community. The women in this organization are all givers, having given hours of service to bar associations and community groups. Now, this organization looks inward and works on personal goals with the support of others.

There was really no group similar to what we are doing, but we all needed this — a group focused on our own development. We realized if we want this to exist, we should create it! It reminds me of Mindy Kaling’s quote: “If you don’t see a clear path for what you want, sometimes you have to make it yourself.”

RC: Why are you drawn to this type of labor of love?

PK: Time is so precious, but this project is worth the time because I believe The Podium’s impact and influence will be immeasurable. If each of the women that come through this group finds support to identify and achieve her goals, with a sisterhood to help her dream big, I can only imagine the influence and impact we can have not only for each individual woman but for the community all around her.

RC: How would you define success for The Podium over the next few years?

AS: By using EOS, we have clearly defined what success looks like for The Podium. We know that within 10 years, we want to have helped 25 members achieved their own dream big 10-year goals. By 2024, we will have cultivated a community of sisterhood that lifts each other up and breaks the mold for APA women lawyers.

Over the next year, we are working to build our online presence, starting with LinkedIn, and later this year, we will have our first external event and kick-off for our inaugural membership application cycle.  We hope that by the end of this year, our eight current members will be able to credit The Podium for positive change in their lives — both professionally and personally.

PK: Our group was already full of rock stars, but we are being intentional about tracking the award nominations, articles, speaking engagements, service accolades, etc., for this group, and just to name a few — Ashley Yen has been nominated as a finalist for the 2020 DFW Corporate Counsel Award’s Rookie by the ACC-DFW, Meyling Ly Ortiz has been nominated as a finalist for 2020 DFW Pro Bono and Public Service Award by the ACC-DFW, and Punam Kaji was named Young Lawyer of the Year by the Tarrant County Young Lawyers Association. 

RC: Why do you believe representation is important?

HK: Representation is essential in two aspects. First, representation empowers diverse communities and second, it leads to a more accepting, inclusive society. The Podium seeks to advance the representation and elevate the voices of Asian women lawyers.

I was personally influenced by my mentors Meyling Ly Ortiz, Stacey Cho Hernandez, Ann Sheu, and Punam Kaji as a law student. They showed me that there is space for people like me. Representation is key in sharing diverse perspectives and ideas that ultimately help us grow collectively. Representation carries even more significance within the legal industry, as our profession involves representing and advocating for the interests of all people.

RC: What advice do you have for law students and recent law school graduates?

PK: It is your turn to be the decision-maker in your life. Until now, you may have been choosing from limited options on which law school to go to, and which job to pick.

Now the road map is yours to create, and your life is bigger than your career path alone. This can be daunting, but seeing it this way helped me take ownership of my journey and enjoy it instead of focusing on the stress of the day-to-day grind of legal work. It also helped me practice more autonomy and take the right risks for my career.

RC: Given that we are approaching the end of AAPI Heritage Month, do you have any thoughts on the current state of the state as it relates to AAPI issues?

PK: Our group all identifies as AAPI, but we are diverse — Korean American, Taiwanese American, Chinese American, Cambodian American, Vietnamese American, and Indian American. We embody how the APA community’s influence grows when we work together.

Right now, AAPIs have banded together in allyship with one another and other communities of color as we build more understanding in our country around racial and ethnic diversity. It is with that spirit of solidarity that we can raise awareness about our communities and fight against hate crimes and discrimination in all forms.

HK: There are underlying, pervasive reasons that hate crimes occur. The increase in crimes against the AAPI community — many of which are attacks against the elderly and immigrant populations who have limited English proficiency — is the underlying notion that we “don’t belong here.” The media attention has brought this deep-rooted issue to the forefront, and I believe we are seeing the strength and impact of how people can collectively stand against hate in all forms.

AAPI Heritage Month is meant to celebrate the history and contributions of the AAPI community, and it is on all of us to be more intentional in becoming a more accepting, inclusive society.

RC: Is there anything else you’d like to share with our ATL audience?

PK: Lawyers are whole people, with ideas and lives beyond the billable hours and the practice of law. This group honors that by giving our members a chance to look at the big picture of their lives and dream big.

We really believe we will harness the ambition of APA Women Lawyers and our members will achieve great things for themselves, their families, and their community by being part of our sisterhood.

To the readers — I hope you stop and reflect and ask yourself how you are doing in your big picture journey as we do in this group. You deserve it!

On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, I would like to thank Hanna Kim, Punam Kaji, and Ann Chao Sheu for sharing their stories with our audience. We wish them continued success in their careers.

Urban Meyer may have gotten a proverbial slap on the wrist for keeping a know domestic abuser on the payroll, but that doesn’t mean we have to like it. Indeed, it’s infuriating when a respected white shoe law firm — Debevoise & Plimpton — gives Ohio State the all clear to prioritize winning football games over the safety and well-being of women. Debevoise partner and former SEC chair, Mary Jo Whitewash — erm White — is getting a reputation for giving institutions the all clear when dealing with sexual harassment and assault.

On the most recent episode of The Jabot podcast, Joe Patrice and I discuss what the hell is going on at THE Ohio State University and what that means for all of college football.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Let’s be real — it can suck out there. So we want to create a space where our community can come together share stories, find support and devise strategies.

Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wears when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that — even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

# Partner Group Hiring: A Common Alternative To Traditional Expansion Strategies
## In the face of a challenging legal market, law firms increasingly turn to partner group hiring as a less risky and more efficient alternative to traditional expansion strategies such as individual lateral hires or mergers.

2022 was a difficult year for major law firms, with considerably reduced opportunity to drive profit growth as compared to 2021. It’s no surprise, then, that the more challenging environment is influencing firms’ strategies for expanding their partnerships. With reduced margin for error, firms are mindful of the risks inherent in the traditional methods of hiring individual lateral partners or of merging with another firm. According to our clients and many of the law firm leaders with whom we work closely, [hiring groups of partners](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://laterallink.com/more-bang-for-the-buck-hiring-lateral-partners-in-groups-is-gaining-popularity/%2523:~:text%253DFrom%252520a%252520partner%252520perspective%25252C%252520making,even%252520in%252520more%252520challenging%252520times%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1679617041163724%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw1HD3PqJLEoRUrQNcqA5cLm&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1679617041177421&usg=AOvVaw1bgGAyo_p1D7j-iuPFmKEO) has emerged as a sweet-spot alternative.


Hiring partner groups is less risky than individual lateral hiring

Hiring partners in groups can mitigate many of the risks associated with traditional lateral hiring. Take cultural fit, for example. A lateral partner hire who turns out to be a poor cultural match can do real damage to the cohesion of a firm and, in the final analysis, undermines the very purpose behind their hire. A 2021 survey by ALM Intelligence and Decipher Investigative Intelligence found that [29% of firms](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/legal/forum-spring-2022-effective-lateral-hiring/%2523:~:text%253DConsidering%252520compensation%25252C%252520on%25252Dboarding%252520costs,from%252520%252524715%25252C500%252520to%252520%2525244%252520million%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1679617041164616%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw3R-7JX2gkphg--Jw5wcDaK&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1679617041177718&usg=AOvVaw0zEjU-kiQWVDvamqJo9mIJ) have had a lateral partner leave due to cultural fit issues with other partners. Rather than take the risk of integrating a single new lateral partner, firms often prefer to bring on a group of partners with a proven ability to work together, expecting that the group will replicate its existing equilibrium in the new firm and, thereby, contribute as efficiently as possible to the bottom line.

Group hiring also arguably offers greater security that claimed portable books of business are real. Nearly half of respondents to the ALM/Decipher survey reported that the majority of their firm’s partner laterals underperformed in relation to their stated book of business. The survey found that more than two-thirds of law firms have had a lateral partner leave for this reason.

Group moves improve these outcomes significantly. When a group moves together, clients are more likely to move with them and there are several additional indicators that portables will be solid. These range from such soft indicators as the trust shown by associates, counsels, and service partners moving alongside their rainmaking colleagues to harder indicators available when cross-referencing the business case provided by each partner in their lateral questionnaires.

Lastly, group hiring is also more efficient, offering more bang for the buck and swifter growth than a piecemeal approach – saving both time and money.

Group hiring is more targeted — and certain — than pursuing a merger

In theory, the greatest bang for the buck expansion strategy is a merger; but although we have seen some [merger activity](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/mcguirewoods-aggressively-seeks-merger-partner-chairman-says%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1679617041166248%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw3Qt0KJreWG_3iwzyM27qii&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1679617041178075&usg=AOvVaw2lXPNDNtNd8A2odW88vEsU) this year among smaller firms, and some attempts among larger ones, too, the specter of failure often looms large and a firm may invest significant energy in the process, only to walk away with nothing (take, for example, the recent merger attempts between Shearman Sterling and Hogan Lovells or O’Melveny and Allen & Overy). Worse yet, failed mergers often attract unwanted attention from competing firms looking to take advantage of any resulting turmoil by siphoning off spooked talent – the opposite of growth! Group hiring is less complex than conducting merger talks and a deal is more likely to be reached. In addition, the hiring firm can be more selective about the partners it takes on. Underperformers are less likely to be admitted through a group hire than through a larger-scale merger.

Partner group hiring is ideal for secondary market expansion

As we have [previously](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://laterallink.com/more-bang-for-the-buck-hiring-lateral-partners-in-groups-is-gaining-popularity/%2523:~:text%253DFrom%252520a%252520partner%252520perspective%25252C%252520making,even%252520in%252520more%252520challenging%252520times%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1679617041167310%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw1lDKv7Bq-5ov3G1vgvf-zE&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1679617041178285&usg=AOvVaw1Dat4t0jMibqv9bTvRbJQq) [discussed](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://laterallink.com/partners-assessing-a-secondary-market-move-finding-the-right-firm-and-office/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1679617041167725%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw1XEW3cxHD3j0giR4fifQer&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1679617041178372&usg=AOvVaw1E98oR6B7_SluwH68guCqi), we are in the midst of accelerated Biglaw expansion into new or smaller markets across the country. Consider the options available to a firm committed to opening a new office in Miami or Austin or Salt Lake City, with no prior presence in those markets. While they may, in the past, have hired two or three individual lateral partners from local firms and transferred some of the firm’s current partners to the new office in the hope it all jells successfully, firms are now more inclined to hire a group of local partners and use that group as the anchor for the new office, to be supplemented by some internal transfers.

Mintz Levin’s entry into the Toronto market is one example. This week, we learned that the firm’s new office will be [anchored by a group](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.globallegalpost.com/news/mintz-levin-adds-partners-from-torys-dentons-wilson-sonsini-for-canada-debut-489644339%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1679617041168477%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw3b4a5_DrfaU1ydnXll-EoN&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1679617041178541&usg=AOvVaw2B9FJ5FjTYPJc1Xibnm1V2) of three partners from leading Canadian firm Torys. Mintz has also hired a Toronto-based Dentons partner who was previously at Torys.

Expansion into a new market is a high-stakes move, with considerable reputational risk. A group with existing local client relationships that already work together productively provides a strong initial platform. Firms’ desire to maximize their likelihood of success in new markets is a key driver of the partner group hiring trend.

# No Memo, But We're Pretty Sure This Biglaw Firm Is Handing Out Market Bonuses
## Plus extra cash for high performers!

There may not be a formal memo announcing lockstep bonuses, but that doesn’t mean the associates at Gibson Dunn have been left out in the cold. As is their [usual tradition](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/associate-bonus-watch-this-prestigious-biglaw-firm-has-announced-its-bonuses/?rf=1), the firm gives out individualized bonuses communicated to associates in private review meetings. As is also their usual tradition, the amounts appear to track along the market bonus — with extra cash for particularly high performers.

As one tipster noted:

Gibson is matching Cravath plus the usual bumps for high performers. They don’t do formal bonus announcement or memo – never have. Associates find out individual bonus in a private review meeting.

# Pillsbury's Equation: Biglaw + alt.law = Modern Cybersecurity Solution
## It's unusual to see a Biglaw firm like Pillsbury announcing a partnership with an alt.legal company.

When a Biglaw firm builds and promotes a cross-disciplinary, globalized approach to cybersecurity, I take note.  And when one of my colleagues is helping lead that charge, I feel compelled to write about it (and if I have learned anything from this election cycle, it’s that there is simply no such thing as an inappropriate time for a product plug).

So what is this new business model? They are calling it a “one-stop shop” for cybersecurity risk assessments and compliance.  It was the brainchild of my colleague [Christy Weisner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christyweisner) (a UVA Law grad and former [Mayer Brown](https://www.mayerbrown.com/) associate) and the co-chair of Pillsbury’s Cybersecurity Task Force, [Brian Finch](http://www.pillsburylaw.com/brian-finch). The alliance combines the legal support heft of my company, [Thomson Reuters Legal Managed Services](http://legalsolutions.thomsonreuters.com/law-products/solutions/legal-outsourcing-services?searchid=TRPPCSOL/Google/LegalManagedServices(LMS)-UnitedStates/BrandedKeywords-LMS/+legal+managed+services/Broad&cid=PPC_GLM_448&jt=1&jap=1t1&js=1&jsid=39399&jcpid=8a8ae4cd50070bb9015027c9125904cf&jtid=gcp:se_39399:t_kwd-31417773491:ag_20056596657:cp_375610017:n_g:d_c:cr_144958779091:fi_&gclid=CjwKEAiA9s_BBRCL3ZKWsfblgS8SJACbST7DmRttBVokb9K-e1AajomBRi9Vp1xUlIgKOXEp4jfv0xoCwxvw_wcB) (f/k/a legal outsourcing company Pangea3) with the superior legal know-how of Biglaw powerhouse [Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw & Pitman LLP](http://www.pillsburylaw.com/).  Last, but certainly not least, is a very cool company called [FireEye](https://www2.fireeye.com/PPC-security-reimagined-adaptive-defense-threat-landscape.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=Security_Reimagined&utm_keyword=fire%20eye&utm_campaign=Brand%7CUS%7CGGL%7CExact&cid=Brand%7CUS%7CGGL%7CExact&utm_content=Brand%7CExact&gclid=CjwKEAiA9s_BBRCL3ZKWsfblgS8SJACbST7DgBpz6cD03pSF27wcUz1l3TnK8cgwIpIWKxDOxmXyKhoCP6rw_wcB), a cybersecurity consulting firm and an essential piece of the puzzle.

It’s not every day you see a Biglaw firm like Pillsbury (a white-shoe firm dating back to the 1800s) announcing a partnership with an alt.legal company – even though many quietly rely on such arrangements to win new business and keep clients happy (we see you lurking in [the closet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFosUj6A22c) there).

Christy was, coincidentally, my very first recruit to the alt.legal community, so I was proud to see her working alongside innovators in Biglaw to craft new solutions for new problems. So, this week I chatted with Christy and Brian about the origin of the alliance, as well as Christy’s experience on the alt side of the law. Enjoy.

Joe Borstein: What exactly are Pillsbury, Thomson Reuters, and FireEye doing together?

Christy Weisner: A number of things, including risk assessments in response to regulatory requirements and in support of general cybersecurity programs, and M&A due diligence with a focus on cybersecurity risk.

It’s not rocket science: companies need to understand their risks and address them. But they can easily forget major areas of risk. So we banded together our legal, process, and technical expertise to provide a holistic approach to assessing and addressing cyber risk within a cost-effective delivery model.

Brian Finch: While Biglaw firms have a lot to offer, the reality is that we cannot be everything to everyone. That’s particularly true when it comes to cybersecurity – law firms can and do employ a number of people who are very sophisticated when it comes to cybersecurity matters, but the reality is that they will never replicate the resources and technical skills of other service providers.

Bringing a combination of skills together, however, like the ones offered by Thomson Reuters and FireEye, gives us the chance to present a more robust and well-rounded offering to a potential client. There is clearly significant value in presenting a more complete set of cybersecurity skills in one presentation along with the message that “we know each other and have thought about ways to work together to help you.”

JB: How did this collaboration come about?

CW: Brian is an innovative and client-focused lawyer. When we met we quickly realized that our legal support services and their legal expertise were complementary (not competitive). Since Pillsbury already had a great relationship with FireEye, he brought them into the discussion and we figured out that there’s a really great fit to all of our services.

JB: Is this collaboration a model of things to come? 

CW: I think so. There is great opportunity for firms who are getting cut out of the delivery of legal services, because they can’t price their work rationally, the client has increased their in-house capabilities, the client comes directly to companies like ours, or some combination of the above.

It’s a shame, because while we can do wonderful legal process work, we can’t offer legal opinions and advice.

JB: If there is so much potential, why do you think more firms are not creating partnerships like this?

BF: It’s hard to speak for every firm, but in my experience there are certainly a lot of lawyers who think they can handle it all themselves, or just do not want to invest the effort in finding suitable collaborations. Some firms also like to stick with what they feel they are best at – providing legal counsel. That’s their decision, and I certainly wouldn’t question that. We are doing what we are doing because we think clients and potential clients like the idea of multiple skill sets coming together to offer a coordinated package of services.

CW: To me, it’s shortsighted, but understandable. Biglaw firms need all the business and billable hours they can bring in. But at the end of the day, you’ll bring in more work if you are able to scale seamlessly, and price work rationally and competitively. Junior partners often get this and are coming to us with ideas. Senior partners, in their defense, are often too rich to care!

That’s why it was so refreshing to meet Brian and actually put pen to paper and come up with something that clients need and can afford.

Why cybersecurity?

BF: To me, Cybersecurity is a fascinating issue that impacts every sector of the global economy. It’s transforming every part of the world. As technology advances, people are finding ways to exploit that progress to make economic and other gains using illegal or unauthorized means. And that is presenting incredibly unique challenges to everyone from law firms to Fortune 1000 companies. The law is having trouble catching up with the problem of cyber threats, and so all sides – from regulators and plaintiffs’ lawyers to general counsel and solo practitioners – are scrambling to figure out how to deal with these issues.

It’s fascinating and overwhelming at the same time, and also presents a rare opportunity for lawyers; we can get in on the front end of a whole new practice area and shape it. That’s really exciting as well as humbling. From my perspective, lawyers cannot go it alone either. They need the help of other companies like FireEye and TR to understand what is going on and how to manage their legal obligations.

JB: Last question, Christy — for all those Biglaw associates and partners thinking of taking the plunge, tell me about your experience on the alt.legal side

CW: Frankly, it was scary at first.

You were pretty convincing to get me to join you, despite my own parents telling me I was nuts for leaving the safety blanket that the associate track provided – one that I had worked so hard to get during the financial collapse!

But as soon as I left, my personality (and literal color in my face) returned. I hadn’t realized how much of myself I had lost in the few short years I was there until I joined this company. (Remind me again how much this therapy session costs?)

On the complete opposite side, you have to find your own voice and style to succeed in a business like this. Every day you have to ask yourself how you can help your clients in ways they have never tried before (and enjoy trying to convince lawyers to try something new!).

At the end of the day, the alternative side of the legal business has been so much fun. I highly recommend associates finding something in the business of law they consider fun, and exploring it. It’s out there, I know it.

# Stroock Working On Wind Down, Trying To Keep Firm Out Of Bankruptcy
## This mess started when the firm lost its bankruptcy group, and now the firm doesn't want to end up in bankruptcy.

It’s the end of an era for Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, a firm that existed as an elite among its peers for nearly 150 years before disaster struck. In the wake of [losing more than half of its partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/the-end-may-be-near-as-stroock-loses-more-than-half-its-partners-to-hogan-lovells/) to Hogan Lovells, the firm has announced its [plans for a dissolution](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/stroock-to-dissolve-close-its-doors-after-nearly-150-years-in-business/).

What’s the next step for a firm trying to hold it all together before the end officially comes? The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/10/31/stroock-planning-dissolution/) has some of the details:

The dissolution process of the 147-year-old New York-based firm will begin once the partnership at Hogan Lovells approves the pending Stroock hires, according to sources familiar with the negotiations. Law.com has reported that the hires are subject to a partnership vote at Hogan Lovells set to close on Tuesday, Oct. 31.

After that lateral move, a wind-down committee will oversee Stroock’s dissolution or potential bankruptcy filing.

But whether the firm lands in bankruptcy is unknown at this point, sources said, as Stroock will be dealing with both preferred and non-preferred creditors. Its full liabilities are unclear at this point, sources said.

Stroock will likely attempt to avoid bankruptcy at all costs, perhaps in the hope that the firm doesn’t become the next posterchild for law firm mismanagement. Hopefully Stroock doesn’t strike out and wind up in bankruptcy court while it’s winding down.

# Data Analytics For Lawyers
## Avoid the HiPPO!

Avoid the HiPPO! These three words can change the way anyone does business for the better. I will explain what I mean here at the end.

First, it’s time to confront a cold truth. Like it or not, data analytics is becoming an increasingly important part of the business world, including the legal profession. For attorneys of all stripes then, that means it’s important to understand how data analytics works, what it involves, and where it can be used.

Steps in Data Analytics

Understanding data analytics means starting by understanding the steps that all data analytics and business intelligences processes take.

There are five steps to any data analytics project; (1) figure out what the question to be answered is, (2) gather relevant data, (3) clean and structure that data, (4) run analysis and test hypotheses, (5) make a decision.

Effective business analytics requires all five of these steps and it truly is a process. Any firm that sets out to use data on a one-off quick project is going to find themselves a victim of the garbage-in, garbage-out paradigm. Much of the consulting work that I do for firms is around using data to analyze business issues, and it’s very common for me to get a phone call from a potential client that has already tried to do a data analytics project quickly on their own often as a side task for one employee. It almost never works.

Nonetheless, data analytics is still crucial for businesses of all sizes today including attorneys.

Where Can Data Analytics Be Used?

Data analytics including predictive analytics (making data-driven predictions related to business issues) is useful for attorneys in a broad variety of areas. Small law firms can use data analytics to optimize pricing and discounts for clients, large law firms can use data analytics to help corporate clients determine lawsuit risks and the probabilities of a loss in a trial setting, litigation finance funds can use data analytics to value and assess particular claims, and securities lawyers can help clients understand risks from regulators using tools like the SEC’s new API measure or the any of the litany of other data-related flagging tools.

Anyone reading this can probably come up with questions they have about their own business that can be answered with data analytics. The biggest constraints on data analytics are not about having a question that requires numbers or math to answer — textual analysis can answer many nonmathematical questions. Rather the questions that data analytics can answer are those not based on a subjective opinion.

What is the risk of a lawsuit to firm XYZ given all of the characteristics particular to firm XYZ? That’s a data analytics question. What should I have for dinner tonight? That is not something data analytics can help with.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Where Does The Data Come From?

Once a question is determined, it’s time to gather data.

The biggest problem that firms run into when trying to do data analytics work is that they are not sure where to get data from.

Fortunately there are numerous good tools out there to help with this issue today, and many are free or low cost.

There are many sources of free data such as the Federal Reserve’s FRED service and the Census Bureau’s Data Ferret. There are of course many paid data sources available as well from large firms like Thomson Reuters and Standard and Poors among many others. Data specific to attorneys can be gathered from many boutique sources ranging from Lawyers.com to the Litigation Finance Journal.

What Is Involved in Analysis?

The process of cleaning up a data set and analyzing it requires some training and experience. Lay people can identify questions they are interested in answering, but answering those questions requires careful use of data. The most important tool in data analysis is the multiple regression often simply called regression analysis.

Regression analysis allows the analysis of a situation after controlling for all other factors involved. For example, what is the probability of winning/losing this trial given the type parties involved and given the judge and given the geography and given the economic climate, etc. etc.

Regression analysis then can serve as the benchmark for providing objective guidance in a variety of settings.

The HiPPO

All of this brings me back to where I started and the importance of avoiding HiPPO’s. The HiPPO or Highest Paid Person’s Opinion is how many crucial business decisions are made today. Yet that model is flawed because it creates subjectivity and key man risks related to crucial business decisions. In an uncertain world, adopting objective data-driven methods can help to create consistency for businesses and reduce risk in the process.

We live in a world of data. In the course of a day, we each interact with and generate data at levels that once likely seemed impossible. Law firms and legal departments are in possession of vast amounts of data just waiting to be collected and analyzed. The potential for data-driven insights and decision-making in the legal industry is huge. Unfortunately, though, much of this potential still remains untapped.

The legal industry today, compared to other professional industries, generally makes less use of their available data to drive decisions. This may be because, historically, lawyers have prided themselves on bespoke work, creating work product that’s highly customized to individual clients and matters. However, as lawyers become more comfortable with data, they’re increasingly seeing its value in crafting and pitching legal strategies to clients.

At its core, that’s what data-driven law is all about: how do lawyers use data to inform their decision-making and provide better client service? Tools like [Lexis+](https://bit.ly/32zUQly), the comprehensive new solution from LexisNexis, are making it possible and opening doors to a new era of data-driven law.

##Understanding the Shift to Data-Driven Law
Even just five years ago, lawyers had a limited ability to understand things like the likely outcomes of various motion-filing scenarios or the breadth of contract provisions that are market. Today, with the help of data and advanced tools, those things are increasingly knowable and are crucial in recommending the best possible legal strategies to clients.

The shift to data-driven law is driven partly by pressure from clients. While client demands for anything that increases deficiency and lowers fees are not new, today they’re heightened. Legal departments and in-house counsel themselves have access to this data and understand its value, so there’s an increased pressure on outside counsel to provide data-based recommendations more directly. Additionally, broader technology capabilities like cloud computing and machine learning have made it easier to mine this information and for technology providers like LexisNexis to deploy these capabilities in a cost-effective way.

Now that it’s easier to unlock these data insights, more and more lawyers are embracing the concept of data-driven law. In the near-term, we can expect lawyers to become conversant about data points in a way that helps them drive better legal strategy recommendations for their clients.

##How Lexis+ Is Changing the Game
Lexis+ is a comprehensive new solution from LexisNexis that provides a modern user experience and exclusive integrations. It’s also making it easier for lawyers to gain data-driven insights through a host of features that are brand new to the legal market.

Lexis+ is empowering the shift to data-driven law by capitalizing on current trends and taking into consideration how lawyers actually practice. On the trend front, Lexis+ exposes lawyers to insights in ways that were previously not common or possible. With the amount of data most legal organizations have, it’s possible to model likely outcomes, whether for litigation scenarios, the introduction of legislation, or something else. This ability is new, and it’s something that lawyers are becoming and will continue to become more comfortable with as they understand how data can help them make smarter decisions about legal services for their clients. In the near future, we’ll regularly be talking about modeled outcomes, generated by sophisticated tools like Lexis+.

On the practical front, Lexis+ is customizing these new capabilities to specific workflows. How a transactional lawyer, whether they’re an M&A specialist or a tax attorney, interacts with large corporate data sets looks very different than how a litigator interacts with large data sets from the courts. Lexis+ is striving to get each of these individual use cases exactly right, customizing the data that’s presented depending on the type of law practice.

Data-driven law has long been focused on the litigation space. While Lexis+ is continuing those efforts, it also recognizes that, increasingly, there’s exciting work being done in fields like M&A or securities law where there are very big, rich data sets. To handle them, Lexis+ has developed a bespoke set of analytics tools and data review capabilities designed for each type of practice. The legal field has never had such capability before, and this power makes Lexis+ equally applicable to all practitioners and specialties.

##Forging Ahead
A big concept like data-driven law can sometimes seem scary or overwhelming for lawyers who just want to focus on serving their clients. Established practices and workflows are comfortable, and there’s an understandable fear about having to adapt to new tools. However, technology experts like LexisNexis that are moving the market in the direction of data-driven law understand lawyers and how they work and make it easier than ever with the right tools. No big change happens overnight, it happens over time. With tools like Lexis+, transitioning to the future of legal practice can be seamless.

Many other professions have excelled after exploring the use of data and technology to drive new insights and confidence. The legal industry’s moment is now. It’s time to embrace data and all the insights it can offer.

# Biglaw Firm Delights With Up To $40,000 Extra In Bonus Money For Big Billers
## A nice thank you for those who have had an extra busy year.

Complain and you shall receive. Not just a[ few hours ago](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/sidley-bonus-2019/) I was whining about the relative slowness of this year’s Biglaw bonus announcements. Yes, it is understandable since [Milbank’s surprise move](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/breaking-biglaw-bonuses-are-here/) the first week of November bumped up the usual timeline. But still, I want more bonus announcements, and I’m sure a lot of you agree.

Well, looks like Schulte, Roth & Zabel heard me. Today, they announced the following bonus scale:

Class of 2019 – $15,000 (prorated)
Class of 2018 – $15,000
Class of 2017 – $25,000
Class of 2016 – $50,000
Class of 2015 – $65,000
Class of 2014 – $80,000
Class of 2013 – $90,000
Class of 2012 – $100,000
Class of 2011 – $100,000
Class of 2010 – $100,000

# Akin Gump Partner Arrested Trying To Sell The Details Of A Whistleblower Complaint (While Wearing A Wig)

Jeffrey Wertkin

Biglaw bombshell alert: Jeffrey Wertkin, an Akin Gump attorney who [joined the firm last year](https://www.law360.com/articles/785815/health-hires-akin-gump-gets-a-fed-morris-manning-an-ip-pro) after a successful stint at the Justice Department prosecuting cases under the False Claims Act, was [arrested](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-08/akin-gump-lawyer-accused-of-trying-to-sell-lawsuit-under-seal) on January 31 by the FBI (the [arrest documents](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/akin-gump-lawyer-arrested-trying-to-sell-the-details-of-a-whistleblower-complaint/2/) were unsealed on February 6). Wertkin was charged with obstruction of justice and contempt of court. He stands accused of trying to sell the details of a whistleblower lawsuit for $310,000 to an employee of a company that was under investigation by the Department of Justice.

According to the allegations, Wertkin — dressed in a wig, and going under the name “Dan” — was arrested in the lobby of a Cupertino, California hotel. He reportedly told the arresting agent, “My life is over.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As [noted by](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-08/akin-gump-lawyer-accused-of-trying-to-sell-lawsuit-under-seal) Bloomberg Technology, lawsuits under the False Claims Act have a unique process, which Wertkin allegedly sought to exploit (though it isn’t clear how Wertkin got a hold of the complaint):

The arrest highlights the unusual process involving lawsuits under the False Claims Act, which allows whistle-blowers to sue companies on behalf of the U.S. government. The lawsuits, which are filed under court seal and given to the Justice Department, typically claim a company cheated taxpayers. The U.S. may investigate for months or years before notifying the company of the claims. Whistle-blowers can share in any recovery, and some have collected tens of millions of dollars.

The FBI’s investigation began when they were alerted by an employee of the company targeted by the lawsuit. The employee received a voicemail from “Dan” offering details of the suit in exchange for a “consulting fee.”

The employee agreed to secretly record calls to Dan for the FBI. On Dec. 22, Dan said he would provide the full complaint for $300,000, the FBI said. Two weeks later, Dan suggested he get paid in untraceable bitcoins, and said buying the complaint would help the company “get out ahead of the investigation.” The employee unsuccessfully sought to negotiate a cheaper price for the sealed lawsuit, according to the court filings.

The price was eventually settled at $310,000 (Wertkin allegedly wanted travel costs covered), and when he went to make the drop-off, he was arrested.

An ATL source had this to add about Wertkin: “He was DOJ lead on a number of my cases. He was not the most liked person, but he always purported to be a very ‘by the book’ guy. So this is pretty shocking.”

Akin Gump’s statement about the arrest is suitably chagrined and notes they have fired Wertkin:

“We are shocked and deeply troubled by the conduct alleged in the charges filed against Mr. Wertkin,” an Akin Gump spokesman said in an e-mailed statement. “Honesty and integrity are at the core of our values and our client relationships. Immediately upon learning of these charges, we took swift action and Mr. Wertkin is no longer with the firm.”

Wertkin has been released on $750,000 bail.

# Rankings, Shmankings: Has USNWR Law School List Ever Been Relevant?
## Rankings? It’s not what you bring to the table when you enter law school, it’s the education you carry when you practice.

Right now in the soggy “Golden State,” a dispute between U.S. News and World Report’s hospital rankings and the San Francisco City Attorney’s office has morphed into litigation. The [LA Times has reported](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-01-24/u-s-news-world-report-sues-s-f-city-attorney-over-hospital-ranking-subpoenas) that “San Francisco City Atty. David Chiu issued two subpoenas to [U.S. News and World Report] earlier this month” with respect to hospital rankings and other health institutions. “The first demanded answers about the company’s process for ranking hospitals. The outlet also makes money from the healthcare facilities, including through its sale of ‘badges’ that high-scoring institutions can and often do place on their websites and other branding materials. The second subpoena demanded internal business records that might reveal more about U.S. News’ rankings process and whether the financial relationships with hospitals are a factor.”

This litigation should be interesting. California has codified the law of unfair business practices ([Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq.](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2022/code-bpc/division-7/part-2/chapter-5/section-17200/)) and so whether these rankings could be seen as an unfair business practice will be determined in the lawsuit that USNWR has filed in federal court.

For its part, USNWR claims that the subpoenas violate the First Amendment, and it seeks an injunction blocking compliance with those subpoenas.

Why should lawyers care? Think about it. The precious USNWR law school rankings have been the bible for prospective law students trying to decide where to apply, whether that school would be a fit, and, of course, the reputation of that school weighs heavily on decision-making, whether rightly or wrongly.

Any possibility that [USNWR’s rankings of law schools](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/law-rankings?_sort=my_rankings-asc) could be a possible future target? I would imagine that some law schools, especially lower tier, may be watching this litigation with interest. Some law schools have [ditched the rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/law-schools-dropping-out-of-us-news-rankings/) and more probably will.

[GPAs and LSAT scores are not necessarily indicative of success](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/this-year-im-thankful-that-law-schools-ditching-us-news-rankings-might-make-my-book-obsolete/) as a lawyer, and why should those matter? I’m not the only one to think that way. And does anyone really care about those things once out in practice? Maybe in Biglaw, but most lawyers do not practice in that rarified realm. In fact, the longer one is out of law school and practicing, the less value, if any, those “predictive” (and I use the term advisedly) scores have to real life. Has any client ever asked what your GPA was? Your LSAT score? I thought not.

It’s not what you bring to the table when you enter law school, it’s the education you carry when you practice. That’s the fallacy, I think, of any rankings. Rankings only matter in the eyes of the beholder, kind of like beauty. And we all know what a fallacy beauty can be.

Rankings should not be the be-all and end-all of any decision. Every prospective law student needs to do [their own due diligence about where to apply to law school](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/5-ways-us-news-can-change-its-rankings-methodology), whether to go to a particular school, whether the law school is a good fit, not just academically, but — even more important — financially. How much debt is in the offing and how much debt is the student willing to incur to get that professional degree? How deep in hock is she willing to go?

Reread John Grisham’s novel “[The Rooster Bar](https://www.amazon.com/Rooster-Bar-John-Grisham/dp/0385541171/ref=sr_1_1?crid=ITVRFH2JYOEA&keywords=the+rooster+bar+john+grisham+hardcover&qid=1706668046&s=books&sprefix=the+rooster+bar%2Cstripbooks%2C187&sr=1-1)” as a cautionary tale.

Not to limit itself just to law school rankings now that some law schools have kicked it to the curb, USNWR has just released its first “Best Companies to Work For” list of Biglaw firms. As the [ATL post points out](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/01/u-s-news-gets-in-on-rating-biglaw-firms-the-results-are-a-mixed-bag/), the results are, at best, a mixed bag. It’s not just a modified version of [Maslow’s hierarchy of needs](https://www.thoughtco.com/maslows-hierarchy-of-needs-4582571) but other aspects of law firm life that, in olden times, would probably have been considered too “woo-woo,” but not any more. What did USNWR also consider? A positive work environment, day-to-day employee experience, and opportunities for advancement.

Looking at the scorecard for the top 10 Biglaw firms in USNWR’s list, the factors are “quality of pay, work-life balance, stability, comfort, belongingness (?), and professional development.” Do you remember in high school (I know, going back that far is a stretch for me) how some students yearned to be part of the popular group (was that you)? Are these top 10 Biglaw firm rankings just a grownup version of that? What do you think?

And last, but not least, if anyone forgot to calendar the date, tomorrow, February 2 is Groundhog Day. That’s the day that Punxsutawney Phil emerges briefly from hibernation to tell the world whether there is going to be six more weeks of winter or if spring is nigh. If only he could tell us there’s going to be only six more weeks until the 2024 election, rather than the endless months of campaigning ahead of all of us.

# Biglaw Firm Raises Salaries, But $$$ Amount Remains Unclear

Baker & McKenzie is raising associate salaries, but hasn’t decided — or maybe just refuses to reveal — what those raises will be.

In an email sent to associates this evening, managing partner Rick Hammett announced that the Baker & McKenzie compensation scale would be raised for all U.S. offices, but left wide open the possibility those raises would be different based on office, as the managing partner for each market will be communicating the dollar amount separately.

The good news is that raises are coming for Baker associates, and they “will be commensurate with the extensively matched salary level in the legal industry that made the press last week.” We are happy to help hardworking associates get paid whenever we can, and here’s a [handy cheat sheet](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises/) if a managing parter in a specific office seems to be out of touch with what the market is dictating.

We are covering this story as market conditions develop, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

# And Then There Were 4: Biglaw Lawyers Behaving Badly
## Who belongs in the finals?

To celebrate March Madness — without any sports knowledge required — we here at Above the Law have decided to determine who is the absolute, very worst in Biglaw. And boy, do we have some doozies in the bracket. The Final 4 consists entirely of Biglaw partners; I guess the bigger they are, the harder they fall.



The first matchup features Keila Ravelo versus Jeffrey Wertkin — two Biglaw partners that have yet to be tried for their alleged crimes. If you’ve been voting in the earlier rounds, you’re familiar with their (alleged) work. Both of them are accused of using their roles for their own personal benefit. Ravelo [allegedly embezzled millions](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/partner-allegedly-steals-millions-from-biglaw-firms-to-lead-luxurious-lifestyle/) from not one but two Biglaw firms, through phony litigation support bills from a company owned by her and her husband. Wertkin [supposedly took a whistleblower complaint](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/akin-gump-lawyer-arrested-trying-to-sell-the-details-of-a-whistleblower-complaint/) he had access to from his previous job at the DOJ and tried to sell it back to the target company. He was arrested while trying to make the sale, while wearing a wig.

Who should be in the Finals?

- # 4 Seed Jeffrey Wertkin (63%, 305 Votes)
- # 1 Seed Keila Ravelo (37%, 179 Votes)
Total Voters: 484

The second matchup features ex-Biglaw partner Edward De Sear, who is [serving time](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/12/it-gets-worse-ex-biglaw-partner-who-possessed-kiddie-porn-pleads-guilty-to-child-sex-trafficking/) for sex trafficking of a minor and child pornography. There is really nothing I can even conceive of that would be worse than that, but perhaps the distance between De Sear’s crimes and his work as a lawyer gives some justification to not advance him to the final. Sarah Buffett’s [meltdown at 20,000 feet](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/biglaw-partner-gets-wasted-on-plane-causes-mid-atlantic-flight-diversion/) was truly epic and caused her flight to be diverted.

Who should be in the Finals?

- # 1 Seed Edward De Sears (81%, 369 Votes)
- # 1 Seed Sarah E. Buffett (19%, 85 Votes)
Total Voters: 454

# Sorry, But The Biglaw Layoffs Aren't Quite Over Yet
## With more 'uncertainty lying in wait,' this expert thinks we’re 'still in limbo.'

I think you’re going to see firms beginning to try and tighten up their expenses and reduce those expenses as much as they can without having to go to lawyer layoffs. I know it’s not fair to other professionals who work in law firms that they get trapped in this, but I think that’s just reality. What law firms are going to do as long as they can is avoid laying off lawyers.

I think that’s why most firms don’t want to lay off associates right now. They don’t want that pent-up demand to come flooding in and be understaffed.

— Jim Jones, director of the Georgetown University Law Center on Ethics and the Legal Profession, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/02/10/big-law-layoffs-may-continue-in-light-of-uncertainty-lying-in-wait/), on the most recent wave of layoffs across Biglaw, which he says are “not going to be the end of the story.” Matthew Bersani, a law firm consultant at Cliff Group said additional layoffs will depend on the state of the economy. “Law firms are reacting to the macro situation,” he said, noting that “there will be more blood on the floor” if a recession happpens.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

# More Associate Salaries On The Biglaw COVID-19 Chopping Block
## Salary cuts are becoming a way of life in Biglaw.

The Biglaw COVID-19 austerity measures show no signs of slowing down. With state and local governments struggling with how to best respond to the pandemic, the economic uncertainty grows. And the naturally fiscally conservative legal industry is trying to maintain its cash flow in these tumultuous times.

Quarles & Brady is the latest firm making cuts as COVID-19 rages on. As tipsters from the firm have told Above the Law, the firm, which made $266,790,000 in gross revenue in 2018 making it 117th on the Am Law 200, has decided to implement compensation cuts as part of cost-cutting measures designed to deal with the economic uncertainty surrounding COVID-19. The cuts are tiered by position and salaries.

We were on a call where the following was announced for all locations:

• Equity Partners taking 30% cut in quarterly distribution, then a a 20% in bi-weekly draws (indefinite length)

• Non-Equity Partners (making $200,000+) taking 15% pay reduction (indefinite length)

• Associates (and Non-Equity Partners making under $200,000) 10% pay reduction (indefinite length)

• Remaining Staff (indefinite length):

• 10% pay reduction for salaries above $75,000

• 5% pay reduction for salaries below $75,000

• Pay cuts begin with 4/16 paychecks.

• Some staff furloughed – 30 people. Covering their health insurance during this time, hope to re-hire.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And as tipsters note, the firm has furloughed a limited number (~30) of employees.

Michael Aldana, Managing Partner, had the following comment about the cost-cutting measures:

Quarles & Brady entered this period of disruption in a strong financial position with leading practices serving key industry sectors. But given the unprecedented nature of the global crisis, we have taken steps to respond appropriately to the current  economic climate. The firm has temporarily adjusted partner distributions and draws; temporarily adjusted compensation for all attorneys and staff; furloughed a small number of employees; cancelled our summer associate program; and adjusted our expense budget for the remainder of our fiscal year. Through these measures and a notion of shared sacrifice, we hope to minimize the economic impact on our people while maintaining the financial strength and resilience of the firm. The COVID-19 pandemic is changing our lives in many ways. What won’t change is our commitment to continuing to serve our clients’ legal needs efficiently and effectively in this rapidly changing environment.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# Top 10 Biglaw Firm Is Cutting Attorney Salaries As Part Of COVID-19 Austerity
## Even firms with $2 billion+ in revenue need to cut salaries, at least for now.

We’ve long suspected that even the Biglaw firms with the most impressive financial performance weren’t going to be immune from the economic ravages of COVID-19. Now we’ve learned the Hogan Lovells — a firm that took in $2,246,050,000 in gross revenue last year, making an impressive [8th on the latest Am Law 100 ranking](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/04/21/the-2020-am-law-100-ranked-by-gross-revenue/#) — has instituted salary cuts for attorneys.

The firm had previously announced they were delaying bonuses and 2019 profit distributions for all partners (income and equity). They also deferred UK and Asia Pacific salary reviews and discretionary bonuses for lawyers and for the majority of business services teams worldwide, which were scheduled for May 1st. Now the firm announced in an email (full version [available on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/holove-cuts/2/)) that, “April was better than we expected but it was still down both in relation to budget and last year. As far as the outlook for May, we expect further softening as some of the COVID-19 specific project wrap up and overall economic activity continues to be affected. Although the constraints affecting litigation will begin to loosen, we predict that it will be some months before we are back to pre-crisis levels.”

And if you guessed all that all that means the firm will institute salary cuts, well, you get a prize. The new salary cut scheme is as follows:

The series of measures which the firm is additionally enacting as of 1 June are as follows:

U.S. equity partners will reduce their monthly draws by between 15% and 25%. In addition, all equity partners will defer half of any profits for the first quarter of the year normally paid in August until November.

Non-equity partners will be taking a reduction from 1 June of 15% in their base compensation, equivalent to a cut of about 8.75% to their annual compensation.

Base compensation of Counsel, Associates, Attorneys, Specialists and Knowledge Lawyers in the U.S. is also being adjusted. For certain highly compensated Counsel and Specialists, the reduction will be 15% – an effective reduction of 8.75% for the year. For everyone else in these categories, the reduction will be 10% from 1 June onward – effectively 6% for the year. In addition, the firm will be reducing the compensation of Senior Counsel by 15%. There will be no reductions for those (including Senior Counsel) whose base compensation is $100,000 or lower.

Decisions on U.S. attorney bonuses will be made in the normal course at the end of the year.

HoLove CEO Stephen Immelt had this to say about the firm’s austerity measures and overall financial outlook:

“The firm’s overall position is very solid. We continue to see an uptick of work in the technology and life sciences sectors, our restructuring practice is very active, and we have successfully advised on headline-grabbing M&A deals. However, we are facing an uncertain environment and economic activity globally continues to drag. Complacency is not an option for us. We are therefore continuing with our policy of cutting back all non-essential costs and making measured adjustments to compensation. Our approach is to share the burden to protect both the business and our people so that we are well-positioned to meet our clients’ needs when the economy bounces back. We can always revisit and unwind some of these measures if the economy rebounds faster than expected, but otherwise, we plan to revisit these measures by the end of the year.”

# Biglaw COVID Appreciation Bonuses Come To The West Coast
## Another firm giving out generous appreciation bonuses!

The excitement over COVID appreciation bonuses is just getting started!

Cooley got the [COVID appreciation bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cooley-bonuses/) ball rolling earlier this week. But[ Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/) did not come to play, and they wowed with more money and [others](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/milbank-bonuses/) have matched that more[ generous scale. ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/another-elite-firm-affirms-their-commitment-to-the-top-of-the-bonus-scale/)

It remains to be seen exactly which firms will pony up the cash to meet the top of the market, but we have at least a partial answer: Irell is in. The West Coast firm announced last night that they would be offering associates a special bonus, between $7,500 and $40,000, depending on class year. They’re payable September 30, and yes, they are in addition to, not instead of, any end-of-year bonus.

# Former Biglaw Partner Gets 18 Months In Prison For His Work With Pharma Bro Martin Shkreli

Evan Greebel and Martin Shkreli

On Friday, Eastern District of New York District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto sentenced Evan Greebel, former partner at Katten Muchin Rosenman and Kaye Scholer, to 18 months in prison for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud. [Greebel’s conviction](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/former-biglaw-partner-faces-up-to-20-years-in-prison-for-fraudulent-scheme/) stems from his representation of Retrophin (during his tenure at Katten Muchin), the pharmaceutical company led by the infamous Martin Shkreli.

Prosecutors alleged Greebel assisted Shkreli in using Retrophin’s assets to pay investors in unrelated hedge funds run by Shkreli through the use of phony settlement and consulting agreements and fraudulently backdating agreements. During the trial, Greebel [attempted to lay the blame](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/ex-biglaw-partner-and-former-client-go-at-it-in-criminal-case/) for the shady financial deals at Shkreli’s feet, but that strategy failed.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Prior to sentencing, prosecutors asked the judge to sentence Greebel to five years, while the defense argued no jail time was appropriate. Greebel, who [was arrested in December of 2015](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/pharma-karma-martin-shkreli-and-biglaw-partner-arrested/), argued the tatters of his Biglaw career were sufficient punishment for his role in the financial misdealings, and the defense [pulled in legal heavyweights](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/biglaw-circles-the-wagons-say-one-of-their-own-doesnt-deserve-jail-time-despite-felony-conviction/) to make their case for leniency.

However, as Law.com [reports](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2018/08/17/ex-big-law-partner-gets-18-months-in-prison-for-stock-fraud-scheme/), Judge Matsumoto was unmoved by those pleas:

“He is not reckless, he was not naive, he was not inexperienced,” Matsumoto said. “He was not led astray by a young, brash CEO.”

Greebel was sentenced to 18 months for each felony conviction, to run concurrently, and was ordered to pay more than $10.4 million in restitution and forfeit $116,462.

During the hearing, Greebel was reportedly stoic and read a brief statement:

He was mostly expressionless during the hearing and looking at the table in front of him, though while reading a brief written statement to the court prior to the sentence, he removed his glasses and wiped his eyes.

“I will regret every day of my life, the day I met Martin Shkreli,” he said.

For his role in the scheme, Shkreli was sentenced to [seven years in prison](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/09/business/martin-shkreli-sentenced.html), which is a good deal harsher than his lawyer’s jail time.

# Biglaw Firm Hires Outside Counsel To Review Response To Associate's Sexual Assault Claim
## This is one of the first law firms to be publicly caught up in the #MeToo movement.

Baker McKenzie, a firm that was launched into turmoil when word got out that a now former partner had been sanctioned, but not fired, following an investigation into his [alleged sexual assault of an associate](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/biglaw-firm-admits-to-sanctioning-partner-after-sexual-harassment-investigation/), has hired Simmons & Simmons, an international firm, to review Baker’s response to those allegations.

As [previously reported](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/biglaw-firm-under-investigation-for-failing-to-disclose-partners-alleged-sexual-assault-to-regulators/), Baker McKenzie is now under preliminary investigation by the Solicitors Regulation Authority to assess whether the firm’s actions in this case amounted to professional misconduct.

About two weeks ago, a representative from the firm [issued an apology](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/biglaw-firm-under-investigation-for-failing-to-disclose-partners-alleged-sexual-assault-to-regulators/?rf=1), saying, “We are really sorry this incident ever happened and we acknowledge we should have handled it better.” Now that an outside legal team from Simmons & Simmons is on the case, we suppose we’ll be able to see just how much better the incident should have been handled. A spokesperson released this statement announcing the review:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Baker McKenzie has appointed Simmons & Simmons to conduct an independent review of this incident and how it was subsequently handled. The review will also look at and review all our complaints policies and procedures to ensure our employees are protected and have a voice. We will follow the recommendations of the review and will take all appropriate action. As a firm, our values of inclusion and diversity are extremely important to us and we are committed to ensuring the welfare of all employees.

Perhaps Baker McKenzie should have gone about protecting its employees and ensuring their welfare prior to becoming the first law firm to be the subject of a global expose on the #MeToo movement — or perhaps that would’ve been too much to ask.

# A Wachtell Lipton Lawyer Who Speaks His Mind

George would be spectacularly qualified to give legal advice to just about anyone on any topic…. My neighbor has a poodle smarter than some of the people on Trump’s legal team.

— Professor [Joseph Grundfest](https://law.stanford.edu/directory/joseph-a-grundfest/) of Stanford Law School, quoted in a [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/06/us/politics/george-conway-trump.html) about the [Twitter activity](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/george-conway-makes-strong-case-for-mansplaining/) of George Conway, prominent Wachtell Lipton lawyer and husband of Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump (who sometimes receives criticism in George Conway’s tweets). Although Conway is primarily a commercial rather than white-collar litigator, Professor Grundfest still trusts Conway more than many of the lawyers to the president.

# Lawyers Can Make Mistakes When Business Is Slow
## When an attorney does not have enough billable work to complete, they may rely on their existing clients more than usual to find tasks to fill their days.

Solo practitioners and small firm lawyers have much flexibility over how they approach legal practice. Indeed, small firm attorneys are often much more open with the matters they can handle and the types of fees they can charge since these lawyers do not need to report to many other attorneys (if any) and said lawyers often do not need to worry about conflicts of interest or other issues impacting a firm’s ability to take on a case. However, small firm lawyers often have more difficulty maintaining a steady workflow since they often have fewer institutional clients who can provide steady work. This can lead to some negative outcomes, and lawyers should keep the big picture in mind when they decide to take on new business during slow times.

Many small firm lawyers are not paid a set salary for the legal work they perform. Rather, they usually operate in an “eat what you kill system” by which a substantial part of their income, if not their entire income, comes from work that they help originate or tasks that they perform. During slow times, it can be difficult for small firm lawyers to earn enough money to pay for firm expenses on top of the living costs that all of us need to pay. This can make it much more likely that attorneys will take cases that they would not consider if they were completely busy with work.

For instance, I was talking to a lawyer friend of mine not too long ago who was having a difficult time generating work. This lawyer decided to take on a number of contingency fee cases in a specific area of the law. The lawyer reasoned that since the cases were all relatively similar, he could manage the cases without too much effort, and since there was a high volume of the cases, once a few of them started resolving, he would eventually have a consistent revenue stream. A lawyer who was busy with work likely would not have taken these types of cases with such a contingency arrangement, but my friend had nothing else to work on so he reasoned that this strategy was better than nothing.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
However, my friend originated a lot of these types of cases all at once, so it took a long time for any of these cases to begin settling. All the while, my friend needed to front his own money to pay litigation expenses for the matters, and the costs added up. In addition, my friend ended up needing to spend much more time than he ever imagined, and all of these matters he originated took time away from hourly or other work he could have handled. The situation got to a point where my friend needed to abandon his practice and accept an associate position since he was not making enough money to float his living expenses. However, my friend had a difficult time handing his files off to other lawyers, even though my friend had nursed the files along for years, and this made it more difficult for him to accept an associate position. If my friend had been busier, he likely would not have accepted these matters since there were objective reasons to be cautious about handling such work that was put aside since my friend needed some kind of work with which to keep busy.

Lawyers can also put relationships with their existing clients in jeopardy if they are making decisions because they are slow on work. When an attorney does not have enough billable work to complete, they may rely on their existing clients more than usual to find tasks to fill their days. Moreover, lawyers are more likely to suggest that their clients approve the lawyer to file motions or take certain types of discovery that may not be needed because they lawyer wants more tasks to complete.

I once worked for a large law firm at which all of the associates had a difficult billable hour requirement. The firm fell on hard times and many associates had difficulty billing enough hours to meet the billable hourly requirement. Many of the lawyers accordingly made hay out of the existing clients we already had by working on tasks that were less necessary to the completion of the representation and suggesting that our clients take action that might not have been needed, but which would lead to more work. The situation got so bad that partners at an office-wide meeting told everyone that people should not heavily rely on existing clients to fill the work gap since this could strain relationships with existing clients and add to financial issues at a firm.

All told, lawyers can approach legal work differently depending on whether they are busy with work or whether they have little to do. Attorneys should keep the big picture in mind so they do not make mistakes when business is slow.

Time continues to be up for alleged serial predator and former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. The onetime mogul’s fall from grace has been anything but pretty, and now he’s facing a lawsuit filed this week by Biglaw firm Gibson Dunn on behalf of their client, Ashley Judd.

In the suit, Judd alleges that after she rebuffed his advances at a breakfast meeting in the 90s, Weinstein smeared the actress’s name across Hollywood. Specifically, when Judd was up for a role in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the complaint alleges Weinstein told director Peter Jackson she was a “nightmare” and working with Judd should be avoided “at all costs.” The complaint focuses on the impact this had on Judd’s career:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“With those baseless smears, Weinstein succeeded in blacklisting Ms. Judd and destroying her ability to work on what became a multibillion-dollar franchise with 17 Academy Award wins and many more nominations… Weinstein’s wrongful and outrageous conduct has not just deprived Ms. Judd of the specific opportunity to play a prominent role in a blockbuster film trilogy; it has had a long-lasting ripple effect on the trajectory of her whole career.”

The complaint contains claims of defamation, sexual harassment, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and violation of California’s Unfair Competition Law.

As [reported](https://www.law.com/2018/04/30/gibson-dunn-boutrous-sue-harvey-weinstein-on-behalf-of-ashley-judd/) by Law.com, Gibson partner Ted Boutrous said of the lawsuit:

“Our aim in bringing this suit is to hold Mr. Weinstein accountable for his retaliation against Ms. Judd, defamation of her business reputation, and interference with her career, and to shine a light on the broader economic damages caused when individuals in positions of authority attempt to punish those who have resisted their improper advances.”

# Associate Bonus Watch: A Giant Law Firm Exceeds Its Associates' Expectations
## Law firm bonus news may be slowing down, but one big player just announced.

DLA Piper sent out its bonus and compensation memos Wednesday night, finally taking one of the last big players off the “still waiting on bonuses” board here at ATL HQ.[[1]](#f1) The third highest grossing firm in last year’s Am Law rankings — and the [third best Biglaw brand](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/the-best-law-firms-in-america-according-to-in-house-counsel/) according to in-house counsel — doesn’t announce their scale, but initial reports suggest the firm met or exceeded the established market bonus for the vast majority of associates.

One Chicago associate explained:

Everyone I’ve talked to in Chicago got at least a market match (if they hit 2,000); many did a little better (if they were over 2,150). No idea what the other offices were like.

We don’t get a bonus scale in the email, but it did say that “the vast majority of our high performing associates will receive bonuses at or above the widely published ‘market’ scale.”

This is a big deal because DLA Piper hasn’t been known for their overwhelming generosity in the past:

It’s been the common understanding among associates that DLA pays bonuses that are sub-market (unless you bill an extraordinary number of hours). Not so this year — they really stepped it up, and it seems from discussions with others that their bonuses are at or above market for everyone in all offices. So long as you hit your 2000 hours (which counts all pro bono), they paid out. Associates are universally pleased, and a bit shocked. Kudos to DLA for stepping it up this year… associates who were going to shop around are starting to think twice.

Bonuses will be paid next Friday. That should help all these associates continue to [bankroll Hillary Clinton’s campaign](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/biglaw-firm-going-viral-for-its-political-leanings/).

And if there’s any DLA Piper associate [named Maddi](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/hillary-clinton/12150600/ImNotKiddingMaddi-trends-after-Hillary-Clinton-sends-email-asking-for-a-dollar-after-New-Hampshire-vote.html), Hillary expects to hear from you right now.

# West Coast Biglaw Firm Joins Milbank Scale

A PR person from a firm here on the East Coast complained to me recently that I don’t refer to international law firms with regional terms other than that one, which is absurd, but here we are.

Irell is not that firm because Irell knows enough about recruiting to say that the West Coast can’t wait…even if it keeps ATL editors up after happy hour.



The Milbank Mo has hit the West Coast.

When will the rest of NYC respond…or top it?

# Top 30 Biglaw Firm Raises Associate Salaries For The Second Time This Week
## Happy news for associates, once again!

Look what we have here. The prevailing Biglaw salary scale changed so quickly this time around that we’ve got a firm announcing an additional raise for associates just three days after it announced its last one.

We’re speaking about Paul Hastings, of course, a firm that’s ranked at No. 27 in the most recent Am Law 100 after bringing home $1,310,126,000 gross revenue in 2020. The firm announced a [Davis Polk match on Monday](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/paul-hastings-raises/), and here they are on Thursday with a Cravath match.

This is what the new salary scale looks like at the firm:

Associate Salary Scale

Class Year

Salary

2014+

$415,000

2015

$400,000

2016

$370,000

2017

$345,000

2018

$295,000

2019

$250,000

2020

$225,000

2021

$215,000

The firm’s salary increases apply to their U.S. and São Paulo offices. They’re retroactive to January 31, and associates will see their new compensation in their March 11 paychecks. Congratulations for the second time this week!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Paul Hastings.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Sometimes It's Better To Be Fired Instead Of Stealth Laid Off
## Believe it or not, there are sometimes many financial benefits to being fired in the traditional sense at some firms.

This website has previously discussed the phenomenon of “stealth layoffs” within the legal community.  For those of you who do not follow Above the Law as closely as I have for the past decade, a stealth layoff is when a firm wants to get rid of an attorney, but they do not fire them in the traditional sense.  Rather, they tell the attorney that their days are numbered and then give the attorney some time (usually several months) to find a new job.  The firm typically provides the attorney ample leeway to go to job interviews, and supervisors usually do not tell prospective employers about the nature of the attorney’s departure.

Sometimes, attorneys subject to stealth layoffs do not find jobs so quickly and need to be terminated in the traditional way.  However, many times attorneys are able to secure employment without being fired, and both parties gain something from the arrangement.  The attorney gets to secure other employment and not blemish their career with the embarrassment and negativity associated with being terminated.  The firm also gets to maintain its reputation, and usually does not need to provide severance payments to the departing attorney.  However, there are certain situations in which it is actually better to get fired than to be stealth laid off from a firm.

Believe it or not, there are sometimes many financial benefits to being fired in the traditional sense at some firms.  Most Biglaw shops pay sizable amounts in severance to departing attorneys, in part to help attorneys during their career transition, [and mostly to decrease their legal exposure in case an attorney wants to sue the firm](https://www.rothmanlawyer.com/limitations-on-the-right-to-fire-employees/).  Although the amount of severance varies from firm to firm, many Biglaw shops typically provide three to six months of salary as severance, and this can be a substantial amount of money.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
If attorneys are able to find a job shortly after being laid off from a shop that offers this type of severance, they can devote their severance to purposes other than merely paying for living expenses.  This is especially true if you work in a state that pays unemployment benefits even if someone is receiving severance.  Indeed, if someone gets a job quickly, and devotes the lion’s share of their severance payments to student debt repayment, they could effectively pay off a sizable amount of their student loans.  If the job market is strong, and it is easier to find a new job, the severance offered by many firms can offer a substantial windfall that is often not obtainable by being stealth laid off.

In addition, being stealth laid off can be a worse experience than being laid off in the traditional sense.  I have never been stealth laid off myself, but I have some friends who have, and they have told me how negative the experience can be.  One colleague of mine described feeling like “the walking dead” around the office as a result of being stealth laid off.  Going to work is a rough experience for these folks, since it can be embarrassing and frustrating to interact with colleagues responsible for the stealth layoff.  In addition, setting a discrete time by which an attorney needs to find a new job can create an impending sense of doom.

Of course, being laid off in the traditional sense is no picnic.  Indeed, not having something to do with your time while searching for new work can be a lonely and depressing experience.  I am sure many of us (especially veterans of the Great Recession) know someone who has struggled with the tribulations of being laid off from a firm.

However, as previously mentioned, most attorneys in Biglaw receive considerable severance after being terminated.  In addition, being laid off in the traditional sense means that an attorney can use their time however they wish.  I am sure that everyone has heard the term “funemployment” at some point or another, and being laid off in the traditional sense, with an income stream from severance, can be a positive experience.  I personally know people who have traveled, pursued passions, and made other positive uses of their time after being laid off from firms.  Again, this experience varies greatly from person to person, but being stealth laid off typically binds an attorney to continue billing for a firm, whereas being terminated outright allows attorneys more time to do as they please.

Furthermore, being stealth laid off sometimes does not guarantee that an attorney will have an easier time finding employment than if they are terminated outright.  If someone is laid off in a mass reduction in force (of the type covered many times on this website), people might understand that attorneys were let go not for performance issues, but because of financial troubles.  However, if a firm lets people go through stealth layoffs, and prospective employers discern this fact, then it appears as if the attorney was terminated because of poor work performance.  People within the legal industry are fully familiar with stealth layoffs, and if hiring partners catch wind of someone being stealth laid off, this might put that attorney at a greater disadvantage than someone who is subject to a larger, public reduction in force.

In the end, stealth layoffs are common within the legal industry, and it is typically understood that this process offers benefits to both attorneys and firms alike.  However, under certain circumstances, it is actually better to be terminated outright than subject to a stealth layoff.

# Biglaw Firm Announces 50 Percent Remote Work Policy For Associates
## Policies like these were unheard of before the COVID crush.

The legal profession is usually extremely slow when it comes to the adoption of new technologies — or new anything, for that matter — but the coronavirus crisis has forced everyone to accept the way of the future much more quickly than expected. Remote work has been going smashingly well, prompting some firms to give up real estate and encourage [office sharing between partners and associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/biglaw-firm-tells-partners-to-share-their-offices-with-associates/). Other firms are rolling out new remote work policies for all employees that would allow them to work from home up to 50 percent of the time.

Remember when working remotely was frowned upon in Biglaw? Not any more. Linklaters has announced a global “agile working policy” that will allow all of its employees to work remotely 20 to 50 percent of the time, as long as their team members know their plans in advance.

“The COVID-19 pandemic and our enforced remote working experiment has given us an opportunity to take stock and revisit how we approach agile and remote working,” Andrea Arosio, managing partner of Linklaters in Italy and member of Linklaters’ Global People Committee, said in a statement. “Our recent experience has demonstrated that, whilst we are a people-focused business and collaboration is key, remote working has worked remarkably well and we can deliver high-quality work whilst working remotely.”

Perhaps you’re tired of your COVID quarantine. Under the new Linklaters policy, no one will be forced to work from home if they don’t want to. The firm is also open to exploring other options, like flexible start and end times and otherwise modified hours. “Being agile is essential to our business, meeting the needs of our people and our clients,” Arosio said. “We are committed to fostering our agile culture which encourages our people to develop working arrangements which suit their needs along with those of the firm and our clients.”

Is something like this going on at your firm? Please get in touch with us via email or text — [tips@abovethelaw.com](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com) or (646) 820-8477) — and let us know. This could be a brand new Biglaw trend in the making.

# Disbarred Former Biglaw General Counsel Pleads Guilty
## He faces up to five years in prison.

The Biglaw firm of LeClairRyan may be gone (the partners voted to [dissolve the firm in 2019](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/biglaw-firm-finally-admits-its-closing/)), but that doesn’t mean there’s nothing noteworthy going on with them. The firm’s former general counsel, Bruce Matson, was [disbarred](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/former-biglaw-general-counsel-disbarred-amid-allegations-he-misappropriated-2-5-million/) last year after allegations that he misappropriated $2.5 million in funds. And now he’s pleaded guilty to obstructing an investigation.

[Matson](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/bruce-matson/) had previously served as trustee for the bankruptcy of LandAmerica Financial Group (LFG), and when the Chapter 11 closed in 2015, he was selected as the court-appointed trust fiduciary to oversee the wind-down. As part of those responsibilities, he was prohibited from making any distributions to himself until 2021, when the wind-down would be complete. Matson admitted to transferring $1 million to himself, $1.5 million to attorney Robert Smith, and an additional $341,000 to an escrow account in his name — described as “discretionary bonuses.”

Last week, Matson [pleaded guilty](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/pr/former-richmond-attorney-pleads-guilty-obstructing-investigation-bankruptcy) to obstruction of an official proceeding for lying during the investigation into his misconduct as bankruptcy trustee. Prosecutors also say they uncovered a separate, unrelated instance of embezzlement during their investigation.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“Matson abused his position as an attorney, officer of the court, and bankruptcy trustee to enrich himself at the expense of the people whose very interest the court appointed him to protect,” said Raj Parekh, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. “As part of our unwavering commitment to pursuing equal justice under the law, we will continue to root out the fraudulent conduct of those who violate the public’s trust and use their positions of power to conceal their crimes.”

[It doesn’t look like](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/former-leclairryan-general-counsel-pleads-guilty-to-obstructing-probe-of-financial-misconduct) he’ll get off with a mere slap on the wrist either:

U.S. District Judge John A. Gibney Jr. of the Eastern District of Virginia said during the plea hearing Thursday the misconduct alleged in the statement of facts shows “a long history of malfeasance,” according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. Gibney warned Matson that “it is very, very likely in this case that you will go to jail for a while.”

Matson faces a maximum of five years in prison and will be sentenced on November 22nd.

# Associate Bonus Watch: Norton Rose's New Compensation Scheme Smells Sweet To Associates
## In response to critical coverage of its comp system earlier this year, Norton Rose raised associate base salaries and bonuses earlier this month.

Earlier this year, we heard from associates at [Norton Rose Fulbright](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/norton-rose-fulbright/) who were unhappy with their compensation. As one of them put it, “Many associates at NRF were okay with [our weak] bonuses through the recession, but now people are getting increasingly pissed off. We are not even in the same ballpark as our peers, and it is really hurting morale.”

Today we’re happy to report that Norton Rose Fulbright heard these complaints and acted upon them. We couldn’t get our hands on a memo or other documentation — if you can help us out, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Norton%20Rose%20Fulbright%20bonus%20memo) (subject line: “Norton Rose Fulbright bonus memo”) — but here’s our understanding of the firm’s new compensation system for U.S. associates, announced earlier this month:

1. Base salaries have been raised to market levels — $160K, $170K, $185K, etc. — in all major U.S. markets.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
2. The complicated and confusing “roll in” or “true up” system that applied in some offices, in which an associate’s salary would be brought up to market for hitting a certain number of hours, is no longer in effect.

(As one source explained, “Previously, in certain offices, salaries starting second year were below market unless the associate hit 2000 hours, at which point a ‘bonus’ would be rolled into her salary for the following year. The higher salary would last for three years after an associate hit the 2000-hour mark in any year, so it was possible for an associate to see a pretty serious pay cut in her fourth, fifth, or sixth years if she went three consecutive years without hitting it. Additional lump sum bonuses were achievable but modest. The prevailing attitude was that it was not worth going past 2000 hours.”)

3. Bonus eligibility begins at 2000 hours (including 100 hours of pro bono). The lowest-tier bonuses are below the New York City market levels, but still represent “a substantial increase from the previous amounts.”

4. “Market” bonuses kick in around the 2300-hour mark. (Note the use of the word “around” — we don’t have the full scale, and our sources disagree a bit on this — some say the 2300-hour bonuses are above market.)

5. The new compensation scheme is already in effect (effective May 1).

Norton Rose Fulbright is the world’s [fifth-largest firm by headcount](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/the-global-100-the-worlds-top-law-firms-ranked-by-revenue-profit-and-headcount/2/), so this news will affect a significant number of associates.

We reached out to Norton Rose Fulbright. The firm declined to provide details (or to confirm the ones that we presented to it), but it did acknowledge making changes to its comp system. Here’s the statement issued by U.S. managing partner [Linda Addison](http://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/people/90633/lindaladdison):

Norton Rose Fulbright is committed to remaining a law firm of choice for top talent. We attract, develop, promote and retain our people strategically. Our associates contribute to the success of our firm and our clients, and we want to reward their efforts in alignment with our strategic goals. Our new compensation system, announced earlier this month, has been enthusiastically received by our associates and senior associates.

That seems to be accurate, at least based on the sources we’ve heard from. As one tipster told us, “It probably goes without saying that there is a lot of positive buzz.” Said a second source:

Management did announce a completely new bonus structure, and from what I can tell people are pretty happy with it. I certainly am. It is still below the normal New York market amounts, but it is a big improvement.

I don’t think this would have happened without [your coverage](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/associate-bonus-watch-earth-to-partners-the-recession-is-over/), so I and many others are very grateful!

We’re happy to help. If you have a comment or complaint about compensation at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus%20News) or text us (646-820-8477), and we’ll see what we can do.

UPDATE (6:05 p.m.): Here’s additional information from a lawyer at NRF:

I can confirm that there was no memo or other documentation relating to the new bonus stricture that was circulated. There was a PowerPoint that was presented to all the offices via video conference but copies were not distributed to associates….

I can confirm… that the bonuses at 2300 are market (15, 25, 50, 65, 80, 90, 100, 100). The bonus at 2000 is exactly half of those numbers (7.5, 12.5, 25, 32.5, 40, 45, 50, 50). In addition, at both the 2000- and 2300-hour levels, you are also eligible for a discretionary bonus. It is unclear how this is calculated or determined, though. So if you hit 2300 you could potentially receive an above-market bonus (market plus the discretionary, if any).

# Biglaw Firm Finally Reveals Compensation For Midlevel And Senior Associates -- And They Are Pissed
## Associates are pissed about the newly announced compensation scale.

When[ last we checked in](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-firm-does-right-by-junior-associates-mid-levels-and-senior-associates-not-so-much/) with Reed Smith, first- and second-year associates had gotten raises, but there was no official word on the fate of midlevel and senior associates. But folks there weren’t optimistic.

The general feeling was that RS would use this opacity to compress the salaries of older associates who would wind up with below-market salaries, despite the the newbies getting the attention-grabbing market rate. And people were pissed:

Second time in two years these offices have backhanded their senior and midlevel associates in exchange for their years of hard work — and given the people doing their cite-checks an unearned windfall.

And now the other shoe has fallen.

Reed Smith had an associates’ meeting yesterday, and insiders report they kept the associates in the meeting room for over an hour, and dropped the compensation bomb in the last five minutes. A tipster reports:

Everyone was groaning and rolling their eyes (in front of the summers) at this point.

And the news wasn’t great:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As per the associate meeting, the new salary ranges for “big markets” incl NY, CA, Houston (HOUSTON?) are:
First Year 180
Second Year 190
Third Year Midlevel 190+
Midlevel 200-260
Senior 225-300+

Ranges are never good, since there is no downside to having a high side of the range that few, if any, actually receive. This is all part of a [savvy play](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/no-you-are-not-matching-the-market-1st-years-to-180k-doesnt-tell-the-whole-story/) to make it seem like you are paying market rate when, for the majority of associates, you are not.

So, taking a closer look at the ranges the firm revealed, it is clear only first- and second-year associates are protected by the changes to the compensation structure. Third-years won’t make less than second-years, which… maybe [counts as a win?](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/am-law-100-firm-raises-salaries-kind-of/) Perhaps having a floor is reassuring, but third-years at rival firms know they’ll be pulling in more. And telling senior associates that their minimum is $225,000 is the opposite of reassuring — let’s not forgot fifth-year associates on the Cravath scale are pulling down $260,000. And then there’s that giant, $35,000 overlap between the top of the midlevel compensation range and bottom of the senior range, so the firm can promote you to “senior” but not have to pay you any more money. Nifty trick, and one that tipsters say the firm has used in the past.

Reed Smith also tried to sell associates on the notion that “merit-based compensation” is really where it’s at, but associates weren’t buying:

Head of associates’ compensation, Mike Lynch, gets up and stammers all over himself about how we aren’t lockstep and we believe in “merit-based compensation,” which works great when you’re a firm that pays above market to people but not when your justification is that “we have senior associates who are 10+ years in practice” and the top of your range is “$300k+”

What does merit-based compensation mean?

The firm will continue to use the compensation system to deny raises to people for arbitrary reasons (written off hours; transferring hours to partners; clients who don’t pay – yes, this is blamed on associates).

Apparently Lynch also told associates they’re going to have to “work harder” for their raises, thought exactly what that means was left ill-defined. The firm has a 1950-hour requirement, which, as of yet, hasn’t changed, but associates are left with little direction as to what it will take to actually make market-level salaries.

Though most of the market has been making the new and improved salary scale for nearly a month now, the compensation discussion has hardly ended at Reed Smith. The firm is scheduling additional meetings with compensation committee members, but if they are hoping to actually pay market rates (though it sure doesn’t seem like they want to), they’d best act fast; recruiting season is almost here.

But for those already at RS, morale is low and getting lower. Talk of “walking out” and meetings with recruiters are apparently swirling through the halls. Unsurprising when associates feel undercompensated for the work that they do.

# Cleary Makes A Move In The Fall 2020 Bonus Wars
## And associates don't think it was the right move to make.

Just when we thought that all was lost for the fall bonus wars, with firm after firm refusing to offer additional monetary support to their associates through these tough times because [it was apparently a “bad look,”](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/whats-the-real-reason-biglaw-firms-are-begging-off-fall-bonuses/) Willkie entered the scene with the mic drop of a [Davis Polk match](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/willkie-announces-fall-bonuses-blowing-off-cravath-followers/). Would other firms dare to get back on board the bonus train and renew associates’ hopes?

Nah.

Willkie dropped its exciting news at around noon on Friday, and later that afternoon, Cleary stepped in it by announcing that there would be no early bonuses for associates. Here’s the memo that was sent via email:

Here are some of the immediate reactions we received from associates at the firm:

Cleary with the dick punch. Not surprising at this point.

General mid-level and senior consensus is that they’re unhappy but they knew it was coming given the silence. Email sent on a Friday afternoon and is so brief. It doesn’t even acknowledge the challenges of the pandemic or make clear that the firm will take these special bonuses into account for the year-end bonuses. Also LOL @ “we remain committed to paying competitive compensation, including bonuses.” If that was the case, we’d be getting this special bonus.

# Wisconsin AG Loses It When Former Biglaw Associate Accused Of Rape Gets An Award

There’s been so much progress in recent years to foster a criminal justice system that welcomes sexual assault survivors and other crime victims… This is a terrible lapse in judgment, and Mr. Addison’s nomination should be pulled. He does not deserve to have his name listed alongside the 15 other distinguished attorneys and judges nominated this year.

—Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel [in a statement ](http://www.doj.state.wi.us/sites/default/files/news-media/4.18.18_State_Bar_0.pdf)recommending [Stephan Addison](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/08/suspensions-for-ex-biglaw-bad-boys-accused-of-sexual-assault/) be stripped of his nomination for the Jack DeWitt WisLAP Volunteer Award, which recognizes contributions to the Wisconsin Lawyers Assistance Program. In 2005 Addison, a Seyfarth Shaw associate at the time, was[ accused of sexually assaulting a woman on vacation](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/01/biglaw-boys-up-to-no-good/), and later pleaded no contest to a felony charge of second-degree reckless endangerment and to two misdemeanor counts of sexual gratification. Paul Swanson, president of the State Bar of Wisconsin, said he’d recommend the nomination be rescinded, and [according to Law.com](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/04/20/wisconsin-ag-slams-award-given-to-ex-seyfarth-shaw-associate/), mention of Addison’s nomination has been scrubbed from the Wisconsin Bar’s website.

# Allegations Of Harassment By A Partner Surround Associate's Departure From Proskauer

According to [a report from Roll on Friday](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-proskauer-rose-associate-quits-alleging-harassment-partner), an associate in the London office of Proskauer Rose has left the firm after experiencing harassment at the hands of a partner. Indeed, they report the “associate was ‘harassed’ by the partner until she quit.” The harassed associate has reportedly found a job at another law firm.

Though the exact nature of the allegations remains unknown, we do know that last week the managing partner of the London office, Mary Kuusisto, was joined by the firm’s compliance officer to have what’s being described as “an unusual ‘townhall’ meeting.” At the meeting employees were told about the harassment allegations, though the identity of the partner involved was not revealed. According to sources, the message from the town hall was to “remind[] everyone to act appropriately” and “to remember their obligations.” Which is British for, “stop with the harassment, y’all.”

In a statement given to Roll on Friday, the firm provided platitudes and assurances about their protocols:

“Proskauer does not tolerate disrespectful or inappropriate behaviour and holds everyone in our Firm to the highest standards of conduct”, the firm said in a statement.

“We encourage anyone to report behaviour that they believe violates Proskauer’s policies and provide confidential avenues to do so. We follow strict protocols to investigate complaints. Proskauer remains committed to ensuring everyone in our Firm is treated with respect and dignity.”

Of course, these words may not do a lot of good to the associate who has allegedly already changed her career path because of a partner’s actions.

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

According to data collected in [Leopard Solutions](https://www.leopardsolutions.com/)‘ State of the Legal Industry 2020 report, what percentage of the top 200 law firms saw a decline in the number of lateral partners hired in 2020 compared with 2019?

Hint: Leopard reports only 28 percent hired more partners in 2020 compared with 2019 (the balance hired lateral parters at the same rate as the previous year).

# Jean-Jacques Rousseau And The Law Firm Of The Future

One of the most wonderful books I have read is “The Social Contract” by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. I have found his book extraordinarily valuable.

Rousseau’s concept is that each person is theoretically loose in the wild.  A premise I am defining as a Wilderness Person. Wilderness Persons can do anything they would like to do. They can kill another person, for food or pretty much any reason. It is the law of the jungle and the stronger person survives at the expense of the weaker one.

To achieve a higher standard of existence, a group of persons can come together to form an association — i.e., a State — under which each person gives up 100% of their rights to the State and in return gains the benefits when everyone else also gives up their rights to the State. This is the essence of Rousseau’s social contract.  The remainder of his treatise is how the state should be formed and governed (i.e., he delves into an analysis of the meaning of the social contract, which, the more you delve, the trickier it becomes).

As I read his book, it hit me pretty strongly that the same parameters and thinking apply to law firms.

In theory, we are all out there at some point roaming the legal plains. Of course we could be solo practitioners. In that role, we could be honest or sleazy. We could do good work or sloppy work. We could treat our clients wonderfully or do the opposite. We would not have to worry about treating our colleagues with respect or care about them at all since we would have no colleagues.

Wouldn’t that be wonderful to have no cares or worries, except for the minor things like getting clients and the vexation of having to do every single administrative thing yourself? So as you think about it more, you might realize that maybe it isn’t as wonderful as you thought, and you might consider the benefits of joining a team.

As an aside, I want to be clear I am not prejudiced in the slightest against solo practitioners, so please don’t take this article with that concern. It is a completely worthy way to practice; however, my column is about the law firm of the future, so let me continue.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
So there we are — we lawyers out roaming the legal plains — and the question for us is do we wish to give up all of our rights to do whatever we please — yes, just about all of them — in order to be part of a law firm and obey all the firm’s rules and regulations and policies?

There are many reasons why this might be a good idea, a few of which are:

- It is safer as we have partners, associates, and administrative staff as colleagues as opposed to being totally on our own.
- Typically, there is more money here since clients will pay a lot more to a law firm with its stability and diverse practice areas. Indeed perhaps a lot more money.
- Administrative work would be handled by someone else, and you could just practice law.
Of course, you give up your freedom in return for these benefits. You are no longer able to do as you please. Even picking a new client is subject to the firm’s policies and procedures. You have to be nice to your colleagues, even when you are in a bad mood. You are no longer your own person — you are part of the group of lawyers now.

Ultimately, just like in Rousseau’s state, you are making a contract — a social contract — with the law firm — that in return for giving up your rights, you get much more from the whole.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
This line of philosophical thought takes us to evaluate the following considerations:

First — if you are anyone other than management of the law firm, consider whether your social contract has resulted in your getting the deal you want from the law firm.  You gave up all of your rights as a lawyer to join a community of lawyers. You made a social contract with the firm. So is the firm giving you back enough to you in return for what you gave up? And I am not just talking about management — are your colleagues doing that too? Hearkening to my prior article [Is there a mission that excites you?](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/the-law-firm-of-the-future-what-a-law-firm-should-be-what-is-a-law-firm/)  Is it a good deal?

If not, perhaps it is time to find a better deal, just as the theoretical Wilderness Person I described above could find another state to join.

Second — if you are firm management, you had better think about this too. Are you giving a good deal to those who work at the firm? If not, you have that terrifying risk — that all of your assets go down the elevator every night, and how do you know they will come back in the morning. Maybe, every morning, you should try to sit in the shoes of everyone in your firm and consider if you were those persons would you make the social contract with the firm they have made thus far. If not, you know what you need to do that very day, which is solve that problem.

To punctuate all of this, Rousseau says “that the social state is advantageous to men only when all possess something and none has too much.”

To conclude, the law firm of the future will need deep thinkers — dare I say philosophers — to lead them to where they should be going. Yes, great legal work and good economics will always matter; however, increasingly those will become base expectations for law firm survival.  To outperform, law firm leaders — and followers — will need to think deeply what their (small-sized State) is about and does its underlying social contract work for the various constituents. Rousseau’s “Social Contract” book is a great place to start that kind of thinking.

# Not Surprising, But Still Disappointing: Another Biglaw Firms Denies Associates Fall Bonuses
## Like so many firms, they're waiting until year end for all bonuses.

Biglaw is, by and large, little “c” conservative. And, as far as compensation goes, that usually means following the leader (read: Cravath). Most times that works out well for associates, as Cravath is generally a market leader. But when it comes to COVID-19 fall appreciation bonuses, well, Cravath has taken a [wait-and-see approach](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cravath-is-not-offering-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-pissed/) — despite others like [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/), [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/milbank-bonuses/), and [Sullivan & Cromwell](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/sullivan-cromwell-makes-a-move-in-covid-19-bonus-war/) moving forward. But Cravath is still Cravath, and lots of firms have taken [their lead on fall bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/fried-frank-no-bonuses/?rf=1).

So, it really isn’t a surprise that White & Case has made a statement that there will be no fall bonuses for associates [(available in full on the next page)](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/white-case-no-bonus/2/). But it is still upsetting, as tipsters say:

No fall bonus at W&C. No surprise given the firm is never a leader on comp. If they do eventually give a bonus, I’m sure this will allow them to make it subject to minimum hours (like the usual end of year bonus) and delay paying until February 2021 with the usual bonus.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
This is a gut punch for people in practice groups that are drowning in work right now. I, and many of my colleagues, have already hit (and well exceeded) hours requirements for this year. We were just told that banking, restructuring, and M&A are having banner years.  So essentially all of that cash goes to partners. I’ve spoken with many overworked associates whose motivation is utterly gone now.  I’m not holding my breath that the Firm will make good at time for bonuses early next year.  Truly disappointing.

For what it’s worth, White & Case notes they will be taking the fall bonuses into account when it’s time for year-end bonuses. But it doesn’t sound like associates are holding their breath.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Liability management is continuing with its fast pace from last year. All of that work was driven by market challenges. But in the last month, we saw the first sustained optimistic period in debt in at least 18 months.

Companies that were already over-levered or facing difficulties were already looking at liability management. Now that capital markets have started to open up, we are seeing companies that are doing well seeing the first opportunity to reprice their debt or extend debt maturities in some time.

— [John Sobolewski](https://www.wlrk.com/attorney/jrsobolewski/), a partner in Wachtell’s restructuring and finance practice, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/01/30/deal-watch-debt-offerings-surge-as-markets-begin-to-turn/) concerning the liability management market. As noted by Am Law, last week’s corporate debt offerings added up to about 12, a high mark compared to the weekly count over the course of the past several months. “There will be new issuances and refinancing and repricing types of transactions,” Sobolewski said. “That stays hot as long as the markets stay open.” In addition to Wachtell, other firms active in this area right now include Cleary Gottlieb; Davis Polk; and Skadden.

# Biglaw Attorneys, Staff Expect More Layoffs To Be Announced Before Year End
## Overcapacity and economic turbulence will likely be to blame for these job cuts.

[Layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/layoffs/) plagued certain sectors of Biglaw this summer, with announcements concerning reductions in force coming fast and furious. Some firms were attempting to slim down despite a [slight uptick in demand](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/law-firms-saw-rising-demand-q2-report-says-2023-08-07/) year-over-year, while others decided to defer the start dates of their incoming associate classes to lighten their load when it comes to headcount.

Things seem to have slowed down now, but what does the future hold for associates and staff when it comes to layoffs?

[Law.com](https://www.law.com/2023/09/05/readers-poll-results-lawyers-and-staff-foresee-more-law-firm-layoffs-but-caution-against-overcorrecting/) recently polled associates, partners, and staff on the matter, and it looks like they’re still a little cagey when it comes to job cuts — the prospect of layoffs is still top of mind, and they’re expecting more to happen before the end of the year.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The majority of Law.com’s poll respondents hailed from the biggest of Biglaw firms (63.8%), and when asked if their firms had already conducted layoffs this year, 17% said yes, while 76.6% said no (another 6.4% said they were unsure). But what was to blame for the layoffs at firms that did part ways with attorneys and staff? Here are the details, from Law.com:

Of those who answered “yes,” 40% said the reason given for the layoffs was that their firms had overhired during the pandemic and were now over capacity as demand slowed.

But in open-ended responses, several respondents were skeptical of that notion.

“Firm is saying we have too much headcount, but we all know this is to ensure partner comp remains unaffected,” one respondent said.

Unfortunately, it looks like lawyers and staff members simply aren’t buying the overcapacity song and dance that many firms soft-shoed to this summer while slashing jobs. With that in mind, Law.com’s poll respondents believe more layoffs are headed our way in 2023.

There was strong sentiment among respondents that layoffs among law firms are not done yet this year, with 76.6% saying they anticipate more cuts in 2023, mostly due to economic factors such as high interest rates tamping down demand.

Noting what happened with the tech industry, one Law.com respondent said, “[I]f every firm wants to maintain the profitability or their ranking, the whole industry will need to make layoffs when faced with a slower economy and less transactions.”

If more layoffs are, in fact, coming down the line, let us be the first to say that it’s probably not you — it’s them. We sincerely hope it doesn’t happen, but in case it does, best of luck to those who may be let go from their jobs.

If your firm or organization is reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through deferrals, open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive.

# Are Firms Radically Cutting Back On Summer Programs?
## A tip about summer lunches could portend dark times for summer fun.

Summer programs go through some degree of ebb and flow. A few summers of wild bacchanalia are generally followed by a few more button-down years. There are some good reasons to keep things more reserved — “boozefests” can play to the worst impulses of law firm culture, even if firms are [taking it way too far in response](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-summer-programs-phasing-out-boozefests-to-create-all-new-worse-sexual-harassment-opportunities/). But generally speaking, the health of Biglaw can be traced by its approach to the summer.

When things are looking up, firms spare no expense to match hard work with hard play. The festivities are as much about the firm’s full-timers as they are the summers: it’s the party the attorneys earned over the last year of hard work. When the outlook is more gloomy, summer programs put a cap on things — there’s not much to celebrate and the summers are just happy to be given a shot.

An unconfirmed report suggests that at least one elite law firm is in the latter camp:

[Biglaw Firm] has canceled associate budgets for summer student lunches. Now, the only way an associate can have a paid lunch with a Summer student is if there is a partner present…CHEAP!!

So, the good news for partners is there’s a pretty clear path to earning the eternal loyalty of your favorite associates.

Still, this is a frustrating level of nickel and diming. Firms don’t need to be springing for lavish four-star meals every day, but associates being able to treat summers to a mid-range lunch once or twice a week without breaking the bank. A summer going out every single day amounts to, at worst, an additional 5 percent expenditure over what they’re getting paid already. Considering they’re more likely only going out one or two times, it’s a pittance.

Partners aren’t always free for lunches and, frankly, having “management” at lunches during the recruiting season isn’t necessarily productive. A lot of the value of summer lunches comes in building bonds with soon-to-be peers and having the freedom to ask questions about the firm that one might not be willing to ask with a partner in the room.

After weeks of mulling over the raises [Milbank introduced](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/milbank-raises-associate-salaries-and-announces-year-end-bonuses/) to the market at the beginning of the month, it looks like Biglaw — or at least the top of Biglaw — has coalesced around a new compensation grid. And all it took was [Cravath weighing in](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/cravath-announces-raises-comes-over-the-top-of-milbank-scale-for-some-associates/) (with higher base salaries for midlevel and senior associates).

Cleary Gottlieb, a firm placing 30th on the Am Law 100 with $1,393,989,000 in gross revenue last year, has announced their raises and year-end bonuses. As expected, the Biglaw firm has matched the top of the market in both base compensation and bonuses.

The salary grid at Cleary is as follows:

# 'Legal Tech Lists': 9 Lawyer Misconceptions About Legal Ops
## The latest in our new series detailing what you *really* need to know about the legal tech world.

Editor’s note: This is an installment in the “Reference Manual of Legal Tech Lists,” an eBook set for release this spring. [Read the prior installments here](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/wolters-kluwer-lists/), and feel free to pre-register for your copy of the complete eBook using the form below.

Legal operations has the potential to serve as a powerful tool for problem-solving in a General Counsel’s arsenal, provided that we overcome prevalent false beliefs.

UpLevel Ops created this list of nine widespread misunderstandings GCs have about legal operations.

- Legal operations professionals are ‘just support staff.’ One of the most common misconceptions about legal operations professionals is that they are simply administrative assistants. In reality, legal operations professionals are highly skilled and strategic professionals who work closely with the general counsel to develop and operationalize the legal department’s strategy. They optimize legal department operations, manage legal spend, streamline processes, and implement technology solutions.
- Legal operations professionals are unnecessary for smaller legal departments. Another misconception is that legal operations professionals are only necessary for large legal departments. However, legal operations professionals can help any legal department improve efficiency, reduce costs, and better manage risk.
- Legal operations professionals only focus on technology. While technology is an important aspect of legal operations, legal operations professionals also have expertise in process improvement, project management, data analytics, and vendor management.
- Legal operations professionals are a threat to the traditional legal role. Some may view legal operations professionals as a threat to the traditional legal role. However, legal operations professionals work closely with attorneys and other legal professionals to help them work more efficiently, allowing them to focus on higher-value legal work.
- Legal operations professionals are not needed for regulatory compliance. Legal operations professionals can play a critical role in helping legal departments manage regulatory compliance requirements by implementing effective compliance programs, managing risk, and providing data-driven insights to inform compliance strategies.
- Legal operations leaders should be paid less than attorneys. Legal operations leaders play a critical role in the efficient and effective functioning of a law department, often serving as the backbone of the organization. They are responsible for managing legal processes, implementing technology solutions, and driving innovation, all of which are essential to the department’s success. They possess a deep understanding of the legal industry and highly specialized skills and knowledge. Given their contributions to the organization, it is no longer unusual to see them earning the same amount as the other direct reports to the General Counsel.
- In tough times, it’s a better idea to cut legal operations heads first.  Legal operations professionals will know department and company spend better than anyone else and in more minute detail and can help GCs think holistically through budget and staffing challenges. In tough times, the smart move is to double down on operational projects to drive revenue and company efficiencies.
- Legal operations professionals are just there to service legal department needs. A key part of a successful legal operations role is representing legal in project collaborations with other teams around the organization to drive overall company objectives. Think about it: If Sales and Finance both have operations teams and no legal operations person is at the table, do you think decisions will be made with Legal’s needs considered?
- I don’t know what a legal operations person would do for my team.  If you carefully consider just how much of the work and how many different types of work are needed to run a successful legal department, you have your answer. Much of this work does not fall within the practice of law — for example, budget planning and management, outside counsel spend management, technology infrastructure including litigation infrastructure and data analytics, onboarding, event management, facilities management, staffing and vendor management, data management, strategic planning, practice operations or process design. Legal operations teams can be a critical part of a GC’s strategy for ensuring Legal plays a key role in the organization.

No, no, no! This is not happening. This is not happening. (via Getty Images)

It’s hard to believe that it’s been over six years since I left Biglaw to join a company and that I can no longer claim that I am new to being in-house counsel.

Looking back over my time, I have certainly learned a thing or two. Here are some common mistakes I made or observed.

Advising In A Silo

I distinctly remember visiting one of my business client locations for the first time. For the sake of this story, let’s call them Avenue Q. At Avenue Q, I was introduced to a room full of stakeholders on the tail end of a regular business meeting. After the meeting, I was stopped while I was on my way out and was asked a question. Eager to please and make a good impression — and confident in my answer to the legal question, I shared my legal opinion.

Within a few hours, I was surprised to receive a call from a legal colleague from a different department. Surprised because I didn’t realize that my work phone number even worked yet! After introductions and a little small talk, she asked me if I recently gave advice to Avenue Q, and I proudly said yes, confident in my legal prowess and expected a thank you for taking it off her to-do list.

Little did I know that Avenue Q was engaging in some forum shopping and had already consulted with my legal colleague before asking “the new girl,” me — who gave a different answer, without any background or historical knowledge.

Yeah … don’t be me. Make sure you consult important stakeholders, including your own team.

Only Giving The Legal Analysis

While as in-house counsel, we are obviously lawyers and provide legal advice — business clients can get frustrated if that is all you do. Providing the legal pros and cons and risks is only part of the job. The other part is to consider the practical ramifications of the options presented and helping the client reach a reasonable decision that best fulfills the “why” of said project or of the company. And in some cases, part of the job is also helping the business client defend its decision to other stakeholders, which often involves stating that “legal approved it.”

Because there is more to the job than simply giving the legal analysis, this is why I caution against having a regular practice where business clients go directly to outside counsel. In-house counsel, who usually have a better, more intimate understanding of the business objectives of any given project, as well as any politics that may be involved, should be a part of the process.

Failing To Verify

Isn’t the saying “trust, but verify?” There are times when new laws become effective, and clients need to simply comply. And if your previous roles have only been as outside counsel, you may be under the false impression that all you have to do is to provide the new law to your client.

In reality, you may also need to provide ideas on how to comply with the law — and follow up to ensure that timely changes are made. While your role is probably not execution, “it wasn’t me” still isn’t a great look.

# Uber Tried To Make Biglaw A Gig Economy. Biglaw Told Them To Cram It.

The greatest gift that high stakes litigation can bestow upon the outside observer is some unrelated yet ultimately embarrassing insights that can run off and become a story unto itself. Sometimes phone calls to prostitutes come up in [a lawsuit about football coaching prowess](https://www.everydayshouldbesaturday.com/2017/7/21/16008350/hugh-freeze-meets-a-snare?_ga=2.159101626.1451225276.1500905347-804959825.1487280172), other times emails reveal a startup so convinced of its own hype that it thinks it can turn its law firm into another poor schlub doing their bidding for crumbs. This is the latter story, and the best part is Uber is still blinded by the hype — they’re the ones revealing to the world how much they suck to work for.

As Uber wages an intellectual property showdown with Google’s Waymo over driverless car technology, Uber filed a motion detailing the disintegration of its professional relationship with Quinn Emanuel, who now represents Waymo. Uber sees a conflict, while Quinn retorts that nothing could be further from the truth.

But for the legal industry, the real story here is how Uber tried to turn Biglaw into a gig economy full of “preferred” plans and hints at better work that never materialized. As Law.com put it:

In a July 20 filing from Uber, it’s revealed that Quinn Emanuel, which now represents Waymo in the dispute over driverless car technology, emailed a number of top attorneys in Uber’s legal department, including current chief legal officer Salle Yoo, to cut off the relationship. The email from Quinn Emanuel partner Stephen Swedlow, dated Sept. 23, 2016, noted that, since the firm entered into Uber’s preferred counsel program with fixed fee arrangements, the cases and tasks it has been hired for have “been at rates that are not financially viable” for the firm.

Swedlow’s email also states “it is no longer feasible to serve the role we have been relegated to in the context of representing Uber” which is a very polite way of telling the client to go to “hail.”

That’s what happens when the Ted Talk tactics of selling people on taking less to be in a “program” that would, theoretically, pay off one day hits the reality of sophisticated professionals who just want their damn money, thank you very much. Frankly, it’s astounding that Quinn Emanuel participated in this program for four and a half years! But, as the email from Swedlow makes clear, Quinn kept expecting things to take off. They figured that big matter was right around the corner. It wasn’t.

In-house counsel are looking to cut costs everywhere and alternative fee arrangements are one tool in that arsenal. But some tasks fit that scheme better than others. When Ropes & Gray [spins off a whole group](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/ropes-gray-splitting-with-around-100-lawyers-and-staffers/) to take advantage of the fact that its reliably predictable work fits an AFA model and no longer justifies the overhead of a Biglaw firm, that’s a healthy marriage of smart in-house pricing and good firm business management.

But Uber was taking litigations that could not neatly fit within a fixed fee structure and treating it that way because they involved lower stakes. If a client has work that doesn’t justify Biglaw prices, then give to a small shop with low overhead. But capturing Biglaw resources and expertise for tiny matters by holding the prospect of a high-earning matter just out of reach isn’t a healthy long-term practice: clients just burn bridges and firms just burn resources.

Polsinelli is facing a federal investigation over work it did for Jackson County, Missouri. The F.B.I.’s looking into the lobbying contract between the county and the 800-lawyer Biglaw firm. The fact of the investigation came out during the sentencing of former Jackson County Executive Mike Sanders and aide Calvin Williford when Western District of Missouri Judge Roseann Ketchmark referred to it.

According to[ sources for the Kansas City Star](https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article218793090.html), while the exact scope of the investigation is unknown, federal investigators are looking at travel expenses the firm signed off on. Apparently it was the practice of Polsinelli partner Pete Levi to sign off and expense travel costs for elected Jackson County officials:

Travel records obtained by The Star under an open records request show that Levi signed off on thousands of dollars of travel, accommodations, meals and other expenses for elected officials and other county employees in 2015 and 2016.

Chief among them was Williford, who until his resignation in 2017 was executive director of the Rock Island Rail Corridor Authority and before that chief of staff to both [Jackson County Executive Frank] White and Sanders. Records show that Williford racked up large bills on expensive hotels and air travel.

(According to [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pete-levi-b5b90b2a/) and [Polsinelli press releases](https://www.polsinelli.com/newsevents/polsinelli-shughart-announces-peter-s-levi-to-lead-firms-kc-regional-public-policy-practice-11-27-2009), Levi is a shareholder in the firm, but he is conspicuously absent from the [firm’s directory](https://www.polsinelli.com/professionals/plevi).)

At issue are tens of thousands of dollars in travel expenses approved by Levi. The contract between Jackson County and the firm called for the firm to cover “costs relating to educational and fact-finding activities engaged in by county officials pursuant to the goals for the scope of work.” When the new County Executive became aware of the practice in 2016, he says he ended it:

“When the County Executive became aware he informed staff that this was not a practice that he wished to continue and directed that the practice cease,” White said in a statement Wednesday. “In addition, representatives from Polsinelli were contacted and agreed to remove that provision from any subsequent contract and reduce the contract cost accordingly.”

The general counsel for the firm, Doug Laird, said they are cooperating with the investigation:

# Are Layoffs Looming If Some Firms Match Milbank's Associate Salary Increase?
## Cross your fingers and pray that your firm doesn't follow Milbank -- lest you enjoy the schadenfreude of layoffs.

Everyone knows that Milbank announced [associate raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) yesterday, but the real question is whether [anyone is going to match](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/who-will-match-the-milbank-raise/?rf=1) the firm’s new $190K salary scale. Boutique firm [Hueston Hennigan has already matched](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/the-first-firm-has-matched-the-new-milbank-scale/), but that’s because the highly profitable firm is smaller, so it can afford to do so. We’ve yet to see a true Biglaw firm match Milbank’s money.

What will happen when firms that can’t necessarily afford the extra expenses of this associate raise match Milbank anyway? It’s summer associate season, after all, and there’s no better way to convince them to give their lives to the firm than to increase their prospective first-year associate salaries.

It’s been speculated that fewer firms will follow Milbank’s move, creating  bifurcated market for Biglaw salaries, but there are far worse things that associates may have to worry about. Are layoffs (stealth or otherwise) looming on the horizon?

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Dan Binstock, a partner and recruiter at Garrison & Sisson, says that there are unexpected consequences for firms that adopt the 2018 associate salary raise. While Milbank’s raise definitely “applies to a certain segment of firms,” other firms outside of the “super elite” are “feeling rate pressure” in certain practice areas, meaning that if they were ro increase associate salaries, they’d struggle to justify the increased billing rates necessary to finance the salary raise to their clients.

As a result, the pressure will mount for associates to keep up with with their billable hours. Underperformance in any way, shape, or form may become a surefire ticket to the unemployment line, as flexibility could very well fly out the window. Here are the depressing details from Binstock’s chat with the [New York Law Journal](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/06/04/fewer-firms-expected-to-follow-milbanks-associate-pay-boost/):

“I’ve literally heard managing partners say since we raised salaries to $180,000, we don’t have the luxury of giving associates six to nine months to catch up on their hours,” [Binstock] said. Instead, firms may now give three to six months before they start a termination process, he said.

“With this increased compensation always comes an increased financial pressure that is often not evident at first blush but is occurring on the back end in order to make things work,” Binstock said. “Partners only have a limited willingness to dip into profitability.”

If you like your job and the limited flexibility you have when it comes to your billable-hours targets and you think your firm may have jumped the gun when it adopted the 2016 associate salary raise, you better cross your fingers and pray that it doesn’t follow Milbank — lest you enjoy the schadenfreude of layoffs.

Today, we must report on some unfortunate news from Massachusetts, where a longtime partner of DLA Piper’s Boston office was found dead late last month. Local authorities believe that the cause of death is suicide.

Bruce Wickersham, a 1996 graduate of Boston College Law School, focused his practice on joint ventures, working with institutional investors, real estate private equity funds and sponsors, and real estate investment advisers during his 13 years at DLA Piper. The avid boater and fisherman’s body was found submerged between two boats at the Moby Dick Marina in the southern coastal town of Fairhaven. According to the Bristol County District Attorney’s Office, Wickersham’s death was the result of an apparent suicide.

John Rattigan, managing partner of the firm’s Boston office, released this statement on Wickersham’s death to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/09/21/suicide-blamed-in-death-of-dla-piper-partner/):

# After Stiffing Associates Over The Summer, Firm Isn't Offering Much Good News In The Winter
## This is not inspiring.

Over the summer, when firms were furiously adjusting associate salaries to reflect the cost of living bump since 2016, McGuireWoods told its team that they really had [no interest into being peer pressured into raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/mcguirewoods-will-do-what-it-wants-and-it-doesnt-want-to-give-raises/) until the new year, no matter what the “market” did. At least they offered some small summer bonuses.

Well, after months of leaving associates waiting for a big announcement to bring the firm — a firm that [resides on the $1M+ PPP list](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/the-richest-firms-that-still-havent-announced-bonuses/) — into line, the firm held a meeting for associates and delivered a report that didn’t overwhelm anyone.

For a firm that already paid below market, offering a $155K to $175K salary for first-years after 2016’s raises, the firm is bumping the young attorneys up to $190K which is nice (second years will be getting $200K in these top markets). Elsewhere, first years in Atlanta, Baltimore, Charlotte, Pittsburgh, Raleigh, Richmond will make $165,000. The firm hands out individualized salaries for more senior associates, and it’s among that crop that the raises will merely “average” 10 percent (another tipster says the meeting said “up to 10 percent”).

But the raises, while welcome news after so many months, aren’t even something associates will be seeing anytime soon. It seems the firm isn’t making the new salaries active until April 1. They’ll be lucky if there aren’t another round of raises by then.

When it comes to bonuses, the numbers weren’t much better. First- and second-years will receive $7500 for 2050 hours, $15K for 2150, and $22,500 for 2250. (NOTE: A copy of the memo forwarded to ATL appears to suggest associates make $7500 at this level regardless of hours — apparently what this memo intends to convey is that associates get an additional $7500 at each benchmark) Third- through fifth-years will get $10K for 2050 hours, $25K for 2150, and $42,500 for 2250. The sixth and above associates are getting $12,500, $30,000K, and $50K at those levels. It’s one thing to trade off compensation for a relaxed billables target, but forcing associates to exceed 2050 hours to get $625/month in bonus (and McGuireWoods would undoubtedly contend that their summer bonus should count here, but we’re not inviting that apples to oranges conversation) is brutal.

So, for now, we can cross McGuireWoods off the list of firms with millionaire partners who had yet to announce bonuses.

UPDATE: An earlier version of this article had some slightly different numbers. That’s been fixed.

# Fired Biglaw Partner Sentenced To Prison For Cyberstalking Former Colleagues
## Prosecutors said he showed a 'lack of remorse, or even recognition that what he did was criminal.'

On Friday, former K&L Gates partner Willie Dennis was sentenced to two years in prison following his [October 2022 conviction](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/fired-biglaw-partner-convicted-of-cyberstalking-former-colleagues/) on three counts of cyberstalking. As we previously [reported](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/ex-biglaw-partner-arrested-accused-of-cyberstalking-former-colleagues/), Dennis was accused of sending thousands of “harassing, threatening, and intimidating emails and text messages” to partners at his former firm between the years of 2018 and 2020.

Dennis’s problematic communications began shortly after he was fired from the firm, and his former colleagues grew fearful thanks to the violent tone of the emails and texts, complete with warnings like “I will find you” and “sleep with one eye open.”

Dennis represented himself during trial, and it was there that he ran into trouble with Judge Jed Rakoff of the Southern District of New York, who threatened Dennis with contempt. During sentencing, however, it seems that Rakoff may have had a change of heart when it came to the defendant. The [New York Law Journal](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2023/02/10/former-kl-gates-partner-willie-dennis-sentenced-to-two-years-for-cyberstalking-ex-colleagues/) has more information on that:

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Rakoff . . . said he felt “anguish” about sentencing a man who lived an “admirable” life, graduating from top schools and pursuing a successful legal career, before he began sending thousands of alarming messages to the victims in the case.

“A factor that is glaring beyond all else is the degree of fear and emotional distress that he imposed day after day, message after message on the victims of his crimes, and that cannot go unpunished,” Rakoff said.

Rakoff ordered Dennis to stay way from his victims, as well as from any current or former employee of the Biglaw firm he once called his professional home. “At the time, I was emotional,” Dennis said. “I didn’t think about right or wrong. I do know now that it was wrong.”

In their sentencing memorandum, prosecutors asked Rakoff to sentence Dennis to four-and-a-half years in prison, noting his “lack of remorse,” and emphasizing that his former colleagues “remain fearful” of him.

In a statement to the court, Dennis apologized not only to his victims, but also to his former lawyer and Rakoff, as well as the judge’s legal and administrative staff, saying he’d failed to heed the judge’s “wisdom” as a pro se litigant.

[Former Greenberg Traurig associate Aaron Honaker](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/former-biglaw-associate-accused-of-being-serial-bank-robber/) pleaded guilty to a string of bank robberies — two successful, and three additional attempts. Earlier this month, he was [sentenced](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdfl/pr/former-miami-lawyer-sentenced-40-months-imprisonment-five-bank-robberies) to 40 months in prison.

The string of robberies occurred in Florida, Coral Gables and Aventura, specifically. According to[ reports](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/former-biglaw-attorney-gets-jail-time-for-bank-robberies), Honaker only received $1,850 between the two successful robberies. The thwarted robberies went down as follows:

In one of the unsuccessful robberies, the teller told Honaker that she couldn’t provide money because it is “in the machine,” according to an FBI affidavit supporting the criminal complaint.

In another, the teller told Honaker that she couldn’t read English on his demand note and would need help. In the third, the teller said she couldn’t provide money because it was in counting machines.

The [Wake Forest Law](https://alumnius.net/wake_forest_universi-8805-27#id38471931) alum began his legal career as an associate at Greenberg Traurig, where he practiced business reorganization and financial restructuring. He also worked at boutique law firm Salazar Jackson and then at business and real estate litigation firm Martinez Morales. According to earlier [reports](https://www.law.com/dailybusinessreview/2020/10/21/fbi-arrests-ex-big-law-attorney-over-florida-bank-robberies), partner Raul Morales said Honaker just disappeared from the firm: “He disappeared. He was one day here, one day gone. I had no idea where he went.”

Honaker’s former colleagues described him as a “highly intelligent” and “brilliant,” saying, “I have no explanation as to how he got to this point.” Letters submitted as part of Honaker’s sentencing [also spoke](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/former-biglaw-attorney-gets-jail-time-for-bank-robberies) to his character:

In a [sentencing letter](https://www.abajournal.com/files/HonakerLttrs.pdf) submitted on behalf of Honaker, a fellow inmate described him as kind-hearted, respectful, smart and a “willing to give you the shirt off his back” kind of guy. Honaker used his background to assist other inmates with their cases, the letter said. Other inmates also submitted letters on Honaker’s behalf.

# Biglaw Firm Announces Disappointing Year-End Bonuses
## UPDATE: The firm has amended their bonus policy, and it's much friendlier to associates.

UPDATE: The firm has unveiled a new bonus system. Check out the end of the post for all the details.

When it comes to Biglaw bonus memos, shorter is better. Just let folks know how much they’re getting (hopefully at least market rate) and when they’re getting it and… that’s it. That’s all folks really want to know. The longer the announcement, the more conditions on the bonuses — like the number of billable hours or the time frame to enter said hours in order to qualify for the money.

The 2020 bonus memo at Goldberg Segalla, 171st on the 2020 Am Law ranking with $150,000,000 in gross revenue last year, is an astonishing 15 pages long. ([Available in full on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/goldberg-bonus/2/)) (Ed. note: check out the update at the bottom for details on the firm’s new policy.)

Yikes.

The majority of it is dedicated to describing the leadership and “professional hygiene” components of the bonus formula which is an attempt to put some criteria on functionally discretionary factors. Listen… the Biglaw gold standard is lockstep bonuses. Besides being impervious to subjective impressions of associates which can reflect personal bias, lockstep gives associates a measure of certainty about their compensation and allows for apples to apples comparisons across peer firms. This is… not that.

In any event, the leadership and “professional hygiene” components can enhance the production component of the bonus, and that’s where Goldberg Segalla lays out the hard numbers. First we’ll note that associate production bonuses are based on “realized hours” meaning the firm has to actually collect from the client to get a bonus on that time, which… is not great for associates. It’s hardly a young associate’s fault if the firm is unable to collect on the work that they did. Of course there’s always a risk that a firm won’t get paid, but floating that should be the responsibility of the partnership, not the rank-and-file associates that have little control over whether clients pay, especially when they rarely have autonomy over which matters they’re assigned in the first place.

But anyway, here are the bonus amounts detailed in the memo — regardless of class year (the two discretionary components may account for class year differences):

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Subject to the professional hygiene component of the bonus program as described on the pages discussed within the body of this bonus memo, the Production bonus component for associates is based upon number of realized hours during the fiscal year (see above).

Hours: Bonus:
1950 $5,000
2000 7,000
2050 8,000
2100 9,500
2150 11,000
2200 12,500
2250 14,500
2300 17,000

each additional 50 realized hours = $2500; there is no maximum production bonus component.

But don’t worry — it gets shittier. Usually year-end bonuses are paid… at the end of the year. Or perhaps at the end of the first quarter the following year. Not at Goldberg Segalla. They drag the process out over the course of the following year:

“Gross bonus” is the cumulative amount determined by adding the gross production component to the leadership component and adding or subtracting the professional hygiene component (if any).

The bonus will be paid in five distributions as follows:

On or before December 31, 2020: 12.5 percent of the gross bonus

On or before January 31, 2021: 12.5 percent of the gross bonus

On or before April 30, 2021: 25 percent of the gross bonus

On or before July 31, 2021: 50 percent of the remainder after write-offs and holdbacks are accounted for

On or before October 31, 2021: remainder of bonus after write-offs and holdbacks are accounted for

Any holdbacks that still exist as of October 31, 2021 will be monitored monthly and released accordingly as the receivable on which the hold back is based is collected by the firm.

And of course, associates only get the bonuses they earned if they’re still employed at the firm at the time of the distribution. That locks associates in at the firm and off of the lateral market if they want to collect the money they’re owed.
UPDATE: According to a spokesperson at the firm, while this was, at one point the 2020 bonus policy, it has since been scrapped. After internal changes at the firm, and you know, the whole global pandemic thing the powers that be at Goldberg Segalla decided to implement a different system for assessing bonuses. And there’s a lot of good news for associates in the new formula, with several of the more onerous provisions eliminated. Aidan Ryan, a spokesperson for the firm, describes the new policy:

Goldberg Segalla’s leadership recently announced significant changes to the firm’s previous bonus program, aimed at simplifying and streamlining the program and responding to feedback about the program from the firm’s attorney community. The Above the Law article published November 19 purporting to discuss Goldberg Segalla’s bonus program was entirely based on a year-old document describing a program that has been replaced.

Goldberg Segalla’s new bonus program eliminates components of the previous program including the professional hygiene requirements, realization and productivity calculations, and write-offs and reductions. The new program also shortens the payout structure. The firm has also implemented a practice of conducting individual meetings between attorneys and practice group leadership to discuss anticipated compensation and expectations for the upcoming year, providing greater transparency and predictability around total compensation at the beginning of the year.

Goldberg Segalla has not yet released bonuses for 2020.

Since Baker McKenzie made the[ first year-end bonus announcement](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/) last week, Biglaw has been pretty quiet on the bonus front. Let’s hope whichever firm acts next will do so with the nice, big lockstep numbers we’ve come to expect from the elite in Biglaw.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

[The American Alliance for Equal Rights] is hopeful these programs will transition to become available to all qualified law students, regardless of their race. Additional litigation may be necessary.

— Edward Blum, leader of the American Alliance for Equal Rights, in a statement given to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/fox-rothschild-susman-godfrey-are-possible-dei-lawsuit-targets) over the organization’s threats against diversity fellowship programs at Fox Rothschild and Susman Godfrey. The Alliance has already [filed suit](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/two-biglaw-firms-sued-over-diversity-initiatives/) against Morrison Foerster and Perkins Coie, which both [revised their DEI fellowships](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/biglaw-caves-morrison-foerster-changes-diversity-fellowship-criteria-following-lawsuit/) to [remove race as a factor](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/perkins-coie-diversity-fellowship/), leading to the lawsuits being dropped. Blum has also targeted Winston & Strawn, Hunton Andrews & Kurth, and Adams and Reese, [threatening litigation](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/blum-group-threatens-to-sue-more-biglaw-firms-over-their-diversity-fellowships/) over their diversity programs. While Adams and Reese decided to do away with its program, Winston and Hunton are ready to [fight for their diversity initiatives](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/after-being-threatened-with-litigation-these-biglaw-firms-are-ready-to-fight-for-their-diversity-programs/).

# Bonus Season Has Started, But Where Are The Bonuses?
## Come on, Cravath! Stop keeping everyone waiting.
By [Staci Zaretsky](https://abovethelaw.com/author/staci-zaretsky/)

Baker McKenzie decided to kick off the 2020 bonus season late last week before Above the Law first publicized it yesterday, announcing the same [$20K to $115K scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/biglaw-bonus-season-begins/) it employed last year (though without any statement of the bonus premiums it offered to high billers in 2021). Thus far, the firm’s announcement has been more or less … ignored.

Before you start wondering what the other firms could possibly be waiting for before making their matches, you should know that we’ve seen this before.

Back in 2020, when [Baker McKenzie made the first move](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/) when it came to announcing year-end bonuses, and for almost two weeks, partners on Biglaw executive committees sat twiddling their thumbs until [Cravath came forward](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/cravath-bonuses/) to announce that it was matching the Baker McKenzie bonus scale. Only then did matches occur — and at a rapid pace, at that. The same thing happened in 2019, when [Milbank was the first firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/breaking-biglaw-bonuses-are-here/) to announce bonuses. That announcement was also met with five days of silence until [Cravath made its own announcement](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/cravath-announces-bonuses-now-the-2019-bonus-season-can-really-begin/), matching the Milbank scale. Other firms quickly fell in line to match, but only after Cravath gave its thumbs-up.

Based on past precedent, Cravath’s seal of approval is what’s needed here, but let’s face it: we’re dealing with an industry-wide slowdown in business and there are already different tiers of compensation across Biglaw. Some firms may take longer to match this year, and some may even tie bonuses to office attendance, thus fragmenting the compensation market even more.

It looks like we’re going to have to wait impatiently for Cravath to make its move on bonuses, but for the time being, at least associates know what the bottom of the 2022 bonus market looks like. It’s just a matter of when your firm will match — or beat! — it.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

The Boston legal market has seen significant growth over the last few years. Several major international law firms have opened new offices in Boston, many hoping to carve out their share of the market with respect to Boston’s core industries: tech, biotech, health care, and other life sciences-related businesses. Lateral hiring is strong. If you are strategizing the next stage in your career — whether it’s a move within Boston, a move to Boston, or staying put at your Boston firm — you should consider market indicators and be sure you understand the dynamics from 2017. While it is impossible to cover all relevant statistics in one article, I will focus here on overall lateral hiring compared to prior years, hiring by practice area, and hiring by firm.

Lateral Hiring Year-on-Year

Between January 1, 2017, and the start of this week, November 26, 2017, there were a total of 424 lateral hires in Boston (268 associates, 91 partners, and 65 counsels).[[1]](#_ftn1) This figure is down slightly from the corresponding time frame in 2016 (487 total Boston lateral hires) and 2015 (475 total Boston lateral hires) but still up from 2014 (403 total Boston lateral hires) and 2013 (400 total Boston lateral hires). Keep in mind that I am only comparing the first nearly 11 months of each year. While we would generally expect hiring to be busiest in the first half of the year after year-end bonuses are paid out and attorneys look to move on, Boston hiring actually picked up in the second half of 2017. There were 188 hires between January 1, 2017, and June 30, 2017, compared to 236 between July 1, 2017, and November 26, 2017. So it’s quite possible that year-end total hires for 2017 could exceed 2016 and 2015 hires. Boston hiring is on an uptick and there are no indications that it will slow down come Q1 2018.

Hiring by Practice Area

As mentioned above, Boston is best known for its tech, biotech, health care, and other life sciences-related industries. This translates into a demand for legal work above all in the corporate (fund formation, venture capital, private equity/M&A, finance, and investment management) and intellectual property (patent prosecution and patent litigation, as well as trademark, copyright, and other soft IP) fields and real estate. If you are currently in New York or another major market and would like to take advantage of a true growth market in these core areas, a move to Boston is well worth considering.

Total lateral hiring in Boston from January 1, 2017, to November 26, 2017, by practice area breaks down as follows, with lateral hiring for other practice areas in the single digits:

Litigation: 129 (81 associates, 32 partners, 16 counsels)

Corporate: 94 (66 associates, 15 partners, 13 counsels)

Intellectual Property: 67 (37 associates, 20 partners, 10 counsels)

Labor & Employment: 39 (27 associates, 6 partners, 6 counsels)

Real Estate: 32 (22 associates, 7 partners, 3 counsels)

Trusts & Estates: 16 (10 associates, 3 partners, 3 counsels)

Tax: 11 (6 associates, 1 partner, 4 counsels)

The big surprises here? Litigation and L&E. Although hiring within litigation appears to be strong, a further look at the figures shows us that only about 1/3 of this hiring was by Am Law 100 firms, compared to more than 80% of the corporate lateral hiring by Am Law 100 firms. No one firm hired any significant number of litigators; instead, the hiring was fairly spread out. Traditionally, litigation lateral hiring nationwide has been less noteworthy due in large part to the larger pool of litigators coming out of law school compared to the talent pool supplying the many corporate and other non-litigation fields and sub-fields. As for Labor & Employment, with more and more new companies opening in Boston, look for this to be a growing field in Boston in coming years.

Hiring by Firm

Based on the size of their Beantown presence, the top Boston firms are Ropes & Gray, Goodwin, Mintz Levin, WilmerHale, and Morgan Lewis. However, some of the top firms in Boston for lateral hiring may surprise you. Seven Boston firms have landed in the double-digits to date in 2017: Burns & Levinson, Goodwin, Kirkland & Ellis, McCarter & English, Mintz Levin, Prince Lobel, and Ropes & Gray.

It’s worth noting that Kirkland & Ellis is the latest in the most notable new Boston office openings of late, announcing its new as-of-now all corporate Boston presence in May 2017. If they follow the same pattern in Boston as they have in Houston, we can expect to see Kirkland on this double digits list next year as well.

White & Case bucked the corporate and IP trend by opening a Boston office in April 2016 with a team of white-collar litigators. The Palo Alto-based Wilson Sonsini opened a Boston office in February 2016, to focus primarily on life sciences and IP-related work. This latest wave follows Boston office openings by Sidley Austin in 2013, and Latham & Watkins and Jones Day both in 2011. We will continue to keep an eye on these relatively newer players in Boston as well.

Conclusion

Deciding if and when to make a lateral move requires reflection on your own personal and professional situation and also a careful analysis of the specific market. It is useful to understand recent hiring trends to best position yourself within that market. It is also important to work with a recruiter who is knowledgeable about the specific market. At Lateral Link, each recruiter specializes in one or just a few markets where we have practiced ourselves and/or where we are on the ground to build relationships with the firms’ key players. We can help you make sense of the lateral hiring trends and we can also help answer questions such as:

- How important is it that I have ties to the area?
- How important is it that I have the local bar before starting my search?
- When in my career and when in the calendar year is the ideal time to move?
- Would a particular lateral move get me closer to my career goal?
- Which firms will be most interested in a candidate with a profile and skill set such as mine?
These are particularly key questions for lawyers looking to enter the Boston market. And for a seasoned Boston lawyer contemplating a move within this tight-knit legal world, discretion is imperative. Having an experienced intermediary can be essential in assuring that your skills and experience are valued to their highest.
