# #TimesUp For This Biglaw Partner Who Got A New Gig After Being Quietly Pushed Out Of His Old Firm
## The days of being able to slink away from under a cloud of allegations are probably over.

There are many reasons why the #MeToo moment hasn’t fully crested in Biglaw yet, and a big one is that law firms know how to conduct internal investigations. They have the skills and experience to handle problems with maximum discretion. Once law firms decide to take sexual harassment seriously, they are in a good position to efficiently and quietly rid themselves of bad actors.

What’s less obvious is whether or not law firms, Biglaw firms in particular, are any good at due diligence before they make new hires. The downside of the efficient internal investigation is that potential bad actors are allowed to float away to new opportunities without serious questions being raised about their past behavior. One firm’s solution can become another firm’s problem.

Multiple sources report to Above the Law that Mayer Brown capital markets partner [James R. Tanenbaum](https://www.mayerbrown.com/people/james-r-tanenbaum/) was fired from Morrison & Foerster’s New York office after allegations of sexual harassment there were supported by an internal investigation.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Sources report that Tanenbaum had a history of allegations of “sexual harassment” and “inappropriate behavior” at the firm.

A source tells us that management at the firm was first made aware of Tanenbaum’s behavior a little over two years ago. That source says that Tanenbaum was reprimanded, at that time, and told to never do it again.

But… two years ago was a different lifetime when it comes to sexual harassment in the workplace. At least, let’s hope it was a different lifetime ago. Allegations against Tanenbaum resurfaced last year. One source, a partner at Morrison & Foerster who spoke to us on the condition of anonymity, said that the allegations against Tanenbaum were squarely in the sexual harassment category, “not assault.”

This time, Morrison & Foerster decided to bring in an independent outside firm to conduct an investigation into Tanenbaum’s behavior. Our sources report that Tanenbaum was asked to leave the firm the very day the report was finished. He left in December 2017.

Of course, Morrison did not issue a press release about James Tanenbaum’s departure. There was no headline saying that Tanenbaum was pushed out over sexual harassment allegations. Morrison & Foerster declined to comment for this story.

Tanenbaum went away quietly, but he was also able to quickly find a new gig. Here’s the [New York Law Journal headline](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2018/02/26/mofo-capital-markets-team-jumps-to-mayer-brown/):

MoFo Capital Markets Team Jumps to Mayer Brown

A source reports that a group of Morrison associates sent over a bouquet of flowers to Mayer Brown… thanking them for taking Tanenbaum “off their hands.” And that is pretty much the most MoFo thing to have ever happened.

However, we reached out to Mayer Brown about whether they had any kind of official knowledge of the allegations surrounding Tanenbaum at any point during the hiring process. This morning, Richard Spehr, the partner in charge of Mayer Brown’s New York office, informed us that Mayer Brown had accepted Tanenbaum’s resignation:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Today, Mayer Brown accepted the resignation of James Tanenbaum, who recently joined the firm. His resignation follows assertions that Mr. Tanenbaum may have engaged in inappropriate conduct at his former firm. Mr. Tanenbaum has informed Mayer Brown that he forcefully denies these assertions, but that he has determined that resigning is in the best interest of Mayer Brown, its clients and the capital markets group. We wish Mr. Tanenbaum well.

We reached out to Tanenbaum directly as well, but he has not responded at the time of this writing.

Biglaw will not deal with its sexual harassment problems like Hollywood has. It will not be as public and as salacious as all that (despite a few [high-profile incidents](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/06/dewey-know-a-partner-whose-alleged-actions-led-to-a-400k-severance-arrangement/) over the [years](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/02/musical-chairs-jeremy-pitcock-1/)).

My fear is that the industry will deal with the issue somewhat like the Catholic Church. Some of the most heartbreaking stories in the Church context are when you hear about priests who were shuttled from diocese to diocese, instead of being drummed out of the system altogether. Each individual parish handled its own problem, but in a way that allowed the problem to merely be transferred to somebody else’s account.

Our partner source said she was inspired to come forward by the courage of women at her firm and around the country who were also coming forward. She was proud that Morrison & Foerster did the right thing and got rid of Tanenbaum after an appropriate and fair investigation into the claims, but she also felt strongly that people needed to know what happened here.

“I don’t think he should be allowed to go away quietly.”

# Cheetah: Banking And Consumer Finance Law By Wolters Kluwer

As one of the few practicing transactional attorneys here at Above the Law, I occasionally get asked to take the latest corporate law tools out for a test drive. Last weekend I tested an online tool named [Cheetah](http://bit.ly/2aPAhoZ), a new product being rolled out by Wolters Kluwer. Cheetah is focused on banking and consumer finance law. Whereas in my primary field of securities law there are just four relevant acts at the federal level, banking and consumer finance is broad enough that it’s a real challenge to keep enough books on your shelf so every topic is covered, or to bookmark all the relevant websites. A tool like Cheetah can be a real game-changer — if it’s easy to use, that is.

So is it?

It is. The first thing I noticed about Cheetah, other than the fact it shares its name with a certain ballet company in Atlanta, was the commonsense layout. Some sites (here’s looking at you, TheCorporateCounsel.net) are way too junky, and it can be difficult to find particular items. Other sites are a bit too spare, so you have to memorize which items are located in the particular categories (because there are always subjects that straddle categories). But Cheetah strikes a nice balance, with eleven topics laid out, and hyperlinks of the three to five most relevant subjects beneath each one. It really works. The eleven topics take up the first and second columns, with the third column consisting of practice tools and news headlines (click to enlarge):

I’ll briefly touch on some of the individual features of the product.

The Bank Digest section, under the News & Blogs topic headline, gives you all the latest news in the banking industry, from relevant GAO reports to OFAC sanctions. Any news that touches the banking industry is provided, even news from some sources I wouldn’t think of as generating relevant content, such as the Federal Trade Commission. In addition, Cheetah features every kind of banking law reporter you would ever need. You can quickly access the Federal Banking Law Reporter – Wolters Kluwer’s proprietary guide to the federal regulation of banks and thrifts – as well as the banking law reporter of any state, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Reporter, and every other type of reporter you can shake a stick at.

Cheetah is an easy way to quickly find the most relevant laws. All the rules and regulations are publicly available on the internet in various locations, but it can be a pain having to earmark a lot of different sites of varying search capabilities. It definitely helps having everything in one place, where you can search across the different primary sources for the most relevant information. Cheetah also offers various newsletters and treatise notifications you can sign up for, if you feel like you don’t get enough emails.

I would think that if you work in-house, the digest and reporter features would be particularly helpful, since you might not be part of a larger practice group constantly feeding you information.

Clicking around the site and running various searches, I found that there is a lot of good, easily digestible general information for junior associates needing to get up to speed on overall banking law, or for more senior banking lawyers just needing a quick touch-up in a particular area. See the below result for “purchase money security interest”:

[](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Purchase-Money-Security-Interest.png)

(However, none of the general-information pages give the date they were last updated. I always like to be able to see when a page was last updated, so I see this as a potential area for improvement.)

Cheetah has a feature named “Smart Charts,” which allows the user to easily compare the laws and regulatory procedures in various jurisdictions. Here I was able to bring up a chart of the fees and regulations regarding filing a UCC statement in three separate jurisdictions. Smart Charts is somewhat reminiscent of Practical Law Company’s state comparison tools, though I suppose there are only so many ways you can do a comparison chart:

The showstopper (in a good way) is the compliance information, specifically the guides. They are the best I’ve seen. The various guides – and there are several – thankfully eschew the “kitchen sink” approach of having 40 pages or so of bracketed text, which can be laborious to go through, and instead offer guides you can use with minimal revisions. The Cheetah compliance guides offer a useful starting point, and I’m willing to bet that even senior banking or compliance attorneys will find these useful, and they also include various examiner’s guides. In my eyes, the guides and other compliance information provide everything you need to get a compliance program off the ground, whether you are in-house or at a law firm. Note the compliance guides can be downloaded to pdf or rtf.

[](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Expedited-funds-availability-guide.png)

I won’t go on to describe every single thing that Cheetah has to offer, but I do want to mention that Cheetah also offers guides to federal and state credit laws and regulations, federal money laundering regulation, financial privacy law, and individual retirement plans.

In addition to being able to “favorite” pages, you can also save bookmarks to a particular “Worklist,” a feature that I found useful. If you’re working on two or more projects simultaneously, it’s useful to be able to pin different pages or entries to a particular worklist. Again, maybe not the most original feature (though the way I described it makes it sound more like Pinterest than it actually is), but the ease of use is notable. So if you’re thinking you’re too old for some newfangled device, note this could be something even you can use.

Cheetah is not just for corporate lawyers like myself. There is also an interesting resource named Bank Directors’, Officers’, and Lawyers’ Civil Liabilities, which is a collection of recent cases, with a one-paragraph analysis of each case and what that case might mean for participants in the field:

[](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Livestock-case.png)

In general, I think it is a benefit to have a tool that is focused on the banking and consumer finance law practice areas. Practice tools that are too broad end up being no more useful than a Google search. Obviously, there can be some situations in which this is a drawback. Back in the day, I used to do a lot of “3(a)(2) bank note” offerings, and though 3(a)(2) is a Securities Act of 1933 registration exemption, I thought it would be included here, especially since in the advert there is a reference to securities activities of banks, but it wasn’t. Cheetah doesn’t provide the user with any kind of alert letting the user know a certain search term is out of its scope, so you could spend a few minutes thinking you’re typing in a word or phrase wrong, before finally realizing it’s not included in the scope of the tool.

That small quibble aside, for attorneys whose primary focus is banking or consumer credit, Cheetah is a useful arrow to have in your quiver.

# Davis Polk Junks Prior Commitments, Adopts 4-Day Mandatory Office Policy
## Another firm pulls the rug out on hybrid work models.

The burning question of the summer was whether other firms would follow [Skadden’s move to a Monday-Thursday office policy](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/you-didnt-see-your-kids-before-the-pandemic-you-shouldnt-expect-to-see-them-now-says-elite-law-firm-partner/), or continue with the predominantly three-day model Biglaw adopted post-pandemic. It’s essentially a less fun version of the salary wars, with firms glancing side-eye at each other to figure out if they’re all going to torch their goodwill with associates or not.

Davis Polk has decided to bank on Skadden. Despite a report that the Skadden policy was so unpopular that even the partners rejected it in a vote, Davis Polk seems convinced that Skadden’s forging a new consensus, and will adopt a mandatory Monday-Thursday schedule as of Labor Day.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Neil Barr informed the firm this morning.

The key driver behind our in-office attendance philosophy is a desire to provide all members of our community with best-in-class professional development opportunities, including mentorship, training and the opportunity to create more meaningful relationships with others at the Firm. As you have now heard me say many times in our Town Halls and elsewhere, I believe that these opportunities derive, in the first instance, from our collective presence in the office and, for our Firm, simply cannot be cultivated as effectively in a remote environment.

To that end, when we return after Labor Day, all lawyers and, with the exceptions noted below, business services personnel will be expected to work in-office four days a week. Attendance will be mandatory Monday through Thursday.

Davis Polk had a mandatory Tuesday-Thursday model, which they had been claiming as a success. Apparently Mondays are the critical lynchpin that allows “mentorship, training, and the opportunity to create more meaningful relationships with others at the Firm.” You just can’t get that on Tuesdays!

DPW’s decision to join Skadden isn’t a huge surprise. In March, the firm signaled its waning faith in its existing office policy when it [installed a bonus threat](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/davis-polk-associates-bonus-office-attendance/), holding compensation hostage if attorneys were not at their desks. At the time, the firm made the implicit commitment that if everyone could just come in three days a week, everything would be fine.

As it turned out, this was the “frog in boiling water” move setting the table for a four-day policy.

We will concurrently introduce a new concept to allow some flexibility as we move into this new work paradigm – an annual remote day “bank.” This policy will allow you to choose 16 days annually to work remotely. For 2023, you may choose 5 remote days between September 5 and year-end. Additional details on the remote day bank, including related policies and procedures, will be made available shortly via an update to our Firm policies on the intranet.

The firm is also announcing that everyone can work remotely (subject to their workload) Thanksgiving week, the last week of December, and the last two weeks of August. Because partners have no intention being in on those days either, so they don’t need their coterie of paid friends hanging around to keep them company in the office.

As one tipster reports, “Absolutely ridiculous. Everything they said about hybrid ‘working’ was clearly not how they felt, despite it being true. This is going to significantly lower the happiness of associates for no additional benefit. This is simply to justify their rent.”

And so the momentum toward four days in the office mounts. Where everyone else lands will likely be decided over the next month or so.

The Ministry of Justice of Ukraine has appointed [Quinn Emanuel](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/) to act as counsel to Ukraine in proceedings against Russia at the European Court of Human Rights.

After weeks of stories focusing on Biglaw firms [trying](https://law.stanford.edu/law-firms-and-russian-profits/) to have their [Russian Honey Cakes and eat them too](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/law-firm-leaving-russia-has-a-bit-of-trouble-describing-its-russian-spin-off/), it’s encouraging to see the arsenal of Biglaw lining up behind Ukraine (or MORE of the Biglaw arsenal lining up — we’ve already seen firms offer [pro bono resources](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/paul-weiss-mobilizing-pro-bono-resources-for-ukrainian-refugees/) and [donation](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/debevoise-ukraine/) [matching](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/more-law-firms-step-up-to-match-donations-for-ukraine/)).

London office co-managing partner [Alex Gerbi](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/gerbi-alex/) and partner[ Julianne Hughes Jennett](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/hughes-jennett-julianne/) will helm the case with assistance from teams led by [Timothy Otty QC](https://www.blackstonechambers.com/barristers/tim-otty-qc/) of [Blackstone Chambers](https://www.blackstonechambers.com/) and [Guglielmo Verdirame QC](https://www.twentyessex.com/people/guglielmo-verdirame/) from [Twenty Essex Street](https://www.twentyessex.com/).

# Finding Light And Gratitude In A Holiday Season Of Darkness
## While we journey through the last few weeks of 2023, make sure to give yourself grace, patience, and forgiveness.

As we cycle through the holiday season this year, the world feels darker, grimmer, and less joyous. The unspeakable brutality and atrocities of October 7 and its aftermath affected me more deeply than I ever fathomed. Watching the news unfold while having family and clients in Israel, as well as witnessing the increased antisemitism across our country and within our educational institutions has left me oscillating between feelings of anger, hurt, and despair over the past two months. It’s also brought me unequivocally closer to the practices and traditions within Judaism — lighting candles every Shabbat (including an extra one for the hostages, the victims, and IDF soldiers), embracing family time, and taking needed pauses without feeling guilt or shame.

Over the past six weeks, I’ve received a lot of outreach from readers of my column, followers on LinkedIn, and clients alike, many of whom are also navigating challenging times internally and externally in this last part of the year. The economy has shifted dramatically in 2023. Job searches are taking longer. Hiring feels limited, and there is less outreach this year for career opportunities compared to last. Many people are grappling with issues of short- and long-term uncertainty at current companies. Others are navigating through painful personal losses and grief, which often feels heightened and accelerated in the holiday season.

The end of the year is often anticlimactic — you might be asking yourself: have I accomplished everything I set out to achieve this year? Did I lose the weight I wanted to? Did I make the needed time for myself? Did I grow closer to the right people and distance myself from the wrong ones? Did I make that big career change I wanted to? Did I get the promotion and salary increase I was promised this year?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Finding light and gratitude in a season of darkness can feel like a self-defeating prophecy. COVID-19 took a lot out of us in 2020 and in the years after. Many are still recovering from it.

You might question and agonize over those [new year’s resolutions](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/why-i-am-setting-intentions-instead-of-resolutions-in-the-new-year/). You might feel disconnected professionally and personally. You might have also experienced [total and complete burnout](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/how-to-tackle-career-burnout-and-determine-if-youre-ready-for-a-career-change/). Perhaps there’s this lingering dark cloud surrounding you, and you can’t seem to avoid it or exit it.

One of my favorite song lyrics says, “Dark clouds may hang on me sometimes … but I’ll work it out.” I used to repeat those words over and over again during my hardest days as a law student and lawyer when I would question myself and my entire existence. It has always been a message of reassurance that even with the dark clouds following us around and even with all of the uncertainties surrounding us, everything is going to be OK. One step at a time. One moment at a time. Positive thoughts. Positive energy. Positive changes.

While we journey through the last few weeks of 2023, make sure to give yourself grace, patience, and forgiveness. Allow yourself the space to grieve, ponder, and heal. Embrace this period as a chance for reflection, regrouping, and resurfacing. Communicate those boundaries and utilize hard stops on your workload in order to decompress.

A new year means new beginnings and new opportunities for a fresh slate. It’s a chance to [set new intentions](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/setting-your-personal-and-professional-intentions-for-the-new-year/) and write the next chapter in your book of life — it’s not the ending, but a beginning of new journeys, new roads, and new destinations to come.

As I head into a brief holiday break to recharge my own internal and external batteries, I want to thank you for reading my column through the years. I truly enjoy the shares, the messages, and the insights.

I look forward to writing more in 2024 and having you along for the journey. Have a safe holiday season.

What does it take to cultivate job satisfaction at a law firm? In a new report from BTI Consulting, associates pointed out exactly what they wanted from and valued in their work lives, and which firms were the best at committing to their overall happiness.

According to BTI, Biglaw associates are looking for these eight core activities from their firms when it comes to their overall professional happiness:

- Commitment to helping associates in their career
- Specific action to help develop a career path
- Access to training they need
- Good mentoring
- Optimism about growing within their firm
- High levels of job satisfaction
- Being well paid
- Having at least one partner watching out for them

After going evaluating 4,000 responses, BTI found that 147 Biglaw firms did the best job when it came to associate satisfaction. But which firms did the best in each category? Last week, we covered the firms that were considered the best at [helping associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/the-biglaw-firms-that-are-best-for-associate-satisfaction-2022/) in their careers and those with partners who have associates’ backs; the firms that have helped associates [build their careers](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/the-biglaw-firms-associates-rank-as-the-best-of-the-best-2022/) and provided access to the training they want and need; and finally, the firms that offered associates a winning compensation combination.

Today, we’ll take a dive into the firms that offer associates the things they need to learn and grow into the future Biglaw partners: mentoring and opportunities for growth within the firm.

Associates called out 60 firms for their mentoring prowess, but these nine were considered the best of the best:

- Baker Donelson
- Faegre Drinker
- Fenwick & West
- Greenberg Traurig
- Jones Day
- Katten
- Milbank
- Mintz
- Polsinelli

Every lawyer, and by extension, every law firm, aspires to do quality work. Clients demand it, the legal system demands it, and most of us have an ego that demands it as well. At the same time, lawyers are fallible, and firms always struggle to maintain quality standards — especially when firms are growing or contracting, which seems to be the norm in this more fluid era of legal practice. Add in the challenging atmosphere regarding the recruitment and training of new lawyers, and it is no surprise that quality control is an important topic for firms to address.

With competition for clients fierce, and enhanced by the expressed the desire of many corporate clients to keep as much work as possible in-house, a focus on quality control is a must for firms at every level of the legal profession. Large firms need to demonstrate that their premium pricing is justified, while smaller firms are challenged to show that their work is on the same level as the “less risky to hire” Biglaw firms. Older lawyers need to demonstrate that their skills have not eroded, and that they are capable of flourishing in a legal world driven by technology. Younger lawyers, in contrast, need to erase the perception that they lack the attention to detail and work ethic that was the hallmark of the previous eras of legal practice. Everyone has something to prove — constantly.

Most of what we consider quality control in the legal world is really a reference to a careful attention to detail. Avoiding typos, accurate research, complying with court orders – these and other tasks require the investment of both time and care. Careful lawyers develop good habits early in their careers, and maintain those habits as their careers progress. Lawyers who are too sloppy typically wash out of quality practices, and get shunted down the prestige chute to practices that are more tolerant of mediocre lawyering. But maintaining this level of quality control is something many firms are able to accomplish without much struggle. Most firms are able to create a culture where lawyers, both as a means of self-preservation and due to peer pressure, strive to avoid “silly mistakes” as much as possible. Any lawyers who falter are expendable, and usually sent packing.

But what of the major mistakes? The ones that cost firms clients, or see them lambasted on these pages? Avoiding these kinds of mistakes is an essential task for firms of all sizes, since not many firms have the wherewithal to survive the loss of credibility that ensues when a major mistake happens. Every firm will take a different approach to avoiding such disaster, but there are three elements that I think are essential if a firm hopes to make their approach a successful one.

It is important to remember that major mistakes are never made in a vacuum; they are usually the result of loosening standards. Standards within any organization can slacken for a variety of reasons. One of the big challenges, particularly for successful firms, is avoiding complacency. “We have always done it this way, and look it works” may be a comforting approach to legal practice, but it can also be an unsafe one. Every firm needs at least an occasional quality control audit – group by group in large firms, and top to bottom in smaller firms – to make sure that the firm’s “processes” are still professional standard. Big problems can arise when lawyers get complacent, and “trust the system” without occasionally checking to make sure that the firm’s systems are properly calibrated.

If avoiding complacency is the first element of major mistake avoidance for firms, the second one has to be avoiding the tendency to overpromise results. Whether it is in communicating with clients, or lawyers communicating with colleagues, problems can quickly spiral out of control when lawyers overpromise results. Mistakes happen when people are under stress and desperate, and overpromising creates conditions that cause people to be under stress and desperate. Better to be unpopular but realistic than to use “ambitious” promises to impress clients and colleagues. It usually does not end well, no matter how well-received the gung-ho attitude is at the start of the matter.

Third, it is absolutely critical to create an environment where everyone in the firm can pull an “emergency brake” if they see something going wrong. The firm must make clear that senior attorneys need to pay attention when more junior attorneys and staff highlight potential concerns. Likewise, junior lawyers and staff need to internalize that the firm demands prompt reporting of problems, and will not tolerate “looking the other way.” Yes, it can be difficult to ingrain in junior attorneys and staff that they need to report problems in the first place, much less make sure they escalate if their first contact ignores them. It can be even more difficult to inculcate the same attitude within the firm’s partnership. But it is essential for the firm’s future.

Major failures of quality control are not limited to the legal world, of course. Mistakes in other industries can be much more serious, even deadly. For example, one of the most notorious “product failures” was the Ford Pinto, a small car with the unfortunate tendency to burst into flames when rear-ended – with tragic results. There is no doubt that Ford’s engineers were all capable people, and could have designed the car’s faulty fuel tank better. At the same time, executives placed unreasonable expectations on the engineering team to develop a cheap vehicle, as they had made unattainable promises to investors. Compounding the problem was that Ford’s culture at the time suffered from a tendency to ignore junior staff. Only when a senior engineer literally saw the charred hulk of a Pinto and reported it did Ford address the quality control failure. Law firm mistakes may not be as deadly as Ford’s, but the consequences for those firms that ignore their quality control responsibilities could be deadly serious for the firm and its clients. Best to drive safely.

Karen Dunn and Bill Isaacson may work in D.C., but when people think about the blue chip clientele these litigators bring to the table, there’s a bit of a West Coast vibe. The pair boast clients from a wide array of industries, but are perhaps best known for representing Apple in its throwdown with Qualcomm and their recently announced move to Paul Weiss is likely to bring significant business from Oracle and Uber as well.

So it should come as no surprise that the unveiling of this lateral move was packaged with an announcement from firm chair Brad Karp announcing [a planned expansion](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/06/11/star-litigators-karen-dunn-and-bill-isaacson-leave-boies-schiller-for-paul-weiss/) to the Northern California market.

“We have been thinking about entering the Northern California market for a while,” Karp said. “This is an exciting first step in that direction.”

To date, Paul Weiss has focused on its New York and D.C. presences, with an outpost in Wilmington for good measure. Taking the firm to the West Coast will be big news when they eventually put the plan in action.

And one that coincides with the West Coast downsizing of Dunn and Isaacson’s former firm, Boies Schiller. The firm has experienced a number of high-profile departures over the last several months, with many of the moves flowing out of the West Coast offices. This does generally track the message from Boies Schiller’s leadership, which has said that the transition from a firm based around the named partners would see [big changes in the footprint of the firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/everyone-seems-to-be-overreacting-to-these-boies-schiller-departures/) and a [revamping of its compensation model](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/big-changes-on-the-horizon-for-boies-schiller-bonuses/). Losing Dunn and Isaacson was probably inevitable in this reorientation process — whether getting out of this area sets up the firm better in the long-run remains to be seen of course.

For now, Paul Weiss is casting its eyes westward and the Bay Area mainstays will soon have a new kid on the block to deal with.

The field of commercial litigation finance has exhibited explosive growth in recent years as a means to finance claims, hedge risk, and fund operating expenses. For both corporations and law firms, there has been an ever-broadening acceptance of litigation finance as not just a viable option, but a powerful one.

However, as it is a relatively new phenomenon, information and insights about the benefits of and process around litigation finance remain unevenly distributed throughout the legal profession. In order to address this knowledge gap, we offer today a free new eBook.

[Mastering Litigation Finance: A Guide For Lawyers](https://lakewhillans.com/mastering-litigation-finance-a-guide-for-lawyers/) is a collection of advice from the experts at Lake Whillans, addressing high-level topics to deepen your understanding of this burgeoning area of the law. Among the topics addressed in this guide are choosing a litigation funder, pricing considerations, communication with funders, and much more.

# Kasowitz Does Right By Its Associates
## It's all part of a new associate focus.

Being kept in the dark about your end of the year bonus is no fun. Especially when the firm has a pretty good idea what the bonuses will look like. This year, kudos go to Kasowitz Benson Torres for veering away from their traditional end of December announcement, letting associates know nice and early what their bonuses will be. Our tipsters seem thrilled with the news, and see the move as part of a larger associate-focused plan:

I am happy to see the firm taking a proactive approach to get the memo out to associates early this year, as opposed to waiting until around the end of December to announce, as they have done in the past. This consideration and timing adjustment is in line with other associate-friendly changes that the firm has made over the past few months under the new leadership of co-managing directors Wally Schwartz and Cindy Kelly. Some of the new changes include offering standing desks to associates, decreasing medical contribution rates by 10% (for the majority of plans), upgrading technology and exploring other potential changes that will benefit the firm’s associates.

And they’ll be matching the Cravath scale, which just tops off the good news:

Class of 2017 — $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2016 — $15,000
Class of 2015 — $25,000
Class of 2014 — $50,000
Class of 2013 — $65,000

Class of 2011 — $90,000
Class of 2010 — $100,000
Class of 2009 — $100,000

The requirement for the bonus is 2150 hours, which is on the high side, but all pro bono, new business development, new matters in process, recruiting, Kasowitz University, and certain other non-billable hours all count towards meeting the standard. There’s even some extra money for those that made “extraordinary contributions”

Congratulations to Kasowitz associates. It must be nice to have this resolved so early in December!

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text (646-820-8477), or tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). We always keep our sources anonymous — and that includes our sources for bonus stories. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks for your help.

# Morning Docket: 10.10.18
## * Oh boy, it looks like we've got a new person to lock up. People who attended Trump's MAGA rally in Iowa last night broke out into chants of ""lock her up!"" after the president wondered whether Senator Dianne Feinstein leaked a letter containing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. [[The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/410681-trump-rally-crowd-chants-lock-her-up-about-feinstein)] * Just because Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court doesn't mean that student organizers at Yale Law are giving up. Yale Law Students Demanding Better will be entering a ""new phase of advocacy,"" by getting politically involved, registering voters, and joining grassroots movements. [[Yale Daily News](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2018/10/09/law-school-organizers-reflect-plan-post-kavanaugh/)] * Elon Musk hired Williams & Connolly chairman Dane Butswinkas to help him with the hot securities mess he's created. He may have settled his case with the SEC, but a judge still has to accept their agreement and his tweet calling the agency the “Shortseller Enrichment Commission” might not help him. [[Big Law Business](https://biglawbusiness.com/musk-hires-williams-connolly-chairman-butswinkas-in-sec-case/)] * Keila Ravelo, the former Biglaw partner who pleaded guilty to tax evasion and conspiracy to commit wire fraud charges last year, will be sentenced today in her $7.8 million scheme to cheat her firms and clients. The government is asking for six years behind bars and three years of supervised release. [[New Jersey Law Journal](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2018/10/09/ex-big-law-partner-to-be-sentenced-wednesday-in-7-8m-law-firm-fraud-scheme/)] * Women have been treated unfairly in the legal profession for far too long, and maybe that's why the number of women-owned firms has been dramatically increasing. As a partner in your own firm, the compensation will be fair, promotions will be merit-based, and no one is going to sexually harass you. What's not to like?

# Will More Biglaw Firms Cut Jobs Now That Fenwick Has Opened The Floodgates On Layoffs?

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Once more, we find the regrettable reality of yet another tech-centric firm being hit by layoffs. Any firm that is heavily invested in industries that are still lagging in the current economy may come to this same resolution.

— [Summer Eberhard](https://laterallink.com/team/summer-eberhard/), a California-based legal recruiter at Lateral Link, in comments given to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/fenwick-west-laying-off-nearly-10-of-attorneys-staff) on Fenwick & West’s recent decision to [slash “just under” 10% of the firm’s attorneys and staff](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/02/layoffs-literally-decimate-am-law-100-firm/). Eberhard went on to note that these layoffs shouldn’t “sound alarms with associates that their firm may be next,” because many firms have already adjusted their headcounts accordingly. She thinks there is hope for the future, though, saying, “The fact is that corporate transactional practices at firms are slow but I am cautiously optimistic that we have already hit the bottom and work will be picking back up over the next year.”

# Controversial Former Biglaw Attorney Relaunches His Career As Internet Mogul

Picture it — 2009. The economy is rapidly going down the toilet. But you’re a recent Stanford Law grad, so things are supposed to work out for you. But at the Biglaw firm you’re at, Dewey & LeBoeuf, there doesn’t seem to be enough work to go around. Now they’re offering “deferral time” to associates who want a third of their salary in exchange for a year off. So you take the deal, and launch a whole new career outside of the law.

That’s [the story](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/07/a-genius-use-of-deferral-time/?rf=1) of [Mahbod Moghadam](https://www.everipedia.com/mahbod.moghadam/) up through 2010. That’s when he launched [Rap Genius](http://rap.genius.com/), a lyric annotation website. But it hasn’t all been smooth sailing for Moghadam once he’d escaped the clutches of Biglaw. Moghadam and his fellow Rap Genius co-founders, Yale undergrad classmates Tom Lehman and Ilan Zechory, seemed to [court controversy](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-inside-story-of-how-rap-genius-fired-a-cofounder--and-just-raised-40-million-annotated-2014-7). In tech circles they were known for their antics, and then there was their link-building strategy that got them [kicked off of Google](http://genius.com/Genius-founders-rap-genius-is-back-on-google-annotated).

Oh, yeah, and he was fired from the venture he’d co-founded.

After the [Santa Barbara mass shooting](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/20/mass-shooter-elliot-rodger-isla-vista-killings-report) in which Elliot Rodger killed six people and injured another fourteen before killing himself, Rodger left behind a manifesto. This autobiography detailed the reasons why he wanted “revenge” on a “cruel world,” and Moghadam uploaded the screed onto the Genius website. And then he annotated with his commentary. Called “weirdly gleeful annotations that ignore the memoir’s context as a prelude to mass murder” [by Gawker](http://gawker.com/rap-genius-co-founders-creepy-comments-on-elliot-rodger-1581469310), Moghadam seemed enamored with Rodger’s prose and made inappropriate comments about the women in the manifesto. Moghadam apologized for his words and the lapse in judgment, but the damage was done, and he resigned from the company he started.

Now he’s reimagining his career once again. I spoke with Moghadam about his latest endeavor as co-founder of Everipedia, an interactive encyclopedia website that he favorably compares to Wikipedia:

It’s like Rap Genius vs the janky old lyrics sites. Everipedia is really easy to use. We have a diverse community that isn’t 99% white men. You can add gifs and videos to pages – it’s more fun! Celebrities can get “Verified Accounts” — on Wikipedia, celebrities aren’t even allowed to edit their own pages, even if it’s 100% facts. Isn’t that silly. Everipedia is easy to edit from your phone, the design is mobile-first. Since we’re for-profit, we can pay people for their hard work.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Moghadam got involved with the Wikipedia competition after the creator, [Sam Kazemian](https://www.everipedia.com/samkazemian12/), showed him his own Everipedia page:

He showed me the site in April 2015. He was a Senior at UCLA at the time, and I was giving a talk about Rap genius at the [Bruin Entrepreneurs](https://www.everipedia.com/bruinentrepreneurs/) organization. He came up to me and showed me MY Everipedia! I flipped out. My dream in life had always been to have a Wikipedia page about me. One time, in 2013, somebody made me one — but Wikipedia deleted it! They decided I’m not important enough. It really made me sad, so seeing my Everipedia page was kind of a “Eureka” moment — I realized, if I wanted a Wikipedia page this much, and they were denying me, there are probably lots of people in the same boat! The site’s growing really fast, already one of the 6K biggest in the U.S., so it seems my hypothesis was on point.

He credits his time in law school, as well as his torts professor and internet activist (and [unsuccessful presidential candidate](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/whose-fault-is-it-harvard-law-prof-larry-lessig-had-to-quit-running-for-president/)) [Larry Lessig](https://abovethelaw.com/larry-lessig/), for igniting his passion in the internet, calling him a “brilliant, inspiring teacher.” But like so many who attend law school, he was not motivated by a great passion for the law, but because of a lack of viable other options. Though he doesn’t regret the experience, saying, “I think it’s the best thing I ever did. I’m always trying to get young people to go! When you go to law school, nobody f**ks with you. People are afraid. In Democracy in America, de Tocqueville says that lawyers are the U.S. version of aristocracy. I think this observation is spot-on.”

Moghadam missed seeing the worst of the Dewey & LeBouef demise up close and personal, but he says he says he enjoyed his time there. He was at the Biglaw firm for only a year before he took the offer of deferral time, and he seems wistful about the legal career that might have been: “I kind of regret that I didn’t get to be an attorney — but I guess God had different plans. Shalom…” Besides, as he notes, “I liked dressing up for work, it was fun. My business casual attire was always on point.”

Now if he can only steer clear of controversy…

# Associates Better Be Ready For Biglaw Firms To 'Throw More Money' At Them
## All of this money madness won't be stopping anytime soon.

Some firms are responding to the pressure by opening offices in places like Salt Lake, Austin, and others and staffing them as production offices with lots of associates. Others are letting attorneys work from anywhere to try to attract more high quality people outside of the cities where they have offices. Others are creating more interesting career experiences and paths for associates. And then there’s money. We are about to see a lot of firms throw more money at associates.

To sum it up, this is driven by supply and demand. Demand for excellent associates is outstripping supply, raising prices. That will continue until an equilibrium is reached. That will likely happen when the economy cools and deal flow slows.

More than 30,000 votes were cast, so it’s fair to say our 2022 holiday card contest was a great success. Voting went right down to the wire. With 39% of the vote, our top contender was separated from the second-place finisher by 12 percentage points.

Our victor joins the company of previous holiday card contest winners:

Congratulations to… “Lambert & Lambert”! The fictional firm belongs to Eric Lambert, who works in-house as division counsel at Trimble, a technology company. With more than 12,000 votes, Lambert is the deserving winner of our 2022 competition — and the first in-house attorney to ever do so. You can check out his excellent submission — a threat to sue Santa — below.

# The Good Times Roll At This Firm
## Boston firm joins bonus parade.

If you’re getting versed in my pun game, you know that music you hear is Goodwin Procter coming in off the top rope. The Boston-based mainstay [UPDATE: The firm counters that they’re no longer headquartered in their largest office] is upping bonuses to match the accepted DPW standard… with a bit of a happy twist!

First, the usual boilerplate: Goodwin clocked in at No. 23 in the Am Law 100 this year after generating $1,486,263,000 in revenue, amounting to $2,883,000 in profits per equity partner. So no one expected this firm to be anywhere but at the top of the compensation game.

Which, as a refresher, is this:

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

Class	Base Bonus	Special Bonus
Class of 2021	$15,000	N/A
Class of 2020	$20,000	$4,000
Class of 2019	$30,000	$6,000
Class of 2018	$57,500	$11,500
Class of 2017	$75,000	$15,000
Class of 2016	$90,000	$18,000
Class of 2015	$105,000	$21,000
Class of 2014+	$115,000	$23,000
With the 2021 cash pro-rated, of course.

The interesting twist is in the phenomenon of “extra” cash for associates who exceeded 1950 hours or earned a “Distinctive” rating (not to be cynical, but we’re reading that as “in practice groups likely to be poached”). A lot of firms have teased this sort of additional bonus pool, but Goodwin offers a little transparency in announcing that associates can secure “a maximum of 175% of the new scale amount.” Nice!

Congrats, Goodwin folks.

[Earlier this week](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/littler-biglaw-download-associate-lawsuit/), we told you about Biglaw firm Littler Mendelson suing a former associate. Littler maintains in February of this year, Uliana Kozeychuk downloaded 7,900+ documents, including firm proprietary and client data, to an external Dropbox while she was on Family Medical Leave Act leave.

Kozeychuk denied the allegations, saying the downloads were “exclusively personal in nature,” and that Littler’s legal maneuvers are an effort to distract from her complaints of “abuse” by Littler shareholders — even [posting](https://twitter.com/UKozeychuk) about the case to social media with the hashtag [#TimesUpLittler](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TimesUpLittler?src=hashtag_click).

However, an in-camera review of Kozeychuk’s documents in her Dropbox, Gmail, and other accounts from July 1 through February 28 found confidential firm material. Texas Associate Judge Tahira Merritt ordered a third-party company, TransPerfect, to “immediately segregate these [confidential] documents and deliver them to counsel for Littler,” and that Kozeychuk “shall not maintain any copies of the confidential information.” The exact amount of confidential information found in Kozeychuk’s possession is unknown.

Of the discovery, Kozeychuk [told Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/1590771), “I have reached out to the judge and counsel to obtain information as to what docs the order is referencing so I can provide my position on whether they are actually confidential or not as I am not aware of any confidential docs being present in any of my accounts and am shocked by the court’s claiming that I do.”

Littler said they’re “extremely pleased with the court’s ruling, as our sole focus in this case has been on ensuring the protection of client and firm confidential information.”

“Judge Merritt’s interim review of a portion of the documents Ms. Kozeychuk took from Littler identified many as being confidential information of the firm and its clients, as asserted by Littler,” the firm said in a statement. “The case is ongoing and the remainder of the issues to be resolved are the subject of our application for a temporary injunction. Littler will continue to be diligent in taking all necessary steps to safeguard sensitive information.”

The firm’s counsel, Michele Naudin of Lynn Pinker Hurst & Schwegmann LLP, said there is potentially more confidential information in Kozeychuk’s possession.

“We were not privy to Judge Merritt’s discussions with the forensic team, but we do know that Judge Merritt limited the scope of her review,” Naudin said in an email. “She did not review all 10,000 docs that Littler identified as having been uploaded and removed from Littler systems. If the court grants our application for a temporary injunction, all documents will be preserved and reviewed by independent licensed forensic professionals. Kozeychuk will no longer have access to any confidential Information.”

It doesn’t look like this acrimonious case will be over any time soon.

# Jones Day Can't Even Raise Salaries Without Screwing Someone Over
## Some people don't seem to understand the idiosyncrasies of Jones Day's compensation structure.

Earlier this week, Jones Day announced, via [memo to their incoming summer associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/jones-days-notorious-black-box-now-starts-at-190k/), that they’d be increasing first-year salaries by $10,000 and adjusting the summer pay scale accordingly. In other words, Jones Day would join the Milbank scale, at least until their notorious [black box compensation system](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/) took over.

So far so good.

Then first-year tipsters starting complaining to us that Jones Day hadn’t raised salaries for first-years after all. Which isn’t true. They just forgot the Jones Day cardinal rule — the rule that motivates their shadowy black box system — “it’s all about cynicism.”

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The memo couldn’t be more clear — first-year compensation is going up $10,000, so summer pay is going up by a prorated amount. But if you’re a current Jones Day first-year, don’t expect to see that money. They mean the next class of first-years will start at $190K. That’s all that matters when they show up to on-campus interviews. And at the end of the day, that’s all a salary increase is really about — not showing up to recruiting with your proverbial genitals in your hands. Paying the current crop of associates is purely gratuitous.

And Jones Day doesn’t do gratuitous or they’d be paying a transparent Biglaw scale all the way up. This is the life you’ve chosen, Jones Day associates!

# Ropes & Gray Splitting With Around 100 Lawyers And Staffers
## Is this the beginning of downsizing for Biglaw IP?

In a statement released yesterday, Ropes & Gray announced that they will be sending around 100 lawyers and staffers to form a new spinoff firm to handle an important chunk of the firm’s intellectual property work.

The details of the spinoff are not entirely hammered out, but the new firm will open offices in New York and Silicon Valley and take Ropes & Gray’s patent prosecution practice along for the ride, though “other Ropes & Gray lawyers, technical advisors and staff in the IP rights management practice” will be joining the new team. According [to its statement](http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/files/ropes-gray-statement-3-7-17.pdf), Ropes & Gray will retain “other IP rights management capabilities, such as trademark prosecution and patent analysis, strategy and counseling.”

From [Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202780785662/Ropes--Gray-to-Shed-Lawyers-Retreat-From-Patent-Work-in-Firm-Shakeup/), reporting on a conversation with Joseph Guiliano, the new firm’s leader:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“We realized that there were certain trends that happened in Big Law, but now there’s almost a next-level type of analysis going on,” Guiliano said. “For us, it just made sense to work at a smaller firm.”

Guiliano may prefer the generality of the “certain trends” language, but those trends inevitably relate to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board streamlining the patent dispute process — UPDATE: Or maybe not? More on this after the quote:

[As noted by The American Lawyer last month](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202778422968), the creation five years ago of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board—a specialty for the recently departed Baughman—moved patent disputes into a less costly litigation venue. The creation of PTAB practices [tightened competition in the IP arena](http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/id=1202738703773/IP-Boutiques-Adjust-to-Client-Use-of-Patent-Office-Reviews), even as larger, general practice firms [moved into the area](http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/id=1202766461339/Kenyons-Closure-Follows-Trend-of-Disappearing-IP-Boutiques-in-NYC), many by [acquiring boutiques](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202747505079/Big-Firms-Net-IP-Boutiques-as-Merger-Spate-Continues).

“Looking at IP more broadly, PTAB definitely moved litigation to quicker, more efficient forums, and a [U.S.] Supreme Court ruling reduced some IP litigation,” said [Ropes & Gray Chairman R. Bradford] Malt. “I think you see a lot of big firms now realizing that they’re a bit oversized in IP.”

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The “certain trends” driving this is not really the creation of the PTAB proceedings. The IPR proceedings have really wrecked the profits in patent litigation (suing others with issued patents), but R&G is keeping its patent litigation group.  It is spinning off its patent prosecution group.  The IPR proceedings have perhaps reduced demand for prosecution (getting patents in the first place) by cooling the patent arms race. But that is rather indirect I think.
The “certain trends” that are driving this is the fact that tech companies have been more and more willing to pay solo practitioners and low cost patent prosecution boutiques to prosecute their patents. I understand this was the case before the recession, but it no doubt sped up then. As a result, patent prosecution is becoming a commodity (the firms are using this terminology), and the pricing for this commodity simply does not support the profit margins necessary for BigLaw. For instance, the price for responding to an office action (one very commoditized part of the patent prosecution process) has already pushed below $2,500 and is perhaps even down to $2,000 even for marquee clients. This means that a mid-level associate might only have 4 to 5 hours to work on this, whereas it should really take 6 to 10 hours on many of these cases. Firms have worked hard to get associate hours down to this level per office action (e.g., just being faster, have paralegals do more and more of the work, having lower cost technical specialists do the work instead of associates, etc.), but they are hitting a limit. So if associates cannot spend less time, and clients are demanding static or even lower pricing, then the firms certainly cannot raise rates in the foreseeable future… and well now they are paying associates $20K more a year.  And hence patent prosecution becomes increasingly out of place in BigLaw, thus the move to a smaller firm with lower overhead (I am assuming) and ultimately lower rates and probably lower associate salaries / partner profits (I am also assuming).
Perhaps it’s the dawning of a new era for IP boutiques after the days of Biglaw growth saw many smaller IP firms gobbled up in the mad dash for revenue — a trend that Ropes & Gray actively participated in when it merged with Fish & Neave. Now, no one is suggesting that this is an unwinding of the 2004 acquisition of Fish & Neave, even if the new firm will be led by Fish & Neave alum Guiliano. That said, the new firm has not yet come up with a name for itself.

Perhaps “Fish & Neave” hits the nail on the head.

# Justice Filtered: Plans To Manage Diversity In The Federal Judiciary
## Even with the laudable notion of a more diverse judiciary, aspects of this plan may actually function towards cutting off the nose to spite the face.

Ed. note: Please welcome Dr. Adam Feldman of [Empirical SCOTUS](https://empiricalscotus.com/about/) to the pages of Above the Law.

Since Donald Trump’s inauguration in 2017, his administration has made major changes to the federal judiciary. This includes filling two Supreme Court seats along with a total of 146 confirmed Article III (federal district, appellate, Supreme Courts, and the court of international trade) judges. Democrats saw their last Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, fade away without a confirmation hearing. The entire balance of the federal judiciary has been transformed over the past couple of years and for the first time in recent history, Democratic groups are trying to make a campaign issue out of federal court reform. Several groups have come forward with plans to reform or transform the federal judiciary to varying degrees. These plans range from Pete Buttigieg’s [court packing plan](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/inside-pete-buttigieg-s-plan-overhaul-supreme-court-n1012491) to attempts to employ different [procedures for selecting judges and justices](https://prospect.org/article/ending-biglaw-racket-conversation-brian-fallon). One [consistent critique](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/08/democrats-courts-what-will-it-take-debates-election-2020.html) that follows Democratic nominees though is their lack of consensus on a plan for the courts.

Last week, the group [Demand Justice](https://www.demandjustice.org/), headed by Brian Fallon and Christopher Kang, laid out a novel plan for judicial reform in an article in [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/no-more-corporate-judges/596383/). This plan has the goal of bringing diversity to the federal judiciary and limiting nominees to lawyers that have not worked as corporate “Biglaw” partners. To this end, Fallon and co-author Christopher Kang wrote, “If Democrats truly want the next president’s arrival to mark an inflection point when it comes to the composition of the judiciary, we should elevate those whose full-time jobs were on the front lines defending our democracy during this dark period, not those whose paychecks were drawn from corporate clients.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
They follow this by laying out some bare bones methodology for how this would look in practice: “For starters, there is the question of how to define who counts as a corporate lawyer. We would define it as a lawyer who achieves partner status at a corporate-law firm — such as the large firms known collectively as Biglaw — or who serves as in-house counsel at a large corporation. This would mean lawyers who briefly worked as associates at firms during an early phase in their career would not be excluded.”

While corporate law experience may not be the optimal choice to fill 100 percent of the slots in the federal courts, an effort at increasing diversity is a far cry from total exclusion.  UC Irvine’s Professor Rick Hasen provided a [thoughtful response](https://twitter.com/rickhasen/status/1164227895813791744?s=20) explaining some of the problematic aspects he saw with this plan.  Concurrently, civil rights attorney Sasha Samberg-Champion opined that this proposal could have been designed [as a bargaining chip ](https://twitter.com/ssamcham/status/1164317621891796992?s=20)to start the conversation of judicial reform rather than as a (potentially) binding contract. Democratic nominee Elizabeth Warren [came out in favor of the substance of the plan](https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1164217624437436422?s=20), while not clearly on the side of committing to a no corporate lawyer rule.

Even with the laudable notion of a more diverse judiciary, aspects of this plan may actually function towards cutting off the nose to spite the face. That is to say — while diversity is an unquestionably noble attribute and something sorely needed in the courts, means to get there that include excluding a whole subset of incredibly qualified judicial candidates raise potential problems in their own rights.  There are examples of corporate lawyers who became great jurists, just as there are of corporate lawyers who have a penchant to rule in favor of big businesses (a common [critique of the Roberts Court from the likes of Senator Sheldon Whitehouse](https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Roberts%20Five%205-4%20Cases.pdf) among others).

Leaving the merits of this plan aside for a moment to focus on researching the link between a background as a corporate partner and federal judging, two things are immediately clear. In terms of free resources, even comprehensive sources like the [FJC’s Biographical Directory of Article III Judges](https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges) lacks specific information on judges’ work experience.  Take for instance Judge Leslie Abrams who sits on the District Court for the Middle District of Georgia.  The [FJC’s website lists](https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/abrams-leslie-joyce) her law firm experience as “private practice” for the years 2003 through 2010. If we want to learn more, we cannot go to her bio on her court’s website. The [court’s website](https://www.gamd.uscourts.gov/leslie-j-abrams-gardner) actually doesn’t provide any information about Judge Abrams’s background.  Indeed, the most reliable source for this information appears to judges’ senate questionnaires filled out during the nomination process.  [From this we see](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Abrams%20Senate%20Questionnaire%20Final.pdf) that Abrams worked as an associate at Skadden Arps and Kilpatrick Townsend during this period (note that Wikipedia and Ballotpedia have biographical information on many federal judges but it is often in summary form and thus is almost always incomplete).

Actually evaluating the merits of this no corporate lawyer as judges policy involves more than just theorizing. The Atlantic article, for example, states that upon examining current federal appeals court judges, “60 percent were once corporate-law partners.” The implications of this statistic are really in the eye of the beholder.  To some this may seem staggering, but to others this might be quite obvious. This statistic shows that the backgrounds of federal judges are not representative of the attorney population across the United States as a whole. But is this consequential?  Again, more information may help individual voters determine their positions on this issue for themselves.

It is important to unpack proposals such as that from Demand Justice to understand the ramifications and therefore grasp the costs and benefits of such a plan.  Demand Justice’s methodology for determining who fits within the exclusionary category is a bit vague.  This methodology, as explained earlier, would simply exclude former Biglaw partners and in-house counsel for large corporations from federal judgeships.  One way to begin gauging the merits of such a proposal is through examining what the repercussions would have been had such a plan been in effect at an earlier time. Since this is a proposal for Democratic candidates, we should focus on judges placed on federal courts by a Democratic president.

According to FJC counts, 271 judges were confirmed for their first federal judgeship under President Obama. Obama also nominated several already sitting judges to higher positions (for example, Justice Sotomayor from appeals court judge to Supreme Court Justice), but these elevated judges are not the focus here.  One vague point in Demand Justice’s methodology is its description of Biglaw partners. While there is no universal definition for a Biglaw partner, firm size is the major determining factor here. This analysis used 50 lawyers in a firm as a cut point between big and small law.  Fifty lawyers in a firm is generally good indicia that a firm has the capacity to handle matters for large corporate clients, although it is by no means the only way to gauge this.  Biglaw might mean much larger firms and so the number of judges who previously practiced in such firms might actually be much smaller than those identified herein. Since this notion of a strict cut point for Biglaw is inherently arbitrary though, and because lawyers in a boutique firm might very well handle the same corporate matters as big law attorneys, this at least gives us a place to start the conversation.

Approximately 98 of the 271 new judges, or about 36 percent of the judges identified in this sample, worked as partners at Biglaw firms (those over 50 attorneys in size) at some point prior to their nomination for federal judgeship. These 98 judges are composed of one international trade court judge, 15 courts of appeals judges, and 82 district court judges. While Justice Kagan was an associate at Williams & Connolly, she was never a partner and therefore would not be disqualified under the previously described standards.

The following figure has the positions for all 98 judges who would not be viable nominees if democrats banned nominations of previous Biglaw partners who worked at firms with a minimum of 50 attorneys (click to enlarge).[[1]](#f1)

Three Obama nominees were previously partners at Morrison Foerster, three at Mayer Brown, and three at Munger Tolles. Munger Tolles employs approximately 200 attorneys including Obama’s Solicitor General, Donald Verrilli. Morrison Foerster has over 1,000 attorneys worldwide and Mayer Brown has over 1,500.

Not all firms on this list have such a large number of attorneys, though in multiple offices. Lightfoot Franklin, for example, has two offices, in Houston and Birmingham, and around 60 total attorneys.  When you look at the [matters they handle](https://www.lightfootlaw.com/experience/case-studies) though, many are for large corporate clients and involve large dollar value actions.

Under Demand Justice’s policy, not all potential judges who worked at these firms would be banned from judicial nominations. Several, like Kagan, worked as associates at these firms but did not continue on to the partner level. To get a sense of the firms where more than one of Obama’s first-time judges worked as either an associate or a partner, the next figure has these aggregate data (click to enlarge).

[](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2019/09/F2.png)

Five of Obama’s first-time judges worked at Morrison Foerster. Since we know from the previous figure that three were partners, two must have been associates. The other firms on this list are primarily some of the largest and most successful national and international law firms. These 54 attorneys turned judges hailing from prominent firms in one capacity or another underscores the importance presidents place on experience in highly recognized law practices. This is where many lawyers are trained, and where the majority of lawyers, especially those who matriculate from top-tier schools, go after law school.

Law.com regularly details the statistics of law grads that begin their legal work in Biglaw firms. The schools with the highest percent of 2018 grads going on to work in Biglaw firms according to [law.com’s statistics](https://www.law.com/2019/05/08/law-grads-hiring-report-job-stats-for-the-class-of-2018/) were the following (click to enlarge):

[](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2019/09/F3.png)

Columbia had the highest percentage of grads beginning work at large law firms at 78 percent. The top 10 schools rounded out with Harvard at 58 percent, Georgetown at 56 percent, and University of Chicago at 55 percent of 2018 grads starting their legal careers in Biglaw firms. Suffice it to say that large numbers of lawyers graduating from top schools at least begin their careers in big law.

When we look at Obama’s confirmed judges, many came from the same top-tier schools (click to enlarge).

[](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2019/09/F4.png)

The vast majority of Obama’s confirmed federal judges came from the[ top three ranked ](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/law-rankings)law schools in the country: Harvard, Yale, and Stanford.  Beyond this, in general we see that Obama’s judges mainly hailed from a handful of top-tier law schools, and these law schools were predominately the nation’s top schools, and the schools where the largest percentage of grads went into Biglaw practice.  Perhaps one of the deficits in diversity stems from the few law schools that graduate the majority of federal judges.

Below is a table of all judges that would be potentially banned from seeking judgeships according to the Biglaw partner policy, along with their previous employment and the law school they attended.

Many of the judges who would not be disqualified under this Biglaw partner rule worked in private practices as solo practitioners or with a limited number of partners. This does not necessarily mean they represented different clients than other judicial nominees, but with smaller firms they likely had fewer resources to manage multiple large accounts. Thus, firm size might be a good proxy for the extent of this type of business a firm or attorney can handle.

In the end, this is a question of what matters in judging. Even if we take the importance of diversity on the federal bench as a given, the means to seek this are still unclear.  The bottom line is that voters need to ask themselves what needs to be reformed. We have clusters of judges coming from a top law schools, going into big firm jobs, and we see some continue in these jobs while others go into public interest work, academia, or other non-Biglaw jobs.  Many of Obama’s picks for federal judges worked in the Biglaw world and a large minority went on to become partner in such firms. This may affect the the way they decide cases, but other factors such as political preferences [have been shown to explain](http://www.baserlawprogram.com/uploads/8/9/7/1/8971539/voting_ideologies.pdf) a large percentage of voting behavior as well.  Further statistical research into this subject may illuminate whether the relationship between practicing as a Biglaw partner and supporting corporate interests in judging is truly robust. Without this research, such inferences remain at least somewhat speculative.

Ultimately, voters need to decide what the most important factors are in choosing future federal judges just as politicians must decide on certain criteria that will determine the pool of potential judges they choose from. This may be related to judges’ previous work experiences although this equally may be related to other factors that influence judges’ decisions.  More studies and greater resources may help us understand the correlates between judges’ backgrounds and votes for corporate causes. At this point though, even if the public’s goal is to minimize judges’ votes for corporate causes, the direct link between practicing as a corporate partner and such votes is unclear, and evidence is sparse that practicing as a corporate partner is the most decisive attribute leading to such voting practices.

[ [1]](#reff1) Note that the firms collected here are determined by size and not by practice specialization. It is entirely possible that some firms would not fit the corporate law model described by Demand Justice. Additional information on exactly what constitutes a corporate firm would help further clarify which firms might not fit into this category.

# The Perils Of Thinking That It's All A Game

Every litigator has seen (or been) a person who thinks that litigation is all a game.

There’s the covenant-not-to-compete case where the plaintiff’s lawyer doesn’t care about reality: “One of the 15 employees they stole from us had transferred documents to his home computer for years. He was probably just making it easy to work from home. But the transfer of documents violates company policy! And we can convince the jury that this was part of a scheme to steal information! I’m putting it into evidence! Who cares if  we’re implying something that isn’t really true? It’s just a game; we have to win this trial. They don’t pay me $1,000 an hour to lose.”

Why are you doing this?

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
You don’t need the evidence. It’s not true. And proffering this will steal a bit of your soul.

It’s not just litigation; it’s also real life. Stop.

You’ve seen (or done) the same thing in many different kinds of cases. There’s the personal injury case where one aspect of the injury plainly wasn’t caused by the defendant, but you seek to recover for it anyway: “I have to maximize damages!  This is just a game; we have to recover as much as possible at trial. Let the defendant try to sort it out.”

There’s the defense that’s silly if you spend any time thinking about it, but you file a motion on it anyway: “If we convince the judge, then it’s a winner! We’re not selling truth here; we’re selling arguments! It’s just a game.”

Who cares? Litigation isn’t real life anyway!

Now think of the folks in politics. They tweet their insane crap because it will help them get re-elected. Why not? “I’m not selling truth here; I’m selling myself to the public, and I have to get re-elected. I’ll say whatever’s necessary to achieve that goal. This is all a game.”

It isn’t real life anyway.

Think of the folks on television or social media: “I’ll increase my viewership, or my number of listeners, or my number of followers, or whatever I’m tracking. I’ll say that vaccines don’t work! That’ll grab ’em! That’ll be great! The idea is to increase my public appeal, and this will achieve that goal. Who cares if I’m speaking the truth? This is all a game.”

Who cares if you contributed to the deaths of 319,000 people?

And it increased your audience! Don’t bother to slow down and think.

I have some news for you: You’ve been doing this for so long, and so intensely, that you think it’s all a game. It’s not; it’s real life. You’re tearing America apart, and you’re killing people.

And you’re sacrificing a piece of your soul.

Slow down and think.

Abby Gordon

Ed. note: This is Part I of a three-part series on the timeline for a lateral associate move and the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://www.laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors. [Abby Gordon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abbygordon/) is a Senior Director in the New York office where she focuses on placements of partners, counsel, and associate candidates for law firms and in-house. Her focus is primarily on the New York, Boston, and European markets. Abby holds a J.D., cum laude, from Georgetown University Law Center and a B.A. in Government and Romance Languages, magna cum laude, from Dartmouth College. Prior to recruiting, Abby spent seven years as a corporate associate with Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, focusing on capital markets transactions for Latin American clients in New York, and for the last five years for European clients in Paris, France. She regularly participates in professional and career panels and has published numerous articles offering career advice and tracking trends in the legal market (links to which are on her LinkedIn profile). She is a member of the New York, Massachusetts, and Maine state bars. Abby is fluent in French and Spanish, and enjoys dabbling in Portuguese and Italian.

I have spoken with a number of associates over the years who aren’t sure what the timing and process for a lateral move look like. And why should you? If you are contemplating your first move, you may know that the process is very different from when you first chose a firm as a summer or first-year associate. But beyond that, it’s a bit of a mystery. I am outlining the process here, as it’s helpful to understand the timing and some of the intricacies of a lateral move in order to best strategize that move.

The Lateral Timeline & When to Apply

I am often asked if there is a “best time” to apply to new positions. The answer? Yes, there is. The best time to apply is when you see an opportunity that interests you. Certainly there are more openings in January, February, and March just after bonus season. But there are also more candidates applying at this time. You never know when a position with a specific group will come along again. Many firms are reluctant to consider résumés from even the most stellar candidates if there is no specific need to fill. So if you see an opportunity that tempts you, don’t delay. Jump on it.

As a general rule, a lateral move probably takes longer than you would expect. There are always exceptions, but for an associate looking to move within the same city, we rarely see less than 2-3 months between the day we send the résumé and the associate’s start date with the new firm. But don’t complain — partner, counsel, and in-house moves can take much longer.

I will outline below in italics the best-case timeline for how the process may play out, and note some common causes for delays as well as discuss some additional factors to consider.

Interviews

Week 1: Send materials to firms

Weeks 2-3: Screening interview

Firms may respond to a candidate’s submission immediately. It’s also quite common for firms to wait to receive a critical mass of submissions, and then select which candidates to interview. It’s not unheard of for a firm to inquire 6+ months after submission if the candidate is still on the market. With the typical successful move, the screening interview would take place a within a couple of weeks of the submission. Every firm does it differently, but typically a firm will ask for the candidate’s availability over the following two weeks. A screening interview is usually with one or two people, 30-60 minutes.

Weeks 3-4: Full round of interviews

If the screen goes well, a firm will ask the candidate back for a full round of interviews. Sometimes this is immediate or a week or so later. On occasion, a firm will conduct screening interviews for all candidates before moving on to full rounds.

Weeks 4-5: 3rd/final round of interviews (if necessary)

Sometimes a firm will make an offer after the full or second round of interviews. But oftentimes, a third round is required, either because that is standard or because a key partner was unavailable to meet during the second round. For this same reason, a fourth round may even be necessary at times.

A number of factors can slow down the interview process. For example:

- You may need to travel for interviews.
- Holidays intervene (including most of July and August when interviews are always harder to schedule).
- The team you need to interview with may get too busy to interview.
- A key partner is out of the office.
- The firm may be unsure of their need to hire for that position, so speeding up the process is just not a priority.
- The firms may have a hiring freeze. Often the freeze can be overridden, but this takes time.
- As the candidate, you may choose to slow the process in order to see how the process plays out with other firms where you’re interviewing.
A few notes on interviewing in another city from where you currently live:

- Keep in mind, this is not the summer associate process. There are exceptions, but most firms do not pay for travel for first-round interviews. I would not advise asking them to do so. Firms assume that if you’re serious about a geographic move, you’re probably visiting that new city regularly anyway or at the very least that the cost of one plane ticket is not going to dissuade you from fulfilling your personal and professional goals.
- Ideally, you may try to organize phone or videoconference screening interviews from your home city. Alternatively, it’s often very helpful to plan submissions around a pre-planned trip. Saying you will be in that city anyway (with the implication that it’s on your own dime) can tip the balance in terms of scoring an interview. Firms will often skip the screening interview in this case, or be ready to schedule the full round of interviews in that same week if all goes well with the screening.
When you work with one sole recruiter, we can help immensely to juggle and optimize the timing of the process with various firms. We can advise when delaying or rescheduling an interview is likely harmless and when it could jeopardize your candidacy. Where you are advancing with other firms, we can often push the remaining firms to set up an interview or speed up the interview and offer process.

‘We got offers!’

Fall recruiting season is upon us at law schools across the country, and this year’s crop of summer associates were on their very best behavior in the hopes of earning big, [fat paychecks as first-year associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) after graduating from law school.

Last summer, Biglaw firms extended offers of permanent employment to prospective law school graduates at [historic rates](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/biglaw-offer-rates-for-law-school-student-recruitment-reaches-historic-highs/), with the aggregate offer rate jumping to almost 97 percent and the acceptance rate for those offers reaching a high of 88 percent (which was significantly higher than acceptance rates measured before the recession)

We’ll have to wait for the official numbers to find out how well firms did, but in the meantime, we know of several firms that will have full classes of incoming associates bopping around with visions of $190K salaries dancing in their heads.

Following up on [last week’s post](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/summer-associate-offer-rates-2019-which-firms-had-100-percent-offer-rates/) on Biglaw offer rates, here is a list of firms that have given offers to all of their summer associates:

- Brown Rudnick (firmwide)
- Crowell & Moring (firmwide)
- Drinker Biddle (Philadelphia)
- Goodwin Procter (Boston)
- Holland & Knight (Boston)
- Holland & Hart (Billings)
- Holland & Hart (Denver)
- Holland & Hart (Las Vegas)
- Holland & Hart (Salt Lake City)
- Jones Day (New York)
- Latham & Watkins (New York)
- Morrison & Foerster (Washington, D.C.)
- Norton Rose Fulbright US (firmwide)
- Potter Anderson & Corroon (Wilmington, DE)
- Quinn Emanuel (New York)
- Reed Smith (Chicago)
- Ropes & Gray (firmwide)
- Shearman & Sterling (New York)

- Skadden Arps (Washington, D.C.)
- Thompson & Knight (firmwide)

- WilmerHale (Boston)
- Winston & Strawn (Chicago)
- Winston & Strawn (New York)
If you have offer rate additions to this list to share or if you have corrections to the list — e.g., an office listed above that does NOT belong on the 100 percent list — please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Summer%20Associate%20Offer%20Rates) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Summer Associate Offer Rates”), or text us (646-820-8477).

Right now, it’s more newsworthy if a firm does NOT have a 100 percent offer rate than if it does. On that note, please let us hear about firms that are NOT issuing offers to all their summer associates. If you know of a firm or an office with an unusually low offer rate — which we will arbitrarily define here as something under 66 percent, or two-thirds — please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Low%20Offer%20Rate) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Low Offer Rate”). If we hear about any firms with particularly low offer rates, we will investigate.

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

The litigation powerhouse of [Boies Schiller Flexner](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/boies-schiller-flexner-llp/) is looking ahead to the [future](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/on-the-future-of-boies-schiller/). It recently [spun off its corporate practice](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/boies-schillers-corporate-group-finds-a-new-home/) so it could focus on its core strength in litigation. And now it’s strengthening that core, with the addition of lawyers from a leading boutique.

Today BSF made the following announcement (press release posted in full [on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/boies-schiller-picks-up-a-top-boutique/2/)):

Boies Schiller Flexner is pleased to announce that Caldwell Leslie & Proctor—one of California’s preeminent  litigation boutiques—will join its ranks, effective April 17. The combination of these firms will give BSF added strength to serve clients in key California markets, and will provide Caldwell Leslie’s attorneys with a global platform from which to serve existing and future clients.

“The attorneys at Caldwell Leslie are highly respected trial lawyers, and they share our values as litigators and our dedication to excellence. Any major law firm would be proud to have them as members, and we are fortunate that they have chosen to join us,” said BSF Chairman David Boies.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
On its [website](http://www.caldwell-leslie.com/), Caldwell Leslie lists 27 lawyers. We understand that all or almost all of them will be joining Boies Schiller Flexner. Lawyers making the move include Christopher Caldwell, who was named “Lawyer of the Year” by the Los Angeles Business Journal last year; his co-founder Michael Leslie, an expert in complex environmental litigation; David Willingham, chair of Caldwell Leslie’s white-collar practice, who will now lead BSF’s West Coast investigations and white-collar practice; Robyn Crowther, whose practice focuses on legal malpractice, trade secret, and employment disputes; and Michael Roth, who handles class actions and unfair competition cases.

In his recent [Forbes interview](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidparnell/2017/03/07/jonathan-schiller-boies-schiller-how-a-good-law-firm-should-be-managed/#1dd234c92eca) with David Parnell, BSF co-founder Jonathan Schiller listed getting “the very best people to join our firm” as one of four keys to the firm’s success — and this latest transaction seems very consistent with that vision. Congratulations to Boies Schiller Flexner on its enhanced West Coast presence, and congratulations to the Caldwell Leslie lawyers joining BSF.

UPDATE (3 p.m.): There’s additional coverage over at [Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/boies-schiller-acquires-los-angeles-litigation-boutique-caldwell-leslie/), which reports that all 17 of Caldwell Leslie’s shareholders will join Boies Schiller Flexner as partners.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# School Prayer Coach Told Supreme Court He Wanted His Job Back... He Hasn't Bothered To Show Up

Remember when a former high school football coach said he was fired for saying “quiet” and “private” prayers and asked the United States Supreme Court to erase the Establishment Clause from the First Amendment and force the school to hire him back?

Well, it turns out that the coach — whose prayers were not “quiet” or “private” and wasn’t even really fired — got his wish. But Coach Kennedy hasn’t even bothered to show up for work.

Three weeks into the season.

O.J. put up a show of looking for the real killers longer than this guy acted like he cared about coaching.

[From the Seattle Times](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/the-story-of-the-praying-bremerton-coach-keeps-getting-more-surreal/):

“He’s had the paperwork for his reinstatement since August 8th, and we haven’t gotten so much as a phone call,” says Karen Bevers, spokesperson for Bremerton schools.

Instead, as the Bremerton Knights were prepping for the season in August, Kennedy was up in Alaska, [meeting with former Vice President Mike Pence](https://www.facebook.com/coachjoekennedyofficial/posts/pfbid02SaR6PGhxqxpwfZ3g51Hp8AYB5HG1xxCJTQEdg5k4xGqf54qiCMRfLAmhzv9GWdvfl?__cft__%5B0%5D=AZVmCb4kz30bfKf1ulw5TDmz5O0elfsd6E0UUOroxCyw18wSXnAo7seHCQNxSfpshUtvHsrdejIQx0n2g1Virx1TpTSF7whPL6kL-XZ19CrOh7FeNf_e6sXjwmRk7OMZM8hSPB2WzFPiCJ0qmJr-EiW2NfxcIdmGSrJyFerbn7NaNQ&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R) and evangelist Franklin Graham. On the eve of the first game, which the Knights won, Kennedy was in Milwaukee [being presented with an engraved .22-caliber rifle](https://www.facebook.com/supportcoachkennedy/photos/a.1647146798894979/3289597531316556) at an American Legion convention.

On the other hand, Bremerton High School’s varsity football team is 2-1 right now, so I guess they didn’t need anyone praying for them after all!

It shouldn’t shock anyone that Kennedy might have led the Court astray about his desire to return to the sidelines because his whole case amounted to one misleading representation after another. Starting, of course, with the fact that he was never even fired.

“He was not terminated,” [School spokesperson Karen] Bevers said. The head coach at the time had moved on, as did most of the coaching staff.

This did not stop Kennedy’s lawyers from telling the Supreme Court repeatedly that he was fired.

“The record is clear that Coach Kennedy was fired for that midfield prayer,” lawyer Paul Clement told the nine justices in the first 15 seconds of [the oral arguments of the case in April](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2021/21-418_3e04.pdf). The words “fired,” “fire” or “firing” were used 16 times in the hour and a half session.

Paul Clement took out a whole editorial to [whine about being forced out of Kirkland for his beliefs](https://www.wsj.com/articles/2nd-amendment-bruen-new-york-gun-case-supreme-court-decision-kirkland-and-ellis-rule-of-law-constitution-11656017031), as opposed to [being a stain on the firm’s reputation without providing any discernible upside](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/paul-clement-laments-kirklands-cancel-culture-or-capitalism-as-the-case-may-be/). In Coach Kennedy’s defense, the guy hired one of the world’s experts in blaming everyone else for the consequences of your own actions.

The respectable conservative legal types told me this was a real example of religious liberty under attack. They said former SG Paul Clement would never misrepresent facts. They said the Court’s opinion was well-considered.

None of these seems to be true. [https://t.co/RbwWdgAb9y](https://t.co/RbwWdgAb9y)

Still, as the school carries on holding open a coaching position that the plaintiff seems uninterested in doing, I wonder how much Paul Clement knew about his client. Did he know the coach hadn’t been fired when he said repeatedly told the Court that he had been? Did he know his client hadn’t even applied to get his job back? Did he know that Kennedy wasn’t going to bother to go back to coaching?

Because if he knew the correct answers to those questions when he went before the Court and said the opposite, that seems like a problem. Not for this Supreme Court, of course, but other entities might care about that.

# Do Today’s Work Today
## 'Don’t stop thinking about tomorrow, it’ll soon be here.'

My grandfather used to have a saying: “Do today’s work today.” This is, I appreciate, [not a unique idea](http://www.ihi.org/resources/Pages/Changes/CommittoDoingTodaysWorkToday.aspx), and indeed [is pretty widespread](https://modernretrowoman.com/do-todays-work-today/), but I’m going to attribute that to it being a generally [good universal principle](https://books.google.com/books?id=y-xEAQAAMAAJ&pg=PT194&lpg=PT194&dq=%22do+today%27s+work+today%22&source=bl&ots=7hNcKtrKNn&sig=ACfU3U3XRnZZKgNlccsPlB7QnH1dCiHVbQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjdqMSN9cDqAhUTu54KHRk9DsY4ChDoATAAegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=%22do%20today's%20work%20today%22&f=false) to live by. Fleetwood Mac, whose songs are all secretly productivity tips, even sang about the idea on the third single from Rumours, “Don’t Stop.”

Most procrastination can be solved by just doing today whatever you need to do today. It’s easy to fall into a hope of a magical future tomorrow where whatever stopped you from getting done today what you wanted to will no longer exist. But tomorrow is usually the same as today and yesterday. If today you were slowed down by a toothache or a broken arm, you will probably still have a toothache or a broken arm tomorrow, or at least injure yourself in some other way as you seem accident-prone. Or if today you were thrown off by some emergencies, you’re probably going to just get new emergencies tomorrow. Things tend to continue as they have.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Don’t fall into magical thinking. Be realistic about when and how you can complete the tasks that you need to complete, and what will stand in the way. Some things really are one-off circumstances and won’t repeat, but you need to be brutally honest with yourself about whether that’s really what you’re facing.

Being realistic about priorities will also allow you to make better judgments about what can be pushed off until tomorrow. If you are having trouble completing tasks because each day you have 29 “urgent” tasks and only get through five of them, then likely the 24 other weren’t really that urgent. If you find that you’ve pushed 10 of those items forward for three weeks, one day at a time, then those 10 items are really not urgent. In all those cases, the problem is one of proper priorities, and just not trying to do everything in one day would solve at least part of the problem.

Thus, if you do have to adjust priorities and put something off, be realistic about when it will get done. Allowing tasks to simply snowball from one day to the next won’t do anything except confuse your planning and waste time each day as you adjust all tasks. And when you do have to put something off, be realistic about when it needs to get done and will get done.

Also remember the difference between something that has to be done and something that has to be done by you. Very often the real issue with lingering tasks is that they’re best delegated. This folds back into prioritization: the time to realize a task should be delegated is when it comes up. If you decide to delegate only after having pushed the task off a day at a time for two weeks, then you’ve wasted a lot of time.

# Before The COVID-19 Pandemic: The Top 10 Law Schools For Landing Biglaw Jobs
## Can you guess which T14 schools didn't make the cut?

Once upon a time, before a pandemic drove Biglaw firms to put their summer associate programs online or cancel them outright, it could confidently be said that graduates of certain law schools would assuredly land high-paying jobs at some of the largest law firms in the country. Now that the novel coronavirus has taken hold, things aren’t so certain, but it’s still likely that graduates of the very best law schools will get the very best jobs — even if their official start dates are delayed until January 2021.

Today, we’ve got a recently published, unintentional blast from the past when it comes to employment-related law school rankings.

According to [U.S. News](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/slideshows/10-law-schools-that-lead-to-full-time-jobs-at-big-law-firms), based on the 2018 statistics used in the 2021 Best Law Schools rankings, these are the 10 law schools where graduates were most likely to land full-time jobs lasting at least a year at Biglaw firms with more than 500 lawyers.

Can you guess which T14 schools didn’t make the cut?

Stanford University
Graduates employed in law firms: 53.2%
Portion of these graduates employed full time at large law firms: 90%

University of Virginia
Graduates employed in law firms: 71.4%
Portion of these graduates employed full time at large law firms: 85.7%

Harvard University
Graduates employed in law firms: 63.1%
Portion of these graduates employed full time at large law firms: 84.4%

Northwestern University (Pritzker)
Graduates employed in law firms: 76.2%
Portion of these graduates employed full time at large law firms: 84.1%

New York University
Graduates employed in law firms: 77%
Portion of these graduates employed full time at large law firms: 83.9%

Click [here](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/slideshows/10-law-schools-that-lead-to-full-time-jobs-at-big-law-firms) to see the rest of the top 10 and reminisce about the way things used to be.

Will these law schools still be at the top of the list when it comes to students landing Biglaw jobs after graduation? Almost definitely. But will the percentages be as high? We’re not so sure about that, but we suppose we’ll see in a year or two.

# Panning For Good Counsel
## As important as a law firm’s financial statements are, perhaps an even more useful proxy for evaluating the health of a firm is the depth and breadth of its conflict check reports.

By now, it has been a long time since I had to review a Biglaw conflict check report. But I do remember how serious an endeavor it was, not only when trying to open a matter for a new client, but also in terms of maintaining a general sense of the firm’s active client roster. I could argue that as important as a law firm’s financial statements are, perhaps an even more useful proxy for evaluating the health of a firm is the depth and breadth of its conflict check reports. Likewise, the seriousness with which the firm’s partners approach and handle conflict issues that arise is often a solid barometer of a firm’s culture and morale. Partners looking out for themselves rarely spend a thought on conflict issues that might arise out of a given representation. Conversely, firms that are thoughtful and thorough in the treatment of conflict issues — both actual and prospective — are more likely to have a cohesive partnership and a clear sense of direction. All that said, conflicts are hard, particularly in this age of ever-larger law firms engaged in legal practice worldwide.

What is true for other practice areas is also true for patent litigation, at least when it comes to the challenge presented by client conflict issues. That is true whether or not the conflict issues that arise are legal conflicts, such as when a firm is asked to take on a representation adverse to a current or former client, or whether the conflict that arises is a business conflict. The debate that arose well over a decade ago at my former firm about whether the IP group should represent “patent trolls” remains seared in my memory, both for its importance and the level of emotion the debate itself engendered. In today’s patent litigation environment, where firms are often asked to choose which side of a given industry they want to represent, the presence of business conflicts remains a potent issue. It has long been known, for example, that firms practicing pharmaceutical patent litigation may have to elect between representing branded or generic companies. There are exceptions, of course, but it also makes sense that a given pharmaceutical company would want its IP law firm to see the world its way, with part of that vision coming out of representation of like-oriented, if not directly competitive, companies.

Similar considerations are at work in today’s patent litigation market for consumer products technologies, which we can define as broadly as covering everything from automotive to mobile technology to Smart TVs. On the defense side, the concentration of buying power in the hands of a few mass-market retailers, such as Target, Best Buy, or Walmart, has led to a much greater market share for certain products being concentrated in a few suppliers. As a result, fewer litigation-worthy targets remain in any given industry for plaintiffs to pursue, making it more important than ever for defense-oriented law firms to secure engagements from the leading group of defendants. The story is a similar one on the plaintiff’s side. Because of the high cost of litigation, the cases that are most attractive to both law firms and litigation funders are those with high damages potential, namely those same companies that are dominating their respective markets. In short, the shrinking number of patent targets worth fighting for or against is contributing to an even more challenging time for large law firms looking to avoid conflicts issues while not crippling their ability to market to and represent clients in the competitive patent litigation legal marketplace.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
A recent decision out of the Eastern District of Texas helps bring some focus to these knotty questions. The decision addresses an attempt by a patent litigation defendant frequent flier, LG, to disqualify a large law firm, Mayer Brown, which it had previously engaged for help on the defense side — but was now representing a patent plaintiff, Pantech, alleging infringement of multiple patents in an EDTX campaign against LG and other smartphone makers. Mayer Brown’s prior representation of LG in patent matters was substantial, including working for LG in a confidential arbitration proceeding and at least four prior district court cases. When sued by Pantech, LG moved to disqualify, only to see the assigned magistrate judge deny its motion. LG objected, leading to an August 28, 2023, decision by EDTX Judge Robert W. Schroeder III that upheld the magistrate judge’s report and recommendation, with one significant exception relating to one of the asserted patents.

Many of the facts were not in dispute. In a 2019 defense engagement, LG agreed to a specific conflict waiver that played a very large role in the Court’s handling of the present disqualification motion. Noting that everyone agreed that use of LG’s confidential information was off-limits with respect to Mayer Brown’s representation of Pantech, the court concluded that disqualification was not warranted in light of LG’s waiver, even as to one of the prior representations that was found not to have been waived. There, the fact that “counsel’s representations in Core Wireless and the instant case are not substantially related under American Airlines and the applicable case law” precluded disqualification, even in the face of technological overlap between the issues in Core Wireless and Pantech.

With respect to another case that fell outside of the waiver, however, even a gap of eight years between Mayer Brown’s limited billing on LG’s behalf was not enough to stop disqualification with respect to one of the Pantech asserted patents. Key to that decision was the fact that confidential LG source code had been shared with Mayer Brown attorneys in the earlier case, leading to a chance that impropriety could arise — even though no such impropriety was even alleged to have occurred. As a result, the court offered LG the opportunity to either waive the conflict with respect to that one asserted patent, or to sever that patent out of the case and disqualify Mayer Brown from representing Pantech in that severed case. LG opted for the latter option, albeit with some continued irritation that Mayer Brown was not fully disqualified.

Ultimately, this situation demonstrates some of the challenges faced by frequent litigants and active patent litigation law firms in managing complicated conflict issues. On the one hand, a specific conflict waiver helped Mayer Brown avoid full disqualification. On the other hand, the presence of that waiver was not enough to deter LG from trying to disqualify its former law firm from representing an active patent assertion entity choosing to assert multiple patents against it. In the end, no one in this dispute appears to have escaped unscathed, much less satisfied. In today’s patent market panning for good counsel can lead to further affirmation that conflict(s) can breed more conflict(s).

# Am Law 100 Firm Cuts Partner Pay Entirely, Reduces Associate Salaries By 25 Percent
## Another Biglaw firm is tightening its belt because of COVID-19.

The coronavirus crisis continues to ravage the legal profession, be it through layoffs, benefits reductions, or salary cuts. We’ve already seen a Biglaw firm announce a [10 percent pay reduction](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-announces-associate-layoffs-and-other-cost-cutting-measures/) for anyone making more than $100,000, but the latest salary cuts are quite the doozy in comparison.

According to multiple sources, Cadwalader, ranked #89 in the latest Am Law 100 and #52 in the latest Vault 100, announced a series of cost-cutting measures during a townhall meeting this morning. Specifically, for the next four months, the firm will be slashing associate compensation by 25 percent and staff compensation by 10 percent. On top of those cuts, partners and senior counsel will be making the most “significant financial sacrifice” of all. Here’s an excerpt from the firm’s memo on its shocking compensation adjustments:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  


These salary reductions take place almost immediately. IMMEDIATELY. Yikes.

With no end to the COVID-19 pandemic in sight, law firms are clearly trying to find ways to quickly lessen their costs. On the bright side, although its employees’ wallets may be a little lighter in April, at least Cadwalader hasn’t decided to conduct layoffs.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

Stewart Dolin

Yesterday, a Chicago jury found drug company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) liable for the [death of Reed Smith partner Stewart Dolin](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/07/reed-smith-partner-commits-suicide-in-chicago/).

Dolin committed suicide in 2010, jumping in front of an oncoming L train six days after he began taking the antidepressant paroxetine, which is a generic of GSK’s Paxil. A lawsuit was brought by Dolin’s widow, Wendy Dolin, who claimed her husband’s suicide was the result of a paroxetine side effect.

The lawsuit also alleged that the company knew of an increased risk of suicidal behavior in patients of all ages, though the label only notes the risk for children and young adults. As Law360 (sub. req.) [reports](https://www.law360.com/lifesciences/articles/912864/breaking-gsk-hit-with-3m-verdict-for-reed-smith-atty-s-suicide):

What’s more, the lawsuit claimed that GSK knew about the increased risk of suicide for adults taking paroxetine, particularly in the early days of treatment. Dolin said that the company had hidden data proving the link from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for decades. She testified during the trial that while her husband was sometimes anxious, he had developed coping mechanisms to deal with that anxiety and was seeing a therapist at the time of his death.

The jury awarded the plaintiff $3 million, which, though far less than the $39 million she’d sought (representing lost wages and loss of companionship), was still seen as a major victory, as a statement from the plaintiff’s attorney reveals:

“We are very pleased with the jury’s verdict and are grateful for their diligent service,” said Brent Wisner, co-lead trial counsel for Ms. Dolin in the Paxil suicide case. “We feel justice has been served, and are hopeful this verdict will result in a labeling change to warn that people of all ages are at risk. This should send a clear message to GSK and other drug manufacturers that hiding data and manipulating science will not be tolerated. Brand drug manufacturers have the ability and responsibility to make their drug labels accurate. If you create a drug and know that it poses serious risks, regardless of whether consumers use the brand name or generic version of that drug, you have a duty to warn.”

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
GSK, through their representative, indicated they would be appealing the verdict, maintaining that since they did not manufacture the generic drug Dolin took, they aren’t liable. The manufacturer of the generic drug, Mylan, was dismissed from the case, as Law360 reports:

Mylan NV was the manufacturer of the generic but was dismissed from the case in 2014 after U.S. District Judge James Zagel ruled that GSK, as the maker of the brand-name drug Paxil, was responsible for ensuring the label was accurate. The ruling [remains controversial](https://www.law360.com/articles/517394).

During the course of the trial, the defense tried to place the blame for Dolin’s suicide on the stress of Biglaw. Dolin had worked for a smaller firm, Sachnoff & Weaver Ltd., before it merged with Reed Smith, and GSK introduced evidence that Dolin felt unprepared to take on Biglaw. They used Dolin’s work challenges, including a negative comment in a performance review, an unhappy client, and upheaval in the corporate and securities practice group, to argue something besides the antidepressant was behind the suicide.

While acknowledging the high rates of depression and suicide within the legal profession, Wendy Dolin [still maintains](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202784228076/Jury-Awards-3M-to-Widow-of-ExReed-Smith-Partner) the workplace was not the cause of her husband’s death:

“I know the American Bar Association wanted to put Stewart into the category of Big Law suicides,” Wendy Dolin said. “My question to Big Law is, how many of those lawyers who killed themselves have been on antidepressants these past 20 years? There are a lot of consumer issues here.”

# One In-House Counsel’s Take On 'Non-Negotiable Expectations' (Part I)

“They’re not lying.”

That was my first thought when I read the now infamous Paul Hastings PowerPoint slide entitled “Non-Negotiable Expectations.”

And my second thought?

“I wish someone gave me this real talk in one session instead of me having to figure it all out on my own.”

There, I said it.

And as unpopular as this post (and my opinion) is going to be, I just had to write it — despite seeing most of my in-house brethren light up LinkedIn in incredulousness and (dare I describe it as) outrage, some calling for a boycott of the firm.

Before you crucify me on social media as also part of the problem with law firm culture, please don’t misunderstand me. I’m not saying I unequivocally agree with everything the slide purportedly conveyed. But honestly, part of why I was a “go-to” associate when I was in private practice was because I followed most of the proffered tips — only I had to learn them the hard way.

Admittedly, the tone (as best as I could infer — because let’s face it — it’s all just text, and we would have to project our own lived experiences to infer the tone and create the context) was cheekier than I could personally get away with. All of it needed explanation, but that’s why it’s a PowerPoint deck. And because it’s aligned with my personal style, I imagine that hyperbole was intentionally used to make a point with the audience. Again, all of this is conjecture on my part.

By the way, if you have been living under a rock, or rather, have more important things to do than follow controversies on LinkedIn, the backstory is that some senior associate created the slide to train new associates.

Here it is in case you missed it:

So in no particular order, to the extent, you are curious, here are a few of my thoughts in response to the slide.

- “You’re in the big leagues, which is a privilege, act like it.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
I did not do well enough in law school to ever share the same air as any law school contemporaries to work at any AmLaw 20 law firm. But as a first-gen college student and law student and someone who has cleaned a public bathroom a few times in her life as a part of her job — I read the line as a tongue-in-cheek reminder to be grateful and to not feel, or importantly, act entitled. Know that hard work is imminent, and much will be expected of you because of where you work.

Now that isn’t to say that having gratitude means that a person has to ingratiate themselves to any abuse or bullying or work to the detriment of their health. By the way, that first sentence of this paragraph is an example of hyperbole — not me actually believing any person is better than another just because they work at an AmLaw 20 law firm.

The call to avoid acting entitled is also echoed in No. 7 on the slide with “WFH is a luxury.” The author was trying to channel “with great power comes great responsibility” but was less inspirational and a bit snarkier in the delivery.

- “You are the concierge at the Four Seasons, a waiter at Alinea. The client always comes first and is always right. If a client wants a mountain moved, we move it. No questions.”
I actually love the concierge and waiter analogies and the nod to fancy brands. You DO want your brand to be highly regarded and sought. After all, clients or customers have many choices when it comes to hotel accommodations, restaurants, and lawyers, and you want them to keep coming to you — for the bespoke, frictionless experience you can offer them, which may include making them feel like they always come first.

At the same time, note my use of the word “feel.” This can be accomplished by being responsive, by underpromising and overdelivering on expectations and how you communicate. You don’t actually have to put clients first to the detriment of your own well-being. Practically speaking, how do I actually know if I come first or not? The answer is I don’t.

The actual part that I take umbrage with is the “client is always right” and “no questions” part. If I call outside counsel, it is because I want their advice and counsel, to leverage their expertise and experience. I don’t want a hired gun or potted plant. Please don’t just follow me off a cliff in loyalty and move the mountain if it’s a terrible idea. I actually want someone who will ask me all the questions I have not yet thought of.

- “You are online 24/7. No exceptions. No excuses.”
This one is a hard no for me. As your client, I do NOT expect you to be online 24/7. And I hope I have conveyed reasonable deadlines and that I care for your well-being.

But I also can’t ignore the reality that if you don’t respond and I need something urgently, I may call someone else. It’s not personal; I’m not upset. I’ll call you again, but right now, my internal business client needs a response so I’m calling everyone on my list until I can find some help.

Therefore, the reality of this competitive market may incentivize outside counsel to be online 24/7 because you don’t want to miss that call — but if you are an exceptional lawyer, whose brand is like the concierge at the Four Seasons or a waiter at Alinea, then you will get more calls.

Part Two next week!

# Lawyers Should Try Not To File Documents At The Last Minute
## From the possibility of technical failures to the overall quality of work, no one should file documents too close to the deadline.

Numerous lawyers, like many other professionals, often procrastinate all kinds of tasks in our professional lives. Sometimes, attorneys put matters off until the last minute because they have other pressing issues to address, and other times, they delay working on matters since they do not have the mental energy to deal with a given matter at a given time. Since many courts accept filings until midnight the day the filing is due, lawyers also routinely procrastinate filing documents and wait until late at night to file documents before a deadline. However, there are many reasons why lawyers should avoid filing documents at the last minute if it is possible to do so.

Perhaps the biggest reason why lawyers should avoid filing documents close to a deadline is since technical issues might need to be addressed at the last minute which can make it harder to file a document on time. Filing systems themselves routinely breakdown, and it is a running joke in a jurisdiction in which I practice that a filing system is down more often than it is not. Filing systems being down is usually not the biggest deal since most courts have an email address where filings can be sent in emergent circumstances or some other system in place to deal with this situation.

Far scarier is when a lawyer faces a personal technical issue close to a deadline. This happened several times in my career, but one particularly scary situation was by far the worst. When I was an associate in Biglaw, a handful of attorneys and myself were working on an appellate brief that needed to be filed by a given deadline. We used Word documents to pass edits to each other and the latest draft would be saved as a new document that was edited by the team.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
At about 8 p.m. before a midnight filing deadline one time, the Word version containing the brief got corrupted. We were unable to open the document the regular way, and when we attempted to view the data in the document, a bunch of weird symbols were in the file instead of words. This set our team into a panic, and we quickly needed to react to the situation. Out of desperation, we opened one of the earlier versions of the brief and made all of the edits we could remember into that file. We then finalized everything and got the document filed just in time to meet the deadline. The whole situation was extremely stressful, and the possibility of a technical failure has convinced me that no one should file documents too close to the deadline in case something comes up.

Another reason why lawyers should try not to file documents shortly before a deadline is since the time crunch can impact the work product produced by a lawyer. There are some people that thrive off of pressure and who believe that they perform their best work when they are under pressure. However, most of us would agree that someone can produce their best work when they have time to think about their work product and make several rounds of edits in the days leading up to a filing deadline.

One time, I was given work by a client that needed to file something in two days. Normally, it would take me a week or more to prepare the filing that I needed to complete for the client. I worked hard over the next 48 hours putting together the best work product that I could, but the papers were not as good as they could have been if I took my time and reviewed everything over a number of days until all of the papers were perfect.

People might disagree with me on this, but there is also a courtesy element to filing things well before the deadline. If lawyers file papers close to midnight, most electronic filing systems run by courts will send an email to all of the parties notifying them that papers have been filed. This might invade people’s personal time, since many lawyers might want to log into their e-filing accounts as soon as something is filed to see what is going on. I remember being out once late at night when I got a notification stating that an adversary had filed a summary judgment motion. When someone left to go to the bathroom, I couldn’t resist retrieving the filing on my phone so I could see what my adversary had filed. Of course, empathy for adversaries is rarely a motivation for lawyers, and people can have more discipline about work-life balance, but not intruding personal time is another reason why lawyers should file documents well before deadlines.

In any event, so long as courts accept documents until midnight there will be parties filing papers close to this deadline. However, there are a multitude of reasons why you should file documents well before a deadline if this is at all possible.

# More Sullivan & Cromwell Lawyers Joining The Trump Administration
## After Jones Day, is S&C the biggest ""feeder firm"" to the Trump Administration?

Two thumbs up for S&C (President Donald Trump by Ali Shaker/VOA)

After Jones Day, which is clearly the [“feeder firm” to the Trump Administration](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/jones-day-in-the-white-house-the-biglaw-firm-fills-top-jobs-in-the-trump-administration/), which big name of Biglaw sends the most lawyers in DJT’s direction? I haven’t seen a comprehensive analysis (or conducted one myself), but Sullivan & Cromwell is definitely up there.

The most prominent S&C partner nominated to serve under Donald Trump is [Jay Clayton](https://www.sullcrom.com/lawyers/Jay-Clayton), picked by the president to [chair the Securities and Exchange Commission](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/trump-nominates-sullivan-cromwell-partner-to-lead-sec/). Clayton recently [cleared his ethics review](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-pick-for-sec-chairman-clears-ethics-hurdle-1488585212) and is [scheduled to testify](https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-nominee-jay-clayton-set-for-senate-panel-hearing-1488938809) before the Senate Banking Committee on March 23.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Critics charge that the veteran dealmaker is [too close to Wall Street](http://dealbreaker.com/2017/03/jay-clayton-not-that-conflicted/) to serve as its chief regulator, but I’m not sure I agree. Like anything else, regulation has costs and benefits. If the pendulum has swung too far in the direction of excessive regulation, as criticism (by President Trump and others) of the Dodd-Frank Act suggests, having someone like Clayton as SEC chair — someone who understands the problems as well as the promise of regulation — could be a good thing. Also, to the extent that the Commission under Mary Jo White focused too much on enforcement, a chair who will [promote capital formation](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-sec-idUSKBN14N1Y9) might be beneficial.

Yesterday we broke the news of Noel Francisco, the Jones Day partner turned principal deputy solicitor general, being [nominated to serve as solicitor general](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/and-the-nominee-for-solicitor-general-is/) on a long-term basis. Who will fill Francisco’s shoes as principal deputy SG?

As noted earlier today by Amy Howe of [SCOTUSblog](http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/03/trump-nominate-francisco-serve-solicitor-general/) and Robert Barnes of the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/trump-nominates-dc-lawyer-noel-francisco-as-solicitor-general/2017/03/08/c62b0774-040f-11e7-b9fa-ed727b644a0b_story.html?utm_term=.56adc29a60e4), those honors go to [Jeffrey Wall](https://www.sullcrom.com/lawyers/JeffreyB-Wall), currently serving as co-chair of S&C’s appellate practice. Like Francisco, Wall is a great pick for his new post. He’s a graduate of the University of Chicago Law School, a former law clerk to two distinguished judges (Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson of the Fourth Circuit and Justice Clarence Thomas), and an alumnus of the SG’s office. He’s argued before the Court a whopping eleven times (more even than his future boss Francisco, who has three arguments under his belt).

Wall isn’t the only partner in S&C’s D.C. office who’s heading for the Trump Administration. As reported just now by [Bloomberg Politics](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-03-08/questions-about-loyalty-to-trump-stall-mnuchin-s-treasury-picks), Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s pick for his department’s general counsel is [Brent McIntosh](https://www.sullcrom.com/lawyers/BrentJ-McIntosh), a litigation partner at S&C and co-head of its cybersecurity practice. McIntosh, a Yale Law School graduate with prior service at both the Justice Department and in the White House Counsel’s office, has extensive experience working for clients in the financial sector, including such major names as AIG, Barclays, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Prudential, and UBS. He too is an excellent choice for his position. (Robert Schmidt and Saleha Mohsin of Bloomberg Politics suggest that McIntosh’s [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/brentjmcintosh?lang=en) has complicated his candidacy, but our sources say that it was simply reviewed as part of the routine White House vetting process, and he should not have any problems.)

Clayton, Wall, and McIntosh are all S&C partners. Also joining the Trump Administration is Jed Doty, a former associate who’s now in the [White House Counsel’s office](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/making-the-white-house-counsels-office-great-again/).

A white-shoe law firm and a brash billionaire might seem like an unlikely couple. But if lawyers from the culturally conservative S&C can curb some of the Donald’s excesses, that’s all to the good.

UPDATE (3/9/2017, 1:39 p.m.): Here’s a list of [Biglaw attorneys who worked on the Trump transition](http://www.americanlawyer.com/home/id=1202776268104/Behind-the-Scenes-Big-Law-Shapes-Trump-Presidency?slreturn=20170209133629) — not the same as a list of lawyers taking permanent jobs in the administration, but certainly a useful indicator of which law firms carry clout in Trumpworld.

UPDATE (3/15/2017, 11:42 a.m.): Brent McIntosh’s nomination is [now official](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/14/president-donald-j-trump-announces-intent-nominate-key-administration). H. Rodgin Cohen — senior chairman at Sullivan & Cromwell, and a [contender for a top Treasury job himself](https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2009/03/12/cohen-is-withdrawn-from-consideration-for-treasury-post/?_r=0), in the Obama Administration — [praised McIntosh](http://www.corpcounsel.com/id=1202781324736/Sullivan--Cromwells-Brent-McIntosh-Is-Picked-for-Treasury-GC?slreturn=20170216113911), saying he’s the “rare combination of an individual who really is extremely gifted intellectually but also combines that with a sense of business judgment.”

# Biglaw Firm Raises Salaries And Has A Surprising Message About Increasing Productivity

Now that McDermott Will & Emery and the collapse of the taxi medallion market have apparently converged to [bleed Michael Cohen dry](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/report-mcdermott-will-emery-is-done-with-michael-cohen/), the firm has [dropped him as a client](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/report-mcdermott-will-emery-is-done-with-michael-cohen/) and no longer has to worry about getting stiffed at the end of his long, winding criminal prosecution.

And they can use that extra confidence to pay some higher salaries and bonuses.

The firm informed all U.S. associates today that it will be increasing salaries in line with the prevailing market scale. Details of summer bonuses were not disclosed but the firm informed associates that they would receive details tomorrow.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
While this is happy news, the memo appears to come with the warning that most firms only imply:

Compensation is, of course, just one piece of our broader approach to ensuring the strongest possible Associate cohort, and it must also be a corollary of being in the top tier of both productivity and excellence.

Uh-oh. With great compensation comes great responsibility, folks, and this sounds like a tougher push on billables.

And then… the memo takes a surprising turn.

At our Associates’ Retreat, for example, we emphasized health-focused topics that help us grow, both personally and professionally, and be our best selves. To put our support into action, we will be introducing an hours credit for participation in a mindfulness program. We will send the specific details separately, but a growing body of research draws a clear line between mindfulness and overall wellbeing—reducing stress and anxiety, while improving productivity.

Wha? That is definitely NOT what we expected when we saw the message about improving productivity. Sounds like MWE is really committed to thinking outside the box.

(Full memo on the next page.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

“I am the one thing in life I can control / I am inimitable, I am an original.” — [Lin-Manuel Miranda](https://genius.com/7990142), “Wait for it, Hamilton”

Last week, the American Bar Association (ABA) hosted a webinar titled [Combatting Bias and Increasing Inclusion in the Legal Profession](https://shop.americanbar.org/ebus/ABAEventsCalendar/EventDetails.aspx?productId=269848672).

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Michelle Silverthorn, the Diversity and Education Director of the Illinois Supreme Court Commission on Professionalism, began the presentation by retelling the story of [The Oprah Winfrey Show’s 1992 experiment](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/02/jane-elliott-race-experiment-oprah-show_n_6396980.html) about racial prejudice. Many of us still remember the episode to this day. Throughout her storytelling, Silverthorn’s passion, personality, and energy were on full display.

For those who weren’t able to attend last week’s webinar, here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of my conversation with fellow ABA panelist [Michelle Silverthorn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michellesilverthorn/):

Renwei Chung (RC): In the ABA’s [Unconscious Bias webinar](https://shop.americanbar.org/ebus/ABAEventsCalendar/EventDetails.aspx?productId=269848672) last week, you mentioned that you immigrated to the United States from Jamaica. Can you tell us about your journey? 

Michelle Silverthorn (MS): My mother is from Trinidad and Tobago and my father is from Jamaica. We moved between Jamaica and Trinidad until they finally settled in Jamaica when I was about six.

A lot of Jamaicans immigrate to the United States and Canada, and, particularly at my all-girls school, several attend school in the States (including my older sister, who went to Vassar). So when my turn came around for college, I picked the top eight or ten small colleges in the United States and applied to them, as well as to Princeton University. I visited all of the schools and picked Princeton. I moved here in 2000 and except for the year after college graduation when I lived at home, I’ve been in the States ever since.

RC: What motivated you to attend law school, and how did you choose University of Michigan Law School?

MS: Every summer at Princeton, I traveled to a different country. I spent my first summer in Kazakhstan and Botswana, my second in Switzerland, and my third in Peru. So I wanted to attend a school that had a strong international law program. I’d narrowed it down to Michigan and one other law school.

Then I visited Ann Arbor on the most perfect spring day in March, and I thought then, and still do now, that there’s no university setting more beautiful than the Michigan Law quad in spring. I knew I had to go there. And it was a good decision, for many reasons, including because I met my husband the first day of law school.

RC: Can you tell us about the University of Michigan event you attended two weeks ago?

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
MS: Sure, it was Michigan Law’s 2017 African-American Alumni Reunion. We had over 100 black alumni from all over the country travel back to the law school. We had federal judges, White House staff, non-profit leaders, private and public sector executives. And we took a picture with our hundred-plus black Michigan Law alumni, which was amazing to see.

Probably my favorite part was the listening session with the students, where the black Michigan Law students shared with us their struggles as a community and how we as alumni can help. And of course I picked up some Michigan gear, since we, as a country, need more people walking around in Michigan gear.

RC: Before your current position, you were a Biglaw attorney in New York and Chicago. What was that like? 

MS: I feel like this interview is coming full-circle, since Above the Law played a crucial role in my first years as a lawyer. I started at Latham & Watkins in New York City in September 2008 and was there during the [“Lathamed”](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/06/how-did-latham-become-the-poster-child-for-layoffs/) period. It was surreal reading about what was happening with our law firm online while living it out in person. I left Latham at the end of 2010 and moved to Chicago to another large law firm after my husband got a job out here.

I think there are people who succeed in Biglaw, who work extraordinarily hard and devote the hours to the work and the client development. For me, there were some great moments and some less great moments, and I’m happy it got me to where I am right now.

RC: Last week, you helped with the Black Women Lawyers’ Association National Summit in Chicago. What were some of the most memorable moments?

For the last few months, I have been on the planning committee for the Black Women Lawyers’ Association National Summit. I was in charge of planning the CLE for the conference, and crafting the descriptions and the subject matter.

We had around 400 lawyers attend our sessions, including our lunch with Kimberley Harris, GC of NBC-Universal and fellow Trinidadian, and Valerie Jarrett, President Obama’s Senior Advisor and fellow Michigan Law grad.

All of these black women came together to talk about how they succeed in their careers, how they advocate for political and social change, and, most importantly, how they overcome the challenges we all share as black women lawyers in this profession. It was a great conference, and I can’t wait for our next one.

RC: What advice do you have for law students and young attorneys? 

MS: I would tell them to navigate their law firm culture, join a bar association, find a mentor, manage their finances, and listen to feedback. But because I work in civility and professionalism, I will also say this:

“You are going to have millions of conversations with partners, with clients, with colleagues, with people whom you like and whom you dislike, people who look and think and act like you, and people who do not. For every conversation you have, start out with respect. Many people think that you respect people because of who they are. No. You respect people because of who you are, because of that deep, ingrained moral code inside of you that tells you that every person deserves your respect. Start out with respect and keep moving upward from there.”

RC: It was great chatting with you. Is there anything else you would like to share with our audience?

MS: There’s a great book that Professor Deborah Rhode at Stanford wrote called Lawyers as Leaders. And she points out that even though lawyers are less than half a percent of this country’s population, we are very well-represented in every level of leadership in this country. We are government leaders, community leaders, philanthropic leaders, leaders of business and leaders in business. Twenty-five lawyers signed the Declaration of Independence. Twenty-six of this country’s 45 presidents have been lawyers.

Two-thirds of our vice presidents have been lawyers. Fifty-five of our current Senators are lawyers. I think lawyers have done a remarkable job throughout history of shaping this country. I would love to see our current and future crop of lawyers continue that legacy of leadership and change. 

On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, I would like to thank Michelle Silverthorn for sharing her story with our audience. We wish her continued success in her career.

If you happen to be in Chicago on May 18, be sure to check out the [The Future Is Now: Legal Services 2017](https://www.2civility.org/future-is-now-legal-services-2017/#speakers) conference, where lawyers, entrepreneurs, and professors will talk about alternative legal landscapes, helping to achieve justice through technology, preventative lawyering, blueprints for change, and more.

Raises are in the air! Biglaw firms are busy increasing associate compensation, and the most recent firm to do so is Cahill Gordon & Reindel.

The firm is known for [giving associates a little something extra](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/cahill-bonus-2021/) when bonus time rolls around, so it isn’t a shock that Cahill is moving to the new industry standard for base compensation. Cahill wants to show its associates that they’re appreciated and they have the cash to do so!

The new salary scale at the firm is as follows:



The raises are retroactive to January 1. You can read the [full memo on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/cahill-raises-22/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

# Another Cravath Bonus Match And Another Complaint About Benefits
## Bonuses may be nice, but associates are feeling the pinch of cuts to other benefits.

Bonus season 2017 has only been on a few days and already some patterns have emerged. Most Biglaw firms — well, at least the ones that have announced bonuses so far — have matched the scale established by Cravath. That isn’t too surprising; they have become the established compensation leader, both in terms of yearly bonuses and base compensation.

Yesterday, Proskauer Rose announced they are matching the industry standard for end-of-the-year bonuses, to be paid on December 22nd.

Class of 2017 — $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2016 — $15,000
Class of 2015 — $25,000
Class of 2014 — $50,000
Class of 2013 — $65,000
Class of 2012 — $80,000
Class of 2011 — $90,000
Class of 2010 — $100,000
Class of 2009 — $100,000

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The [other trend](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/biglaw-firm-matches-cravath-but-are-they-cutting-associate-compensation-while-no-ones-looking/) we are noticing? That the bonuses may be nice, but associates are feeling the pinch of cuts to other benefits. From a Proskauer tipster:

The bonus is nice, but doesn’t make anyone feel better about the firm’s new, terrible, health insurance policy that is functionally a significant pay cut for any associate with health issues.

Remember, if your firm is similarly cutting back on health care benefits shoot ATL a line — we are organizing a [comprehensive listing of health care benefits](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/attention-associates-tell-us-about-your-health-plan/).

So, Proskauer attorneys, how do you feel about the bonuses and your health insurance? Feel free to sound off [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

The associate salary party is far from over. While the market has seemingly settled on a standard compensation grid for associates, we now play the much longer tail game of which firms will match. And think about it — with at least 200 firms earning the moniker “Biglaw” and a wave of elite boutiques also ponying up the big bucks, it’ll be a minute before we have a true understanding of which firms are true Moneylaw firms, and which are not.

Well, there’s now another Biglaw firm shelling out the big bucks for associates. Mintz — a firm that brought in $502,100,000 gross revenue in 2020, ranking it at No. 79 in the Am Law 100 — has decided to up associates’ salaries. They’ll be matching the market standard set by Cravath.

The new grid is as follows:



While most firms have backdated the raises to January 1, Mintz has opted to go with — I imagine — a much easier to administer April date, which also coincides with the start of the firm’s fiscal year.

# Top Biglaw Firm Will Allow Associates To Control Their Own Office Schedules, Work Remotely 'Whenever ... Appropriate'

Whoa! This seems great!

No desire to go into the office? No problem. Wouldn’t it be nice if all law firms had office reopening policies like this? Try not to be too jealous.

This seems to be what’s happening at Gibson Dunn, which announced its return-to-office plan earlier this week. The firm will throw open its doors on September 13, and according to a memo sent by managing partner Barbara Becker, lawyers will be free to make their own office schedules.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“You are free to work remotely whenever it is appropriate, taking into account the needs of our clients and your teams, and you should feel comfortable doing so,” Becker said in her email to attorneys. “The ability to structure our schedules in a way that is responsive to the needs of our clients and teams, as well as our essential personal and family priorities, is key to a vibrant and sustainable career,” she noted.

But associates — especially junior associates — should be aware they’ll need to have a presence in the office from time to time. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/07/14/gibson-dunns-flexible-work-policy-hands-autonomy-to-attorneys/) has details:

Becker acknowledged the benefits, both to the firm and to attorneys’ professional development, that accrue from working collectively in an office setting.

“We do not want anyone to miss out on the immense training, mentorship, and professional development benefits that come with being together in person,” she said. “And we know that we learn and grow from working together. This is especially true for our most junior attorneys and those who are new to the firm, who must not only develop substantive legal skills and expertise, but also thrive in a variety of professional situations that cannot be replicated in other settings.”

But Becker added that the flexibility to work remotely when necessary is crucial to fueling “full, well-rounded, happy lives.”

Gibson Dunn is allowing its attorneys to create their own schedules because management “implicitly trust[s] the judgment of our lawyers to do what’s best for their clients, their teams and their personal lives.” Perhaps other firms should adopt policies like this — it’ll make their attorneys feel a little more like autonomous adults instead of mere billing machines.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# Could Biglaw Firms Use 'Core' Hours To Get Associates Excited About Returning To The Office?
## Just don't force it upon them -- because lawyers really don't like that.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Law firms are different from other businesses—they just are. Lawyers don’t want to be told what to do and when to do it.

We are professionals. We know that if we want to be in that office with our colleagues then that office is doing a good job.

[A]nything that is an unnecessary order can create resentment.

— Law firm consultant Alexa Ross, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2023/09/07/could-core-hours-help-firms-balance-mandates-with-flexibility-few-are-willing-to-try/) on the concept of “core” hours within law firms operating with hybrid work policies. Lawyers should “look forward” to coming to the office, she said, rather than being required to do so. “That increases productivity tremendously,” Ross said, “it also decreases attrition.”

# Desperately Seeking A Milbank Match: When Will The Waiting Game End?
## Biglaw firms are busy biding their time as they wait for someone else to make the first move on bonuses and raises -- and associates are tired of waiting.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

They’ll wait to see what the other firms are doing. But I would be surprised if they didn’t quickly follow suit.

It’s just more of a collective mentality among law firms. They feel the need to be matching what the top most profitable firms are doing to remain competitive for top law students.

— Jeffrey Lowe, founder of the consulting firm Jeffrey Lowe Partners, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2023/11/20/wait-and-see-mode-for-associate-pay-law-firms-in-dc-bide-time/) on when other Biglaw firms can be expected to match [Milbank’s year-end associate bonuses and raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/milbank-raises-associate-salaries-and-announces-year-end-bonuses/) across all class years. Lowe went on to say that New York’s elite firms will officially kick off bonus season, and it’s unlikely that D.C. firms are “going to be leading the charge.”

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

Biglaw firms across the Am Law 200 have announced associate salary increases, some across the board, and some only for certain class years. Back in mid-December, an Am Law 100 firm announced lockstep Cravath raises — but only for its most junior associates, maintaining a black-box compensation system of sorts for its midlevel and senior associates.

The firm in question is Lowenstein Sandler, which brought in $451,902,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 99 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking. According to a memo viewed by Above the Law, eligible associates at the firm in the classes of 2023 through 2021 will receive raises in line with the Cravath scale:

- Class of 2023: $225,000
- Class of 2022: $230,000
- Class of 2021: $260,000
All midlevel and senior associates at the firm will receive “performance and market-driven” salaries that reward “exceptional performance” and “challeng[e] each individual to maintain a level of client service and productivity that is commensurate with their compensation.” Those base compensation changes will be communicated individually.

On top of this compensation model, we’re told that just like last year’s streamlined model, the firm’s bonus scale rewards only the highest performers — those who have billed 1950 or more hours — with market rates. Once again, the firm will award additional bonus money to its highest billers (i.e., those with 2250+ hours).

Congratulations to everyone at Lowenstein Sandler.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of compensation updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or email us (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus/Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Young Federal Judge Leaves The Bench, Joins Biglaw Firm
## Why are all of these young judges returning to private practice?

Young federal judges are pulling the plugs on their lifetime appointments left and right — and the latest to do so is heading to greener pastures, at least money wise, at one of the most successful Biglaw firms in the business.

Back in December, Judge George Hazel of the District of Maryland announced that he would be resigning from the bench to return to private practice. The 47-year-old Obama appointee officially called it quits on February 24, 2023, and [said](https://www.mdd.uscourts.gov/news/notice-resignation-honorable-george-j-hazel-united-states-district-judge-2022-12-07t000000) it was “the highest honor and privilege to serve the public as a United States District Judge,” and that he’d “always cherish [his] time on the Bench.”

So, where is Hazel headed? Gibson Dunn recently announced that the judge would be joining the firm as a partner in Washington, D.C., where he’ll work in the litigation and white collar defense and investigations practices.

Hazel is the latest in a series of young judges to leave the federal bench. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/maryland-federal-judge-joins-gibson-dunn-after-leaving-bench-47-2023-03-01/) has the details:

In January, Gary Feinerman joined Latham & Watkins from the federal bench in Chicago at age 57. Last April, Alabama federal judge Abdul Kallon resigned at 53 and later joined Perkins Coie, and in September Gibson Dunn hired Gregg Costa after he left the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Houston at age 50.

And let’s not forget about about 55-year-old Judge Paul Watford of the Ninth Circuit, whose time on the bench will [come to an end in May](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/watford-resign-court-private-practice/). He, too, is headed back to private practice.

Are all of these jurists leaving to give Biden a leg up when it comes to announcing judicial nominees? Or is the lure of Biglaw and its golden handcuffs just that strong? Best of luck at the firm, Your Honor!

# The Associate's Guide To Holiday Parties
## The Annual Party Survival Guide

If you’ve worked in Biglaw for any length of time, waking up at your desk is not a foreign concept. Waking up at on desk amid a bevy of broken beer bottles with your tie around your head on the other hand may be entirely foreign. And not just because your firm is business casual and you haven’t worn a tie in years. Did you get yourself fired last night? Is someone — or something — pregnant? Or worse, did you volunteer to review documents in Wichita?

The Biglaw (or any office frankly) holiday party is fraught with profound risk. If law schools really cared about building the “practice-ready” attorney, they’d make every 1L legal methods course end with an issue spotter exam about the firm party.

It’s important to note that not every mistake you can make at one of these parties boils down to alcohol. Our columnist Brian Cuban wrote [a great guide for the sober holiday party](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/a-sober-navigation-of-the-law-firm-holiday-party-circuit/), but it’s worth remembering that some of the biggest mistakes you can make at a holiday party can still strike if you’re stone cold sober.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Here are some key tips and pitfalls to avoid.

Mandatory Fun Is Not Billable: You may not want to be there, but that doesn’t mean it’s billable. Meh. Maybe that “Office-General” code.

Don’t Dance: Ever. Maybe if you trained for over a decade at one of those conservatories that gave you a [Black Swan](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/) eating disorder, but otherwise don’t attempt it. Have you ever seen Seinfeld? They [effectively hit on this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Kicks). It’s paranoia to believe that everyone is watching you at the party. It’s realistic to believe that some people are watching you at the party and they’re inevitably the judgey ones. Your credibility as a professional is at stake.

Tread Lightly On Bonus Talk: If you really have to show off how light on your feet you are, practice walking on egg shells around bonus talk. This may spark some disagreement. Many folks might encourage a polite word of thanks to the partners you speak with, but honestly it’s just too dangerous. You don’t know the internal politics of the firm — the partner you’re thanking may have been fought hard against that bonus, or maybe not had a seat at the table at all. That bonus may be hurting them in the pocketbook, forcing Little Jimmy to settle for a private pre-school that doesn’t have fair trade, 100 percent gluten-free teachers.

Keep A Spare Outfit In Your Office: I’m not saying that you’ll get drunk and vomit all over yourself. Perhaps I am. But even if I weren’t, it’s important to remember that lawyer parties are an excuse for — and this is an admittedly gendered example — middle-aged women who can’t hold their liquor to guzzle red wine like it’s a juice box. If you catch yourself in a conversation with someone living this particular lie, they’ll eventually gesticulate wildly while explaining some f**king trip to the Hamptons they took last summer and spill all over you. Be prepared.

That Partner Isn’t Really Your Buddy: Sure, if you’ve done a lot of work with a partner they’re probably hanging out with you at the party because they genuinely like you. That’s great. The party is an excellent opportunity to build on that mentor-mentee relationship. But beware the partner you don’t really know sidling up to you. You know why they’re there? Because no one wants to work with them and they see easy prey in a party full of associates intoxicated on good cheer, alcohol, three rails of coke… whatever. The next thing you know you’re on a 7-month trial with a screamer.

Don’t Hook Up With That Paralegal: Next thing you know you’re in a 7-month relationship with a screamer.

Just Because It’s Free Does Not Mean You Have To Go Top-Shelf: This isn’t a summer associate gig anymore. Back then you survived for days on the table scraps the philosopher kings of your firm threw your way. But now you’re making, presumably, big bucks and you don’t need the firm to give you that elusive single-malt. Or, for that matter, that raw oyster. Do you really want law firm catered oysters sitting on ice for hours? In both cases, you’re much better off using beer or wine to wash down your chips or pigs-in-a-blanket. You’ll keep your wits about you much better and probably avoid a trip to the firm’s well-appointed conference floor bathroom.

Proudly Display The Tacky Party Favors: At my first holiday party as an associate, the firm sprung for these [light-up ice cubes](http://amzn.to/2glpYiw) (affiliate link) at one of its bar stations. Every cocktail came with a plastic encased dab of freezer gel and an LED that turned on when you struck the cube on a hard surface. There was nothing cool about walking around with a light brite bourbon (because I clearly violated the last rule). But you know what was critical? Everyone asking me “where did you get that?” Regardless of seniority, I was the guy with the intel. That builds trust right there.

Editor’s note: This is the latest installment of the “Reference Manual of Legal Tech Lists,” an eBook set for release this spring. [Read the prior installments here](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/wolters-kluwer-lists/), and feel free to pre-register for your copy of the complete eBook using the form below. 

It’s no secret that there’s been an explosion of interest in the legal operations field in recent years. So much so that we’ve even got our own cliches!

Here, we bring you our favorite — and not-so-favorite — phrases we often encounter, fit for a game of Legal Ops Bingo.

-  “I know our processes are inefficient, but it’s how we’ve always done it!”
- “We’re a small company. We don’t need to worry about operations and technology.”
-  “We don’t have time for streamlining our processes.  We’re too busy putting out fires.”
-  “Why do we need to invest in legal spend analysis when we already know we’re spending too much on legal fees?”
- “Why hire a legal operations expert when we can just wing it?”
- “Setting up this new system will save us a lot of time, but we’re too busy, and we don’t have the budget!”
- “Strategic planning takes too much time. We prefer to just wing it.”
- “If we implement an information governance policy, I won’t be able to find old emails and documents.”
- “We have a repository, but we also save things to our desktop.”
- “Our lawyers will only work in Word, but we want to implement a detailed metrics program.”
- “We have legal ops. We implemented eBilling.”
- “We don’t need an intake system. That will get in the way of relationship building.”
- “Legal Ops professionals make how much?! But I don’t even pay my lawyers that!”
- “But our company/department is different…”
- “Our clients insist on white glove service.”
- “We’ve already cleaned up our templates. They’re good enough.”
- “Fixed fees are too complicated. We’ll just charge hourly.”
BONUS ROUND: Shouting “Bingo!” after one of these will double your prize! 

- “Low-hanging fruit”
- “Synergy”
- “Value-add”
- “Best practices”
- “Paradigm shift”
- “Out-of-the-box thinking”
- “Streamline”
- “Disruptive technology”
- “Win-win”
- “Thought leadership”
- “Metrics & data analytics”
- “Process improvement”
Fill out the form below to pre-register for your copy of the complete “Reference Manual of Legal Tech Lists,” which will be sent to all registrants later this year! And as a bonus, registrants will receive a copy of the “[Legal Tech-to-English Dictionary](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/introducing-the-complete-legal-tech-to-english-dictionary/)” from Above the Law and Wolters Kluwer — another piece of our growing legal tech reference library.

By filling out the form, you are opting in to receive communication from Above the Law and its partners.

# Dewey Think This Former Biglaw Leader Is Sorry His Firm Crashed And Burned In A Historic Collapse?

I feel an immense sense of, really, that I owe all these people an apology. At the end of the day, it was my responsibility. I have to accept that and I have to live with it.

— Steven Davis, the former chairman of Dewey & LeBoeuf, discussing the firm’s downfall in a [short documentary produced by Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/how-a-big-law-firm-went-bust-dewey-chair-talks-stunning-demise). Created via the 2007 merger of Dewey Ballantine and LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae, the mega firm declared bankruptcy just five years later. “I think in its brief existence, the firm did some good things,” he said. “But it’s a reality that all that has disappeared in the chaos and turmoil that resulted from the bankruptcy.” Speaking for the first time on camera about the Biglaw firm’s fall from grace, Davis, who was brought up on criminal charges after the firm toppled, called the prosecution “absolutely inappropriate and unnecessary.” He now lives in London where he does litigation finance consulting and said the reputational damage he’s endured is “frankly irreparable.” Check out the documentary below.

More than 2,000 votes were cast, so it’s fair to say our 2020 holiday card contest was a great success. With dueling firms from the same city, the race to the finish line was quite close — this year’s top contender won the competition by a slim margin, separated from the second-place finisher by just 11 votes.

Our newest winner joins the company of previous holiday card contest winners:

Congratulations to… Wolf Greenfield! The Boston-based IP firm is the first and only law firm to win our holiday card contest four times in the 12 years we’ve been hosting the event. The firm beat Conn Kavanaugh’s, another Boston-based firm, by only a smidge. You can check out Wolf Greenfield’s winning submission below.


Congrats to all the worthy finalists, and thanks to everyone who nominated a card or voted in the contest. We can’t wait to see what cleverness comes our way in 2021.

# Flexible Staffing For Antitrust Boom
## As law firms confront an influx of major antitrust matters, some of which will arise on short notice, flexible staffing is playing an important role in serving clients efficiently and effectively.

Any way you slice it, antitrust is a booming practice area.  A year ago, Bloomberg Law [projected](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/by-the-numbers-four-practice-areas-set-to-power-big-law-in-2022) that antitrust would be a top practice set to power Biglaw growth in 2022 and beyond.  The wisdom of that prediction was reinforced by what turned out to be an immensely competitive [lateral market](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/09/12/freshfields-scores-wilson-sonsini-partner-in-hot-september-for-antitrust-lateral-moves/) for antitrust partners, with a string of high-profile lawyers changing firms.  The 2022 lateral market was so strong that even partners without portable books of business were a hot commodity.  In 2023, the FTC has already [proposed a broad ban](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/01/ftc-proposes-rule-ban-noncompete-clauses-which-hurt-workers-harm-competition) on non-compete agreements, and the FTC and DOJ appear ready to issue [revised merger guidelines](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/01/federal-trade-commission-justice-department-seek-strengthen-enforcement-against-illegal-mergers) based on last year’s “joint public inquiry aimed at strengthening enforcement against illegal mergers.”

As law firms confront an influx of major antitrust matters, some of which will arise on short notice, flexible staffing is playing an important role in serving clients efficiently and effectively.  Given this need, [Bridgeline Solutions](https://www.laterallink.com/bridgelinesolutions/), a Lateral Link company, recently established a dedicated Antitrust Practice Group co-chaired by Bridgeline’s CEO, Craig Brown, and one of its senior executives, the Group’s Managing Director, David Copeland.  Craig is a former government attorney who practiced as an antitrust attorney with Kaye Scholer, the same firm at which David was a Chambers-ranked antitrust counselor for 25 years, including 15 years as a partner.

Although Bridgeline Solutions’ services have included antitrust since the company’s inception, the booming activity in this vital area drove the decision to establish a standalone Antitrust Practice Group.  The Group will advise on best practices in all areas of antitrust and will staff and manage Second Requests. Additionally, the Group will continue to provide premier Biglaw-trained antitrust attorneys to assist on mergers as well as non-merger substantive antitrust matters.

The Antitrust Practice Group will also continue to assist in educating the public and practitioners in antitrust law and its evolution.  For example, Craig and David were instrumental in procuring Jonathan Kanter, Assistant Attorney General of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, as the keynote speaker for the 2022 Milton Handler Lecture at the NYC Bar Association.  In delivering this Lecture, AAG Jonathan Kanter sharply [criticized](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-jonathan-kanter-delivers-remarks-new-york-city-bar-association) the “consumer welfare standard” that has been the hallmark of civil antitrust enforcement since the 1980s.  Instead, Mr. Kanter signaled that the Antitrust Division would prioritize “protecting competition” under his leadership.  “Companies that test our resolve…do so at their own risk and will continue to confront aggressive antitrust enforcement. As one of my predecessors explained, some deals should never leave the boardroom.”

After much anticipation, that tough talk is now translating into action.  In October, the DOJ successfully [blocked](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-obtains-permanent-injunction-blocking-penguin-random-house-s-proposed) Penguin Random House from acquiring Simon & Schuster.  In December, the Federal Trade Commission sued to block Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of video game publisher Activision, an ambitious effort that illustrates Chair Lina Khan’s willingness to bring cases that may be [difficult to win](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/09/technology/lina-khan-ftc-microsoft-activision.html).

# Jury Will Have To Decide If Davis Polk Lawyers Are Racist Or Just Socially Awkward
## Really makes you wonder if his coworkers were bad actors.

As Kaloma Cardwell’s discrimination trial continues, interesting tidbits of what it’s like to work at the firm continue to trickle out. Davis Polk alleges that Cardwell was fired for performance issues — at one point, he refused an assignment. Cardwell argues that its all pretext for a retaliation firing because he complained about the racial climate at the firm. Understandably, testimony has been used to establish a baseline for what the day-to-day work experience was like for him at the firm. A former colleague [nitpicked that Cardwell looked too comfortable in his seat while on the job](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/01/former-davis-polk-employee-testifies-in-racial-discrimination-trial-that-fired-associate-was-too-relaxed/).

One of Cardwell’s complaints was that he wasn’t treated like one of the members of the group: they left him off email chains about cases he was assigned to and allegedly didn’t even make eye contact with him while he was in the room. While we’ve yet to hear an explanation for the email issues, one was given for the stinginess with eye contact: We’re just weird like that, man.

“I had just experienced sitting in an M&A practice group [meeting] for an hour, being one of the only Black attorneys in the room, sitting at a table that had six or seven other attorneys at it and experiencing absolutely no [one] looking at me for the entire hour-long meeting,” Cardwell explained.

Davis Polk executive director Sharon Crane’s response mentioned that many lawyers are “socially awkward.”

“At the time, I thought that what I experienced did not happen to everyone and it was not happening to everyone, so when I read that response, I disagreed with her assessment,” Cardwell said.

Cardwell said he raised similar concerns to then-managing partner Thomas Reid at a January 2016 dinner. Reid’s initial response was similar to Crane’s, Cardwell testified, and he told Reid that he also attributed the behavior to social awkwardness at first.

There’s nothing wrong with having awkward coworkers. It is kind of weird when they turn on the charisma for literally everyone else though:

Cardwell said he changed his mind when he watched the lawyers take on a charismatic “Leonardo DiCaprio” persona when they talked to clients and non-Black colleagues.

It would be strange to encounter “Wolf of Wall Street” Leonardo DiCaprio in one room and the much more demure “Don’t Look Up” Leo in the other. Assuming everyone here is above 25, you can’t explain the DiCaprio switch-up with simple flirtation jitters — maybe there is something to what Cardwell is saying.

Then again, is it really that surprising that a firm would can you after refusing work?

# Associate Bonus Watch: The First Magic Circle Firm Speaks

[Accio](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Summoning_Charm) bonus bucks! With a wave of its wand, the very first Magic Circle firm has cast a spell to summon tens of thousands of dollars into the bank accounts of its deserving associates. Congratulations!

Yesterday, in a memorandum emailed from U.S. managing partner [David Krischer](http://www.allenovery.com/people/en-gb/Pages/David-Krischer.aspx), Allen & Overy announced that it would be matching the Cravath bonus scale for all of its U.S. associates (and it looks like associates in São Paulo, Brazil, will see some extra cash too). Bonus payouts to associates will be made by January 13, 2017. The full memo is available on the next page.

A&O being the first Magic Circle firm to match this year’s market bonuses speaks volumes. When will the rest of its cohorts with U.S. offices — Clifford Chance, Freshfields, and Linklaters — conjure up cash for their associates?

That’s our take on the Allen & Overy bonuses. If you’re an A&O lawyer, what do you think? Feel free to let us know how you feel [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks for your help.

Don’t forget, if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please enter your email address in the box below. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Cheers to a happy bonus season, everyone!

# Better Late Than Never: Firm With $1.38M PPP Finally Decides To Raise Associate Salaries
## Finally! What in the world took this firm so long to announce raises?

Cravath kicked off the summer by raising associate salaries to the shiny new $180K scale on June 6, and thus far, almost [every major player in the Biglaw market has matched](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises/) (or given the illusion of matching while [hanging their senior associates out to dry](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/no-you-are-not-matching-the-market-1st-years-to-180k-doesnt-tell-the-whole-story/)). Some firms, however, have been reluctant to pull the trigger on salary increases, and haven’t said a peep to their associates one way or the other as to their thoughts on the matter.

Take Kaye Scholer, for example. Per the latest Am Law 100 rankings, the firm sustained declines in gross revenue (down 1.3 percent to $370 million) and profits per partner (down 2.1 percent to $1.38 million). Two weeks ago, we speculated that perhaps it was the firm’s [failed merger with Arnold & Porter](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/a-failed-merger-might-explain-why-these-firms-havent-announced-raises/) that was keeping it from joining its peers and anointing its associates with cash in the form of Cravath matches. Arnold & Porter announced its raises [later the very same day](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/a-leading-d-c-law-firm-finally-announces-raises-for-associates/), while Kaye Scholer remained mum.

Associates were angered terribly by the firm’s silence. It was this past Saturday that we received yet another missive from a Kaye Scholer tipster bemoaning the firm’s inaction: “Another week has gone by and Kaye Scholer still hasn’t made a move. July 1 is next week. Hope they don’t pull a Reed Smith. If I were a summer, I’d definitely consider going somewhere else full time at this point.” Ouch. When associates are advocating for new blood to move along to other firms, you know it’s time to make a move.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
It’s been almost a full month since firms began moving to the new prevailing salary scale, and last night, Kaye Scholer finally decided to match Cravath for all of its U.S. associates, from first-years to eighth-years. Ninth-year associates and counsel will be spoken to separately about their salary increases. [Michael Solow](http://www.kayescholer.com/professionals/solow_michael), the firm’s managing partner, thanked associates for their “consistent hard work and dedication,” announcing that the raises would kick in as of this Friday, July 1, and be seen in their July 15 paychecks. The Kaye Scholer memo is completely silent on raises for summer associates.

Congratulations to all Kaye Scholer associates! All of that waiting finally paid off.

Remember, we are covering this trend extensively, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

# Younger Lawyers Should Argue More Appeals And Motions
## Judges are more likely to give younger lawyers the benefit of the doubt and flexibility than older attorneys who should know better about the practice of law.

Facebook from time to time reminds me how old I am by showing me pictures of myself at various times in the past. While recently perusing my news feed, I was reminded that six years ago this month, I argued my first appeal in front of New York’s Appellate Division, Second Department. The photo brought back some vivid memories of waiting anxiously in the attorneys’ room before my appeal was called, and my brother Adam showing up to witness me deliver my first appellate arguments. At the time, I was about two years into my legal career, so it was kind of a novelty that I was arguing an appeal. However, my experiences over the years have shown me that younger lawyers should argue more appeals and motions for a variety of reasons.

One reason why younger attorneys should be more involved in oral advocacy is because they often devote more effort and dedication into arguing appeals and motions than senior lawyers do. Partners at numerous firms often have many tasks other than practicing law. This includes originating business, reviewing bills, ensuring that bills are paid, and dealing with administrative functions at a law firm. Moreover, partners often have more cases to oversee than associates, since they usually have several associates under their supervision who each has their own portfolio of cases. This can limit the amount of time and attention partners can devote to arguing motions and appeals.

However, associates are more likely to take pride and ownership over the opportunity to argue a motion or appeal. For instance, when I was assigned to argue my first several appeals, I was honored to be given the opportunity to participate in the appeals. I spent a significant amount of time reviewing the appellate record, briefs, and cases cited by both sides. Even though I was given a set number of hours to bill for preparing oral arguments, I ended up spending far more hours during my free time preparing for the appeals. I remember taking the briefs and appellate records with me whenever I was on the subway so I could thumb through the documents constantly. The extra consideration associates may give to oral arguments can provide clients the best possibility at success on an appeal or motion.

Younger lawyers should also argue more appeals and motions because they are often more familiar with a case than a partner or other senior lawyer. Associates often need to do the research and draft the briefs necessary in the appellate or motion process. By completing this work, associates are often more familiar with the arguments that will be most successful in a matter and the particular facts associated with a case.

One time earlier in my career, I drafted papers for a high-stakes summary judgment motion. The motion was based on some complicated estoppel arguments that required a detailed understanding of the law and facts of the case. It was eventually decided that the partner would argue the motion, presumably because the partner had argued many more motions than me up to that point in my career.

However, the partner was extremely busy at the time, and had not been closely involved with that particular case for years. He asked me to summarize all of the arguments orally to him before the motion hearing, and I am not sure that the partner read all of the papers that were submitted for the motion. At oral argument, the partner seemed extremely flat-footed when pressed on some issues, and he was unable to answer a few basic questions posed by the court and the other side. Our adversary, however, was extremely well-prepared, and it showed. In the end, our client had an unusually bad outcome after the summary judgment arguments. If I as the younger attorney had argued the case, perhaps I would have presented the arguments more effectively, and we should have selected the advocate who was most knowledgeable about the case.

Younger attorneys should also argue more appeals and motions since many jurists like seeing younger lawyers in their courtrooms. From my own personal experience, judges are more likely to give younger lawyers the benefit of the doubt and flexibility than older attorneys who should know better about the practice of law. One time, when I was waiting to argue an appeal, I saw an advocate (who was either a law student under supervision or a young attorney) absolutely crush oral argument on a criminal case. Not only were the judges impressed with this advocate’s arguments, but they also seemed wowed by how a young advocate could do so well on her first appeal. I have a feeling this perception helped that advocate’s client receive the best consideration possible. [Some judges even actively try to incentivize lawyers to select junior attorneys as oral advocates](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/hero-federal-judge-takes-steps-to-increase-meaningful-experience-for-diverse-lawyers/). Many state and federal judges read this column and email me regularly, and I would love to hear the opinion of jurists about whether younger lawyers can make an impact on oral arguments, but from my own experience, it doesn’t hurt.

All told, senior attorneys like to argue appeals and motions themselves, since it is often seen as an honor to go to court on a case. Nevertheless, younger attorneys should argue more appeals and motions in many circumstances to best advance the interests of a client.

# Summer Associate Hiring Was Down This Year, But Will It Make A Comeback?
## Fingers crossed next year will be better than the last.

It’s not just your imagination — summer associate hiring was down for the 2021 season. In fact, according to [new data](https://www.nalp.org/uploads/NALPPerspectiveson2020_21LawStudentRecruiting.pdf) released by the National Association for Law Placement (NALP), 56 percent of law firms reported making fewer offers for their summer program in 2021. And there’s more. Approximately 75 percent of law schools reported a 5 percent decline in on-campus recruiting, and ~29 percent say they saw a 30 percent dip in recruitment for 2020-21.

As [reported by](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/after-a-soft-recruiting-season-for-2021-summer-associates-new-cycle-appears-off-to-a-rollicking-start) the ABA Journal, there are other signs of a down recruitment season:

The percentage of callback interviews that resulted in offers for class of 2022 students in 2021 summer programs decreased to 50%, down from 51% the prior year and from 52% to 54% for five previous years. The yield on the offers increased by nearly 5 percentage points to about 41%. The yield rate is eclipsed only by that of 2009, when the yield was 43%.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
James Leipold, executive director of NALP, [said ](https://www.nalp.org/uploads/PressReleases/NALPPressReleasePerspectives_21July2021.pdf)although COVID made this year incomparable with previous seasons, firms may have been too cautious in recruiting amid the pandemic:

“There is a story that emerges, however, despite the asterisks, and that is one of both resilience and caution,” Leipold said. “Firms made conservative decisions about future talent at a moment when the future was uncertain. In retrospect, some of those decisions may prove to have been too conservative, and indeed we see that some of the figures measured in this recruiting cycle approach some of the low water marks reached in the immediate aftermath of the Great Recession.”

But it doesn’t look like this hiring dip will be permanent. In a corollary to the [hot lateral market in Biglaw, ](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/the-biglaw-lateral-market-is-fire-right-now/) Leipold also sees indictions the next class of summer associates will be larger:

“In fact, word on the street is that the July/August 2021 recruiting cycle for summer associate positions for members of the class of 2023 is already off to a rollicking start.”

# Baker McKenzie Partner Leaves Firm After Conclusion Of Racism Probe
## The firm issued an apology, and said that a new management team would be put into place.

The managing partner of the Belgium office of Baker McKenzie has left the firm following an internal investigation into claims of racism. Daniel Felser, the departing partner, had temporarily stepped down from his leadership role pending the completion of the investigation.

As we [previously noted](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/baker-mckenzie-partner-racism-allegations/), the allegations of racism stemmed from a departure memo from an attorney at the firm, which detailed a variety of problematic incidents. As reported by [Legal Cheek](https://www.legalcheek.com/2023/03/baker-mckenzie-belgium-managing-partner-departs-firm-following-review-into-racism-claims/):

The probe was launched after after we exclusively revealed that a former lawyer at the firm had quit over what she claimed was a “lack of diversity” in a departing email to colleagues.

The mixed-race lawyer, who we have not named, alleged a series of discriminatory incidents took place during her time at the firm, which included colleagues using the “N word”, touching her hair out of curiosity, and questioning whether a family photo was “a rap album cover”.

She also claimed she was “yelled at” by a staff member for reporting the use of “blackface” during a traditional “Sinterklass” event and that her work email address indicated only part of her surname as “it would otherwise be confusing for clients”.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Kirsty Wilson, a member of Baker McKenzie’s executive committee and its global inclusion, diversity & equity committee chair, issued a statement on Felser’s ouster departure: “We have completed a thorough review of the incidents and broader issues raised in our former colleague’s email. Where we were able to identify individuals responsible for specific incidents, appropriate action has been taken. We are incredibly sorry and sincerely regret that our former Belgium colleague, or any colleague, has had this experience.”

Wilson continued, noting that “a new management team will take our Belgium offices forward” and that “as part of this, we have agreed with Daniel Fesler that he will permanently step down from the role of managing partner and leave the firm. We thank him for his service and commitment to clients over the past 30 years.”

It’s good to see the global firm taking allegations of racism seriously. Now that “appropriate action” has been taken, we hope that life at Baker McKenzie Belgium takes a turn for the better.

# Compassion And Courage Amid Coronavirus: Lawyers Speak Out

Thanks to the COVID-19 crisis, the legal profession as a whole is currently attempting to navigate uncharted waters.

To protect their employees from contracting the potentially fatal illness, law firms have closed their doors and urged their employees to do all of their work remotely. Law schools have canceled on-campus classes in favor of virtual learning, and some have even canceled their upcoming commencements in an effort to flatten the curve and stop the spread. Throw grade school and high school closures into the mix, and we now have all manner of legal professionals trying to get their own work done while teaching and parenting their children at the same time.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Did we mention the economic turmoil the coronsvirus has caused? The legal profession has already been through tough economic times, and while many made it out by the skin of their teeth, others did not. In a professional environment where mental health is finally having its moment, layoffs, furloughs, delayed start dates, and pulled offers are now worries once more.

We’re living in scary times. There’s a very real human toll here, and people are being stretched incredibly thin. Above the Law’s own founder, David Lat, has fallen ill with this virus and is currently on a ventilator. This has hit home for us, and we know it’s hit home for you too. We must find compassion and courage amid COVID-19.

As the most popular legal website in the country, we’d like to share this platform with members of the American legal community. We want to know how you’re coping with the coronavirus. Please reach out to us. Your stories need to be heard. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=The%20Coronavirus%20Struggle), text us at (646) 820-8477, or tweet us [@atlblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog). We will share your stories anonymously. You may be able to help a law student or lawyer who needs to know that someone else is going through the same thing — and surviving.

Although we have to be apart to stop the coronavirus in its tracks, the only way we’re going to get through this is together.

# Mo Money, Mo Problems -- Again
## The cost of Biglaw's $200K starting salaries.

Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly, and Biglaw firms gotta raise first-year associates’ salaries. Milbank led the charge this year, and, for the first time, incoming associate salaries will be more than $200,000. Most every major large firm has followed suit. Get out the bubbly. This is a great thing for the industry and those lucky enough to cash those paychecks, right?

Strings Attached

Not so fast. Let’s talk for a minute about what life is like for the associates who sign up for that $200K-plus paycheck. Associate life in Biglaw is largely defined by the billable hour, of which you generally need to be cranking 2,400 to 2,600 a year — if not more. That means that new salary will cost an associate roughly 50 billable hours a week on average just to stay afloat and move on to the next year.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The normal American workweek is 40 hours, or eight hours a day for five days a week. To get another 25% above that, either you’re billing 10-hour days every single day or you’re committing your weekends to the cause. Or, more likely, both.

And lest we forget, billable hours and hours spent on the job are not the same number. Do you have a commute? Add that time to the pile of what you’re committing. Do you want to eat lunch or dinner during those long days? Either eat while working at your desk or commit to longer days to make up the difference. Enjoy chatting with your coworkers, developing your skills through CLE, or performing pro bono work? I hope you enjoyed them enough to make up the hours somewhere else. The billable hour requirement at a Biglaw firm is a furnace that always needs to be fed, often to the tune of 70 to 80 actual hours a week or more committed to work.

In comparison, a typical regional firm will have a billable hours requirement of 1,900 to 2,000 hours. The NLJ 250 firm I call home, Fennemore, has an 1,850 target. That’s a 500 to 700 hour swing as compared to a coastal firm’s expectations. That kind of time could be the difference between you having a hobby, exercising, taking vacation, or not doing any of those things. It could be the difference between being happy or just existing.

That kind of time might also be what determines whether you develop a book of business to call your own. We all take our own paths to developing our client base, but not many of us stumble into our clients during work hours. Most of us have to network, develop our skill sets, and get out of the office on our own time to build those relationships. There’s not a lot of time for that when you’re trying to get 2,600 hours billed to keep your assigning partner happy.

What’s Your Long Game?

Where do you see yourself in 10 years? If you answered “still in Biglaw,” then you’re probably wrong, at least statistically. Milbank, which fired the first shot in this year’s salary wars, elected [five attorneys](https://www.milbank.com/en/news/milbank-llp-elects-five-attorneys-to-partnership.html) into its partnership this year. In an average year it brings aboard 50 to 80 new [entry-level associates](https://www.chambers-associate.com/law-firms/law-firm-intake-sizes). That’s on average less than one partner made for every 10 new associates, before we even consider the further dilution of those numbers by laterals. Milbank’s not an outlier, either. Skadden promoted [13 partners](https://www.skadden.com/about/news-and-rankings/news/2020/04/skadden-names-new-partners) the same year its summer associate class boasted [177 members](https://www.skadden.com/careers/attorneys/law-students-and-graduates/united-states/summer-associates#:~:text=Skadden%20hired%20177%20summer%20associates%20in%202020). Overall 90% or more of Biglaw first-years will leave before making partner. In comparison, at the NLJ 250 firm I’m at, we had a summer class of seven last year and a new-partner class of four.

For those who do make it to partner in Biglaw, congratulations! You won the pie-eating contest, and your prize is more pie. Expect to continue billing an absurd amount of hours a year, as well as supervising junior attorneys, maintaining client relationships, and attending to firm managerial responsibilities.

On the plus side, you’ll start keeping more of what you brought in than you did as an associate. A Biglaw associate in New York City might easily have a billable rate of $600/hour or more. Some firms charge [over $1,000 an hour](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/biglaw-firms-are-charging-how-much-for-associates/) for associate time. Even discounting for collections, write-offs, and other issues, it’s not outlandish to expect a firm to make $1.5 million or more (sometimes substantially more) in revenue on an associate in any given year. After your $200,000 salary and maybe another $200,000 in overhead costs, the firm clears over $1 million profit, or around two-thirds the revenue. You kept around 13% of the value you created, and all you had to sacrifice was your nights, weekends, and personal relationships.

Don’t get me wrong, that’s how law firms and most other businesses work. The owners provide the clients and resources and take all the risk, so they keep the lion’s share of the profit. But smaller market firms tend to share the wealth a bit more, usually devoting about 20% of collections to associate compensation as opposed to 13% or less in the biggest of Biglaw.

What Are You Worth To Yourself?

If my concerns about the Biglaw salary wars can be summed up in a word, it’s sustainability. It’s been assumed since I was in law school that Biglaw associates were worked to death, and that’s why they got paid the big salaries. Those whopping salaries in turn became justification to raise associate billing expectations, which in due course lead back to more raises. I fear this last round of raises is just another step on an unseemly cycle that will continue until either we as an industry decide to stop, or (more likely) until we hit the physical limits of what a newly graduated law student can bill. The status quo won’t last, and it doesn’t seem headed anywhere good.

There’s nothing morally wrong with this arrangement. If you want to commit a few of the best years of your young life to working like a dog and forsaking everything else in pursuit of a big salary, you should be free to do so. And Biglaw should be free to pay you for the privilege. But at the end of that marathon, what do you really have? Probably poor health, damaged personal relationships, and internalized, unhealthy views of work-life balance. What you don’t likely have are a support network, a book of business, or a realistic prospect of partnership.

Before committing to signing on to a firm that promises you that giant salary, consider what that paycheck will actually cost you. Don’t let the big shiny number blind you to reality. Consider not stepping onto that endless treadmill, and instead maybe work somewhere that sees you more as a future partner and less as a present-day billable machine.

Sometimes less truly is more.

Like many lawyers, I’m a sucker for rankings. In the world of Biglaw, some of the most notable rankings are the [Am Law 100](https://davidlat.substack.com/p/the-top-10-most-profitable-biglaw) and [Am Law 200](https://davidlat.substack.com/p/theyre-here-the-2021-am-law-200-rankings) rankings, which rank the nation’s largest law firms by total revenue (and also include data on such metrics as profits per equity partner), and the [Vault 100 rankings](https://www.vault.com/best-companies-to-work-for/law/top-100-law-firms-rankings), which rank firms by prestige.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Not to be overlooked, however, are the NLJ 500 rankings, in which the National Law Journal ranks the 500 largest firms in the United States by lawyer headcount — the firms that put the “big” in “Biglaw.” They might not be as sexy as rankings of firms based on profitability or prestige, but they still matter.

First, the NLJ 500 rankings remind us that large U.S. law firms, even if they’re not publicly traded, can be bigger than all but the biggest companies, generating billions in revenue and employing thousands of people, including not just lawyers but paralegals, legal assistants, and other professionals. Second, the rankings also reveal how many people’s careers and lives are tied to a particular firm, and in that sense they reflect a firm’s influence and importance within the Biglaw ecosystem.

As I’ve mentioned in these pages, I’ve been a bit distracted over the past few weeks by our family’s big move from Manhattan to the New Jersey suburbs. So I actually missed the latest [NLJ 500 rankings](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/06/23/the-nlj-500-our-2021-survey-of-the-nations-largest-law-firms/) when the National Law Journal issued them late last month. I’d like to take this occasion to double back and discuss them.

Here are the top 10 firms from the [NLJ 500](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/06/24/the-nlj-500-main-chart-3/), i.e., the ten biggest firms in terms of headcount based on 2020 data. I calculated myself and added in two columns of calculations that I thought might be of interest — partners as a percentage of total attorneys at a firm, and equity partners as a percentage of total attorneys at a firm:

Some brief observations:

- The headcount of the largest firm, Baker McKenzie, is a staggering 4,699 — 700 lawyers more than second-place DLA Piper. And Baker McKenzie’s headcount actually decreased last year, by 2.3 percent, meaning that it was even bigger in 2019.
- In the top 10, the firm where equity partners make up the smallest slice of total headcount is DLA Piper, where they amount to a little more than 10 percent of all attorneys.
- I was surprised by how high the percentages were for partners as a percentage of total attorneys. The title of “partner” doesn’t mean as much as it used to, given the rise in the ranks of nonequity partners (a group that grew in size last year by 3 percent, even though overall lawyer headcount at NLJ 500 firms declined by 0.1 percent). But I was still surprised to see that at most of the top 10 firms, about a third of lawyers carry the “partner” title.
- I wasn’t shocked to see that at Kirkland & Ellis, where you get the title of (nonequity aka “nonshare”) partner if you stick it out for six years or so, more than 40 percent of lawyers have the partner title. But K&E wasn’t even the highest in this regard; at Greenberg Traurig, more than half the lawyers are partners (or “shareholders,” in GT parlance).
- In the top 10 largest firms, the only firm with a single-tier, all-equity partnership is Jones Day. So in one sense it’s easier to make equity partner at JD, but it might mean less once you do: profits per equity partner (PPEP) at Jones Day were just shy of $1.3 million in the latest Am Law 100 rankings, which is quite low by Biglaw standards in 2021. And under the firm’s [“black box” compensation system](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/jones-days-black-box-pay-prevails-for-now-as-women-drop-suit), Jones Day can get away with paying many partners well below that average PPEP figure.
If you hop over to the [National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/06/23/the-nlj-500-our-2021-survey-of-the-nations-largest-law-firms/), you can access the full rankings plus extensive color commentary. Here are a few other highlights from elsewhere in the NLJ 500, including the cities and states with the most NLJ 500 lawyers.

# Profits Margins In Law Firms – Dumb And Dumberer
## Profit margin is a dangerous metric to use in comparing law firm profitability, per managing partner Bruce Stachenfeld.

Matthew Guarnaccia recently wrote [an article for Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/875379/profit-margin-gap-widens-between-top-and-mid-tier-uk-firms) about how profit margins are changing at top- and mid-tier UK firms. Apparently the big firms’ profit margins are getting bigger and the mid-sized firms’ are getting smaller. He concludes it is because the big firms are getting higher-margin work.

Although I actually agree with Guarnaccia’s conclusion (see below), his article misses a major point about law firm profit margins, which is that it is possibly the most meaningless statistic out there or, even if not meaningless, easily manipulated.

Consider a 100-lawyer firm. Each lawyer generates $750,000 a year in revenues, so the total dollars are $75,000,000. Overhead (not counting lawyer compensation) is about $20,000,000, so there is $55,000,000 of gross profits.

Now assume that there are 20 partners and 80 associates and the associates are each paid $300,000 each, or $24,000,000. That leaves the firm with $31,000,000 of profits. The profit margin is now $31,000,000 divided by $75,000,000, which is 41%.

But how about if you had 80 partners and 20 associates? Now the profits are $49,000,000, which is a profit margin of 65%.

The second firm’s leverage is looking a lot worse (with 80 partners and only 20 associates), but its profit margin is dramatically higher!

And what if you had 1 partner and 99 associates? Now the profit margin is only 34%, but that one partner is earning $25,300,000!

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
My point is that a firm’s profit margin can be completely manipulated by two factors:

The titles that a firm gives to its lawyers; and

The leverage in the system.

I do think the concept of profit margin can be looked at usefully if you have a relatively static system, such as comparing a law firm that doesn’t change much between several years to see if it is getting more or less profitable – or maybe comparing two very similar law firms to see which is more profitable. But to make comparisons between big and mid-sized firms in the way Guarnaccia has done – and based on those comparisons, drawing conclusions about the profitability of work — is not a good strategy.

Okay, now to come out the other way and say that Guarnaccia’s conclusions are probably correct, but maybe even more correct than he articulates. This is because it is likely that the major firms are artificially restricting the number of partners and using a lot of leverage, which will mean that their profit margins should be falling next to the mid-sized firms. Since the profit margins of the big firms are in fact rising as compared to the mid-sized firms, it is likely that the big firms are trouncing the mid-sized firms even more soundly on a profitability basis than it appears from just looking at the profit margins.

The COVID-19 global pandemic has forced law firms to adapt at an unprecedented pace. To gain a sense of how firms are reprioritizing and reconfiguring their processes and operations — and how associates are being affected — Major, Lindsey & Africa and Above the Law fielded a survey of law firm associates in April 2020. The survey received responses sharing insight into topics such as communication transparency, technological resources, firm culture, and potential long-term effects on the profession.

This new report, The Unprecedented Challenge of COVID-19: Findings from the 2020 Major, Lindsey & Africa / Above the Law Law Firm Associate Survey, offers the most detailed picture available of how law firms and individual associates are coping right now with both the ongoing disruption and the prospect of lasting change.

In the days of paper court filings, you could hand the clerk a document and directly address any of their concerns in-person.

Now, eFiled documents are too often returned with a note — or, worse, no note at all — with sometimes-confusing directives.

In this free white paper, our friends at InfoTrack analyze hundreds of state court documents that were rejected between July 2020 and June 2021.

Based on this data, the paper provides recommendations for avoiding issues that can lead to rejection, along with a pre-filing checklist to help ensure your documents are accepted.

# No. 2 Biglaw Firm In America Announces New Salary Scale For Associates
## More money for hardworking associates is something that everyone can get behind. Congrats!
By [Staci Zaretsky](https://abovethelaw.com/author/staci-zaretsky/)

One by one, Biglaw compensation news continue to be announced, with some firms offering their associates the best holiday presents of all: higher salaries.

To that end, we’ve now confirmed that Latham & Watkins — a firm that brought in $5,321,007,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 2 in the most recent Am Law 100 — has chosen to use the Cravath scale for its salary increases, meaning these are the salaries associates at the firm will see, effective January 1:

- Class of 2023 – $225,000
- Class of 2022 – $235,000
- Class of 2021 – $260,000
- Class of 2020 – $310,000
- Class of 2019 – $365,000
- Class of 2018 – $390,000
- Class of 2017 – $420,000
- Class of 2016 – $435,000
- Class of 2015+ – $445,000
It’s worth nothing that Latham is one of the few firms that’s offering higher salaries for its most senior associates, joining the likes of Sidley, Ropes, and Schulte. It’s also worth noting that these raises apply only to associates in the U.S., London, the Middle East, Beijing, Hong Kong, Seoul, and Tokyo (though the firm is “considering” adopting this salary scale in some of its other offices).

As far as bonuses are concerned, good things come to those who wait, and Latham associates will be rewarded for their patience in the coming weeks. Median bonuses at the firm are usually above market, and associates are looking forward to receiving good news soon.

Congratulations to everyone at Latham!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from the firm.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of compensation updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or email us (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus/Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks for your help!

Most people think of a legal team simply as a group of people who work in a law office — the lawyers, paralegals, and secretaries. However, legal teams involve many more players than that. A legal team comprises everyone who has a role in getting a product or service to market. That may include members of your marketing, sales, and operations departments and your executive team.

Regarding product launches and other significant initiatives, it’s not surprising that effective collaboration among all team members is essential. But what does “effective collaboration” mean? How can you ensure that it happens?

Let’s explore those questions and discuss some tips for fostering effective collaboration throughout your legal team.

Define The Roles And Responsibilities Of Each Team Member

Before you start collaborating, you must ensure that all members know their roles. Each team member should clearly understand their responsibilities and how they fit into the overall picture. Otherwise, it will be difficult to coordinate efforts between team members and between departments.

To clearly define these roles, you may want to create a simple matrix that lists all of the team members and their respective roles. This will ensure everyone is on the same page and knows who is responsible for what.

Set Clear Goals And Objectives

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Once all team members know their roles, it’s time to start setting the goals they’ll be striving to meet. What is the overall goal of the project? What specific objectives need to be met by the different parties involved? Without a clear understanding of the project’s goals, it will be challenging to measure success.

That said, it’s also essential to ensure the goals are realistic. If the goals are too ambitious, team members may feel discouraged by their seeming inability to achieve them. On the other hand, team members may become complacent if the goals are too easy.

Communicate Regularly

Effective collaboration is impossible without effective communication. Team members must be able to share information and ideas freely, whether through regular meetings, conference calls, or email.

But communication is not just about sharing information. It’s also about listening. Team members need to be open to hearing new ideas and feedback. Otherwise, communication will break down, severely limiting and negating the benefits of teamwork.

Encourage Creativity

One of the best ways to foster effective collaboration is to encourage team members to think outside the box, using creative approaches to develop new ideas. This will help ensure that everyone is invested in the project, that no one is bored and complacent, and that the final product is the best it can be.

To encourage creativity, you may want to try brainstorming sessions or creative exercises to instill a fresh, imaginative mindset in your team.

Be Open To Feedback

Feedback is essential for effective collaboration, allowing team members to share their thoughts and ideas openly. Without the ability to provide feedback, team members may feel like their input isn’t valued, becoming less personally invested in the project’s success.

To encourage feedback, you may want to create a dedicated space for it. This can be a physical space, like a whiteboard, or an online space, like Google Docs. Alternatively, you may want to set aside time at the end of each meeting for team members to share their feedback.

Final Thoughts

Effective collaboration is essential for any legal team. By following the tips above, you can help ensure that your team works together smoothly to achieve its goals. To foster a collaborative environment conducive to success, you just have to communicate regularly, encourage creativity, and be open to feedback.

# Law School To Accept GREs In Order To Corner The Market On Mediocrities
## People with good GRE scores will continue on their path. People with bad GRE scores will get caught in the law school trap.

Nowadays, the only barriers to a legal education are the ability to fill out a financial aid form and the ability to fill out the LSAT. You don’t even have to “take” the damn thing, JUST FILL IT OUT. Law schools are so desperate to fill seats that anybody can get in. [The “brain drain” from law schools is real](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/the-great-law-school-brain-drain-is-the-reason-why-more-people-are-failing-the-bar-exam-than-ever-before/?rf=1), and, like climate change, the only people who deny it are the very dumb or those who care more about their profit margins than a sustainable ecosystem.

At least the LSAT separates out the people who have done some basic research into legal education from those who think a J.D. and a Ph.D. in “law” are the same thing. But, evidently, that bar was just a little too high for some law schools. The University of Arizona Rogers College of Law has decided to [accept GRE scores in lieu of LSAT scores](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/home/id=1202749341287/Arizona-College-of-Law-Will-Accept-GRE-Instead-of-LSAT?mcode=1202617074964&curindex=2&slreturn=20160111135412) for new applicants who choose that option. We’ve previously talked about [Wake Forest Law looking into the same arrangement](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/this-law-school-will-pay-you-to-take-the-gre-to-save-its-u-s-news-rank-from-the-dreaded-lsat/?rf=1).

That’s the University of Arizona, folks. We’re not talking about some InfiLaw diploma mill like Arizona Desiccation or Arizona Summit (only one of those names is a joke). We’re talking about a relatively respected state law school that is now inviting in people who couldn’t even be bothered to take the LSAT.

Arizona is emphasizing a study by Educational Testing Services that suggests that the GRE is just as “reliable” of a predictor of law school success as the LSAT. But there are a couple of problems with that point:

A) Educational Testing Services administers the GRE. I mean, if you ask me, “Hey Elie, is reading Above the Law in college a good predictor of Law School success?,” I’m going to find a way to say, “Yes, gimmie money now.”

B) WHO THE F**K CARES if the GRE is just as relevant as the LSAT? The GRE is not a good predictor of whether the people who take it want to go to law school, because if they did, THEY’D BE TAKING THE LSAT. The point of the LSAT is to set up a minimal barrier to entry in the hopes that those who end up in law school are at least somewhat serious about pursuing legal education and have the basic logic and reading comprehension skills to achieve that goal.

Make no mistake about what is going on here. Now, not only will Arizona take pretty much everybody who is able to score above “illiterate” on the LSAT, they’ll also take the people who took the GREs but were too stupid to get into their first choice graduate program they wanted when they signed up for the damn test.

People with good GRE scores will continue on their path. People with bad GRE scores will get caught in the law school trap. Watching Arizona do this is like watching the moment when a bear decides, “Why would I head to the salmon stream when there’s all this human garbage people have literally just been throwing away.”

And in the bargain, Arizona will have an opportunity to hide the crappy LSAT scores of its admitted students from U.S. News by matriculating a class of students with no LSAT scores at all.

Other than that, NO CONCERNS, ARIZONA. I’m glad the law school machine has found a whole other way to prop up its business model without offering students the kind of price sensitivity and value proposition that would make law students actually want to go to law school.

# Judging Your Work Ethic (Or Your Insanity) By Your Travel Plans
## The ‘when do you prefer to fly’ test is a pretty good one, helping you to judge whether a person aggressively prefers to devote time to business or personal affairs.

This struck me when I worked for a huge law firm, more than a decade ago.

We had to schedule some jury research.  We were inviting the whole world — a collection of lawyers from the firm and a collection of in-house lawyers.  The jury research was impossible to schedule.  We finally found a date that was good for everyone — a Friday some months off.

The lawyers at my firm were delighted that the jury research had been set for a Friday.  That would let you work all week and then fly home either late Friday night or early Saturday.  Everyone naturally preferred to travel during dead time on a weekend.

A couple of weeks later, one of the in-house lawyers called:  “I just noticed that we scheduled the jury research for a Friday.  That’s ridiculous.  We’d have to fly home late on a Friday night or on a Saturday.  I’m not going to miss a Friday night or a Saturday for work.  Please reschedule the jury research.”

We did.

But it got me to thinking.

Maybe a good way to test the work ethic (or the insanity) of an institution is to see whether people prefer to fly on weekdays or weekends.

If everyone is itching to fly on Sunday, to start work bright and early Monday morning, your place is on the industrious side.

Conversely, if everyone refuses to fly on Sunday — “Why would I fly on one of my days off?” — and plans to fly during the workweek, we’ll put your joint on the more leisurely side.

My test may not apply to an institution as a whole.  At a law firm, for example, the lawyers may prefer to fly on weekends, but the folks who don’t generate revenue — the IT staff, for example — may be weekday fliers.  Or maybe it depends whether the IT staff is paid on an hourly or annual basis.

At corporations, you may see differences between revenue-generators and non-revenue generators; between folks who are frantically busy at work and folks who are less busy; between people who are childless, rearing children, or whose kids are in college or beyond; and so on.

But the “when do you prefer to fly” test is a pretty good one, helping you to judge whether a person aggressively prefers to devote time to business or personal affairs.

# Billion-Dollar Biglaw Firm Ponies Up Special Bonuses For Hardworking Associates
## Saying thank you with cold hard cash.

The Biglaw bonus bandwagon is really picking up steam! The latest firm to spread the wealth to associates in the form of special bonuses is Reed Smith — which took the 26th spot on the 2020 Am Law rankings with over a billion dollars in gross revenue.

In an all associates call this morning, firm leadership announced they’d be paying associates bonus on the market scale set last month by Davis Polk. The bonus amounts will range from $12,000 to $64,000, depending on class year. In order to qualify for the bonuses, associates have to bill 50 hours over the standard annualized billable hours requirements (which translates to 1950 hours, but insiders say pro bono and other non-client hours count towards the total). The bonuses will be paid in two installments, June and December (40 percent of the payment in the first payment, 60 percent in the second), and associates will have the opportunity to get a catch up payment if they make up their hours in the back half of the year. And, these special bonuses are in addition to any annual bonuses.

And tipsters at the firm seem pleased with the firm’s bonus news:

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

According to data collected by Law.com for the 2020 Am Law 100 ranking, Wachtell comes in first at profits per lawyer (PPL) with $2.03 million in profits per lawyer. Which Biglaw firm comes in second by PPL?

Hint: Wachtell more than doubles the second place firm’s PPL, but that firm made a respectable $943,000 in PPL in 2019.

Oooh! Ahhh! That’s the sound of associates reading their emails with glee as they learned about the salary increases they’d be receiving from Magic Circle firm Allen & Overy. “Happy that the firm was able to make a relatively quick decision to retain talent and continue to invest in the US office,” said one source.

Associates working at the firm’s offices in Los Angeles, New York, D.C., and São Paulo will receive raises on the Davis Polk scale, like so:

- 2020: $205,000
- 2019: $215,000
- 2018: $240,000
- 2017: $275,000
- 2016: $305,000
- 2015: $330,000
- 2014: $350,000
- 2013: $365,000

# Why Aren't Biglaw Firms Publicly Denouncing The Dobbs Decision?

This is a tightrope to walk for firms. They have a diversity of views among their talent and clients.

— Kent Zimmermann, a law firm consultant with the Zeughauser Group, in comments given to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/large-us-law-firms-mostly-quiet-abortion-ruling-are-walking-tightrope-2022-06-26/) as to why more Biglaw firms haven’t taken a public stance on the Dobbs decision, which overruled Roe v. Wade and took away a constitutional freedom that had been precedent for almost half a century. Robert Kamins, a consultant with Vertex Advisors who works with law firms, echoed Zimmermann’s thoughts, saying firms must be “very cautious” when speaking about the case. “They have to make sure that they are being thoughtful about it,” he said. “What is the business impact? What is the client impact? What is the recruiting impact? There are lots of things to think about.”

A New York lawyer is on the run after allegedly shooting and killing his child’s mother inside their shared home.

[James R. Ray III](http://raypclaw.com/), a 2008 graduate of the University of New Hampshire School of Law, has been charged with murder and weapons offenses, and is currently wanted by police in New Jersey. NJ.com has additional details on the crime:

James R. Ray III, 55, allegedly shot Angela M. Bledsoe, 44, in a home on the 300 block of North Mountain Avenue on Monday, according to a statement issued by the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office.

Police received a call requesting a wellness check at the house shortly before midnight and found Beldsoe suffering from multiple gunshot wounds. She was pronounced dead at the scene early Tuesday.

Ray is no stranger to the pages of Above the Law. In 2013, he was sued by a recent law school graduate who worked as a paralegal at his firm and claimed that for the two months she worked there, Ray subjected her to “egregious, despicable, embarrassing, open, and obvious sexual harassment.” She alleged that Ray constantly regaled her with stories of [his love for polygamy](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/04/a-polygamist-and-his-paralegal-a-tale-of-sexual-harassment/?rf=1), and even went so far as to request that she become his “third wife.” That suit was later settled out of court.

Authorities say Ray is to be considered armed and dangerous. He may be driving a black BMW 328i with New Jersey license plate ZNX68M. Anyone with information is asked to contact the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office at 1-877-847-7432.

# Lawyers Aren't Necessarily Good Managers... So Why Do We Let Them Manage Firms?
## Biglaw looks almost exclusively to within for leadership, which probably isn't the best use of resources.

As Biglaw firms grow ever larger — in some cases [becoming global behemoths](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/why-these-global-100-numbers-should-scare-the-bejeezus-out-of-you/) — it becomes even more absurd that firms cling so tightly to the idea that only one of their own can lead the firm. This isn’t to say there aren’t a plethora of successful managing partners out there, but as a law firm drifts farther from a small law partnership and closer to a Fortune 500 conglomerate — as many firms have — why exactly do these firms stick with a managing partner model?

The answer is probably “rank hubris,” but let’s suss this out.

Chris Johnson touches on this in [a recent piece](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202798801894/Why-Dont-Law-Firms-Like-Experienced-Managers) providing context to the news of former DLA Piper chair Nigel Knowles lateraling to DWF:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Despite this, there is still a degree of stigma attached to management within law firms. Partners, in particular, can be fairly dismissive of leadership roles, often seeing them as a business overhead of questionable importance.

It’s worth noting just how many law firm managers retain an active practice of lawyering and running client relationships. In what other industry would running a billion-dollar organization not be seen as a full-time job? (The reality is that many Big Law management partners just end up effectively working two full-time jobs, but still…)

It’s simply bonkers for an efficiency-minded company to have a CEO with a divided attention, and yet that’s what most elite law firms do every day. But worse than dividing loyalties is the risk of the infamous Peter Principle, that everyone is promoted to the level of their own incompetence. The world’s greatest rainmaker doesn’t necessarily make the best at balancing office supply budgets, and yet firms assign the latter tasks on the basis of skill at the former.

Few other industries work like this. Steve Jobs built the most valuable company in the world, yet he had to be fired and spend years in the wilderness to get his management skills right. The people with their pulse on the substantive business of companies are rarely CEOs — and even when they are, a quick scratch below the surface reveals a shadow COO. Running a company is just a different job. That’s why no one bats an eye when — to stick with the Apple example — a soda company executive takes over a tech company. There’s a management class that exists wholly distinct from the substance of any given business.

Not that these professional executives are always great at their jobs. It’s a sickness of corporate culture that an executive can run a company into the ground and, instead of languishing in obscurity as befitting their epic failure, immediately gets the benefit of the doubt when another board hands them the keys to another shiny new corporation. Running a company may involve a unique skill set, but there’s a danger in putting this managerial class on too much of a pedestal.

Which brings us back to the Biglaw bias against “nonlawyer” managers:

The argument against bringing in a professional manager from outside the legal industry is that they simply wouldn’t understand how to run a law firm. I’d proffer that it has more to do with lawyers being extremely reluctant to take orders from nonlawyers, but it is fair to say that it does represent a difficult transition.

Are law firms really such unique hothouse flowers that no one from outside of lawyer life can understand them? It’s a service industry! The nuts and bolts aren’t that much different than any other professional-services provider.

In the end, the charitable reason why Biglaw lacks nonlawyer management is the deeply risk-averse nature of lawyers. The management class may offer needed skills that partners just can’t match, but there’s always the risk of landing a dud. Partners know each other. Perhaps the managing partner isn’t the best option on the market, but he or she is a known variable. The firm isn’t going to crash while some mercenary executive pulls the ripcord on their golden parachute. That just might be worth forsaking some of that partner’s business.

But it’s probably still hubris.

# Attorney Warns Biglaw's Antisemitism Letter Makes Lawyers Worry About Getting Fired, Gets Fired
## Firm parts ways with lawyer calling on Biglaw to embrace more nuance in discussing the conflict in the Middle East.

In the immediate aftermath of the attacks Hamas launched on Israel last month, some law students and lawyers said some incredibly awful things and got penalized for it. An NYU Law student saw their future job yanked after writing that [the attacks were “necessary.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/nyu-student-bar-president-israel-palestine/) Firms [rescinded offers to students](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/davis-polk-rescinds-offers-to-t14-law-school-students-for-their-controversial-statements-on-israel/) for belonging to groups that signed a letter describing the attacks as a “counter-offensive.” One lawyer [went full Hitler](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/attorney-goes-on-pro-hitler-antisemitic-social-media-screed-immediately-loses-her-job/).

Firms have a right to terminate employees for making controversial statements. And downplaying terrorism falls squarely in that zone! But it quickly became clear that some firm would eventually run into a more difficult fact pattern. Indeed, [Davis Polk almost immediately opened the door to backtracking](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/17/business/davis-polk-employment-columbia-harvard-israel-palestine.html) on its decision to cut ties with students who merely belonged to groups that signed a controversial letter.

A government cannot and should not be above criticism, but navigating the line between critiquing Israeli policy and antisemitism can be difficult. Faced with this challenge and the complex issues it brings, Biglaw firms [put out a public letter blaming law school deans](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/biglaw-firms-tell-law-schools-to-pls-hndle-thx-antisemitism/).

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

While [some firms have taken concrete action to confront antisemitism](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/biglaw-firm-joins-hotline-for-victims-of-campus-antisemitic-harassment/), most rested on vague denunciations and passed the buck back to the academics who don’t have the luxury of walking away from the hard cases where they have to decide when a protest calling for a ceasefire is really a peace rally or just a convenient cover for people airing antisemitic tropes.

And this is a real problem! Not to embrace the Potter Stewart standard, but two groups making superficially the same call can have very different motivations. To use an example from the flipside, [Marjorie Taylor Greene led the drive to censure Rashida Tlaib for antisemitism](https://michiganadvance.com/2023/10/29/greene-wants-tlaib-censured-for-antisemitic-activity-mich-lawmaker-calls-measure-unhinged/) while also [speaking to groups founded by a Holocaust denier](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/marjorie-taylor-greene-cpac-nick-fuentes-afpac-white-nationalist/).

In response to the Biglaw letter, Sidley attorney Melat Kiros [drafted a lengthy piece](https://medium.com/@melatakiros/dear-us-law-firms-77ec63e838af) critiquing the signatory firms for conflating antisemitism with geopolitical commentary. Kiros argued that while antisemitic harassment and violence is rightly denounced, critical statements about the state of Israel as a political entity represent the sort of core political speech that is “the bedrock principle of a true democracy.” By failing to grapple with this distinction in the letter, “the chilling effect is undeniable,” on attorneys worried about their jobs.

[So she got fired](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/11/13/sidley-fires-associate-after-she-speaks-out-against-law-firms-letter-on-israel-gaza-405-131883/?kw=Sidley%20Fires%20Associate%20After%20She%20Speaks%20Out%20Against%20Law%20Firms%27%20Letter%20on%20Antisemitism&utm_source=email&utm_medium=enl&utm_campaign=newsroomupdate&utm_content=20231113&utm_term=tal&oly_enc_id=9241F9834912G4T).

The associate, Melat Kiros, a regulatory lawyer based in Sidley’s New York office, published the letter to Medium, which was widely shared on LinkedIn. Senior members of the firm had asked her to take the letter down, according to sources. After she declined, she was terminated. One of the people said that the firm had informed Kiros that the letter ran afoul of certain of the firm’s policies and procedures.

Where Kiros lost a lot of folks was framing the question around the letter characterizing “calls for the elimination of the Israeli state” as antisemitic. The rest of the Kiros piece suggests some sort of multiethnic state as opposed to the very, very antisemitic talk of the “elimination” of Israel through murder and exile.

Perhaps it is naive to believe that the people in Palestine and Israel might one day live together as neighbors, in peace, without fear of persecution, under a new government, but it is not hopeless, and, most importantly, it is not anti-Semitic.

That’s a far cry from defending violence. But “elimination” is still a rhetorical framing requiring the reader to get past the first paragraph to untangle. The piece had, understandably, already triggered a lot of people with its language by that point.

While on the subject of the existence of the state of Israel, Sidley’s website indicates that its Middle East work [includes sovereign entities and working in “each Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) country,”](https://www.sidley.com/en/locations/global-reach/middle-east) the latter organization includes multiple governments that refuse to recognize the legitimacy of Israel. Qatar is in the GCC and [historically provides funding for Hamas](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-cash-to-crypto-global-finance-maze-israels-sights-2023-10-16/). Maybe the firm only works with sovereign entities of the GCC governments who have recognized Israel — that’s not clear from its description of its work.

Which isn’t meant as a knock on the firm as much as a suggestion that delineating where a stance on Israeli policy crosses into antisemitism is more complex for firms than they might admit.

# Biglaw Firm Offers Raises To Associates, Along With Mega-Bonuses Of Up To $172,500 For Its Busiest Billers
## Wow! Now THAT is a bonus!

Biglaw raises and bonuses keep on coming, and associates are absolutely thrilled.

The latest firm to announce is Katten Muchin. The firm that brought in $742,885,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 67 in the most recent Am Law 100, and it’s chosen to use the Cravath scale for its compensation increases as well as its bonuses. Check out the firm’s new compensation grid.



Note that for the Class of 2016 and beyond, Katten has not gone the Milbank route by offering a $435K salary, but instead offers the same salary as the Class of 2017, putting its most senior associates below market. On the other hand, associates who have really billed their butts off this year stand to make above-market bonuses, with its most senior associates eligible to receive up to $57,500 more than their peers at other firms. On top of these elevated bonuses for high billers, there are additional “superstar” bonuses available for the most dedicated associates.

Congratulations to everyone at Katten!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from the firm.)

Yeah… this is how not to do legal ethics.

In a tale that’s being touted as a “love triangle gone wrong” a Brooklyn prosecutor, Tara Lenich, is under arrest for allegedly using the wiretap capabilities available as part of her work to spy on a love interest, who just happens to be a NYPD detective. The exact nature of the detective and Lenich’s relationship is still unknown, and Lenich had also forged documents to eavesdrop on an unnamed woman’s phone. As the New York Times [reports](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/28/nyregion/brooklyn-prosecutor-accused-of-using-illegal-wiretap-to-spy-on-love-interest.html):

The prosecutor, Tara Lenich, was taken into custody and fired after investigators in the district attorney’s office learned over Thanksgiving weekend that she had conducted the illicit surveillance because of “a personal entanglement between her and the detective,” according to the law enforcement official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the case. The authorities did not release the name of the detective, a man, or Ms. Lenich’s colleague, a female assistant district attorney.

Lenich faces 20 counts of possession of a forged instrument and two counts of eavesdropping.

The scheme went on for over a year, and required Lenich to allegedly fabricate a complex web to avoid the suspicion of co-workers:

Before her arrest, Ms. Lenich, 41, was a deputy bureau chief of the district attorney’s office’s Violent Criminal Enterprises Bureau, which specializes in using tactics like wiretaps to combat criminal gangs and drug organizations. Most wiretaps are valid for 30 days before they need to be renewed by a judge. But the law enforcement official said that Ms. Lenich repeatedly forged judges’ signatures to keep the eavesdropping scheme running for about a year. She also tried to avoid suspicion by telling fellow prosecutors that she had undertaken a secret investigation on behalf of the Police Department’s Internal Affairs Bureau and was the only person who could have access to the wiretap, the official said.

Lenich has since posted bail. A spokesperson for the DA’s office said they’ve “ordered a comprehensive review of our protocols and procedures to make sure that this abuse of authority never happens again.” One would certainly hope so.

According to data collected by ALM for their [Global 100 ranking](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/09/biglaw-keeps-getting-bigger-the-global-100-2019/), how many firms have cracked the $1 billion in gross revenue mark? Bonus points if you know which firms are in the billion-dollar club.

Hint: Last year, 34 firms cracked $1 billion in revenue; this year, even more firms have hit that milestone.

Sure does suck to work at a Biglaw firm that doesn’t announce market competitive bonuses. You know who won’t have to deal with that though? The associates at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati. Not surprising, considering that they came in 33rd place on the most recent Am Law 100 ranking and grossed over $1.3B in profits in 2021. Here is that sweet, sweet scale.



 

 

 

 

 

We love to see it! Word to the wise: set aside some of that bonus money to buy a nice box of chocolates for someone special. Few things pay dividends like showing a little love.

(Turn to the next page to see the Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati memo.)

We like hearing about salary increases almost as much as you enjoy spending them. As soon as your firm’s memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Salary & Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# The Rise Of The Suburban Law Firm?

Global megafirms and high-powered boutiques get most of the attention around here because they dominate the legal landscape with eye-popping profits and newsworthy representations. But in the wake of COVID, there’s a palpable shift in the market. Lawyers, especially younger lawyers, saw firm productivity go through the roof while everyone worked remotely and they’re wondering why they should ever return to the commuting rat race. For their part, most firms are adopting hybrid work models to give attorneys the opportunity to maintain the flexibility enjoyed during COVID without sacrificing the training and business development benefits of an office.

Not everyone is happy with these overtures.

Which is why [this article out of Long Island](https://www.newsday.com/business/law-firm-mergers-long-island-remote-work-o83uj688) raises an interesting possibility: will COVID spark a renaissance for suburban law firms?

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Long Island, however, has been attracting increased interest as remote-work patterns emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We’ve seen a couple of firms open Long Island offices because of that,” [law firm consultant Lisa] Smith said. “Firms are more willing to open an office where [lawyers] live.”

Back in January we covered [Greenberg Traurig’s decision](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/elite-biglaw-firm-opens-suburban-offices-as-part-of-new-work-near-home-strategy/) to open a couple of offices in Long Island as part of a work-near-home strategy. Newsday notes that Syracuse-based Bond, Schoeneck & King added 23 lawyers and offices in Melville and West Palm Beach through a merger. As firms look to hybrid models, it supercharges the incentive to find an office that’s not a two-hour commute away.

But this cuts the other way too:

“As soon as the pandemic hit, there was no need for suburban lawyers to go into the city,” Rosella said. Some of the law firms only required their attorneys to come to the office twice a week, an attractive proposition for Long Islanders.

“The city firms were now taking lawyers from the suburbs,” he said. “Those firms were seeking our lawyers.”

Which is driving these suburban firms to expand their office locations to keep hubs near where the lawyers are to fend off Biglaw poaching. It’s an effort bolstered by the rising price of legal counsel, something that could force clients to expand their roster of lawyers and grow more comfortable sending work to more reasonably priced alternatives.

No one’s going to drive Biglaw out of business. Well, [other than Dewey](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/we-finally-really-may-be-nearing-the-end-of-the-dewey-leboeuf-case/). But we might be on the cusp of a real suburban renaissance where smaller and mid-sized firms have the opportunity to stretch their legs into new locations and take advantage of some less-than-gruntled Biglaw lawyers eyeing a shorter commute.

[Jessica Mager](https://www.taftlaw.com/people/jessica-a-mager), a partner at Taft Law, was[ in some hot water](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/biglaw-partner-finds-sleeping-with-a-client-not-really-a-career-boon/) for engaging in a sexual relationship with a client. In October of 2019, Mager, whose practice focuses on family law, represented a client in his divorce proceeding when the Ohio Office of Disciplinary Counsel said she engaged in a sexual relationship with the client in violation of the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct, “specifically Prof.Cond.R. 1.8(j) [prohibiting a lawyer from soliciting or engaging in sexual activity with a client unless a consensual relationship existed between them when the client-lawyer relationship commenced].”

Two days after that sexual encounter, the client got into a verbal and physical altercation with his wife. The client was later found dead by suicide.

Last month, the Ohio Supreme Court’s Board of Professional Conduct  [recommended](https://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/pdf_viewer/pdf_viewer.aspx?pdf=919256.pdf) a stayed six-month suspension, with the condition Mager refrain from further misconduct. Mager has agreed to this discipline. As [reported by](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/stayed-suspension-recommended-for-taft-stettinius-partner) ABA Journal:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Mager stipulated to violation of a conduct rule that bars sexual activity with a client unless a consensual relationship existed when the client-lawyer relationship began.

The board noted that Mager had no prior discipline, the misconduct involved a single client, and she displayed a cooperative attitude in the proceedings. Several judges, lawyers and former clients also submitted letters attesting to her good character.

Mager previously said that in her two-decade career she “earned a reputation for integrity. However, two years ago, during a difficult time in my life, I made a serious error in judgment. I have no one to blame but myself, and I accept full responsibility for my actions.”

Mager’s attorney, Jonathan Coughlan of the Coughlan Law Firm, noted this is not a final determination. “There has been no decision,” Coughlan said. “This is simply a joint recommendation to the Supreme Court of Ohio, which makes the decision. In fact, the joint recommendation happened some time ago.”

Looks like the [Biglaw merger](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/law-firm-merger-mania-eversheds-and-sutherland-are-talking/) between London-based Eversheds and Atlanta-based Sutherland Asbill & Brennan [last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/whirlwind-romance-leads-to-global-biglaw-merger/) has really paid off. The combined entity — known now as Eversheds Sutherland —  just reported their earning for the first year post merger, and it looks good. The firm entered the rarified air of the billion (yup, with a B) dollar club, posting $1.05 billion in revenue for 2017.

That’s a five percent growth over the year before. As a result of the merger, Eversheds Sutherland boasts 2,400 lawyers in 66 offices across 32 countries. And as Law.com[ reports](https://www.law.com/sites/americanlawyer/2018/02/01/eversheds-sutherland-joins-1-billion-club-with-post-merger-revenue/), the firm is looking forward to a bright future:

“We are very fortunate to have clients who entrusted us with some of their most important and significant matters in 2017,” said U.S. co-chief executive Mark Wasserman. “Our growth in the last 12 months is a direct result of the strong collaborative culture that brought us together. Looking ahead, I am confident that our unrelenting focus and commitment to our clients and our people will drive our continued success.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The firm also touted its client focus as a driver of success:

London-based co-chief executive Lee Ranson said: “By any measure, we have had an excellent first year as Eversheds Sutherland. Clients were the primary driver for bringing our legacy firms together, and the success we have had in winning new clients and growing our business with existing clients has exceeded all our expectations and promises well for the future.”

Keys to Eversheds Sutherland’s banner year include being named Turkish Airline’s sole outside counsel, representing DB Engineering and Consulting with regarding to construction of a high-speed railway in California, and acquiring Hannes Snellman’s Russian practice.

# Why Lawyers Need To Have Business Plans, No Matter What
## Start early: A persuasive business plan can make or break your next career move.

Many lawyers do not think about crafting a business plan until they make partner at a firm. Starting this process sooner, even as a mid-level associate, will at worst be a superfluous intellectual exercise. Having a well-thought-out business plan can mean the difference between landing your dream position and missing the chance to lateral at all. It can also mean the difference between success and lost opportunities at any stage in your career. Here’s why.

A Good Business Plan Takes Time

Designing a solid business plan is not just about putting your ideas on paper. A business plan is a process, it’s an ever-evolving organism, not just an end product. It’s about stretching your brain to the max, being creative, thinking outside the box, connecting dots, and engaging in analytic reasoning. It takes time to get it right. You’ll want to seek feedback from multiple trusted advisors and put the plan aside at some stage so you can return to it with fresh eyes. For this reason, I believe it is never too early to start working on your business plan, even if it’s for your eyes only. You want to start the process well before you start thinking about making a move.

Your Business Plan Can Highlight a Key Skill or Specialty

A business plan is not just a summary of your résumé and deal sheet. It goes above and beyond a list of your legal skills and your contacts. Through a business plan, you have the opportunity to convince a prospective employer that you will add value to the new firm as a business generator and not just as a legal practitioner. You should explain how your particular specialties will lead to business the firm is not currently able to secure. The more specific, the better.

I recently worked with a counsel-level litigator who was asked by a top firm where he was interviewing to give a presentation to a group of partners on a niche specialty that he proposed to develop at the new firm. The litigator’s niche specialty only came to light through his in-depth business plan.

A Business Plan Is Also a State of Mind

A business plan must have substance. A horribly crafted business plan is worse than none at all. But your only excuse for a bad business plan is not starting the process early enough.

Substance is important, but a business plan is not solely about the substance. The fact that you have a business plan at all shows a firm you are serious about the process of lateraling and that you understand that to be a value to the firm, your business development skills are as important as your legal skills. It is hard enough to lateral as a senior associate without business. Having a business plan helps overcome presumption that you don’t have what it takes to bring in business.

A business plan also puts you in the right mindset to interview well and hit the ground running in a new position. The exercise of compiling and refining a business plan is a fantastic preparation for interviews. You have your recent work, contacts, and historical metrics right at your fingertips.

A Business Plan Is Necessary to Succeed, Not Just to Switch Jobs

Isn’t a business plan a waste of time if you’re not looking to lateral? Absolutely not. As I argue also regarding [deal sheets](http://abovethelaw.com/2015/02/10-tips-for-compiling-a-deal-sheet/), a business plan is a great way to take stock of your experience and your connections, and to visualize where you have holes in your skills and your network and where you can best build.

Even if you could lateral without a business plan, you’re going to need one eventually to succeed as a counsel or partner. Give yourself the best chance at success by having a roadmap before you make the move so you can hit the ground running. And don’t be afraid to revisit the business plan frequently throughout your career. Remember, it’s not a static document. It’s an adaptable roadmap.

Even if you go in-house, the exercise of crafting a business plan can prove to be useful. In-house, you are not subject to hourly billing requirements. Success is more results-driven. You’ll need to learn to work closely with your business counterparts and understand their mindsets, pressures, and perspectives. Highlighting your strengths and contemplating potential business strategies for your own “brand” can help you rise to the next level.

***

You should seek feedback on your advanced draft business plan from as many trusted sources as you can — in and outside of your specific field. If you work with a recruiter, that recruiter can help. A good recruiter can provide you with sample business plans to get you started. I usually share with my candidates a one-page template, as well as some longer examples. I review my candidates’ drafts and give them suggestions as to tone, style, and substance. We often go through multiple drafts of the document before sending it to any prospective employers. Where I do not have the necessary level of expertise in a particular legal field to give detailed substantive suggestions, I may call upon one of my colleagues to help out; this is one benefit of working with a recruiting firm composed of multiple recruiters who are former practicing attorneys in a range of fields. I cannot stress this enough: Start early. A persuasive business plan can make or break your next career move.

Please reach out to me at agordon@laterallink.com to learn more about the best lateral opportunities for your specific skills and experience, and to give me the green light to start nagging you for your business plan draft.

# Interns Can Be Very Helpful To Judges And Court Officers
## These internships can be much more than just standing around and doing menial tasks.

Law students often complete internships in a variety of capacities both during the academic year and during summer breaks. Some law students intern for government agencies so that they can get a solid sense of whether they would like to enter the government upon graduation. Other law students intern for their professors so that they can assist with legal scholarship. Many law students also intern for state and federal judges, either during the school year or during summers. Not only can internships be a good experience for law students, but interns may also complete valuable tasks for judges that can help clear the voluminous workloads of busy courts.

One of the most concrete ways that interns can improve the judiciary is through the work they complete for judges. Although federal courts have established clerkships for recent law school graduates, many states do not have clerkships at the trial court level. Additionally, in many states, courts may not have too many assigned staff to assist the courts in completing tasks. Since judges can only devote so much time to matters, the lack of staff can make it very difficult to complete judicial tasks in a timely fashion.

However, interns can help with this workload. When I was an intern for a judge in law school, I was routinely tasked with conducting research projects for my judge. This ensured that the judge stayed apprised of the issues impacting the trials which my judge oversaw and enabled him to focus on the judicial tasks that he could not assign to someone else to complete. Some of the other interns with whom I worked compiled factual information about cases that was helpful for the judge to reference when he was overseeing a particularly complex trial.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In a state in which I practice, there is a long history of interns helping to write draft opinions for judges. Several of my friends who interned for judges in this state told me that they were closely involved with decision drafting, and they felt like they had power and a voice in the judicial process in a way that they did not have by merely attending law school. It is not uncommon in this jurisdiction for courts to mention the intern who assisted in drafting the decision in a footnote, which is a really great way for a judge to help an intern build a record that can be useful to job hunting later on. One of my friends was really proud that he was able to search his name on legal research platforms and the footnote in which his judge thanked him popped up right away.

Many judicial internships simply involve the intern observing a judge or other court officers perform judicial functions without too much substantive assistance from the intern. For instance, I spent much of my judicial internship sitting on the bench with the judge, and if the judge wanted me to get something, or wanted me to pass a note to someone in the courtroom or in chambers, I was available to do that. However, even by just observing judicial functions, interns can have a positive impact on judges and court officers.

Not too long ago, I argued a motion in court, and when the judge took the bench, several interns also entered the courtroom and sat in the jury box. The interns observed the proceedings while the judge asked questions and my adversary and I provided answers. I noticed that the judge was really pleasant and had definitely read all of the papers that had been submitted in connection with the motion we were arguing. It was very unusual in this jurisdiction for judges to be so well apprised of the issues involved with a motion before oral argument, and I was surprised with the judge’s level of preparation.

Now maybe this judge was simply a great jurist to appear in front of who always read motion papers before oral argument. However, I couldn’t help but wonder if the judge wanted to be extra prepared for the oral arguments since several judicial interns were in attendance. The judge was able to use his preparation to distill the issues really well, which must have been useful for the interns who were following along. Moreover, the judge eventually thanked an intern in the footnotes of the decision, so perhaps the judge needed to be extra prepared so that oral arguments and drafting the decision were educational events for the interns.

Of course, I’m not going to get into the propriety of having unpaid interns complete judicial tasks (which I’m fine with since they get valuable experience in return and often do a great job), and I’d love to hear from judges about their own experiences with interns. However, from my perspective, judicial internships are not only helpful for the interns, but internships can also have a positive impact on judges and court officers.

[](https://abovethelaw.com/law2020/big-data-and-the-litigation-analytics-revolution/)Today, Above the Law and Thomson Reuters present [Big Data and the Litigation Analytics Revolution](http://bit.ly/2EsZqbD), the fourth and final installment of our [Law2020 ](https://abovethelaw.com/law2020/)series, a multimedia exploration of how artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge technologies are reshaping the practice and profession of law.

Previous Law2020 articles have explored the implications of AI for [legal education](https://abovethelaw.com/law2020/big-data-and-the-litigation-analytics-revolution/), [legal ethics](https://abovethelaw.com/law2020/the-ethical-implications-of-artificial-intelligence/), and [legal research](http://bit.ly/2L2cALF). Today, we take a deep dive into how sophisticated litigators are leveraging Big Data and analytics to decide critical questions of case strategy and tactics. Additionally, we explore litigation analytics is empowering lawyers to excel on many other fronts, including managing client expectations, accelerating client service, refining law firm operations, and optimizing legal research.

# 5 To Thrive: How To Stand Out As Outside Counsel
## A few ways you can really impress in-house counsel.

It probably comes as no surprise that this is a question I get a lot as in-house counsel — or at least some version of it. So by popular demand and in no particular order, here are some ways outside counsel can stand out.

- Be Responsive
Whether right or wrong, there is an expectation that outside counsel is super-responsive. This doesn’t necessarily mean that I need an answer right away (especially if I contact you outside of normal business hours because I’m catching up on work while the kids are asleep), but it helps to know that my email was received and when I can expect a response. I typically expect some kind of response — even if it’s an “I got your email and am working on it” — within 24 hours. Before you think this is unreasonable, this is the same rule I apply when responding to my own internal clients. While I personally haven’t done this, I have seen in-house counsel call outside counsel, and when there is no pick-up, they call the very next person on their list. Of course, if you are out of the office, I highly recommend having an “out of office” automated message that gives me an idea of whom to call for backup or when you’ll be back.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
- Advise In Plain English
Unless I ask for it, I don’t want a lengthy legal memo composed of legalese that I subsequently have to read, digest, unpack, and interpret into plain English for my business clients. Ain’t nobody got time for that! The lawyers that stand out for me in this space are the ones that give me sound advice and a recommendation — with options and related pros and cons — in plain English that I could copy and paste to send to my business folks. Bonus points if the advice is in a table or graphic form that is easy to digest at a glance. If the legalese is unavoidable, I still appreciate a separate blurb I can copy and paste to send to my internal clients.

- Be Proactive
As legal alerts or new cases come up that may affect my company, send it to me, and share why you’ve sent it to me, in plain English (again, even better if I can copy and paste and forward to my internal clients). This shows how you are invested in my success and are a true partner to my company by helping me anticipate issues. And if you’re not doing it, your competitors are.

- Anticipate And Communicate Deadlines
This may be subjective and vary by your in-house counsel clients, but I am one who wants the litigation deadlines shared with me via calendar invites so we can share responsibility in anticipating case needs. What I don’t want is to be frantically contacted while I’m on vacation because you need my help in obtaining a declaration from a witness (who also happens to be on vacation) for a summary judgment. Also — if I take the time to send you dates when I will be out of town or unavailable, please do not schedule depositions or witness preps for those dates without checking with me first.

- Treat Me As If You Value Our Relationship
This may seem like a no-brainer, but you’d be surprised at how some outside counsel only treat the decision-makers (like my GC or AGC) with deference and respect because their relationship is longstanding and strong. This approach is really short-sighted, especially as organizations change, and as in-house counsel move companies. The lawyers that really stand out in this space are the ones that take the time to educate and mentor me or get to know me on a personal level and try to connect me with helpful people in their network. There’s something compelling about feeling like my outside counsel is “seeing” me as an individual and not just a billable matter.

[](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9S65CVOMBSxMz5j)The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted virtually every facet of life, entirely reshaping the world around us. The legal profession has been hit particularly hard, with entire firms leaving their offices to work from home just to remain healthy. Law firms across the globe have made major changes just to survive, and transaction management is facing unprecedented challenges. Given the forced course correction the law has had to take, Above the Law and Litera have partnered to get a better sense of how firms are responding to the coronavirus crisus and what tools legal professionals are using to help them reprioritize and reconfigure their workflows and client relationships.

That said, we are conducting a [survey](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9S65CVOMBSxMz5j) that is looking for insights into topics such as:

- Preparedness to handle changes;
- Concerns regarding the deal management process;
- Evolution of client requests; and
- Impact on deal completion.
Please click the button below to help us gain insights into how your firms have been dealing with workflow during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Coming soon: The 2017 ATL Power 100 Law Firm Rankings ([2016 version here](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/2016-office-100-law-firm-rankings/)). Among other data, our law firm rankings draw on the 20,000+ responses to the [ATL Insider Survey](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_7U5tOUuQwTAfSxS). The Survey asks lawyers a sort of “time-machine” hypothetical: “If you had the chance to do it all over again, would you choose to work for your firm?”

So, what percentage of law firm attorneys are happy with their choice of employer?

83.6% of law firm lawyers told us yes, they would choose their firm all over again. For all the griping we hear (and publish) about Biglaw, this is a strikingly positive finding. Consider that [one survey](http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/personal/02/09/global.marriage.readers.digest/) found that only 63% of Americans would marry the same person all over again.

# Will Biglaw Associate Salaries Shrink If They Want To Work Fully Remote?

I could see things going there. But the market has just been so high in the last six to 18 months, that most candidates are asking for the moon. They may not get it, but they’re asking for an awful lot. But if we go into recession, I think it’ll level the playing field a little bit more, and employers will have a little bit more leverage than they do right now.

— Robert Graff, partner on Major, Lindsey & Africa’s in-house counsel recruiting team and co-managing partner of the firm’s Atlanta office, commenting on the [possibility of associate salaries dropping](https://www.law.com/2022/05/27/some-law-firms-are-paying-fully-remote-attorneys-the-same-as-others-will-that-change/) based on whether they’re working in an office or in a fully remote environment.
