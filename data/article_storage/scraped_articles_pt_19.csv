Mental health issues in Biglaw are once again a hot topic of conversation. Perhaps it isn’t surprising, we know substance abuse and other mental health issue impact the legal profession more than most. [A study by ALM reveals some disturbing statistics:](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/02/has-the-legal-profession-had-a-negative-effect-on-your-mental-health/amp/)

74 percent said the legal profession has had a negative effect on their mental health over time;
56 percent of respondents said mental health problems and substance abuse are worse in the legal industry than in other industries;
41 percent of respondents said mental health problems and substance abuse are at a crisis level in the legal industry;
17.9 percent of respondents said they have contemplated suicide during their professional legal career;
31.2 percent of respondents said they are depressed;
64 percent of respondents said they have anxiety;
10.1 percent of respondents said they have an alcohol problem; and
2.8 percent of respondents said they have a drug problem.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
But to really grapple with the problem, the profession needs to see the issue as more than impersonal numbers. They need real stories of what it is like. That’s part of the reason the death by suicide of Sidley Austin partner Gabe MacConaill has been so poignant in the industry. His body was found with a[ self-inflicted gunshot wound](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/10/biglaw-partners-death-due-to-self-inflicted-gunshot-wound/) in the firm’s parking garage, but it was after his death that his story’s impact was spread. His widow, Joanna Litt, [wrote a provocative op-ed](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/biglaw-widow-blames-firm-for-husbands-suicide/?rf=1) titled “Big Law Killed My Husband,” detailing the stress and “maladaptive perfectionism” MacConaill dealt with and it has struck a nerve among lawyers everywhere.

Now another former Sidley partner is opening up about his struggles with mental illness. Kent Halkett [wrote a piece](https://www.tba.org/?pg=TennesseeBarJournal&pubAction=viewIssue&pubIssueID=7986&pubIssueItemID=9752) for the Tennessee Bar Association urging the profession to take mental health seriously, particularly in the wake of COVID-19:

The law is an inherently stressful way to earn a living. The profession is now a business. Poor mental health is a medical condition. It is perpetuated in the law through a combination of shame, stress, status and stigma. Attorneys — who are excellent problem solvers by nature, education and training — have not solved the mental health problem in their ranks. Why?

The good news: attorneys with mental health challenges can thrive in the profession.

The legal profession needs to refocus its attention and resources on this crisis. Colleagues are suffering on a daily basis. The COVID-19 virus pandemic has disrupted the practice of law and increased stress levels. The time is now.

And he draws some direct parallels between MacConaill’s tragic story and his own experience at the same firm:

Similarly, in 1995, I was a young litigation partner at Sidley Austin under severe pressure from being tasked by the firm’s management with taking control of the “case from hell” and fixing it. I readily tackled the assignment. I worked around the clock, nose to the grindstone, until the immediate threat had been successfully resolved. However, internally, something was terribly “wrong” with me. A couple of months later, I first saw a psychiatrist for my ongoing mental anguish and was diagnosed as suffering from “clinical depression.”

The diagnosis was a relief and a nightmare. There was a medical reason for my misery, but I was absolutely convinced that my career at Sidley Austin and in “Big Law” was over.

Halkett says that he never discussed his mental health struggles with anyone at the firm, and the combination of the workload and his mood disorder took its toll. As a result, he says his time at the firm was cut short, “prematurely”:

I was most afraid that I would be labeled “damaged goods” if my condition was known by the firm’s management. My worst fears were confirmed. I took six weeks of paid leave from the firm. When I resumed my practice, I went right back to having my nose to the grindstone, despite my painful experience, ongoing recovery and better instincts. I did high-quality legal work and consistently obtained good results for the firm and its clients. My colleagues did not know about my mood disorder, and they did not detect anything “wrong” with my legal abilities. Nonetheless, my career at Sidley Austin hit a plateau that I could not move beyond. The firm no longer directed choice cases and assignments to me. It curtailed my administrative contributions. My compensation was stagnant. It was clear that my time in “Big Law” was prematurely over. I resigned, and joined a small firm that provided an opportunity to continue to practice high-quality legal work, and offered the possibility of a brighter future in the legal profession.

Years later, Halkett again re-entered the world of larger law firms. But his experience shows how pervasive the issues are, and not limited to a particular firm:

After a few years, I moved again laterally as a litigation partner in an old-line, well-respected California firm with more than 100 attorneys and multiple offices. I thought that my struggle with depression was behind me forever. However, after successfully resurrecting my career and practicing without any further mental health incidents for more than 15 years, my depression resurfaced with much more severity. Again, I quickly became “damaged goods” for my new firm. I left and tried to reinvent myself at another firm, but I was fighting a losing battle. I attempted suicide less than six months later.

Halkett says the combination of stress, status (the drive for it), and stigma create a roiling cauldron that exacerbates mental health issues in Biglaw. He urges the industry to “create a culture where all attorneys ‘feel safe’ to reach out to their family, friends or professional colleagues another attorney or, as appropriate, their firm or local bar association.” That’s something we can all get behind.

# Biglaw Firm Announces Raises For Midlevel And Senior Associates, Junior Associates Left Out In The Cold
## Looks like the firm has had a change of heart.

Less than a month ago, Reed Smith’s global head of personnel, Casey Ryan, [announced ](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/another-firm-announces-it-will-only-be-hiring-cheap-and-desperate-associates-this-fall/)the firm has “has no current plans to increase associate starting salaries in any location.” And while the firm hasn’t exactly backed off of that position, there are raises ahead for some associates.

When it comes to compensation, Reed Smith has [eschewed the Biglaw tradition](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/10/reed-smith-joins-the-attack-on-lockstep/) of a transparent lockstep model, [particularly at the more senior levels](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/biglaw-firm-finally-reveals-compensation-for-midlevel-and-senior-associates-and-they-are-pissed/). So when the firm held a firm-wide associates meeting last week announcing changes to its compensation structure, we knew there wouldn’t be a clear cut salary chart. But the firm did raise the upper limit on midlevel salaries by $25,000 and on senior associate salaries by $40,000, as detailed by the firm’s compensation graph:

But, as a tipster points out, no one actually knows who is making those top (market) salaries:

Well, they raised the upper limit on mid-level and senior associates’ salaries, but it’s extremely unclear who even makes those amounts, and they didn’t raise junior salaries at all. It’s still 180k for 1st years and 190k for 2nd years.

There was also good news as the firm announced increases to the non-discretionary bonus amounts based on billable hours (the firm also has discretionary associate bonuses):

Woohoo! It may have taken three weeks, but O’Melveny & Myers has finally decided to join their peers and raise associate salaries. They, like so many other firms, are also offering special summer bonuses. This news isn’t particularly surprising — after all, [the firm is the 38th Biglaw firm by profit per partner and 43rd most profitable firm in the country.](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/by-any-metric-these-firms-really-should-have-raised-associate-compensation-by-now/) With numbers like that, they pretty much had to move with the market.

As is their tradition, OMM announced the raises via voicemail, so there’s no memo to share with everyone. But, we can confirm the firm is paying full market salary and bonuses through the class of 2010 to all U.S. associates, as described below:

Base Compensation:

Class of 2017: $190,000
Class of 2016: $200,000
Class of 2015: $220,000
Class of 2014: $255,000
Class of 2013: $280,000
Class of 2012: $305,000
Class of 2011: $325,000
Class of 2010: $340,000

Special Bonuses:

Class of 2017: $5000
Class of 2016: $7500
Class of 2015: $10000
Class of 2014: $15000
Class of 2013: $20000
Class of 2012: $25000
Class of 2011: $25000
Class of 2010: $25000

The bonus will be paid on July 31, if the associate is on track for their billing target. But, the firm does offer the opportunity to make up the hours by the end of the year and receive the full special bonus.

# Trump Solicitor General Wants All The Jones Day Associates Back In The Office (Jokingly, But Also... Not Jokingly?)
## Those times when maybe there's a little too much truth behind the joke.

Noel J. Francisco (by Jones Day/YouTube)

Jones Day’s Washington office got an all hands New Year’s message welcoming them to 2023 with a few “resolutions” from office captain and former Trump administration solicitor general Noel Francisco.

The subject line was “New Year, New Us (Maybe).”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
But it’s Jones Day, so we can go ahead and answer that with “maybe not.”

A New Year can mean new diets, new gym memberships, and even a new Managing Partner. But not all new beginnings are created equal. Start your 2023 on the right foot with

-The Top 10 New Year’s Resolutions Noel Francisco Wishes Jones Day Lawyers Would Make-

1. Come to the office.
2. Wear a suit every day. Weekends included.
3. Come to the office. You can do this.
4. Enter time entries daily.
5. Improve attendance in the office, one day at a time.
6. Submit fewer coffee machine complaints. What makes you think they’ll work this year?
7. Ask yourself who’s here because you’re here, at least once before bed and once before crossing the office threshold.
8. For all that is good and holy, come to the office.
9. Fewer vests, more vested interest in the dress code.
10. Attend the TGs like they’re billable.

Please join us in 740 from 5:30 – 7:00 PM to knock out #10 and start the year off strong. We hope to see you there.

This is very clearly tongue-in-cheek and it’s cute.

But…

It’s also one of those gags that’s only funny to the extent it rings true to the audience. And whether Francisco personally is a hardliner on returning to the office or just stewing about it behind a forced air of laid back acceptance, he’s not alone.

There are a lot of senior lawyers who want everyone back in the office. Some want it so badly they’re willing to take on a reputation for [retroactively pulling the rug out from associates at bonus time](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/associates-hit-with-unannounced-bonus-reductions-for-not-being-in-the-office-enough/).

Firms still seem to conflate working from home because of the pandemic with working from home today. They are not the same. When the lockdown started lifting, attorneys wanted to work from home because they didn’t trust a return to office. They didn’t want contact of any kind.

The thrust of working from home in 2023 is flexibility. Attorneys spent the last couple years learning that they can perform many — some may say “most,” others may say “some,” but let’s go with “many” — tasks without going to the office. They’ve built their lives around this. They’ve adjusted living arrangements, and appointments, and child care, and countless other little things around the idea that they have some degree of flexibility over their schedules pending extraordinary work events.

For these people, it doesn’t matter if the firm says “come in three times a week” if those specific three days are set in stone. The firm mindset is that “three is less contact than five” but the associates are (by and large) not interested in contact anymore as much as being treated like professionals who can successfully leverage the firm’s remote work infrastructure for mutual advantage.

That’s the challenge over the next year. As much as 2020-2022 put firms in the position of building avenues for secure connectivity, the new obstacle is building hybrid models that satisfy the core demand for flexibility. It’s going to be about [hoteling concepts](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/managing-the-hybrid-office-of-the-future-with-a-couple-clicks/) and office redesigns and [innovative training models](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/firms-are-using-acting-to-get-their-associates-to-write-better-emails/). And if you want someone to come in when it’s not necessary, it’s time to figure out [a way to make it enjoyable](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/seward-kissel-designs-worlds-longest-miniature-golf-hole/).

Associates aren’t coming back to the office five days a week anymore, but they’re also not trying to permanently hang their nameplate over their bed. It’s time to prioritize what really requires face time and what doesn’t, and respect that lawyers can figure out the difference. It’s a fundamental revamp of the philosophy of a law firm, but it’s where we are.

That’s the sort of thing that would make for a good resolution.

The era of big data has irrevocably changed the IP landscape, particularly in the area of copyright. 

Copyright law is constantly evolving to take into account the ways technological advancements are altering and enhancing the creative process, and certain aspects of the law that once were thought settled continue to be upended.

PLI’s one-day program, [Fundamentals of Copyright Law in the Data Era 2022](https://www.pli.edu/programs/fundamentals-of-copyright-law-in-the-data-era?t=live&p=335888&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2), provides a comprehensive review of copyright basics, along with updates on current and cutting-edge developments. It will cover copyright law’s foundational elements, enforcement considerations, and recent major case law and regulatory developments, including those implicating NFTs and copyright.

Topics to be covered include:

- The basic principles of copyright law
- What’s involved in enforcing copyrights
- New case law developments in the area of copyright
- An introduction to intermediary liability and the DMCA
- The intersection of NFTs and copyright law
Whether you’re new to copyright practice or an experienced copyright lawyer, this program will provide the fundamentals and recent developments you need to know. [Register](https://www.pli.edu/programs/fundamentals-of-copyright-law-in-the-data-era?t=live&p=335888&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2) today.

# UnitedLex Luthor
## Meet the alternative legal service provider bent on taking over the world.

Dan Reed is the most compelling kind of supervillain; the one who believes that he’s actually the hero. To be fair, he very well might be.

Reed is the CEO of UnitedLex, an alternative legal services provider bent on disrupting the basic fabric of the global legal market. He’s got an origin story straight out of the comic books. Reed made all the money he’ll ever need early in his career after growing and selling out of two successful companies. With his financial future secure, Reed set about dreaming up a project focused on personal meaning. His solution to this was UnitedLex, a company he believes will break the chokehold of Biglaw and democratize the legal practice.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
[Reed’s got the ideas, the platform, and the financial backing](https://www.unitedlex.com/assets/news/The-American-Lawyer-Is-UnitedLex-the-Future-January-2019.pdf). UnitedLex is developing big-name clients like GE and DXC, and partnering with major firms like Latham & Watkins. Per their PR Department, they closed $1.5 billion in deals over a recent 18-month period. They have all the appearances of an industry giant in the making. So are they a force for good, or something else?

Beyond The Wall Of Biz-Speak

One could be forgiven if they read UnitedLex’s press releases for hours and still walked away with little idea of what the company actually does. According to its [mission statement](https://www.unitedlex.com/), UnitedLex “drives transformation” while “searching for the ‘art of the possible.’” [One press release](https://www.unitedlex.com/news/cvc-capital-partners-announces-majority-interest-investment) describes legal services as “one of the few remaining verticals that is early in the penetration curve of technology, consulting, and solution delivery.” But behind the wall of marketing and business clichés, there appears to be serious substance wedded to global ambition.

The basic structure of the company is threefold. First, it’s a consulting company focusing on helping in-house legal departments develop efficiencies and utilize technology. Second, it’s an engineering and technology company actively developing solutions to sell to those in-house departments. Finally, it’s a legal staffing solution. It supplies lawyers on an as-needed basis to clients ranging in experience and sophistication from highly experienced senior attorneys down to newly minted law grads working remotely out of coffee shops. Many of its attorneys are based outside the U.S. in India.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
On their own, none of these concepts is particularly groundbreaking. In some ways it’s just a more focused version of the efforts the [Big 4 accounting firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/king-kong-is-coming-to-crush-your-practice-with-a-calculator/) have been making to bring their consulting expertise into the legal space. But where the Big 4 have their hands in a lot of pots, UnitedLex is focused exclusively on the legal market.

It seems to be paying off. One of Europe’s biggest equity funds, CVC Capital Partners, announced a few months back that it was purchasing a majority share in UnitedLex, reportedly for $500 million. UnitedLex also claims to count 25 percent of the Fortune Global 500 companies among their clientele, and recently inked a massive deal with Ford Motor Company to transform their IP department from a cost center into a revenue generator.

So what part of successful entrepreneur developing a tool people want qualifies him as a potential supervillain? It’s the method behind the madness — or brilliance, depending on your vantage point.

It’s All About The Labor

The unfortunate reality of the legal market is that our costs of doing business are mostly labor-related. It doesn’t cost much to rent an office, buy a computer, and get to work. Where legal departments spend their money and time is on human expertise, and that’s generally expensive.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
What UnitedLex appears to be doing, better than potentially anyone, is cutting the cost of labor. For example, their “Contract Room” platform breaks major deals down into subcomponents and stages, then assigns the components out based on the expertise necessary. Whereas in a traditional law firm a single experienced attorney might oversee all aspects of a deal, at UnitedLex that experienced attorney handles the top-level negotiations, while a team of outsourced law school grads working for 1/10th the price may handle the more routine aspects of the transaction.

Clients have every reason to love this approach. It’s bottom-line and efficiency oriented, something everyone should strive to be. But do you see any human element in that interaction? This kind of model necessarily treats attorneys as cogs to be slotted in where appropriate and replaced as needed. If UnitedLex’s structure is closest to the Big 4 accounting firms, its actual practices are basically Lyft for attorneys.

This is very much by design. The democratization of the legal market Dan Reed is striving for means opening it up to the industry’s newbies and have-nots who didn’t make it into the traditional firms. UnitedLex has relationships with a number of law schools where it places simple work with newly minted grads. The grads develop practical experience and expertise they wouldn’t otherwise get, and everyone makes some money. Attorneys without experience, without clients, who otherwise would struggle to make ends meet, now have a chance to do legal work and get paid.

What Biglaw Gets Right

But does UnitedLex lift up those inexperienced attorneys and develop them, or is it simply creating a permanent servant class within the legal job market? Biglaw is rightly criticized for many, many things, but one inherent virtue of that system is that it benefits when it develops its talent pool. A firm can make a bit of money off a third-year associate billing for other attorneys. It makes a lot more when that third-year turns into a rainmaker themselves, developing their skill set and bringing in clients to match.

UnitedLex doesn’t have that same incentive. The client relationship lies with the company itself, not its staff attorneys, and it treats skill sets as ultimately fungible. A young attorney growing their skill set just means that attorney has to be staffed onto different matters, and the company needs to find someone else to handle the simpler tasks. Barring an altruistic motive to do the right thing, the company gains nothing from staff development except some administrative headache.

There’s also the problem that [nobody gets rich driving a rideshare](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/02/590168381/uber-lyft-drivers-earning-a-median-profit-of-3-37-per-hour-study-says). In fact, once less apparent costs like depreciation and repairs are accounted for, many drivers are making less than minimum wage. Some outright lose money. The biggest winners of the Lyft and Uber revolution are Uber and Lyft themselves, and the public that now has access to cheap, fungible, convenient ridesharing. The drivers who generate all that benefit get just a sliver of the pie. I worry about that same dynamic transferring over to the legal market. Everyone in the UnitedLex model seems poised to win big, except the lawyers actually making it all possible.

Whose Story Is It?

It’s easy for me to air these kinds of concerns because if UnitedLex is Lyft, law firms are the traditional cab industry that Uber and Lyft have attacked. UnitedLex is a competitive threat to me, and thousands of Biglaw attorneys across the world.

Yet I don’t think my reaction is entirely based on self-interest. I wouldn’t be where I am today without the mentorship and growth opportunities that the law firm model provided me. Done right, the law firm model becomes about more than making money. It’s about passing down knowledge, skills, and an ethic to a new generation, helping people bootstrap themselves into a successful career. I struggle to see UnitedLex or any of its many competitors doing the same. While it may make its clients or shareholders wealthier, it may make our profession poorer.

Dan Reed might be the supervillain of this story. Or Biglaw might just be the henchmen the hero needs to do battle with in service of the greater good. Either way, UnitedLex is spoiling for a fight, and set to do some damage.

# Biglaw Firm Offers Special COVID Bonuses To Associates On Top Of Other Special Bonuses
## Very exciting news!

The year is almost over, and with Biglaw firms looking forward to leaving 2020 in the rearview mirror, they’ve been dropping bonus announcements to remind associates that working hard through a pandemic that included austerity measures like salary cuts still allowed them to reap some rewards.

Last month, Stoel Rives — a firm that came in 132nd place in the most recent Am Law 200 rankings, with $236,541,000 in gross revenue in 2019 — announced not only that the firm would be retroactively restoring base compensation for attorneys, but that [bonuses were on the way](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/biglaw-firm-announces-full-retroactive-salary-restorations-for-all-plus-some-bonus-news/), and 2020 bonus pools, which are larger than they’ve been in any other year, would be left intact. (If you recall, in April, the firm decided to implement [discretionary-only bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/associates-at-this-biglaw-firm-are-taking-a-20-percent-pay-cut/) in lieu of hours-based bonuses.) Those bonuses were paid out last week, but now the firm has even more good news for its lawyers and staff: more bonuses! Here’s a note that was sent to everyone at Stoel Rives:

As the year-end approaches, we expect the Firm will finish the year strong, in large part due to the hard work and perseverance of our lawyers and support staff across our national platform. To show our appreciation, the Executive Committee has approved a special COVID supplemental bonus in addition to the performance bonuses that are already being paid to non-partner attorneys and staff. For associates, of counsel and staff attorneys this will result in an approximately 25% increase in their overall bonus. In addition, the Executive Committee has approved a special 2020 year-end bonus of $1000 for every non-partner attorney and each staff member at the Firm.

I usually limit my “3 Questions For…” written interviews to three questions. But when you have the opportunity to correspond with one of the country’s best lawyers in a leadership capacity at one of its most successful law firms, you gladly make exceptions. Welcome to the inaugural “3 More Questions For” column, whereby we continue our discussion with Boies Schiller’s Bill Isaacson, who generously agreed to discuss some of his headline-making past victories. You do not become famous and successful winning the easy cases, of course. The cases discussed by Bill below were anything but easy — but that is what makes them important for us to learn from. Whether it is taking the initiative to uncover a price-fixing scheme by Chinese vitamin makers to taking on the NCAA on behalf of student-athletes, Bill has consistently proven that a true trial lawyer must demonstrate diligence and curiosity in equal measure — and that winning a case is very much predicated on the preparation that took place pre-trial.

As with last week, I have added some brief commentary to the answers below, but have otherwise presented Bill’s answers as he provided them.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
1) One of your notable professional successes was succeeding in the first antitrust action against Chinese companies for price fixing, based on their manufacture and sale of vitamins into the U.S. You personally investigated and uncovered the price-fixing scheme at issue. Today, Chinese-U.S. relations are at the forefront of economic news, with a key issue being alleged Chinese theft of U.S. IP. Did you learn anything in the vitamin case that can help us think about how to relate to IP issues and China?

We learned from investigations into the formation of export cartels in China that following China’s accession to the WTO, companies in China were given a free hand to engage in all sorts of new commercial practices without the oversight of the government.  Ironically for a communist regime, it became the Wild West, to some extent. When I see the air pollution in China from the lack of environmental regulation, I connect it to the same type of changes. Theft of IP fits within that same framework, to my mind. 

GK: In case any of us ever forget the power we have as lawyers to effect positive change, it behooves us to recall Bill’s work in the price-fixing case against the vitamin makers. Rightly hailed as a landmark achievement, it reminds of the power of curiosity and initiative as precursors to using the legal process in order to right a wrong. And his observation that IP theft is a symptom of the Chinese government’s inability to contain the massive economic changes they have fostered is spot on. 

2) Another notable success of yours was your work on behalf of college athletes in the O’Bannon v. NCAA case. One of the key issues in that case involved the NCAA profiting off the images and likenesses of athletes in video games. In this age of video games and social media, it seems like celebrities and athletes should be more mindful than ever over how their likenesses can be used to generate commercial value for others. What do you think are the next steps for college athletes looking to get their fair share of the enormous revenues generated by their athletic exploits?

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The possibility of state legislation, such as is being considered in California, looms large for this issue.  But there is still the prospect for more private antitrust litigation. It is worth remembering that the antitrust case against the NCAA is not that universities must pay college athletes; it is that universities may not form a cartel or agree not to pay athletes, including for their names, images, and likenesses.  Can you imagine the reaction if technology companies all agreed among themselves to accept new programmers only through unpaid internships with scholarships to cover their living expenses? By providing educational internships and important training, the companies could claim to provide as much educational benefits as many colleges, but no one would tolerate such a system.

One next step forward challenging NCAA rules may come when a top college athlete files an action to protect his rights.  Two years ago, when Trae Young played basketball for his single season at Oklahoma, or last year, when Zion Williamson played his one year at Duke, their names and images were everywhere on ESPN and regional conference networks promoting NCAA games.  It is hard for me to believe that each of those individuals did not have a strong case to challenge the exploitation of their names, images, and likenesses. I also wonder if it could all change quickly if a college football team just agreed not to play their bowl game as a protest against the restrictions imposed on them. 

GK: The exploitation of college athletes in revenue-generating sports is a continuing injustice. While an incremental step, Bill’s victory against the NCAA has helped create the conditions for a future sea change in the way those athletes are treated. Protesting exploitation is a necessary first step towards getting it to stop. Fortunately for the athletes in the NCAA case, they had a lawyer of Bill’s caliber to make their case. 

3) Large copyright infringement verdicts are pretty rare, with your 2015 verdict for Oracle a high-profile example. What was your favorite part about trying a copyright case to a jury?

The case we tried for Oracle against Rimini Street was, to my mind, about theft of IP.   Our goal at trial was to break down the walls that we contended Rimini was using to hide what it was actually doing.  Achieving that required both intense technical work and precise cross examination of witnesses, both of which were gratifying.  The Ninth Circuit in the last month affirmed an important injunction against Rimini’s continued use of Oracle’s copyrighted software that was another important step in that litigation.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
GK: Here again, we see the value of curiosity and hard work as essential components of a trial victory. At the same time, winning at trial often involves weaving a moral narrative, particularly in IP cases, where themes such as rewarding the innovator or punishing the copycat are so often used before judges and juries. Telling that story persuasively is always easier for the trial lawyer when they share in the sense that their client’s cause is a just one. It is no surprise, therefore, that Bill was able to generate such a significant verdict for Oracle, believing as he did that Oracle’s IP was stolen.  

Thanks again to Bill for being so generous with his time and observations for this audience. It is always a privilege to hear from those at the very top of our profession, especially when they have such interesting perspectives to share on a broad range of topics. I am always open to conducting interviews of this type with other IP thought leaders, so feel free to reach out if you have a compelling perspective to offer. La Cheeserie to all!

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs.

# Lawyers Calling Themselves 'Doctor' Is Still Stupid: Trump Lawyer Edition
## Inferiority complex on parade!

We’ve [long taken the stance](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/11/any-lawyer-who-calls-himself-doctor-like-a-ph-d-should-get-punched-in-the-mouth/) that, despite the technicality that a “J.D.” has the word “doctor” in it, lawyers who adopt the honorific are, well, jackasses.

And, yes, we understand that earning a J.D. technically requires more coursework than earning a Ph.D. But we don’t have to functionally write a book to earn our degrees. Even if you want to say a J.D. from Harvard is roughly equivalent as a marker of academic prowess as a Ph.D. from Bumblybuck State — and it might be! — don’t be a self-important jerk about it. You’ve got a profession, it’s an important one, everyone knows it’s an important one, have some dignity and just quietly go about being a lawyer.

If that’s not enough for you, go ahead and use “Esquire.” But [even that is a little suspect](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/get-over-yourself-and-stop-calling-yourself-esquire/).

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
At the end of the day, lawyers who insist on stealing academic valor and going by “Dr.” only succeed in proving that they’re so insecure — likely justifiably — about their own achievement that they need to bolster it with phony accolades.

So it will not surprise you at all to learn that “[Elite Strike Team](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/rudy-giuliani-gonna-my-cousin-vinny-trump-into-a-second-term/)” member Jenna Ellis — who has spent the last week displaying the legal acumen of three cats wearing a trench coat and a wig — is the sort of person who uses “Doctor” in bios.



It’s possible that the Centennial Institute at Colorado Christian University is responsible for writing this, but Ellis certainly knows it exists and didn’t instantly shoot it down. She’s [appeared in videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsuSpwuujRs) under the “Dr.” label since at least 2017.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Weirdly, this isn’t even the first time I’ve seen this kind of inflation in Christian academia. Years ago, there was a guy from a religious school who made everyone call him “Doctor” and had a bio up calling himself a “Doctor” and a record for a Ph.D. he’d earned, but when someone called the school to ask about his dissertation… it came out that there was no degree. At most institutions, that’s the sort of thing that would get someone fired. In this case, they just updated the bio to call him “Professor.” Because consequences really don’t exist in these circles.

At least Ellis really is a “Juris Doctor.” But it doesn’t make it any less stupid.

# Biglaw Firms Are Just Like Big Businesses -- And They Need To Conduct Layoffs, Too
## And conducting outright layoffs is a better business practice than stealth layoffs.

Law firms are trying to operate more like businesses. As they move in that direction, there is a time and a place where they’ll have to adjust capacity. Generally, the industry has come to terms with the fact that firms will need to conduct layoffs and that shouldn’t be a sign of weakness or a threat to stability.

In fact, you could make that argument that is a sign of a well-run business and that could be attractive to some attorneys and partners.

— Kristin Stark, a legal consultant at Fairfax Associates, in comments given to [The Recorder](https://www.law.com/therecorder/2022/12/19/stealth-layoffs-bad-for-business-increase-risk-of-unwanted-departures/), concerning Biglaw firms’ need to trim headcount and conduct layoffs with transparency, rather than resorting to stealth layoffs.

# Bah, Humbug ...
## Everyone and anyone who has even a smidgen of interest in why experienced women leave Biglaw should read the report.

Do we need even one more report on the difficulties that women have staying in the profession? Do we need the ABA to tell us what anyone in the profession with even the teeniest brains knows just by looking around and seeing the attrition of women who boogie out of Biglaw practice? I didn’t think we needed one, but [I would be wrong](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/why-are-women-lawyers-leaving-biglaw-survey-looks-for-an-answer-and-finds-big-disparities). (Not the first time, and certainly not the last.)

Carolyn Elefant, in [a post two years ago](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/is-the-spate-of-discrimination-class-actions-against-biglaw-the-real-reason-behind-the-abas-initiative-on-women-at-biglaw/), wrote about the ABA Initiative to investigate why mid-career women lawyers are leaving Biglaw.

Here we are, two years later, and guess what? No, don’t guess. I’ll tell you. The ABA report has concluded that “men are from Mars, women are from Venus.” Did we need the ABA to tell us that?

And if you’re not familiar with the book, “Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus,” which was hugely popular in the 1990s (when many of our readers were barely in grammar school), the report nails what the problem is. Indeed, male lawyers are from Mars, and female lawyers are from Venus.

[John Gray’s book](https://www.amazon.com/Mars-Women-Venus-Communication-Relationships/dp/B003VW7DZE/ref=sr_1_5?crid=BNWUE3DZKN0G&keywords=men+are+from+mars+women+are+from+venus&qid=1577146859&s=books&sprefix=men+are%2Caps%2C243&sr=1-5) asserts that men and women have differing ways of communicating (no surprise there), and so they need to understand those different styles. Gray’s book also talks about the different emotional needs that men and women have.

[The ABA report](http://www.abajournal.com/files/WALKING_OUT_THE_DOOR_-_FINAL_AS_OF_NOV_14_2019_pm.pdf), entitled “Walking Out of the Door, The Facts, Figures and Future of Experienced Women Lawyers in Private Practice,” is really nothing new after all the reports we’ve read over the past decade. The report suggests recommendations that “if adopted” (notice the use of “if”) could lead eventually to gender parity in Biglaw. However, I don’t think anyone alive today will still be alive to see that transformation unless the cryogenics business really takes off soon.

The report shows a huge disconnect between how male lawyers view aspects of law firm practice and life differently from their female colleagues. Some of the factors where men and women report differing levels of satisfaction include compensation (and how that compensation is determined), opportunities for advancement, workplace gender diversity, and firm leadership.

A few of the disparities in what the report terms “everyday building blocks for success”:

How many times has a male lawyer been mistaken for a lower-level employee? According to the survey, never, but 82% (!) of women lawyers said that they have been so mistaken. (And don’t get me started on how women lawyers are expected to plan parties, pick up refreshments, and other housekeeping duties.)

How many men have experienced a lack of access for opportunities for business development? According to the report, a mere 10%, while 67% of the women lawyers haven’t had that access. (Gee, another surprise.)

How about some more? Disparities in how committed women are to their careers, the perception of a hostile work environment, denials in salary increases and/or bonuses, being overlooked for promotion opportunities, lack of sponsors, loss of a desirable assignment. The list goes on.

Men and women have significantly differing views on why women choose to stay or go. Three of the biggest reasons for why women walk out the door: work/life balance (and let’s stipulate that women have just about all of the responsibilities for both children and aging parents), advancement opportunities, and marketing/business origination. There are others, but those three give you a flavor of why women leave.

The report gives an example of a classic Mars v. Venus situation: a large percentage of firm leaders and male partners believe that their firms do a good job to advance experienced women, however, to no woman’s surprise, “experienced women do not share that view.”

Everyone and anyone who has even a smidgen of interest in why experienced women leave should read the report. Men may well be surprised, but women will not.

What should Biglaw firms do differently? I’m not going to provide a list of the report’s suggestions (and I do have a word count limit). You can guess what most, if not all, of them are. The bottom line is pretty simple. “Change the law firm structure and culture so that firms can better address the needs of the many women they recruit and seek to retain.” Well, that’s easy. Not. Setting up policies and procedures is comparatively easy. Implementing them is more difficult. Compliance with them is the hardest part, and who is willing to devote nonbillable hours (at least currently) to be the “enforcer?”

There has to be commitment and not just lip service if this profession is ever going to look like this country. Women make up more than 50 percent of the population, they compose 50 percent of incoming law school classes, and then mid-career, women lawyers turn their backs on Biglaw, saying, in essence, “phooey.” Think about all the training and knowledge that Biglaw has provided only to see experienced women lawyers walking out the door. Not a very good return on the Biglaw firm investment.

# Power Niche Marketing: Always Start With Peter Drucker

Peter Drucker (via YouTube)

In this column I have staked my marketing reputation on the theme and theory that marketing is (almost) all about creating, owning and building Power Niches. Last week, I [outlined what a Power Niche is](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/power-niche-marketing-what-is-a-power-niche/) – and that definition is found at the end of this article so everyone remembers it, without having to go back to my first article.

In order to move forward and establish the intellectual basis for Power Niches, I start with [Peter Drucker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker). Indeed, he is always a great place to start in the business world. He is one of my intellectual heroes. He was not only incredibly smart; he was also someone who took the time to figure things out and put workable and usable theories together. Drucker, if you don’t know, actually invented the science of “management.” He died a few years ago. If you want to be a real thinker in the business world – or the marketing world – I urge you to read his work.

Anyway, Drucker says that there are two things which every business must do to be successful. If the business doesn’t do those things, the odds of success are not good, and the converse. Can you figure out what they are? Don’t worry, I couldn’t either, but as soon as Drucker told me it was so obvious I was kicking myself. The two things are as follows:

To innovate

To market

Of course! If you don’t “innovate,” you have nothing to sell, and if you don’t “market,” then no one will realize why they should want your product in the first place. But if you put them together, then you have something powerful.

Consider Apple. What would Jobs have done without Wozniak? What would he have had to sell? And what would what Wozniak have done without Jobs? He would have tinkered around until someone stole his ideas or maybe he would just have gotten a job somewhere. If you put the two together; however, you have Apple, which is arguably the most successful company in world history.

So, although I would like to “just” talk about marketing in this column, it is hard to extricate marketing from innovating. If your law firm just does widget-like legal work that is indistinguishable from the legal work of other law firms, you have a serious problem. I will talk about how to solve problems like this in later columns; however, the first step in a successful marketing plan, and in building a Power Niche, has to be some level of innovation.

Let’s look at another very powerful, and indeed in my view the most powerful, thing Drucker ever said, which is when he identified a key and basic question; namely, what is the purpose of a business?

Don’t worry if you can’t get this one either. I couldn’t get it, and I suspect it took Drucker many years himself to figure it out. I was thinking it was probably to serve your customers, to serve your employees, to make the world a better place, to just make money; however, none of that is right. The purpose of a business, according to Drucker, is:

“To create a customer”

Wow! Makes you tingle a bit, doesn’t it? It is the use of the word “create.” He doesn’t say your purpose is to “get” customers or to “sell” to them or to “market” to them. It is to “create” them.

This goes back to the basic idea that you have to do some innovating if you want to market and sell effectively. Synthesizing Drucker, the ultimate plan as I see it is as follows:

“Innovate and market to create customers”

Steve Jobs said this beautifully when he said “don’t ask the customer what it wants; instead, show the customer what it should want.”

Or in another way, “it is not the customer’s job to know what they should want.”

The point here – as both Drucker and Jobs are saying to us – is to

“Innovate and market to create customers”

Please consider this for a few minutes and take a moment to think how it applies to your law practice. Are you just “practicing law,” or are you innovating and marketing to “create” customers?

I used to just be a plain old lawyer, and my career went absolutely nowhere. Now I spend every single day thinking about how to “create” customers – just like Steve Jobs said above – and my career is quite successful. And to be clear, I “really” do this. The purpose of these columns is to teach you exactly how I do it.

This is the first lesson. You have two weeks until my next column. Your homework is to read what I wrote (above). Reread it a couple of times. And think!!! How can you “innovate and market to ‘create’ customers”? You might just be flailing around now and maybe even have no clue what I am talking about. But if you read what the Power Niche is (below) and just turn on your brain, I assure you that your time will not be wasted.

Here is the definition of Power Niche again:

In brief, a Power Niche is a small-sized niche within a bigger industry that no one else yet dominates or owns. The niche isn’t obvious so you have to figure it out and “create” it. You step in and learn everything about it and everyone in it. You tell everyone about what you are doing – incessantly – and become the real “owner” of the niche merely by staking out your homestead in virgin territory. This then becomes a virtuous cycle as the more you know, the more you do, and the more you do, the more you know. Before long you are the world’s unquestioned expert in this (smaller) niche. All of this enhances your bargaining power within that niche. Instead of begging for business in the bigger industry, you now have eager clients paying you top dollar within this smaller Power Niche.

# Associate Bonus Watch: Firm Offers 'Maximum Bonus Amounts' That Match The Market
## The latest bonus match includes some curious language.

The last time we checked in on Covington & Burling’s compensation, it was trying to stem the tide of associate salary increases across the legal landscape. In this, [it spectacularly failed](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-firm-changes-course-on-associate-compensation/). So when it came to bonus season, would the firm follow the herd or try again to buck the trend?

Well, it appears that the firm is marching in lockstep with the rest of the Biglaw. A memo sent to associates last week laid out their bonus schedule. By now you know the scale, but as a reminder:

Class of 2016 — $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2015 — $15,000
Class of 2014 — $25,000
Class of 2013 — $50,000
Class of 2012 — $65,000
Class of 2011 — $80,000
Class of 2010 — $90,000
Class of 2009+ — $100,000

These bonuses apply to all U.S. associates, which is a [new policy](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/associate-bonus-watch-new-york-bonuses-go-to-washington/) after years of setting different scales in NY and D.C. The world (of Biglaw compensation) is flat these days.

The memo also refers to these as “maximum bonus amounts,” a phrase that Covington has used in the past, which is probably just a synonym for the usual “good standing” language that other firms include (in Covington’s case, presumably meeting the firm’s [“workload benchmark”](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/associate-bonus-watch-new-york-bonuses-go-to-washington/)). So associates are advised to keep their wits about them in case this is an effort to make a show of strength to those of us in the media and then slight associates when it comes to handing out the checks in January (when attention has died down). One hopes that Covington wouldn’t play this kind of game, but we’ve heard of other firms trying it, and this language certainly sets up that possibility, so it pays to remain vigilant.

UPDATE: Some associates are also concerned about the vague timing in the memo. The memo indicates that bonuses will be paid by end of January, which is a far cry from the olden days when the firm paid in December or even recent years when it paid in mid-January.

(Full memo available on the next page if you want to read this phrase in its full context…)

Compensation jumps and bonus announcements are exciting days here at Above the Law. Not because we thrive on celebrating greed, [we don’t](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/biglaw-salary-reports-arent-a-celebration-of-greed-its-kind-of-the-opposite/). As former Biglaw attorneys, why would we be excited to see what we’ve left on the table?

No, we’re excited because we know many of our busiest readers will make time to drop by and catch up on these milestone days. But coming up with new and exciting commentary for every compensation match announced in the following days. What more is there to say?

That’s why I’m trying to work these awful dad puns into the headlines. What firm are we talking about? Ropes and Gray! “Tying.” Get it?

# Top 10 Biglaw Firm Matches The Cravath Salary Scale For Associates
## The firm is also changing its bonus program to offer associates even more money.

One by one, top-performing Biglaw firms have either committed to matching the prevailing salary scale, or actually announced a match. Today, one of the top 10 firms in the country let its associates know that they’d soon be seeing Cravath cash in their bank accounts.

Hogan Lovells — a firm that brought in $2,308,401,000 gross revenue in 2020, ranking in at No. 9 in the most recent Am Law 100 — announced this morning that it would be matching the Cravath salary scale, retroactive to January 1. The majority of the firm’s US associates (across 12 of its offices) can expect to see their new compensation later this month, but three offices are being left out. As noted in the firm’s memo (available in full on the next page), “Base compensation will not be adjusted in Colorado Springs, Miami, and Minneapolis.” Of the three offices, Miami has the most associates of all, and we can’t imagine they’re pleased right now.

Here’s the new salary scale looks like at Hogan Lovells:

Class		Previous base salary		Adjusted base salary	
Class of 2021		$205,000		$215,000	
Class of 2020		$215,000		$225,000	
Class of 2019		$240,000		$250,000	
Class of 2018		$275,000		$295,000	
Class of 2017		$305,000		$345,000	
Class of 2016		$330,000		$370,000	
Class of 2015		$350,000		$400,000	
Class of 2014+		$365,000		$415,000	
In addition to increasing its salaries, the firm has also revamped its year-end bonus program. US associates will now have the opportunity to pump up their bonuses by putting in more billable hours (including diversity & inclusion hours as well as pro bono hours). Take a look:

Total billable hours	Additional % of Year-end bonus
2100­-2199	5%
2200-­2299	10%
2300­-2399	15%
2400+	20%
Congratulations to everyone at the firm on the raises — well, almost everyone.

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Hogan Lovells.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Milbank) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Milbank”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Thanks to the rise of new technologies like artificial intelligence, corporate clients are thinking about how to best reshape their business models to compete in our innovative new world. Which Biglaw firms have come out on top and are considered to be on the leading edge of these changes when it comes to advising their clients? Thanks to a new ranking, we’re about to find out.

The [BTI Consulting Group](https://bticonsulting.com/themadclientist/clients-single-out-the-law-firms-on-the-leading-edge-helping-clients-with-biggest-strategic-change) set out to find which firms are truly delivering when it comes to advising clients on how they should be future-proofing their businesses. These are the firms that are tops when it comes to the following tasks:

SERVE AS THE SOURCE OF NEW IDEAS:
Hungry for innovation and transformation in-house counsel seek law firms to help brainstorm their way ahead of the curve.

DEVELOP BRAND NEW STRATEGIES AND THINKING:
Clients want brand new thinking to help deliver new approaches to their business — and the legal issues they are likely to face.

BRING TECH SAVVY IN DELIVERING SERVICES:
Your tech-savvy delivery sends a high-value message about how your firm invests in improving its performance and capabilities.

USE AND UNDERSTAND KEY ASPECTS OF GENERATIVE AI:
Clients believe the firms adopting Generative AI are best suited to help them evaluate and anticipate the legal implications of their plans.

OFFER CREATIVE INTERPRETATIONS OF EXISTING RULES AND REGULATIONS:
Clients want the secret sauce to being able to get something done. They believe it lies in the new and creative interpretations — it offers up answers the naysayers don’t bring.

According to BTI Consulting Group’s report, 121 firms have been identified as the best equipped to meet client’s new leading-edge expectations. Here are the top 33 firms that are considered the best of the best at helping clients implement strategic change (in alphabetical order):

Alston & Bird
Arnold & Porter
Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney
Cooley
Davis Wright Tremaine
Dentons
DLA Piper
Fenwick & West
Goodwin
Greenberg Traurig
Gunderson Dettmer
Holland & Knight
Hunton Andrews Kurth

# The 60 Best Law Firms For Women (2018)

Year in and year out, we watch law firm after law firm pay lip service to their commitment to diversity in the legal profession, with promises to put women attorneys on equal footing with their male counterparts, whether it be through hiring and retaining more women attorneys, promoting more women attorneys to equity partnership ranks, providing more leadership positions to women attorneys, or adopting more family-friendly policies to ensure that women attorneys are able to excel at their jobs while maintaining a stable work/life balance. Despite these continued assurances, and despite the fact that a number of firms have made great efforts to improve women’s stature in the law, there is still more to be done.

Today, Working Mother released its annual list of the 60 Best Law Firms for Women (that’s 10 more law firms than last year’s list). These law firms are considered pioneers in the field when it comes to attracting, retaining, and promoting women lawyers. These law firms not only stand out as being family-friendly workplaces, but they also ensure that women shine in their equity partnership ranks.

With on-campus interview season coming up soon, these law firms are places you might want to work. Which firms made the cut for this year’s ranking?

To earn themselves a spot on the Working Mother Best Law Firms list, self-selected applicant firms with 50 or more lawyers must complete an extensive application (more than 300 questions long) with topics ranging from attorney representation, schedule flexibility, paid time off and parental leaves, and development and retention of women. Working Mother then selected the 60 best firms based on data provided by those firms from the year 2017. According to Meredith Bodgas, editor-in-chief of Working Mother, “The law firms that make Working Mother’s list are remarkable for their long-term commitment to retaining and promoting women lawyers. One hundred percent of these firms provide flexible work arrangements and 57 percent of them offer sponsorship programs for high-potential women lawyers. That’s resulted in a jump in the number of women equity partners to 21 percent.”

Here are some of the interesting results gleaned from Working Mother’s study:

• Several firms offer generous parental leave policies. One firm, for example, offers a gender-neutral parental-leave policy, giving all lawyers and professionals 26 weeks off with up to 18 weeks at full pay.

• Another firm created a formal sponsorship program that identifies junior women and ethnically diverse attorneys and pairs them with senior firm members; that same firm began offering to ship home breast milk for attorneys who travel for work.

• Backup care and in-home care for family members of all ages, from infant through elderly, is offered by a firm, where up to 80 hours may be used at an affordable rate.

• At one of the firms, a Balanced Hours employee-resource group provides guidance on mentoring and development of attorneys with reduced hours

Women have made great progress at Biglaw firms in recent years, but which firms have been most receptive to their advancement? On average, almost half of associates and more than a third of partners at thee firms are women, while one-fifth of equity partners are women. Here’s the list of the 60 Best Law Firms for Women in 2018:

For analysis of issues pertaining to women in the Biglaw workforce by the numbers — like percentage of equity partners who are women, percentage of new hires who are women, and whether firms offer formal sponsorship for high-potential women lawyers — click [here](https://www.workingmother.com/sites/workingmother.com/files/attachments/2018/07/wmm0918_023.pdf) to see the study’s aggregate data summary.

Congratulations are in order for all of the firms returning to the list this year, as well as the firms that are new to the 2018 list. Way to represent your women attorneys!

For what it’s worth, some firms that placed on the Yale Law Women’s list of the [Top 10 Most Family-Friendly Firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/the-top-10-most-female-friendly-law-firms-2018/) were nowhere to be found on this year’s list. Similarly, 21 firms that received Gold Standard certification from the Women in Law Empowerment Forum, an achievement measuring benchmarks in [women’s power, pay, and prestige](https://wilef.com/certification/), were left off of this year’s list entirely. Last, but certainly not least, a handful of firms from [Law360’s Glass Ceiling Report](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/the-glass-ceiling-report-a-bleak-picture-for-women-in-the-legal-profession/) — the firms with the with the highest ratio of female equity partners to male equity partners in the United States — were excluded from this year’s list. This is problematic for several reasons.

As hard as it is to find a Biglaw firm that will promote a respectful number of women to partnership, pay them handsomely, and offer family-friendly benefits — all at the same time — it’s apparently even harder to find a list that will measure all of those important characteristics at once. Women are presented with financial rankings, family-friendly rankings, and one ranking that purports to cover both of those areas but fails to capture all of the data available.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
We’ve made this suggestion a few times in the past, but it bears repeating: Please, please get together to compare notes with all of the women in law affinity groups that publish law firm rankings. Young women still in law school are using these lists for guidance when starting their Biglaw careers, and it can get very confusing. Please consider this before you roll out next year’s lists — because if you don’t come up with an optimal ranking system, someone else will.

Now we’ll turn this discussion over to our readers. If your firm didn’t make the cut, do you think it should have? If your firm did make the cut, was it deserved? What can be done to improve work/life balance for women and working mothers? If you’d like to let us know what you think, you can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com), text us at (646) 820-8477, or tweet us [@atlblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog). Congratulations to all of the law firms that made this important ranking!

At Harvard Law School, Ron DeSantis clearly snoozed through both torts and con law. Phooey on free speech, phooey on learning anything about retaliation, but the most important lesson since HLS is that you do not mess with the Mouse House. Anaheim, California, home of Disneyland, could probably give DeSantis some pointers.

He is just another example of how a Harvard law degree doesn’t translate to competent thinking in the real world, at least [not in Florida](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/disney-desantis-lawsuit-filed/). Watching DeSantis get thumped with the Mouse Ears will be [fun to see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNxdohDAWhY).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Not to be outdone in this ongoing battle of “tag, you’re it,” the board of the special district created years ago for Disney World, a board now full of the governor’s friends, has filed suit [in Florida state court](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/01/politics/reedy-creek-board-sues-disney/index.html) (a more hospitable venue for the board?) against Disney, alleging various theories.

Discovery in both cases should be fun. I wonder how many cringe-worthy emails, texts, and other writings the board will have to produce. Shades of Dominion v. Fox? My advice: never bet against the Mouse House.

If DeSantis likes the idea of putting a prison on what he considers to no longer be Disney’s land, let me suggest that San Quentin prison up in Marin County is in the process of [emptying out its death row](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/california-to-close-san-quentins-death-row-as-part-of-a-broader-prison-reform). Perhaps Gov. Gavin Newsom can expedite relocation of the closed death row section to Florida for use there. Logistics is an issue, but I trust the two besties could work it out.

All lawyers of whatever vintage think about failure. (Am I predicting a DeSantis drubbing by Disney? Cue the alliteration.) It’s only natural that in our adversarial profession there are winners and losers. And that’s why so many lawyers become mediators (I plead guilty) because we think there’s a better way to resolve disputes than going into court to duke it out [Punch and Judy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_and_Judy) style.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
I am always amused by prospective clients (e.g., lawyers) who want to know my “settlement rate.” Does that mean that if the case doesn’t settle at mediation, that’s a mark against using me? What if the parties want time to think about the last offer made? What if they want to consider a mediator’s proposal? What if they need to speak with family to pencil out whether the offer makes sense? What if there needs to be additional conversations with decision makers as to whether to accept or reject? Does the mere fact that there’s no settlement agreement signed at the close of the mediation session mean that mediation failed? The parties failed? The lawyers failed? The mediator failed? What if the case eventually settles, soon after mediation, after more discovery, or even after a jury is selected like Dominion v. Fox? A failure? If I hear lawyers tell me one more time to “work your magic,” I will barf. It won’t be pretty. Mediation should be a collaborative process.

Lawyering is not like sports; there you know who wins and who loses at the end of the game. So, what, indeed, is failure? Who gets to define it? Does it always look the same?

Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Milwaukee Bucks star player, was spot on in replying to a question asked by a reporter if he considered the season a “failure.” (For the non-NBA fans, the Bucks lost to the Miami Heat and were eliminated in the post-season). Antetokounmpo’s words about moving forward from a loss are [words that we lawyers should take to heart](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2023/05/01/npr-giannis-antetokounmpo-reporter-milwaukee-bucks-nba-playoffs). While his words are directed at sports, they are universally true:

Do you get a promotion every year at your job? No, right? So every year, your work is a failure? No. Every year, you work towards something, which is a goal: It’s to get a promotion, to be able to take care of your family, provide a house for them, or take care of your parents. It’s not a failure, it’s steps to success. There’s always steps to it. Michael Jordan played for 15 years and won 6 championships. The other 9 years were a failure? That’s what you’re telling me.

There’s no failure in sports. There’s good days, bad days, some days you are able to be successful, some days you’re not, some days it’s your turn, some days it’s not your turn. That’s what sport’s [sic] about. You don’t always win, some other people are gonna win. And this year, someone else is gonna win. Simple as that.

So 50 years from 1971-2021 that we didn’t win a championship, it was 50 years of failure? No it was not, there were steps to it, and we were able to win one, hopefully we can win another one.

From the time we enter law school (and even before), we are obsessed with winning: class standing, grades, law review, Order of the Coif, and of course, the juggernaut of the bar exam. After we land our first job, then it’s all about proving yourself repeatedly. Do you get good assignments? Stellar reviews? What are your chances for partnership or promotion? Do you stay the course, roll the dice, and hope you get there? What if you don’t?

We are so hard on ourselves, and I think that contributes mightily to the mental health issues we have. We don’t cut ourselves any slack (I plead guilty) and we feel that we have let our clients down if it’s not a perfect outcome. We need to remind ourselves that just because we don’t win every time doesn’t mean we have lost.

[Biglaw firms] might see a dip [in billable hours] in the first quarter, depending on how much longer this goes on. I just can’t believe there’s enough alternate work going on to make up for what’s happening when the [government] offices aren’t open.

— Jeffrey Lowe, practice leader at Major Lindsey & Africa, [explaining to Law.com](https://www.law.com/2019/01/11/law-firms-face-uncharted-waters-as-shutdown-grinds-some-practices-to-a-halt/) that with some legal work stopping or slowing down because of the government shut down, firms might see an impact on their bottom line.

Every year, we publish a list of the [top law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/top-outside-counsel-2022/) in the country, based on the insights of those who know best — the in-house attorneys who hire them.

We invite all in-house attorneys to tell us about your experiences. Which law firms do you rely on and for what kind of work?

As always, our survey is both brief and anonymous. Please [share your thoughts here](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_dbYjoUTbxaPdwea).

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# With Deadline Looming, Firms Continue To Issue Raises
## Keeping your associates in the dark as to their financial futures is not the credited way to improve morale.

Time continues to tick by, and more and more associates are beginning to wonder if their firms will ever raise their salaries. Please take note, managing partners and compensation committees: For the record, keeping your associates in the dark as to their financial futures is not the credited way to improve morale.

Last week, associates at Seward & Kissel — a firm that recently [celebrated its 125th anniversary](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/the-state-of-the-legal-profession-in-2015/) in September 2015 — wrote to us, begging us to out the firm for not raising salaries. As it turns out, we didn’t need to go that far, because the firm issued raises Tuesday. We hear that the firm is only matching the Cravath salary scale through third-year associates, up to $210,000 (but others have said that the firm has matched Cravath through fifth-year associates, up to $260,000). We do not know the date the raise is effective, but presume it must be July 1, if only to keep up appearances with competitors.

If you have any additional information about the salary increases at Seward, please [reach out to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath). Congratulations to all Seward & Kissel associates in New York and DC!

Everyone likes a good ranking, and now Crain’s New York has gotten in on the action. They’ve put together a list of the[ top 100 women lawyers in New York City](http://www.crainsnewyork.com/assets/pdf/CN1135401212.PDF). The publication has started the ranking in commemoration of the achievements of women, while still being mindful of the challenges of being a high-profile woman attorney.

Some 130 years after Kate Stoneman became the first woman, in 1886, to be admitted to the New York bar, these 100 women celebrated by Crain’s have climbed to the heights of their careers against a background of sometimes blatant, sometimes unconscious bias. Only a very foolish man, though, would try to objectify or demean these gifted attorneys.

Which, of course, doesn’t mean they haven’t tried…

# Why The Milbank Raise Is Not That Big Of A Deal -- And Why It Is
## The aftermath of this increase will tell us a lot, just not about the firms you think.

When Milbank chairman [Scott Edelman explained the firm’s thinking](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/the-reason-why-milbank-raised-associate-salaries/) when it came to the latest round of salary increases, he was straightforward that the firm wasn’t trying to shock the market, they just wanted to stay on top of cost-of-living and inflation changes.

But is he right about that? Does inflation really justify this raise?

The short answer is… yes. A tipster yesterday took to the CPI calculator to figure out just what’s going on:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
180K in July 2016 is 187K in today’s dollars. 1.6% raise woohoo!!!!!

It’s true, though only through April 2018 — the latest date with available data on the system — so if anything it’s an even smaller “raise” and even more of a cost-of-living adjustment. Not that this is a criticism of Milbank. On the contrary, this fact should prompt every firm that raised salaries in 2016 to follow Milbank’s suit quickly. There’s really no reason not to.

Unless, of course, those firms have realized that they couldn’t really afford their 2016 raises. That may be the primary lesson to divine from [the course of the next few weeks](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/who-will-match-the-milbank-raise/): which firms are ready to admit they jumped the gun in 2016.

Like the old pretentious saying about jazz that “it’s the notes they don’t play,” when it comes to following Milbank, the firms that hold out will be much more interesting (dare we say “the notes they don’t pay”).

# Yes, There Is (Professional) Life After Biglaw
## What it's like opening up a firm (in the middle of a pandemic).

Connie Bertram

It’s been three years since [Connie Bertram ](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/connie-bertram/?rf=1)helped to shake up the staid world of Biglaw by being one of the early trend setters of [partners suing their firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/inside-the-50-million-gender-discrimination-case-a-partner-filed-against-proskauer-rose/), in her case it was Proskauer Rose. [Though the case settled for an undisclosed amount](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/proskauer-settles-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-but-details-remain-shrouded-in-secrecy/), the allegations — which included that there were “substantial gender disparities” at the firm, that Bertram was objectified by two partners, and that her compensation lagged behind that of similarly situated male partners — helped to break the silence surrounding these issues in the legal industry.

After the settlement, [Bertram joined Polsinelli](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/partner-who-brought-biglaw-discrimination-suit-moves-firms/), but now the time has come for another big career move. Bertram is saying goodbye to Biglaw and opening up her own firm, Bertram LLP. It’s something she says she’s “had in the back of my head for 10 or 15 years. I’ve had several clients that encouraged me to do this.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And, no, it isn’t a reflection on Polsinelli. She [tells Law.com](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2020/09/10/lawyer-who-sued-proskauer-for-gender-bias-launches-employment-boutique-in-dc/) the move “had nothing to do with Polsinelli. It was a great firm. I had a good experience there.” That firm similarly wishes Bertram all the best, “We thank Connie for her commitment to our firm over the past two years and wish her well in her future endeavors.”

As with all new business endeavors launched during the pandemic, there are some questions hanging over the project. For example, Bertram, who is at the moment the only attorney at the new firm, is holding off on getting permanent office. But since she has an existing client base from her 20 years of practice, she doesn’t see much of a problem. On opening her own shop Bertram says, “It depends some on who you are and what kind of practice you have. If you were coming out of government, hanging up your shingle with no clients, [I] would be nervous.”

The new firm will focus on employment counseling, investigations and litigation including whistleblower claims, executive and board disputes, restrictive covenants, trade secret disputes and government contractor compliance. And Bertram hopes to grow the practice to as many as 50 lawyers over time. Her focus will be on hiring women and minorities:

Bertram said throughout her career she held management roles and worked on client service along with associate development and “trying to be ‘the voice in the room’” for women and minorities. As a result, she would like to focus on hiring women and minorities at her firm.

“It’s more on bringing together very like-minded people … who want to do exceptional work, but maybe had some challenges in the practice of law. I’ve found that a lot of attorneys actually have had difficult life experiences and it pushes them to be more exceptional,” she said.

# Tech Company Skirmishes Highlight Biglaw's Revolving Door With The FTC
## That everyone being investigated by the FTC is represented by FTC attorneys is... problematic.

While Trump rails against Facebook for having the gall to occasionally fact-check the nonsense passed around its platform and Democratic candidates are seriously discussing breaking up Amazon, it’s becoming clear that the leeway big technology firms have had for years is going to be reined in regardless of who controls Washington. In the meantime, the FTC is ratcheting up enforcement of tech companies, having secured a pair of big wins last month over Facebook and Equifax.

But as the FTC does its job, these tech companies are [lawyering up with former FTC lawyers who’ve decamped to Biglaw](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/459039-tech-fight-puts-former-ftc-officials-in-high-demand).

Facebook enlisted Sean Royall, an attorney with the firm Gibson Dunn, who was previously a deputy director in the FTC’s Bureau of Competition from 2001 to 2003, according to the law firm’s website. Current FTC Chairman Joseph Simons was the bureau’s director at the time.

And Edith Ramirez, a Democrat who was selected by then-President Obama in 2013 to chair the FTC, represented Equifax over privacy charges stemming from their massive 2017 data breach. Ramirez, who left the agency in February 2017 to join the law firm Hogan Lovells, has also defended Google-owned YouTube against a class action lawsuit over children’s privacy. A federal judge in South Carolina threw the case out in April.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
On the one hand, this makes a lot of sense. Who could possibly know the procedures and motivations of an investigating agency better than someone who used to work there? Former agency officials offer insight and experience that’s hard to find among practitioners who’ve spent their whole life on the outside.

On the other hand, just as there are many excellent criminal defense attorneys who’ve never worked as prosecutors, it’s possible to build expertise defending antitrust actions without being on the other side. And the risk that the rapid-fire revolving door system could undermine the mission of the FTC is high:

“There’s just an enormous expectation that either you yourself will revolve if you’re at the FTC, or that in almost any important matter someone opposite you at the table is a former colleague, and maybe a former boss who gave you a promotion or a friend,” [Executive director of the Revolving Door Project Jeff] Hauser told The Hill.

“I mean, there’s a lot of ongoing social connections between current and former FTC lawyers, who are often going to be ostensibly on the opposite side of tables,” he added. “And I think it would be an act of robotic perfection for that to not influence the tenor of the conversations at those tables.”

The adversarial system breaks down when the other side of the table is approaching the matter as if they’re an alternative agency viewpoint instead of an opponent. The whole conflict changes when one side is acting like a dissenting commission member rather than an outside attorney and that influences how the sausage is made — more likely than not in ways that inure to the benefit of the company.

Still, these folks can’t stay in the government forever and they’ve made their livelihood in trade commission litigation. They wouldn’t have much to bring to the table of the firm if forced to do only slip and falls the rest of their lives. The legal academy can’t absorb a bevy of new FTC professors every year, so some of these folks have to get back into private practice. But the government can do a better job of policing conflicts of interest.

Peter Kaplan, a spokesman for the FTC, told The Hill in a statement, “The FTC strictly adheres to all federal government ethics rules and guidelines.”

Those include a lifetime ban on former officials representing any companies that they were personally involved in overseeing in cases before the federal government.

That’s a good start, but the agency should consider making employees above a certain level off-limits to practice in this area for a longer blackout period. If a line attorney wants to move to Biglaw that’s one thing, but if a commission member who actively shaped policy jumps ship they should be forced to sit out. A ban on representing a specific company doesn’t address the conflict involved when a defense attorney has real knowledge of how overarching policy is being shaped and the sort of deep personal connections with the people making the supervisory calls on cases.

There may not be an easy answer, but with tech companies increasingly being hauled in front of the FTC with their former FTC attorneys in tow, everyone should at least start thinking about what can be done.

The Washington, DC office of our client, a premiere Am Law firm, has asked Kinney Recruiting to help in their search for a financial restructuring associate with one to four years of experience.

This is a nationally acclaimed practice working with the best and brightest lawyers. Best of all? The client’s DC practice is unique, and perhaps the only firm with such a practice, in that most DC FR practices are litigation heavy or exclusively litigation, and this role is pure transactional work. Who doesn’t love that?

# Partner Whose Behavior Features Prominently In Jones Day Gender Discrimination Lawsuit Is Out At The Firm
## We still don't know exactly why he left...

Beyond whatever resolution the purported class-action gender discrimination lawsuit [filed against Jones Day by six associates earlier this month](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/jones-day-facing-second-class-action-lawsuit-over-fraternity-culture-of-the-firm/) reaches, it will have the lasting impact of giving the outsider a glimpse of what it’s like to work at the notoriously secretive law firm — at least from the perspective of the plaintiffs.

In the complaint, the two named plaintiffs, Nilab Rahyar Tolton and Andrea Mazingo, describe some of the “fraternity culture” they allegedly endured while at the firm. For both of these women, the behavior of partner Eric Landau features prominently into their grievances. The complaint alleges Tolton dealt with sexist comments from Landau:

Ms. Tolton’s superb performance did not, however, insulate her from sexist and sexualized conduct and commentary. For example, then-Partner Eric Landau, who was trying to recruit Ms. Tolton to his practice group, regularly commented on her clothes and high heels. After a deposition preparation session, he remarked that partners at his former firm kept asking him why his female associates all looked like volleyball players. Shortly after Ms. Tolton got married, however, Partner Landau seemed to abruptly lose interest in working with her.

The complaint goes on to allege Mazingo experienced similar behavior from Landau:

Ms. Mazingo was recruited into the Firm’s Securities Litigation and SEC Enforcement Practice Group. Partner Landau told her that he and Partner Roman Darmer were impressed with her obvious talent and work ethic. Once she joined the group, however, Partner Landau degraded Ms. Mazingo as a sex object, regularly subjecting her to sexist comments about her appearance, including her makeup, her hair, and her choice of footwear. For example, he continually pressed Ms. Mazingo to wear high heels, even though she assured him that she was more comfortable in flats. Partner Landau also frequently demanded that Ms. Mazingo account for why she looked “prettier than usual” on any given day.

And, according to the complaint, so did a secretary at the firm who felt forced to leave because of the behavior:

Ms. Mazingo was not the only female Jones Day employee about whose appearance Partner Landau commented. In front of the entire Irvine office, Partner Landau extolled how “banging” his secretary’s body looked in a bikini at an event that had been planned to honor that secretary. The secretary, who was also Ms. Mazingo’s secretary, complained to Jones Day, but, so far as Ms. Mazingo is aware, the Firm never took action against Partner Landau. As a direct result of Partner Landau’s actions and comments, the secretary was forced to resign, which particularly upset Ms. Mazingo because she had worked closely with the secretary since she had been a summer associate.

The complaint also alleges that the problem at Jones Day extends beyond the sexist comments, and that plaintiffs were denied “mentorship and professional attention”:

Partner Landau’s sexist and sexualized comments were not isolated incidents. Ms. Mazingo’s peers later tasked her with planning a “women’s luncheon”—a dispiriting ritual in which the office’s female attorneys (which included no homegrown partners) sought to mentor each other. To signify that it was Ms. Mazingo’s turn to plan the luncheon, she was forced to display a 4-foot tall cardboard cut-out of a lipstick tube in her office for months. When Partner Landau asked Ms. Mazingo why the lipstick cutout was in her office, she explained the backstory. He in turn responded, “Oh, I thought it was because you are a lipstick lawyer,” an allusion to the term “lipstick lesbian.”

While Partners Quintanilla and Landau repeatedly subjected Ms. Mazingo to unwanted sexual attention, they denied her mentorship and professional attention. Partner Landau and other male attorneys on his team, including Associate Rob Tiefenbrun and Of Counsel Travis Biffar, often left Ms. Mazingo in the office to work through lunch while they went to enjoy boys only lunches together. They excluded Ms. Mazingo even though she sat next to them and worked on most of the same matters.

By contrast, the female mentorship lunches—organized by the lawyer with the lipstick cutout in her office—were poor substitutes for the one-on-one professional attention that Biffar and Tiefenbrun received from Partner Landau. The female attorney lunches often focused on socializing and conversations about families and weddings.

Now it looks like Landau, who got all this unwanted attention in the complaint, is no longer at the firm. [According to ](https://www.law.com/2019/04/18/jones-day-partner-tagged-in-gender-bias-suit-exits-firm/)Law.com, he is out at the firm, but the timing and circumstances of his departure remain unclear:

The exact timing of his exit is uncertain. An email sent to his firm address prompted a return message stating that he is “no longer with Jones Day.” Data from ALM’s Legal Compass indicates the firm took down his bio and a related page Jan. 16, well before the complaint was filed, but it’s unclear whether he left the firm at that time or later.

Jones Day has not issued a statement about Landau’s exit from the firm. As you may recall, the firm’s [statement about the lawsuit](https://www.law.com/2019/04/09/jones-day-speaks-out-on-bias-claims-says-working-mothers-thrive/) touted their statistical record of diversity and promised to fight the claims.

# Why You Really Should Join A Bar Association...

On the most recent episode of The Jabot podcast I chat with Maria Vathis, president-elect of the national Federal Bar Association and of counsel at Bryan Cave in Chicago. She talks about her goals and special projects while acting as President of FBA, strategies for younger associates to create that elusive work/life balance, and the challenges she faced as a young female attorney.

The podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Let’s be real — it can suck out there. So we want to create a space where our community can come together share stories, find support and devise strategies.

Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wears when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that — even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Let’s not beat around the wreath — being a dick at the Christmas party is an easy way to experience a layoff season of one. As nice as it would be to meet all of your work expectations from the comfort of your living room,[ the collective hallucination of acting like Long COVID isn’t a thing](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351#:~:text=Heart%20symptoms%20or%20conditions%2C%20including,to%20the%20lungs%20(pulmonary%20embolism)) means that in-person events are back in session. Not only will the number of days you’re expected to be in the office increase, the amount of showing face outside the office bumps up too. Going to the party is enough to avoid the “they’re too good for us” gossip at the water cooler (is that a thing again?), but absence is preferable to committing a party foul that makes people think they’re too good for you.

Oddly enough, the wisdom comes from [LadBible](https://www.ladbible.com/community/legal-expert-warning-work-christmas-party-149112-20231213):

A legal expert has warned that you could be waking up with more than just a hangover if you misbehave at your work Christmas party this year…Employment law expert Katherine Cook told the Shropshire Star that – as you might imagine – work Christmas parties that revolve around alcohol led to an increase in problems.

She says that this month and next, her and her team see a ‘surge’ in businesses asking for advice about disciplinaries and bad behaviour including violence and ‘discriminatory comments’.

While that advice is good enough on its own, let’s back it up with a couple of concrete examples. Remember that associate [who got fired for drunkenly yanking an anchored wig off of someone’s scalp](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/it-will-be-harder-to-hold-people-like-the-wig-ripper-accountable-once-this-court-has-its-way/)? Don’t be that guy. And while I have no knowledge of what she was intoxicated by, it is hard to believe that telling a far-reaching legal meme account that Hitler was pretty good actually was a sober decision. [Don’t be her](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/attorney-goes-on-pro-hitler-antisemitic-social-media-screed-immediately-loses-her-job/). Get the brilliant idea to play pranks on coworkers after a few whisk(e)y sours? [Don’t write whatever got this guy kicked off the plane](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/law-partners-bad-prank-costs-him-his-job-though-he-avoids-jail-so-theres-that/). There’s no question your risk of ending up on the no-fly zone is much lower if you indulge in shenanigans at the local pub, but your chances of getting canned are about as high. Should it be protected speech to suggest that [depriving two million civilians of water and food for two months](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/10/30/gazas-blocked-relief) is less than ethical? Maybe. But if Penn’s president loses her job security [for validly considering which statements earn free speech protection](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/penn-donors-push-out-president-continue-whistling-past-the-professor-bringing-white-nationalists-to-campus/)… I doubt your gig is much safer.

Drink, be merry, and try to keep your job. It is much better to eat beforehand and nurse a mocktail than to submit your resume and then fill out those damned boxes that wouldn’t need answering if they read what you just gave them. That said, you are more than welcome to ignore all of this advice and be an asshat in front of your boss. I, along with the rest of the editorial team, look forward to making fun of you.

The name partner of what Biglaw firm declined a contract to pitch for the Philadelphia Athletics (the team later moved to Oakland)?

Hint: In addition to being a prominent lawyer, he was also a skilled politician. He served as both the Governor of Florida and a U.S. Senator.

# Goodwin Associates Who Lost The Visa Lottery Lost Their Job
## Without an H-1B visa, the associates have to transition out of the firm.

If you spend any time on the corners of the internet where Biglaw associates complain — read Fishbowl and Reddit — you’ve [probably heard](https://www.reddit.com/r/biglaw/comments/12684t4/goodwin_straight_out_fired_all_first_years_who/) about the furor surrounding international associates working in U.S. offices. According to the rumor mill, associates who needed the firm to sponsor their H-1B visa applications who were not selected in the lottery for the visa were immediately fired from the firm and not offered positions in any international outposts of the firm.

So which firm’s feeling the heat over their treatment of H-1B visa lottery losers? The finger’s being pointed at Goodwin Procter, a firm that’s already down a round of[ layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/am-law-20-firm-begins-layoffs/) earlier this year.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
When reached for comment, a spokesperson for the firm confirmed that the visa lottery is a situation beyond their control and that eight of 11 international first-year associates failed to secure work visas. As a result, the firm says they’ve worked with immigration counsel on a “near-term” solution, but none is available. As such, those associates will be leaving the firm:

Unfortunately, we recently learned that eight associates in our first-year class were not selected in the lottery and will lose their authorization to work in the United States, meaning that we will no longer be permitted to legally employ them in the United States. We are working with each of these associates to identify whether there are viable, alternative near-term visa paths for them. After consulting with immigration counsel, we do not expect to successfully identify any near-term alternatives for most of these associates, so they will be leaving the firm. Separately, three first-year associates were successful in the lottery.

As to the frequently touted option of transferring the associates to the firm’s European or Asian offices, the firm says that isn’t “viable”:

We do not believe that it is viable to transfer the impacted individuals to any of our offices in Europe or Asia, where they would need to continue to be staffed on U.S.-based work, and where they – as U.S.-trained first-year associates – would not have the same access to U.S.-based work and professional development opportunities as they would in the United States, where they were trained and hired. None of the impacted associates is trained to do local work in any jurisdiction outside of the United States where we have an office.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The firm also indicated they’re providing services to the impacted individuals:

Our principal focus now is to help the impacted individuals. During their transition period, which will run until late June, they will continue to have access to their current benefits, including health care coverage. We are providing them with access to our immigration counsel, and we are offering them career transition coaching, outplacement support, and alumni coaching. We are also offering to sponsor them in the H-1B lottery in 2024.

We recognize that this is a stressful situation for our international first-year associates, who have sacrificed a lot, worked very hard, and may now have to leave the United States, where they have been building a life and a career. Unfortunately, the H-1B process is entirely out of our control.

Best of luck to those being let go from Goodwin.

How is your firm or organization is handling H-1B visa lottery losers? Please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20H1B) or text us ([646-820-8477](tel:646-820-8477)).

# The Bumpy (But Rewarding) Road To Restarting Your Legal Career
## Some challenges come with making the transition back into law.

Restarting your legal career after taking time off for any reason can be difficult. You may have left the workforce to raise a family or care for an ailing loved one. Maybe you were downsized during the recession and struggled to find work. Or you may have simply decided that you want to return to law after years of working in another field.

Whatever your reason, some challenges come with making the transition back into law. In this article, I will explore some of the most common challenges faced by attorneys who are starting over and strategies for overcoming these obstacles.

1. Challenge: Outdated Skills

Suppose you have been out of the legal field for a significant time. In that case, your skills may be outdated — a significant obstacle when most employers look for candidates experienced with contemporary tools and strategies.

How to Overcome It

Consider taking continuing legal education (CLE) courses to improve your knowledge and skills. Many bar associations offer CLEs, and many states even require attorneys to take these classes to stay current.

Volunteering or interning at law firms or Legal Aid organizations is another way to gain valuable up-to-date experience. Finding such a role allows you to update your skills and make sure you want to restart your legal career before making a major commitment.

And, yes, you can always freshen up your skills (or at least learn where to start learning) by reading books, watching online videos, interviewing your peers, or pursuing plenty of other avenues of learning.

2. Challenge: Networking In A New Field

After time away from the highly interconnected legal field, it can be difficult to reconnect with old contacts and make new ones. This is especially true if you are looking to enter a different practice area than the one you were in before.

How to Overcome It

Consider attending legal industry events, bar association meetings, or conferences; taking CLEs classes (mentioned above) is another perfect venue for meeting like-minded lawyers. You can also join a legal networking group in person or online. LinkedIn is an excellent resource for this, as there are many groups specifically for attorneys. Social media networks allow you to connect with people outside your zip code. They were a lifesaver for me during the pandemic when my human-to-human interactions were limited.

This issue can be addressed by volunteering with a legal organization, such as a bar association or Legal Aid. This will not only help you make new contacts, but it will allow you to also serve the community and give back to those who are less fortunate.

3. Challenge: Being Underqualified Or Overqualified

If you have been out of the legal field for a significant amount of time, you may feel like you are either underqualified or overqualified for the positions to which you are applying. This can be difficult to remedy, but it’s essential to address it, as you don’t want to appear overconfident or underprepared.

How To Overcome It

Take an inventory of your skills and experience. Make a list of the things you are good at and the accomplishments you are proud of. Then, look at the job descriptions of positions that interest you and see how your skills and experience match their expectations. If you feel qualified for the position, go ahead and apply.

4. Challenge: Gaps In Your Resume

It is not uncommon — especially if you’re trying to transition careers — to have gaps in your resume regarding relevant experience. This can be off-putting to potential employers, who may wonder what you have been doing during that time.

How To Overcome It

If there are times in your career when you’ve stepped away from the law, be prepared to explain what you were doing during those times in your cover letter or during an interview. To show that your time was still spent productively, I recommend explaining how this time away impacted your life. Did you take time off to travel around the world? Did you choose to take care of a loved one? These are all important life stories that give context to gaps in legal experience. If framed from the point of view of learning, development, and personal growth, you may have a compelling reason to join the team.

Another option is to include a “Professional Experience” section on your resume, in which you list your professional accomplishments, even if they are not law related. This will show employers that you have been busy and have a lot to offer, even if you haven’t been directly practicing law.

Final Words

Restarting your legal career can be challenging, but it is not impossible. With hard work and dedication, you can overcome any obstacle that stands in your way. And once you get your foot back in the door, you will be on your way to a successful and fulfilling career in no time.

If you are looking to restart your legal career, check out the “Notes to My (Legal) Self” podcast episode “[Season 4, Episode 17: Season 4, Episode 17: Relaunching Legal Career (featuring Mindy S. Berkower)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiqYqB6pRd0&t=1s).” This episode features Mindy S. Berkower, a lawyer and career coach, who offers advice and tips on how to make the transition back into the legal field.

# Biglaw Partner Explains How Hard It Is For Donald Trump To Defend Himself in 'Multi-Front War'

Like gremlins that get wet, Donald Trump’s legal troubles just keep on multiplying.

So far we’ve got the New York case against him over [financial crimes](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/trump-indicted-for-34-felonies-its-not-the-payout-to-stormy-its-the-pay-up-to-cohen/) related to the Stormy Daniels hush money, he’s got a federal indictment over his[ handling of classified documents](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/judge-cannon-sets-trump-docs-case-for-may-trial-date/), there’s the [federal case](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/third-donald-trump-indictement/) over that whole January 6th insurrection thing. Thus far he’s faces 78 felony counts in three jurisdictions ([if you’re counting](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/counting-all-of-donald-trumps-legal-troubles/)) and it seems pretty likely Georgia is about to add to these legal problems.

But all these separate — but still felonious — actions are likely to take their toll. Bryan Cave partner and former federal prosecutor [Renato Mariotti](https://www.bclplaw.com/en-US/people/renato-mariotti.html) appeared on CNN to explain that “one thing that people really underestimate” is “how hard it is to defend a multi-front war in criminal defense.”

Because while each of the prosecution teams in the four separate cases against Trump “can focus like a laser on what they need to do to get a conviction,” the defense team has a series of “competing concerns.” Mariotti notes “I have done it, myself personally. It is very, very challenging to represent a client that is facing criminal indictment on multiple fronts.”

# The ATL 2017 Law Firm Rankings: Raises Make You Number 1
## Cravath is the top firm (again), joined by some new arrivals in the top 10.

The new ATL Power 100 are out. Is Jones Day number 1?

No, of course not. Stop drinking the [Ben Ginsberg Kool-Aid](http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/ben-ginsberg/videos/222473/). I had a random friend of my mother’s ask me if “Ben Ginsberg’s firm” was “the best in America.” I didn’t even know how to respond. Television ruins America.

Obviously, Cravath is the top firm in our ATL Power rankings. They were the top firm last year, and this year they [started a salary raise frenzy](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/). Both presidential campaigns wish they could afford to hire Cravath, but CSM is too busy making bank to trouble itself with the leadership of the country.

There are some new arrivals in our top 10 this year. Wachtell comes in at number 3, suggesting our rankings are getting better. Skadden falls out of our top 10, suggesting that I’m about to be cursed at on Twitter.

See the full list by clicking the button below. No matter who is in charge, these firms will be large.

See the complete ranking (and methodology) here.

# This 2-Minute Report Helped A Plaintiffs Firm Thrive
## A top PI lawyer reveals his metrics-driven approach to being more efficient and adaptable.

When Virginia doubled the jurisdictional limit for its general district court — a quicker alternative to its circuit court for personal injury cases — a top PI firm made a key adjustment in what might be record time. 

Paul Hernandez, a partner with Kalfus & Nachman who jokingly calls himself “the efficiency king,” needed to decide how his firm would adjust before the changes took effect on July 1. 

Enacted in March, the changes meant that the general district court could hear cases with personal injury claims up to $50,000 — its prior limit was $25,000. The court offers speedier trial timelines and varied rules that boost efficiency, making it an appealing venue for cases that fit its guidelines. 

Using the Needles Neos cloud-based platform, Hernandez was able to quickly compile a report of all his firm’s current cases, drawing on factors including minimum settlement value and insurance coverage. 

The report ultimately indicated which circuit court cases should be sent to general district court, complete with details like case number and lawyer. Hernandez distributed it to the firm’s lawyers, who acted quickly in getting the appropriate cases in line to be transferred.

“If it took me two-and-a-half minutes, I’d be surprised,” he told legal tech expert Bob Ambrogi in a recent Above the Law webinar. 

“I didn’t rely on my staff to do it. I was able to do it sitting right here at the desk.” 

In this full webinar, Hernandez discusses in detail his metrics-driven approach to managing costs and profitability. 

The conversation also includes how he secured a 2021 pipeline of cases, managed firmwide productivity amid a changing physical office space, and positioned his firm for success in a post-pandemic future.

The COVID-19 tide has really turned in Biglaw.

[We’re already tracking](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/the-great-salary-cut-rollback-tracker-where-does-your-law-firm-stand/) the Biglaw firms that are rolling back their previously announced compensation cuts caused by the novel coronavirus. But now comes word that a Biglaw firm has announced a special (monetary) thank you for all the hard work associates are putting in during this trying time.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Today, Cooley announced special “appreciation bonuses” that will give associates an extra $2,500 – $7,500. Considering the firm has not previously announced any compensation cuts, this generous extra bonus is quite the gesture. Here’s how the bonuses will break down by year:



And if you’ve been particularly busy during the pandemic — on track to bill in excess of 1,950 hours — the firm will give you a bonus “materially higher than the amount listed above.” That’s a pretty nice way to say thank you for the hard work. (In a moment of touching humanity, the firm also acknowledged that financial perks may not cover everyone’s needs during this trying time and committed to continue hiring talent to ease some of the burden, and providing additional resources to everyone.)

In addition to these special appreciation bonuses, the firm has also made some commitments for year-end bonuses. First of all, they announced that these bonuses will not replace or otherwise negatively impact 2020 bonuses. And the bonuses will at least be at the 2019 level (which ranged from $15,000 to $100,000 based on year). With all the upheaval caused by COVID, it’s nice to have confirmation bonus season won’t be another casualty — at least at Cooley.

# Biglaw Associates Expecting Bigger, Better Bonuses After Wild Year Of Billables
## Bonuses are coming... but they might not be big enough.

It’s October 27, and with Halloween just days away, that means bonus season is right around the corner. Given the super hot lateral market, Biglaw firms are all about treats — with hardly any tricks — these days. Thanks to the many pandemic-related bonuses (appreciation bonuses and special bonuses) that law firms have handed out thus far, the thousand-plus respondents to our annual bonus season survey seem to think they’ll be treated to 2021 bonus compensation that’s going to pack a huge punch.

As a little reminder — as if you really needed one — this is what last year’s [Baker McKenzie bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/) ([Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/cravath-bonuses/) later followed along) looked like, and this was on top of the [Davis Polk appreciation bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/) (which ranged from $7,500 to $40,000):

Class of 2020 – $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2019 – $15,000
Class of 2018 – $25,000
Class of 2017 – $50,000
Class of 2016 – $65,000
Class of 2015 – $80,000
Class of 2014 – $90,000
Class of 2013 – $100,000
Class of 2012+ – $100,000

This bonus scale has been in place for years on end. Associates think it’s time for a change — and a big one, at that. With money being handed out to associates like candy, our survey respondents think that bonuses will be large and in charge.

What will 2021 bonuses look like?



Almost 60% of respondents (58.24%) reported that they believe 2021 bonuses will be higher than 2020 bonuses. Biglaw firms better not disappoint their associates when it comes to bonus payouts this year, especially since they’ve been working so hard. (We’ll have more on this in just a moment.)

Will any other money be headed associates’ way? Our survey respondents seem a little more pessimistic when it comes to bonuses on top of bonuses in 2021. After all, let’s not forget that at many firms, the [Davis Polk special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/) (ranging from $12,000 to $64,000) were broken up into two payments, and depending on any given firm’s plan, those have been paid out at various times this fall, with some even coming at the same time as year-end bonuses.

Do you think any additional special bonuses will be offered?



A little more than 55% of respondents (55.39%, to be exact) reported that they do not believe any additional special bonuses will be offered.

For those of you who are wondering when your bank accounts will be a little more flush, here’s a list of the dates when year-end market bonuses hit Biglaw since 2006, the very first year Above the Law started publishing bonus news. Take a look:

Bonus announcements seem to be made in early to mid-November lately, but let’s see when our survey respondents think this year’s first bonus announcement will arrive.

When do you think 2021 bonuses will be announced?



The largest cohort of respondents (27.44%) reported that they believe 2021 bonuses will be announced in the third week of November. We should note that this neither tracks for the last two years of bonus announcements, nor does it line up with past precedent set by Cravath — if we assume that Cravath will be the first firm on bonuses this year, that is. Cravath tends to stick a schedule as far as these things are concerned, and in recent years, it has announced its bonus news on either the last Monday in November or the first Monday in the first week of December (this year, the first Monday in the first week of December is… November 29, oops). But with other firms in the mix — especially firms like Davis Polk — it’s really hard to say what will happen. Will one firm announce the same tired, old bonus scale only to have DPW swing by a short time later to blow it out of the water, as like what happened with appreciation bonuses and special bonuses? There may no rhyme or reason when it comes to this year’s big bonus announcements.

While associates are busy counting down the hours until Bonus Day, they’re likely even busier counting up the hours they’re on track to bill in 2021 to meet their targets for bonus eligibility. Just how much are associates expected to bill during an ongoing worldwide health crisis? The answer is: still quite a lot. About 81 percent of our survey respondents are on track to bill 2000 hours or more (much more, actually) in 2021. Here are the full results from our survey:

How many hours are you on track to bill in 2021?



The largest cohort of respondents (22.85%) said they are on track to bill 2400 hours or more this year. Working from home during the pandemic has all but erased the balance in work-life balance for Biglaw associates, which is why they’ve working their tails off. Law firms and partners are taking home record profits thanks to the pandemic, and that’s why associates are expecting a larger than average payday when bonus time rolls around. This time around, if associates don’t receive what they’re expecting when bonus time rolls around, they might leave….

Either way, Biglaw associates can soon look forward to their bank accounts being stuffed like the Thanksgiving turkeys they’ll gobble down at the end of next month.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

After seven years with a top international law firm, I am now in my sixth year as a legal recruiter. I have worked with hundreds of lawyers — smart, thoughtful, and successful people. But over and over, I see candidates damage — or nearly damage, before my intervention — their best shot at advancing their careers by making mistakes that easily can be avoided.

What are the 10 most frequent mistakes my colleague and I witness as legal recruiters?

- You wait too long to start the process. The time to start thinking about a lateral move is now. Whether you’re still in law school, in Day One of your first year at a firm, or further along in your career, [you should always be thinking of next steps](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/25-things-all-young-lawyers-should-know-in-order-to-not-screw-up-their-legal-careers-2/). That doesn’t mean you have to move right away, or even within a year. The next step may even mean an affirmative decision to stay put. But you should be proactive about [continually evaluating and re-evaluating your professional development](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/top-12-reasons-why-associates-switch-law-firms/). You should keep your résumé and representative matters sheets up to date at all times. You should inform yourself of the legal market regularly so you know when in terms of market cycles, seasonal demands and seniority your skills will be most valued, and you can be sure not the miss that window. At a minimum, have initial no-commitment discussions with a trusted recruiter early on, establish a relationship, and understand the market for your talent.
- You are not responsive. You don’t have to check your e-mail every minute, but don’t let a whole day go by without responding to a prospective employer with additional documents they may request or with your availability for an interview, for example. Delays reflect poorly on your ability to manage a demanding job, the level of seriousness you bring to the job search, and your interest in the position.
- For more senior associates, counsel, and partners, you don’t take the time to develop a solid business plan. I published [a full post on this topic](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/why-lawyers-need-to-have-business-plans-no-matter-what/) recently so I won’t go into great detail here, but the punch line is that a persuasive business plan can be the key factor in convincing prospective employers that you understand the business law firms are in and that you are planning to take an active role.
- You let silly typos slide. I am a fan of sending thank you e-mails to your interviewers. They can be brief but they must be professional. Do not just type a thank you on your phone without proofing it. We’ve seen associates not advance to the next round of interviews due to such mistakes. Also, do not just copy/paste the identical thank you note to multiple people. Assume they will share the message internally.
- You are too negative or not enthusiastic enough in interviews. You must be natural and true to yourself, but you also must be the best possible version of yourself in an interview. You must sound enthusiastic about your work — current and future. Interviewers are evaluating your passion for the practice of law and also your presentation skills. Do not fall into the trap of sounding negative about your current employer. That will be a red flag to any prospective employers.
- You accept a counter-offer from your current employer. There’s a reason you are looking to leave in the first place. Don’t assume that your current employer will keep promises made when forced into a corner, with the imminent prospect of losing you. I‘m not saying your current employer is necessarily acting deceptively. The decision to fulfill these promises may not be in the hands of the partner doing the promising. The problems that drive you to look around are usually systemic.
- You draw out the process and don’t know when to stop asking for more. Once you have an offer in hand, you have the upper hand. But you cannot abuse this leverage. Do not try to nickel and dime the new firm or ask for too much in terms of a delayed start date, signing bonuses, etc. The firm always has the option of rescinding your offer if they feel you’re not enthusiastic enough about the opportunity or they sense you’re going to be difficult.
- You put all your eggs in one basket. Or maybe two baskets. But not enough baskets. Even with the best credentials, guidance and experience, the lateral process is full of unlucky breaks. You will be much better served by keeping an open mind as to your next firm. Do not rule out options based on the unfounded rumors or stereotypes we’ve all heard about various firms. Do not waste your time or anyone else’s by applying to firms in which you have zero interest. But just as prospective employers are not committed to extending an offer to everyone they interview, you also don’t have to be 100% committed to accepting a future offer before applying. You just have to be 100% committed to taking the process seriously and genuinely considering any offers that result.
- You work with multiple recruiters. There are some rare circumstances under which you should consider working with a second recruiter or even multiple recruiters. But this is the exception and not the rule. Some candidates believe that working more recruiters equates to receiving more job offers. This is simply not true when applying solely to other law firms. When you work with more than one recruiter on law firm searches, you run the risk of multiple applications to the same firm — which only makes you look unprofessional. You also impede your main recruiters from managing the process and its timing in your best interest. You make it harder for recruiters to offer you unbiased advice in the final decision-making stages.
- You do not work with a recruiter at all. Deciding if and when to make a lateral move can be difficult. It would be a shame to put so much time and effort into your legal career over the years, just to ruin your best shot at a new position over a mismanaged job search or even a small oversight along the way. [A legal recruiter can help](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/but-my-friend-works-there/) you analyze the market and draw upon experience to help you determine the best strategy for attaining your career goals. A recruiter can also serve as your guide to be sure you don’t fall into the easy-to-avoid traps such as those listed above. Sometimes small mistakes can have lasting repercussions.

# Struggling Law School Vows To Change Its Ways, Triple In Size
## The last InfiLaw school left standing recently announced its plans to convert to a nonprofit institution.

What’s a for-profit law school that’s down on its luck to do when all of its sister schools have already been forced to close? If you guessed that this law school would attempt to become a nonprofit university or find one to align itself with, you’d be right.

Florida Coastal School of Law, the last InfiLaw school left standing, recently announced its plans to convert to a nonprofit institution, and has already submitted an application to the American Bar Association for the change. For what it’s worth, Coastal is currently out of compliance with with the ABA’s accreditation standards pertaining to its admissions practices, and must change or risk facing similar consequences as its defunct sister schools. The [Daily Business Review](https://www.law.com/dailybusinessreview/2019/02/05/florida-coastal-law-school-aims-to-ditch-infilaw-and-become-nonprofit/) has more information:

Florida Coastal has been rocked by accreditation problems and declining enrollment in recent years, and DeVito said the school is in active talks with a nonprofit university with which to affiliate. He told the [Jacksonville Daily Record](https://www.jaxdailyrecord.com/article/florida-coastal-school-of-law-seeking-not-for-profit-status) that the potential affiliate is not in Florida but is a university located in the Southeast. The school is already working to improve its bar pass rates, graduate employment rates, and academic credentials and affiliating with a university is the next step in that strategic plan, he added.

Florida Coastal hopes to avoid the fate of its sister schools, the Charlotte School of Law and Arizona Summit Law School, also owned by InfiLaw. Charlotte shuttered in 2017 after the U.S. Department of Education barred it from the federal loan program, while Arizona Summit is soon to close. Each saw enrollments dwindle as their bar pass rates plummeted and the ABA cracked down on their admissions practices.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
If you recall, both Charlotte and Arizona Summit had plans to affiliate with nonprofit schools (Charlotte with an unknown [“university in the northeast,”](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/charlotte-plans-to-go-non-profit-while-still-paying-profits-to-infilaw-or-something/) and Summit with [Bethune-Cookman University](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/arizona-summit-now-counting-on-black-people-not-knowing-how-to-use-google/)), but these plans didn’t exactly work out. As Professor David Frakt, once a dean candidate at Florida Coastal, previously pondered, is InfiLaw trying to [sell off its law schools](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/is-infilaw-trying-to-dump-all-of-its-for-profit-law-schools/) at the behest of Sterling Partners, its owners?

In the meantime, Dean Scott DeVito said, “Moving to nonprofit is the right thing for our students, alumni and our community. It will also strengthen the institution and open the door to our becoming affiliated with a nonprofit university. We are extremely fortunate in having the support of all of our stakeholders as we transition to nonprofit.” Dean DeVito also said that he’d like to double or triple the size of the school — Coastal currently has 200 students — over the next three to four years.

Can Coastal do that without sacrificing the credentials of incoming students and their bar passage and employment prospects? Is that the right thing for the school’s students, alumni, and community? Yes, the school’s bar passage rates are climbing, but according to the school’s [most recent employment statistics](https://www.fcsl.edu/userfiles/files/FCSL%202017%20ABA%20Profile.pdf), just 40.8 percent of the class of 2017 found full-time, long-term jobs where bar passage was required.

Let’s see what happens when Florida Coastal School of Law announces who its proposed nonprofit partner is, aside from it being a “regional institution that is more than 100-years-old.” This seems to be a noble aspiration, but past is precedent with InfiLaw schools, which leaves room to take this news with a shaker of salt.

Yesterday, we wrote about [the new Vault 100 rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/vault-100-rankings-the-most-prestigious-law-firms-in-america-2018/) of the most prestigious firms in America. While the top 10 was mostly the same, one firm dropped out of the top 10 to make room for Weil Gotshal. What firm exited the top 10 this year?

Hint: This is really a test of your reading comprehension since we mentioned it in our earlier write up. But how well are you retaining your industry knowledge?

Who doesn’t love a good bonus announcement? It’s the perfect inspiration to keep associates happily billing with the promise of a big payday in the near future.

The good folks at Arnold & Porter understand that money can be a great motivator for associate productivity. That’s why in addition to the market bonuses, established by Milbank last month, the firm is offering extra money for their big billers. Associates will get 20 percent above the market rates if they’ve logged 2,400 hours, 2,200 of which is billable time, this year.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The firm’s bonus scale is as follows:

Class of 2019 – $15,000
Class of 2018 – $15,000
Class of 2017 – $25,000
Class of 2016 – $50,000
Class of 2015 – $65,000

You’ll notice the bonus grid at A&P drops off after 2015 while Biglaw bonus schedules tend to end with the classes of 2012 or 2011. According to the firm’s bonus announcement, senior associate bonuses will take into account market rates and well as productivity and other factors. Qualifying senior associates can expect to receive bonuses of up to $125,000.

Bonuses will be paid at the end of January. [ You can read the full memo on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/ap-bonus-2019/2/)

In the current corporate environment, where transparency and ethical conduct are paramount, in-house lawyers navigate the complex terrains of AI washing and greenwashing. These phenomena, though distinct—AI washing relates to artificial intelligence claims, and greenwashing to environmental sustainability—both involve misleading stakeholders about a company’s practices or capabilities. 

This confluence underscores the urgent need for in-house counsel to elevate legal advice and governance practices and embed actionable insights into their strategies.

#Understanding the Challenges
 AI Washing is the practice of overclaiming a company’s use of AI, suggesting a level of technological sophistication that doesn’t exist. The SEC’s focus on AI washing, evident from recent regulatory actions ([SEC Press Release](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2024-36?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery)), signals a crackdown on deceptive AI-related claims.

 

Greenwashing is misleading stakeholders about the environmental impact of a company’s products or practices. This practice is equally scrutinized, with regulatory bodies keen to enforce transparency and accuracy in environmental claims.

 

#Legal Implications and Governance Strategies
 

For in-house corporate lawyers, these issues are not just about legal compliance; they represent deeper ethical and governance challenges. Addressing them requires a multifaceted approach:

 

- Conduct Rigorous Verification: Before making public claims about AI capabilities or environmental impact, verify these claims in-depth. This involves internal reviews and potentially third-party validations to ensure credibility and compliance. Resources like the[ Environmental Protection Agency’s guidelines](https://www.epa.gov/greeningepa/greenwashing) on green marketing can provide valuable insights into establishing verification processes.
 

- Establish Clear Compliance Frameworks: Develop compliance frameworks that are robust and flexible enough to adapt to the rapidly evolving regulatory landscape surrounding AI and environmental claims. This includes creating policies that ensure all claims are substantiated and that there’s a clear chain of responsibility for this substantiation.
 

- Prioritize Transparent Communication: Develop a communication strategy that prioritizes transparency with stakeholders, including clear, accessible disclosures about how AI technologies or environmental practices are implemented. For AI transparency guidelines, referring to frameworks such as those proposed by the[ AI Now Institute](https://ainowinstitute.org/) can be beneficial.
#Actionable Insights for In-House Counsel
 

- Foster an Ethical Corporate Culture: Lead by example in promoting a culture that values integrity over marketing spin. Encourage departments across the company to prioritize factual accuracy and ethical considerations in their operations and external communications.
 

- Implement Ethical Guidelines and Training: Create and enforce ethical guidelines addressing AI and environmental claims. Organize regular training sessions for employees at all levels to ensure they understand the importance of these guidelines and how to apply them in their work.
 

- Stay Informed and Adaptive: The regulatory environment for AI and environmental claims is constantly changing. In-house counsel must stay informed about these developments and be ready to adapt corporate policies accordingly. Engaging with legal and industry-specific forums can provide early insights into regulatory trends and enforcement actions.
 

- Engage Stakeholders in Dialogue: Open lines of communication with stakeholders, including investors, customers, and regulatory bodies, to understand their concerns and expectations. This dialogue can inform more responsible and transparent practices and help avoid potential missteps.
 

- Leverage External Audits and Certifications: Consider third-party audits or certifications for your company’s AI systems and environmental practices. This not only adds credibility to your claims but also demonstrates a commitment to transparency and ethical practices.
 

- Document and Disclose Methodologies: Be open about the methodologies used to validate AI and environmental claims. Providing stakeholders with access to this information can enhance trust and mitigate skepticism.
 

By integrating these actionable insights into their strategies, in-house corporate lawyers can lead their companies to navigate the pitfalls of AI washing and greenwashing and champion a culture of transparency and ethical innovation. This proactive approach safeguards against regulatory risks and builds a foundation of trust and credibility with stakeholders, positioning the company as a leader in ethical corporate practice.

[Jason Mark Sims](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-sims-bb293115/), the Paul, Weiss staff attorney who pleaded guilty to distributing videos of child sex abuse, has been sentenced for his crimes. The charges against him were horrific — while at work he used his computer to engage in sexual explicit conversations about an undercover agent’s purported 10-year-old daughter. The chat transcript was an awful and damning piece of evidence against Sims:

Sims: Wow dude. Awesome. I’m terrified though.

Affiant: She has a real hot bod, 4’10” about 701bs. Good little slut. Lol

Sims: Jesus. Have you done this kind ofthing before? Is she really game?

Affiant: We have talked about bringing in another guy for a while. She loves it.

Sims: Nice. I’m so fucking hard thinking about that right now.

On Friday, Sims was sentenced to five years in prison and 10 years of supervised release. As[ reported by Law.com](https://www.law.com/sites/americanlawyer/2017/12/01/ex-paul-weiss-lawyer-gets-five-years-for-child-porn/), his punishment also includes a writing assignment, designed to help deter others:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Senior U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III in Alexandria, Virginia, handed down the sentence against Sims, 36, who was charged by federal prosecutors in August. As part of Sims’ sentence, Ellis has ordered him to write an article for publication about his crime in an “effort to achieve general deterrence,” [according to a statement](http://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/pr/lawyer-sentenced-distributing-videos-child-sexual-abuse) by the U.S. attorney’s office in Alexandria.

Five years is the mandatory minimum sentence for the crime Sims pleaded to. His lawyers, Judith Wheat and Donna Murphy, had requested the minimum sentence citing Sims’s lack of a previous criminal record, his pro bono work, and the recommendations of a certified sex offender treatment therapist and a forensic psychiatrist who characterize him as a low-risk repeat offender. In court documents, Wheat and Murphy also noted Sims’s history as a victim of childhood abuse and his remorse over his actions:

“While incarcerated he has read [victim] statements and with visible emotion he has struggled to make sense of the reasons he chose to act as he did,” wrote Wheat and Murphy. “This has not been an easy process for Mr. Sims and the effect of his choices on everyone—his wife, his son, the children in the videos—weighs heavily on him.”

Prosecutors in the case had sought the maximum sentence of between 97 to 121 months in prison.

# From Biglaw To Solo Practitioner To Author: Balancing A Fulfilling Legal Career With The Rest Of Your Life

At some point in your Biglaw career — buried between the deadlines, long hours and stress — you’ve probably fantasized about chucking it all for your dream job. While Jill Diamond’s career hasn’t featured a ‘take this job and shove it’ moment, she has managed to secure herself a fulfilling legal practice AND a successful creative outlet as a children’s book author. A balancing act Cirque du Soleil would be proud of.

In the latest episode of the Jabot podcast I chat with Jill about all the twists and turns her career has taken from her decision to go to law school, to Biglaw, to working as an attorney for [InCloudCounsel](http://incloudcounsel.com/), to how she landed her first book deal. Jill also gamely answers pressing questions about her first book, [Lou Lou and Pea and the Mural Mystery](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/125014373X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), from a very special guest, my niece Ruby Elizabeth, age 8.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wears when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

Jamie Spears should be removed as conservator because it is in [the] best interest of the conservatee. We will be moving promptly and aggressively for his removal. The question remains, why is he involved? He should step down voluntarily because that’s what’s in the best interest of the conservatee. My firm and I will be taking a top to bottom look at what’s happened over the past decade.

— [Matthew Rosengart](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/professionals/r/rosengart-mathew-s), a partner at Greenberg Traurig who is now representing Britney Spears in her conservatorship, in [comments given to the press](https://www.cnn.com/entertainment/live-news/britney-spears-conservatorship-hearing-07-14-21/index.html) outside the courthouse following her latest hearing. Rosengart is a veteran entertainment law litigator, and has been [referred to](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/11/arts/music/britney-spears-lawyer-mathew-rosengart.html) by client Sean Penn as “a tough as nails streetfighter with a big brain and bigger principles.”

Thanks to the growth of cannabis industry, Biglaw seems to be going up in smoke. While several firms have already joined the practice area, we’re told that one of the most prominent law firms in the world has decided to take a hit of the good stuff.

DLA Piper is launching a global cannabis law practice thanks to a “number of large cannabis regulatory advisory mandates,” and hopes to reap the benefits of the rapidly budding, billion-dollar industry. [Law.com](https://www.law.com/2020/02/21/dla-piper-latest-firm-to-join-booming-cannabis-trend-292-61997/) has the details:

The group will sit within the wider life sciences sector at the firm, and will be headed up by Toronto-based corporate partner Robert Fonn and London senior associate Dylan Kennett.

They will be supported by a team of 70 other lawyers and support staff in more than 15 countries across the firm’s network.

Kennett said in a statement: “With the likes of Canada leading the way in liberalizing cannabis in a considered manner, it was only a matter of time before other countries looked to Canada’s example on how best to similarly regulate their own markets.”

We’re sure that associates won’t want to puff, puff, pass on billable hours for the greenest practice area around. Congratulations to DLA Piper on its progressive new practice group.

We get so wrapped up in the Am Law 50 market we sometimes forget that attorneys are living rich, full careers at regional firms — firms like Allen Matkins out in California. The firm has five offices and over 200 attorneys but stays local so they don’t end up on our East Coast Bias radar all that often.

But the firm just announced its new comp structure including bonuses and a 401k match that should be music to the ears of their crew.

Under the new system, first-years receive a $170K base with bonuses ranging from $5K at 1900 hours, $15K at 1950, $20K at 2000, and $25K at 2050+. This still puts associates slightly behind the pace set by the Am Law elite, but it’s good money and paired with a San Diego beachfront view is more than amazing.

But more awesome is the firm’s 401k matching program. It’s a perk that a lot of corporate America is accustomed to that firms have disturbingly lagged behind on. But as someone who got to take advantage of it at a boutique firm in my career, it’s an incredible feature. Allen Matkins is offering up to 3 percent of the associate’s annual comp as a 401k match. That may not seem like much today, but 5 or 6 thousand bucks today can mean a lot come retirement.

Congrats to the whole Allen Matkins gang.

# Jones Day Gender Discrimination Case Spreads To New York
## A former New York associate comes forward.

The lawsuit filed by former Jones Day associates just keeps on getting bigger. The[ lawsuit,](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/jones-day-facing-second-class-action-lawsuit-over-fraternity-culture-of-the-firm/) initially filed by two named plaintiffs and four anonymous Jane Doe plaintiffs, alleges there’s a “fraternity culture” at the firm, and the firm’s notorious “[black box](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/)” compensation system is used to pay women less than men at the firm. [Earlier this month](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/gender-discrimination-lawsuit-against-jones-day-gets-yet-another-plaintiff/?rf=1), an additional lawyer — Jessica Jardine Wilkes, who now works in-house at Facebook — joined the case after spending time working at the firm’s Menlo Park, California, office.

The latest former associate to opt into the case is notable in that she’s the first to come forward who worked at Jones Day’s New York office. As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/06/21/amazon-attorney-tags-on-to-jones-day-gender-bias-suit/) American Lawyer, Katrina Henderson spent over two years at the firm before leaving for a job in-house:

Unlike the two named plaintiffs and two of the anonymous plaintiffs behind the April complaint, Katrina Henderson did not practice in Jones Day’s California offices. According to her LinkedIn profile and state bar records, she was an associate at the firm’s New York office from October 2013 to July 2016 before joining Pixar Animation Studios in August 2016. Earlier this month, she moved from Pixar to Amazon Studios in Santa Monica, California.

Currently, plaintiffs and defendant are clashing over whether the four Jane Doe plaintiffs should get to remain anonymous. While [the firm is arguing](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/jones-day-wants-gender-discrimination-plaintiffs-to-reveal-themselves-to-the-public/) the women should be forced to be names, as a plaintiff in any other lawsuit would have to do, plaintiffs take the position they should be allowed to remain Jane Does for the duration of the litigation, and in a recent filing one Doe plaintiff analogized her role to that of whistleblower.

## The firm successfully avoided layoffs by cutting salaries.

[Despite the layoffs ](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/layoffs/)(largely impacting [staff](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/layoffs-come-to-cleary-gottlieb/)) that seem to be making the rounds in Biglaw, there is a lot of good news too. A lot of firms took a conservative financial approach to the pandemic, cutting expenses — including salaries — where possible. Now that they have a better sense of their 2020 economic outlook, a lot of firms are reversing course on those cuts.

The latest firm to undo their COVID-19 austerity measures is Holland & Hart.

[Back in May,](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/covid-19-salary-cuts-are-still-a-thing-in-biglaw/?rf=1) the equity partnership’s profit distribution was reduced. And salaried attorneys are also took a hit to their paycheck — to the tune of a 15 percent reduction. Employees making between $60,000 and $99,999 had their compensation reduced by 5 percent — those making under $60,000 were not impacted by the reductions. Plus the employer portion of the 401(k) matching program was suspended.

But now the firm has announced that because of a stronger than anticipated financial performance, all employees will return to their full 2020 salaries, and the 401(k) program is being reinstated. The firm also announced that because of these measures, they were able to avoid layoffs during the pandemic.

Plus, there are bonuses afoot, as Holland & Hart announced, “The firm has reserved a significant bonus pool to reward at the end of the year those staff and lawyers who contribute to the firm at a high level.”

The firm made the following statement on the end of their austerity measures:

Since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Holland & Hart’s business decisions have been driven by our core values—our commitment to our people and our dedication to deliver excellent service to our clients.

In response to the economic disruption and uncertainty caused by the pandemic, last May, Holland & Hart proactively implemented several fiscal adjustments to offset anticipated revenue declines. Although the firm had one of its strongest financial years in 2019, and an equally robust start in the first quarter of this year, these measures were taken to protect our people and the short- and long-term business interests of the firm. Compensation cutbacks, combined with significant expense-saving and expense deferral initiatives, allowed the firm to avoid any layoffs.

After a significantly strong financial performance the past few months, we are pleased to announce that effective this month, the firm will return all employees to their full 2020 salaries and 401(k) matching contributions will be reinstated. The firm’s third quarter profit distribution to equity partners was restored in full. Finally, the firm has reserved a significant bonus pool to reward at the end of the year those staff and lawyers who contribute to the firm at a high level.

We are grateful to the incredible dedication of our lawyers and staff who continue to demonstrate resilience and a willingness to adapt to change. More than ever, we value our relationships with our clients and appreciate the trust and confidence they have placed in our firm as we have all embraced ways to connect and work together in these challenging circumstances.

# Law Firm Responds To Data Breach Claim By... Leaking Data. Checkmate!
## Do you have the expression 'hat on a hat'?

Law firms must always be supremely cautious with private information, but you can’t help but think a firm would add that little extra attention to the task when their client has already been sued for a data breach. Not only would another leak damage the client’s reputation further, you already know that the plaintiff is exactly the sort of person willing to sue over leaks.

Goldberg Segalla finds itself on the wrong end of a lawsuit after Stephanie Hoffman, the plaintiff in a putative class action against Goldberg client Major Model Management for a breach that “exposed their personal information, including place of birth, date of birth, nationality, permanent address, cell number, email address, Social Security number, signature, passport numbers and actual copies of Social Security cards and passports,” [according to Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/1387769).

But in its motion to dismiss, Goldberg filed an agreement that contained Hoffman’s Social Security numbers, birthdate, addresses, telephone numbers, and pictures of her passport without any redaction. Everything a growing identity thief needs!

A partially redacted version was filed, but Hoffman argues that the new redactions still included problematic disclosures and that the unredacted version remained accessible for almost two months after filing.

Not to prejudge this claim, but… this was an exhibit to a motion to dismiss?!? Botching a redaction in the course of processing millions of pages of discovery is a problem but at least understandable. This is an exhibit to a motion that, by its nature, doesn’t generally require a lot of documents outside the four corners of the complaint. Whatever’s getting attached to this thing is something you’d expect the defense to be very confident is absolutely necessary. The sort of document that the attorneys should realize is riddled with the same information that the whole original lawsuit is about!

Maybe there were technical glitches that caused the redaction failure. Not that it makes it all right, but at least it wouldn’t be a matter of dropping the ball.

# Shhh! How To Actually Keep A Secret

As every lawyer knows, no one keeps a secret.

Protective orders are protective sieves. Information produced under a protective order today is leaked to the Times tomorrow.

Non-disclosure agreements are invitations to boast. After Smith signs the non-disclosure agreement, he promptly calls his old high school buddy to report that Smith is privy to the following inside information . . . .

Everybody talks.

If you want to keep a secret, don’t tell anyone.

Maybe that will work.

If you must tell someone, tell the fewest number of people necessary to achieve your goal.

Unfortunately, that means that you must tell someone.

Suppose that a person who knows a secret (and is sworn not to disclose it) is asked about that subject. How should someone who’s under the tent keep from disclosing information to someone who’s not under the tent?

For example, someone who doesn’t yet know your secret asks: “I read in the newspaper yesterday that we’re planning to buy BigCo. Are we?”

How should the person who wants to keep the secret (even though the information has already been leaked to the press) respond?

The natural reaction is to respond the braggart’s way: “I’m not at liberty to tell you anything about that.”

You’ve proved your superiority! You know about the deal. You’ve implicitly disclosed that the deal is being discussed internally and thus may occur. Yet, you tell yourself, you haven’t breached your non-disclosure obligation because you haven’t revealed anything confidential.

Poppycock.

You’re not allowed to respond to this question the braggart’s way; you must respond the way a person who’s trying to keep a secret would respond. Thus:

“I read in the newspaper yesterday that we’re planning to buy BigCo. Are we?”

“BigCo? I saw those press reports, too, but I don’t know anything about it. I haven’t heard a peep.”

I know, I know: If you answer this way, you haven’t proved that you’re a big shot, with knowledge of inside information.

But you’ve done what you promised to do: You’ve actually kept the secret. You haven’t told the questioner, implicitly or otherwise, that the deal is being discussed. You’ve simply lied (as you’re required to do), saying that you don’t know anything about it, leaving the questioner with no new information.

I understand that this doesn’t implicitly brag, or implicitly give away information, or do any of the other stuff that you’re itching to do. You know a secret! You want to show that you’re special!

But saying that you don’t know anything about a subject is the only way to keep the secret, and that is, after all, what you promised to do.

[[Reuters](http://reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1310NM)] * With apologies to Judge Garland, the only thing that seems to remain certain is that Senate Republicans are firm in their stance that they'll continue to prevent the late Justice Antonin Scalia's seat on the Supreme Court from being filled. Senator John McCain, for example, asked supporters to re-elect him so he can assist his GOP brethren in ""prevent[ing] that four-to-four split from tilting to the left.""

# Biglaw Partner's Emotional Outburst In Russia Probe
## Not what you'd expect from a Biglaw partner in open court.

Reed Smith partner [Eric Dubelier’s](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/eric-dubelier/) representation of Concord Management and Consulting, the company owned by Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin that was indicted as part of the probe by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, has seemingly devolved into farce. As a recap, Dubelier has [already been benchslapped](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/judge-benchslaps-biglaw-partner-bagging-on-the-mueller-investigation/) by the sitting judge — and Trump appointee no less — Dabney Friedrich of the District of Columbia for what she called “unprofessional, inappropriate, and ineffective” comments — a move [he didn’t take kindly to.](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/eric-dubelier/)

The latest development in the case is no less contentious. At a hearing in the case earlier today Judge Friedrich indicated there was a strong likelihood that Concord Management failed to comply with the government’s subpoena. As [reported by](https://www.courthousenews.com/us-judge-weighs-contempt-charge-against-russian-firm/) Courthouse News, Dubelier’s reaction was more akin to an emotional outburst:

Accusing the judge of taking a tone that suggests that the defense counsel is engaged in something “sneaky,” Dubelier pounded his fist on the lectern.

“I am not! I am not!” the lawyer said, his voice shaking.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Assistant U.S. Attorney Adam Jed’s concerns about Concord’s compliance preceded Dubelier’s emotional response, when he said, “We are starting to have some concerns about whether Concord is participating in this case.” To which Dubelier had a predictably forceful response, “It’s bogus… It’s a ridiculous argument.”

Friedrich’s response was described as “calmly wav[ing] off Dubelier’s accusations” of favoritism.

In the document dispute, Dubelier said that Concord produced all documents in its possession. However, Judge Friedrich said that the assurances of production must come from a Concord employee, as Dubelier, “cannot fill that role here, clearly.”

Jed questioned the adequacy of an affidavit to signal compliance, particularly given the weight of the accusations against Concord, “It gives us pause … that they are just going to write something down and give it to the U.S. government.” Jed urged the court to hold Concord in contempt. In the interim, Friedrich ordered Concord to submit an affidavit from someone at Concord describing the steps it took to search for the requested records by 5 p.m. on Wednesday.

Who says Biglaw is slumping? Sure, *some* firms have laid off associates or delayed the start date for newbies, but Quinn Emanuel is bringing back the salary wars!

Today the firm announced special fall bonuses for associates. They start at a few thousand dollars for junior associates billing between 2000 and 2099 hours and the scale goes up to $32,908 for senior associates billing a boatload of hours  (2700+).

Take a look at the full scale, as [reported by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/10/16/at-quinn-emanuel-special-fall-bonuses-run-as-high-as-32908/) Law.com:

2000-2099 hours	2100-2399 hours	2400-2699 hours	2700 and above hours
Class of 2016 and more senior	$16,251	 $24,377	 $29,252	 $32,908
Class of 2017	$14,838	$22,257	 $26,708	$30,047
Class of 2018	$12,718	$19,077	$22,893	$25,754
Class of 2019	$10,599	$15,898	$19,077	$21,462
Class of 2020	$8,126	$12,188	$14,626	$16,454
Class of 2021	$4,239	$6,359	$7,631	$8,585
Class of 2022	$2,826	$4,239	$5,087	$5,723
Class of 2023	$2,120	$3,180	$3,815	$4,292
For those billing under 2000 hours,  bonuses will be “reduced proportionally.”

These special bonuses aren’t typical — at Quinn or other firms. But 2023 is a good year at the firm.

The special fall bonuses are “unusual for us, although there have been times in the past where we’ve distributed additional bonuses,” said firm founder and partner John Quinn. “The firm is having a fabulous year…We could not have accomplished what we accomplished without the dedication and intelligence and talent of our associates, and we wanted to share some of the bounty with them.”

Congrats to Quinn associates — let’s see what other firms decide to match.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

# A Compressed Raise Is Better Than No Raise

It’s never too late for more salary news! But these associate pay raises don’t take effect until September 1, two full months after most of their peers started cashing their big checks. Curtis Mallet has announced raises (though they’ve been confirmed multiple times, there is not yet a formal memo), beginning with the celebrated $180,000 salary for first years.

But starting with fifth-year associates, midlevel and seniors are making below market:

Curtis Mallet matched market salary for 1-4 years. Highly compressed scale after that.

180
190
210
235
245
255
260
265 (tops out)

Summers will get the new salary too.

It was shared informally a few weeks ago, and will be effective Sept 1.

But the general sense from tipsters is that though the pay scale is compressed, they are relieved to be getting any money at all:

I’m not sure what the scale looks like beyond first year, but it’s my understanding that Curtis already had some salary compression beginning with fifth-years. I’d suspect that there will still be compression from the “MoneyLaw” scale, but we were all uncertain whether there would be any raises. So the announcement was a pleasant surprise for all.

That’s a nice healthy attitude, but I suspect there are plenty of Curtis associates out there — particularly those high billers — who are less sanguine.

Over the last 20 years, the largest Biglaw bonuses were in 2007. How much did first-year associates on the Cravath scale take home in bonus money that year?

Hint: While [this year’s $15,000 ](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/cravath-announces-bonuses-now-the-2019-bonus-season-can-really-begin/)for first-year associates is nice, it pales in comparison to the pre-recession 2007 bonuses.

# Another Firm Raises Salaries For First-Year Associates Only
## $180,000 for first-year associates does not, necessarily, mean the firm has matched Cravath.

Looks like there is another firm hoping to get a recruiting boost by only raising first-year salaries to $180,000, while older associates are left hopeful they’ll see more money as part of the annual review process.

Boston-based Foley Hoag is the firm making the leap on first-year compensation for their New York, Boston, and DC offices — though it is only effective six months after most firms are raising salaries, on January 1. According to the memo sent to associates from the executive committee, there will be other adjustments made to older associate’s base compensation as part of their yearly review.

[Another reminder](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/no-you-are-not-matching-the-market-1st-years-to-180k-doesnt-tell-the-whole-story/?rf=1) to law students tempted by Foley Hoag’s [enjoyable summer associate program](http://www.foleyhoag.com/our-firm/rankings-and-accolades), understand the $180,000 does not, necessarily, mean the firm has matched Cravath. It is something to be aware of before you’re a third-year associate jealously looking at your friend’s salary at a peer firm.

We are covering this story as market conditions develop, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Say you’re working in-house at a prominent, profitable company, and you’ve got a major legal problem on your hands. To make matters even worse, the world is facing down a pandemic. It’s a bet-the-company case, and you’re not quite sure which law firm to choose to handle the issue. You turn to a colleague for advice, and luckily enough, they’re ready to make a recommendation to you on the spot thanks to one firm’s superior client service.

Unprompted recommendations from legal decision makers in the corporate world are like liquid gold for law firms. Just one unprompted recommendation can lead to an attorney/client relationship that can last for decades, prompting more and more such recommendations, leading to more and more satisfied clients (not to mention more and more money for the recommended law firms).

But which law firms receive the most unprompted recommendations? Thanks to a [new report](https://bticonsulting.com/themadclientist/clients-recommend-140-law-firms-above-all-others) that was just released by BTI Consulting Group, we now know.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Before we get to that, let’s delve into some of the details from the report. According to BTI, the power of the recommendation is a real success driver for outside counsel. Why’s that? Here’s some pertinet information from BTI Consulting Group’s [Mad Clientist](https://bticonsulting.com/themadclientist/clients-recommend-140-law-firms-above-all-others) blog:

Virtually every top legal decision maker looks to peer recommendations when first thinking of hiring a new law firm. Up to 64% of these decision makers hires the first firm recommended — even if this firm is recommended just once — hence the power of the unprompted recommendation. …

Superior client service is consistently the leading driver of law firm recommendations by General Counsel. Superior service accounts for nearly 4 times more recommendations (75%) than any other single factor.

Without any further ado, these are the 11 firms that have been the [most recommended by corporate counsel](https://bticonsulting.com/themadclientist/clients-recommend-140-law-firms-above-all-others) in 2021 (in alphabetical order):

Arnold & Porter
King & Spalding
DLA Piper
Latham & Watkins
Eversheds Sutherland
Littler
Foley & Lardner
McDermott Will & Emery
Gibson Dunn
McGuireWoods
Jones Day

A dedication to superior client service has essentially been baked into the firm culture at the most recommended firms. In an interview with [Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/1405186/these-are-the-11-firms-gcs-most-recommend-in-2021) (sub. req.), BTI president Michael Rynowecer said, “Most law firms responded well to client needs during the pandemic, but some were just exceptional. If you’re going to recommend a law firm to appear in an unprompted manner that requires an investment of your personal stamp of approval, you’re not going to make that as a corporate counsel or top legal decision maker unless you have very high confidence and tremendous respect combined for these firms.”

Congratulations to all of the firms that have been recommended by their corporate clients during these unpredecented times. If you want your firm to someday be among those on this list, then it would be a good idea to encourage attorneys to intimately get to know your clients’ business, and then show them how deep your understanding of their business really is — after all, that’s all they really want from their attorneys. Try it out sometime and reap the rewards.

# The Future Of Legal Technology Is Here With Lexis+
## The world of data-driven insights is really exciting, and Lexis+ helps answer the important questions that need to be answered.

There’s no question that law and technology are inextricably intertwined. As new demands and unexpected uncertainties continue to arise, the industry’s need for advanced technology continues to grow. 

LexisNexis, a pioneer in the legal tech space, is meeting that need with the introduction of its comprehensive new solution, [Lexis+](https://bit.ly/3kiQLJ5). We recently sat down with Jeff Pfeifer, Chief Product Officer of LexisNexis, North America to discuss how Lexis+ is leading the industry into the future of legal technology.

Can you give us some background on why you created Lexis+?

We began engaging with clients on the concept of Lexis+ about a year and a half ago, speaking with over 2,000 clients about some broad ideas we had. Ultimately, those conversations led us to identify three key themes that became the reason for building Lexis+. 

First, our clients wanted a better user experience in legal products. We regularly heard comments like, “I understand that we’re working in a professional product, but do legal products have to be so dull and boring?” Second, our clients wanted to see tighter integrations and connections between the products we previously offered on a stand-alone basis. The third really big idea that actually predated all of this work by five to seven years was the notion that law was, relative to some other industries, less positioned to leverage data in driving decisions. 

So, as we began to iterate our product concept for Lexis+, we really sought to address each one of those major themes. We wanted to build a modern user experience that compares with any product experience in a consumer environment, while providing better integrations and data-driven insights.

Are there any specific pain points Lexis+ was designed to address?

The themes I just mentioned intersect with a longer-term trend and bigger-picture problem that all major technology suppliers are seeing – namely that the proliferation of information and data from numerous sources is at the largest point it’s ever been, and it’s growing at an increasing rate. 

Traditional functions like search, which have really been at the center of how our customers have interacted with our products for a long time, increasingly have limitations. So we’re also thinking about how a user five years from now will interact with data in very different ways than they do today. Many of those ideas are in Lexis+. 

How does Lexis+ fit into the existing LexisNexis universe of products? 

It’s designed to be part of that universe and also introduce new benefits to the user. As an example, a user in Lexis+ might start an activity in the Legal Research experience of the product and then be guided to additional insights or information in our Practical Guidance experience. Our goal for Lexis+ is for the user to think less about the individual products we offer and more about the questions they’re trying to answer or the tasks they’re trying to accomplish. Lexis+ is designed to help guide them to the best possible insights wherever they exist in the product experience. 

While you might enter fairly straightforward search terms, we’ll increasingly introduce you to other content sets and even analytics. The underlying idea is that data-driven insights help you understand not only that you have to do something like draft a motion, but that you also have to think about whether your motion strategy is appropriate for the business situation you’re addressing. 

Are there any particular features of Lexis+ you’d like to highlight?

In total, there are 12 new feature capabilities that are exclusive to the Lexis+ experience and brand new in the legal market. I’ll highlight a couple.

First, in the area of data-driven insights, Brief Analysis allows you to upload a document and get guided recommendations of additional documents that would add valuable research and strengthen your legal arguments. What’s unique about the application in Lexis+ is the custom machine learning models we built to power the recommendation capability. It really helps users feel more confident that they have, in fact, exhausted their research – that they’ve avoided missing that proverbial needle in the haystack.

In Lexis+, we’ve also emphasized the use of data visualization as an alternative to help users understand relationships between or among documents that they might not notice in a standard text result view. We’ve introduced data visualization capabilities throughout the product experience. We’ve enhanced Ravel View, which is a data visualization that shows citing connections between documents. We’ve found that, in a standard search interaction in Lexis, users typically don’t engage past the 12th document, even though relevant results don’t stop there. But with data visualization capabilities, we regularly see users interacting with the 50th or the 60th document in the result list, and that’s driven by the visual presentation of the connections between those documents. 

Another extensive use of data visualization is in Code Compare, which allows you to see how a statute or administrative code has changed over time. We illustrate visually through addition and deletion markups what’s happened as a statute has been amended over time. 

Our Lexis Answers® product is designed to allow the user to enter a fully-formed question into the search box and get a direct answer. This is an early version of what’s likely to happen with search over time – users will begin to engage with a service like Lexis+ in a more human-like way, with it eventually becoming a dialogue.

In parallel within our Practical Guidance experience, we’ve deployed a number of machine learning capabilities that allow users to mine very large data sets of contracts, find the market standards for a transaction, and review that information in a visual and summary-based way. Collectively, all these technologies help users get insights out of data in ways they never could before with traditional text-based search results.

Finally, we wanted to address the “fear of a black box” – with machine learning, users typically don’t understand what’s happening in the background. We’ve worked hard in Lexis+ to introduce some features that allow users to maintain control of the search experience. One is called Search Tree, which allows users to see visually how a search was interpreted and make modifications to that search to ensure they’re getting the results they’re looking for. The other is called Missing and Must Include. It allows users to force specific terms or ideas to be included in their results. 

Why do lawyers need Lexis+?

Legal users are clamoring for experiences like those they use in their consumer lives, and they’ll have that in [Lexis+](https://bit.ly/3kiQLJ5). Also, tools that were previously separated are now tightly integrated in a way that gives users much better guidance and recommendations about how to answer key legal questions. Finally, the world of data-driven insights is really exciting, and Lexis+ helps answer the important questions that need to be answered, faster than ever before.

# Biglaw Partner Makes Up For Being A Jerk By Getting Texas Employees Access To A Plumber
## Plumbers are in demand, so Kirkland has a plan.

Last we checked in with Kirkland & Ellis’s [Andy Calder](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/andy-calder/), a partner and member of the firm’s global management committee, it was early in the pandemic (May 2020) and [he sent a biting email to associates in the firm’s Houston office](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/partner-shows-all-the-compassion-youd-expect-from-biglaw-read-none-at-all/). The email scolded folks that they need to keep churning out billable hours and that the firm “isn’t a gravy train where you can just chill and be along for the ride” and that “the math is not going to work out well for you at the end of the year.” We (rightly, to my mind) chided Calder for his stark lack of compassion as most folks were and are simply doing the best they can to get through during the global freaking pandemic.

In the wake of the Texas winter weather-pocalypse, it seems Calder is showing a kinder side. Freezing temperatures and snow across Texas last week led to massive blackouts and loss of heat, which, in turn begot freezing and burst pipes. That put a premium on plumbing services, and Kirkland is stepping up to make sure employees are able to access a plumber in their time of need. As a tipster at the firm noted, “For all those who wanted to rag on Calder for the gravy train email….this is what hes [sic] really about.”

So what did the email, sent to all employees in the Houston office, say:

Appreciate that many folks in Houston have burst pipes and can’t find a plumber for love nor money. That doesn’t work, so we have managed to procure a plumber to prioritize Kirkland employees at a slightly reduced rate over the coming days. Essentially we have put him on retainer for the firm.

Employees are instructed to reach out to the partner, who isn’t Calder (or his assistants) that facilitated the hookup, and they’ll be put on the top of the plumber’s list. “Should be same day or worst case next day service. You will be invoiced a reduced amount, then we will pick up the rest.” Which is a nice perk, any way you slice it.

But folks are also advised not to share the offer beyond the “Kirkland family” in order to not “blow availability for colleagues.” (As Kirkland-ites are advised to schedule the plumbing appointments through the firm’s contacts, it’s unclear how this would even work.) I mean, sure, maybe your grandma desperately needs water, but she’s not going to bill for the firm, is she?

# Looking For A Cool JD Advantage Gig? Have You Considered TikTok?
## If only you knew how hard it was for me to not make any ‘recipe for success’ jokes.

Joanne Lee Mulinaro, a former law firm partner better known as the Korean Vegan, is one of those people who lives an impossible life that everyone on social media watches and envies. But in the good way. This former law firm partner managed to exchange billable hours and clients for boiling water and conversation. And it’s a total hat trick. She’s getting paid to 1) cook amazing food, 2) foster community as she shares stories from her life, and 3) dunk on Trumpsters in a way that almost makes Civil Procedure seem cool, all without having to attend after-hours firm parties in Manhattan.

As a 1L, I would hear that you don’t have to practice law just because you have a JD. In part because it’s true. Career Services may have also known that I dropped out of the running for Order of the Coif early on. Besides that, this is proof that thinking like a lawyer could be a set up for something other than Compliance work. There’s still hope to do something that people give a radish’s ass about. Maybe it’s cooking. Maybe it’s singing. Maybe it’s bringing back fingerless gloves. I hope not, but it’s possible. And if you’re looking for inspiration in the meantime, check out Ms. Mulinaro’s vids on incorporating ecological awareness and cultural preservation into your noodles. Maybe even on company time. And if you’ve been thinking about lateraling out, include your TikTok handle on your resume just to be safe.

# Magic Circle Firm Employing Technology To Make Certain Associates Are In The Office
## This is very much the new normal.

[Fresh off the news](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/01/another-major-law-firm-goes-full-big-brother-to-enforce-office-attendance-policy/) that Slaughter & May is checking up on associates to ensure they’re adhering to the office attendance policy, Magic Circle firm Clifford Chance is being outed for a similar policy. The firm requires an in-office presence 50% of the time — or five days every two weeks — and the firm will be using surveillance to make sure it’s all on the up and up.

As a firm spokesperson [told Roll on Friday](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/clifford-chance-latest-monitor-office-attendance):

“To help our managers better understand and support their team’s adherence to our hybrid working policy, from 1st February 2024, the firm will start to review data of individual attendance in London and Newcastle.”

The spokeswoman also confirmed that CC is sticking with its flexible working policy: “We regularly review our approach to hybrid working and continue to believe that our current UK policy in of working from the office at least 50% over a two week period is right for our business, our clients and people.”

She added: “We know from our own experience and employee feedback that when consistently applied, our hybrid working policy provides our people a greater opportunity to learn, develop and collaborate with colleagues and clients thereby supporting our growth ambitions and enhancing the culture of the firm.”

[I’ve said it before](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/01/donald-trumps-legal-team-decides-not-to-ask-permission-or-forgiveness/): if your firm has an attendance policy you should ASSUME they’re using whatever technology they have at their disposal to make sure butts are in chairs at the office.

# Biglaw Firm Announces Raises, Special Bonuses At The Same Time

Today’s lateral market is hotter than fire, and to keep associates happy, it’s best to stay on market in terms of compensation, and that means raising salaries and offering special bonuses too. One firm got the memo, and made a well-received announcement about cash comp yesterday afternoon.

Cozen O’Connor — a firm that brought in $530,875,000 gross revenue in 2020, placing it at No. 74 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking —  notified associates yesterday that everyone would be receiving a raise.

Please note the UPDATE below.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Starting salaries at the firm will be getting a $20,000 boost, but that’s not all. On top of that, department chairs will be permitted to “increase base compensation paid to the Associates and Counsel for the balance of 2021 in an amount up to the increase in starting salary,” effective July 1, 2021. Attorneys will find out their new salaries in a personal memo sometime today. But wait, there’s more good news. Associates and counsel will also be receiving a special bonus by the end of the year that will be paid in addition to, and not in lieu of, their year-end bonuses.

The firm knows all too well that this is a hot lateral market, and they want to be able to both retain and recruit as many associates as they can. Here’s an excerpt from the memo, sent by [Michael Heller](https://www.cozen.com/people/bios/heller-michael), the firm’s executive chairman and CEO:

Our ultimate goal is a compensation system which is reflective of the markets in which we operate and incentivizes productivity and rewards great lawyering, while at the same time recognizes the importance of work life balance and, therefore, your mental health and well-being.   Work/life balance has always been an essential component of our culture, and we intend to keep it that way. …

Our primary objective is to have happy, healthy and productive lawyers.  We have no interest in being an up or out firm for people that don’t “make their hours.”  Those with significant production should expect market based compensation, while those with less can still be rewarded extremely well for their efforts.  We are confident that the increased flexibility being given to the Department Chairs will provide permit both of those options.

Sources we’ve heard from at the firm seem quite pleased, so it seems like Cozen has accomplished its goal of keeping associates happy.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
UPDATE (2:15 p.m.): Scratch that. Not everyone is happy with these raises. Here’s some anonymous intel from insiders at the firm, who are not at all satisfied with this compensation news. Perhaps people were confused, and thought they’d all be receiving $20K raises? Yikes! But on the other side of the coin, some associates really are happy with the compensation scene at the firm. Take a look.

- “I want to be very very clear, not a single associate, myself included, is happy with this announcement. This is a fumbled, vague response to a growing problem at Cozen, we are paid below market and the gap between Cozen associates and associates at other firms only widens as we progress in our careers because the compensation increases are wildly low and out of step with the market. This email from the CEO does nothing to resolve those concerns, but doubles down on the same policies that have led to a lack of transparency.”
- “No one is happy. Compare this announcement to the announcement of other firms. By Cozen’s announcement, you do not know what the increases are for any attorney at the firm other than first-year associates. Again, the problem is the massive gap between ourselves and our peers at other firms…that problem is, and will remain, unaddressed. I know of associates sending out resumes today. I assure you that associates are mostly unhappy.”
- “These comments do not represent the Cozen associate thoughts as a whole. Many of us think that the firm is working to compensate us fairly. As Heller’s email indicates, the Cozen culture, lifestyle and the other intangible benefits of working at the firm outweigh the compensation differences between Cozen and other Am Law 100 firms.”
Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

# Law Firms Should Remember To Back Up Data
## It's a nightmare waiting to happen. To you. At any time. Day or night.

Last week, the firm management system that my firm uses to handle our data was down for a few hours. This is not unusual, but the time it took for the system to return to normal was worrying, and I realized during this period how much my firm (and most other law firms) relies on firm management systems, and how difficult it might be to recover billable hour entries, accounting information, and other such data if the system failed. Law firms should do more to back up and secure data in case there is a catastrophic loss of information.

I first experienced a data loss as a lawyer when I was working as an associate for a large law firm earlier in my career. One day, I logged into the firm’s time entry system to finalize my billing for the month. All of the month’s entries were gone, which was not disconcerting at first. I believed that the data was probably just temporarily gone because one of the law firm’s systems was down, and that soon enough, I would be able to access the entries again.

The next day, a firm-wide meeting was announced by email. I had no idea what the meeting was about, and I did not think that the meeting related to my data loss. As it turns out, because of a glitch, the entire firm lost everyone’s billing entries for an entire month! This was very disconcerting to people at the firm since managers disciplined attorneys regularly for not submitting billing entries by arbitrary deadlines, and management could not even be trusted to keep everyone’s data secure.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The firm gave everyone one week to recreate their time entries for the preceding month. To help everyone along, the firm provided information about everyone’s activity in the previous month, including logs showing calls that had been made by every attorney. It was extremely difficult to recreate the time entries. Looking at my calendar, I was able to recreate court appearances as well as deposition attendances, and I used start times and end times for such appearances to record the time. By checking emails, I was able to tell which projects I worked on each day, and by reviewing documents, I was also able to see what materials I prepared in the preceding month.

The recreation was not perfect. When I was done, I had recorded 10 to 15 hours less than originally. It seems that other people at the firm were in a similar situation, since it is impossible for attorneys to remember and record everything that they did in the preceding month after the fact. The firm did its best to ensure that this data issue did not impact lawyers at the law firm too harshly. The firm said that billable hour requirements would only be assessed on a pro rata for the 11 months of the year for which there was not a data issue unless the lawyer wanted the recreated month counted. However, the firm never compensated people for the hours of extra labor they needed to spend in order to fix the data loss.

It surprised me that a law firm that had hundreds of lawyers did not back up its data or otherwise avoid this issue. In any case, this situation should be a cautionary tale for other law firms on why it is important to back up data and take other steps to ensure data losses are not too harmful to a law firm. Each lawyer can think of how difficult it would be for them to operate if they lost billable hour entries, documents, or other information associated with a law firm. Taking some precautionary measures can save law firms a substantial amount of heartache if lawyers experience a data breach.

# 'Maximum Damage': Law Firm Partners Learn The Hard Way Never To Put Offensive Things In Writing
## It's impossible not to look at this law firm train wreck.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

This is about as bad as it gets when it comes to negative publicity. You don’t often see this level of misogynistic, racist and antisemitic content because people—even horrible people—know better than to put things in writing. The timing of it all, not just for John Barber and Jeff Ranen, but for the dozens of attorneys and staff who followed them to start the new firm, is atrocious.

— Zach Olsen, president of PR firm Infinite Global, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/06/05/barber-ranen-founding-partners-resign-following-disclosure-of-misogynistic-racist-emails/) on the [trove of offensive emails](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/barber-ranen-resign-racist-sexist-antisemitic-emails/) that served as the undoing of Barber Ranen about a month after the firm was first formed after breaking away from Lewis Brisbois. Joshua Peck, owner and founder of Joshua Peck Legal Communications, also gave his thoughts to [Am Law](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/06/05/barber-ranen-founding-partners-resign-following-disclosure-of-misogynistic-racist-emails/), and said of the situation that “it would appear Lewis Brisbois wants to do the maximum damage” since it was reportedly the firm’s PR team that sent Barber’s and Ranen’s antisemitic email exchanges to the Forward, a newspaper that covers of issues of note for the Jewish community.

## This was worth the wait.

Last Friday, one of the top-ranked Biglaw firms in the country started a trend that would rock the industry in terms of 2021 associate compensation.

Willkie — a firm that brought in $868,000,000 gross revenue in 2019, placing it at No. 49 on the latest Am Law 100 ranking — announced that it would be [offering special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/willkie-spring-bonuses-2021/) to its associates for all of the hard work they put in during the especially trying times that were created by the pandemic. At the time, the firm’s bonuses ranged from $7,500 to $40,000, and associates were thrilled by the good news. Then, Davis Polk got involved and offered special bonuses that [completely blew the Willkie numbers out of the water](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/) — and the rest of Biglaw followed, matching the new $12,000 to $64,000 range left and right.

Is the firm going to leave its associates hanging? Willkie has thus far remained silent on whether it will cover the difference. That is, until today. It’s been a week, and Willkie has now decided to speak up. Lo and behold, associates at the firm will now be receiving the special bonuses that have become the prevailing market rate. Check out the new Willkie bonus scale, below:

# Law School Students Locked In Elevator 3 Hours During Worst Callback Ever

Most on-campus interviewing horror stories involve vile interviewer behavior or embarrassing reception drunkenness. Getting locked in an elevator for over three hours before the fire department could arrive and let students out is a new one, however.

Let’s do this in bar exam format: What do you call 12 young lawyers trapped in an elevator?

(a) A good start;
(b) [The Northwestern Law Difference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y8ndX_Ajfo)TM
(c) Both (a) and (b)
(d) Neither (a) nor (b)

Around midnight, we started hearing about the harrowing tale of 12 Northwestern Law students, picked to live in an elevator to find out what happens when people stop being polite… and start getting real. After an evening callback reception at Winston & Strawn’s Chicago office, students boarded an express elevator on the 35th floor at 7:10 p.m. Then things took a turn.

According to another tipster, the building management showed little initiative, refusing to call the fire department “even though the elevator was nearly 100 degrees from the hot lights/lack of air conditioning.” Students would have truly started freaking out remembering that M. Night Shyamalan movie Devil, where strangers are trapped in an elevator with Satan, if anyone had willingly watched a Shyamalan movie between Unbreakable and Split.

The trapped students tried calling the firm, but according to a tipster, the cell service was terrible and they had a hard time reaching anyone. About 90 minutes into the ordeal, after reaching family and friends, the fire department showed up to mount a rescue effort. It reportedly took five fire trucks and firefighters repelling down the elevator shaft to push the elevator manually down 28 floors.

For their part, Winston & Strawn felt the bottle experiment in problem-solving and interpersonal bonding was a great success. No, obviously we’re kidding, the firm was mortified when they learned what had happened and were present on the ground floor with water and snacks for the intrepid students. I’m sure they would have preferred offers, but alas. On the other hand, as a tipster put it:

I am not sure any of us find the prospect of taking that elevator every day to be very promising!

Indeed.

Alright on-campus interview participants… try to top that story. And be sure to email us at tips@abovethelaw.com if you think you have an OCI story you think the world might enjoy.

# Beyond Biglaw: The Power Of Speech
## The lawyer’s power of speech is a useful gift that comes with an equal measure of responsibility. Use it wisely.

As we approach July 4, and in light of the tumult over Brexit, it is hard to overstate the importance of the spoken word in effecting change. Whether it was the Founding Fathers speaking out against tyranny, or the more recent examples of impassioned speech arguing that Britain would be better off leaving the EU, there is little doubt that speech has the power to persuade, and bring people to action. Even the current election cycle seems to have devolved into a series of speeches and counter-speeches by the candidates, with a healthy dose of good old name calling thrown in for fun. As lawyers, who perhaps more than any other profession appreciate the power of words, we are taught to value the power of speech. Over time, we hope to learn how best to harness the power of speech, and thereby develop into effective advocates on behalf of our client’s and society’s interests.

At the same time as lawyers are at the vanguard of using speech to advance worthwhile causes, of both a professional and societal nature, there is an undercurrent of danger accompanying a lawyer’s power of speech as well. We can set aside for now lawyers using their ability to craft a convincing oral argument for devious ends, and focus on potentially harmful uses of speech in less sinister, but no less harmful, contexts. In my years of practice, I have identified two critical areas where lawyers can unwittingly (or perhaps willfully blindly) misuse their power of speech.

The first area is with respect to office gossip. Anyone who has spent a day working at a law firm knows that law firm halls are rife with office gossip. And that nearly everyone participates in some fashion, from the most powerful partners to the most junior employees. We can debate whether the pros of office gossip outweigh the cons. Having practiced in law firms both large and small for over a decade, I personally believe that office gossip is nearly always corrosive, distracting, and contributes to a toxic working environment. Worse still, I believe that lawyers who engage in such gossip are doing themselves and their firms a disservice, and that firms that willfully ignore an internal gossip problem are ignoring a disease in their midst best eradicated. While this is true of large firms, and within practice groups at large firms, it is perhaps even more of an issue at smaller firms, where gossip is nearly always more likely to cause damaging rifts between colleagues.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
I understand the case for tolerating or even engaging in a bit of office gossip. That it is a way to deal with the stress of the law firm environment, is usually harmless, and that knowing the gossip is important politically. Both in terms of knowing what people are saying about you, and what the prevailing opinions are of your internal competition or the firm’s leadership and performance. But just because gossip can be at different turns irrelevant or valuable does not excuse engaging in it. First off, not all gossip is true, and it is impossible to fully vet the source of gossip both in terms of veracity and motivation. Second, most of us are better off concentrating on what we can do to better ourselves than to spend our time discussing the foibles and follies of others. Add in the destructive power of gossip, and it is something that most of us should avoid at every possible opportunity.

Doing so may be difficult at first. But I think it is worth a try. The first step is being honest about whether it is a problem at your firm, or a behavior you personally engage in that is perhaps best avoided. If you are a firm leader with a gossip problem, try and change the culture somehow. Balance your message that mindless gossip is problematic while also reinforcing that the firm wants employees to bring problems to the attention of leadership. But that the best way to do so is via a proactive and positive approach, motivated by a desire to help solve the problem, rather than than tear down the people who may be involved in creating it. These may be strange words to read on Above the Law, but I don’t think they conflict with the mission of this website. Or our personal responsibility to act in the best interests of our firms while maintaining a high standard for our personal behavior. There is nothing stopping each of us from thinking about ways we can improve ourselves in this regard, and resolve to avoid idle gossip whenever possible.

The other area where a lawyer’s power of speech is easily abused is in our personal relationships. Particularly when dealing with family and non-lawyers. Just because we have the power to destroy someone with a convincing oral argument on a particular issue does not mean that it is right to do so. It is important to show some restraint and not use the regular people in our lives as heavy bags for our verbal power punches. It is hard to throttle down from an adversarial posture sometimes, but it is necessary if we want to maintain positive relationships with the people we come home to. One first step is to encourage those people to let us know when we cross the line with our speech, and need to tone down our Clarence Darrow acts. Life is more than a series of arguments, or verbal victories in every encounter.

Ultimately, the lawyer’s power of speech is a weight and useful gift that comes with an equal measure of responsibility. We spend so much of our day using that gift that it can be difficult to filter what comes out of our mouths. But we need to, in order to maintain strong relationships at work and at home. Leave the gossip and negative speech to others. Worst case, you will look like the strong, silent type, or at least someone who is thoughtful. Which is always better than being known as a destructive loudmouth, even if we need to retrain ourselves to respect our power of speech.

# No, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy Is Not Retiring Tomorrow

Justice Anthony M. Kennedy

Ed. note: Please note the UPDATES I have added — and will continue to add — at the end of this story.

Look, I love legal gossip as much as — actually, way more than — the next guy. I entered the world of legal media through the [back door of judicial gossip](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/08/books/david-lats-supreme-ambitions-is-a-thriller-for-lawyers.html?_r=0), writing a blog called [Underneath Their Robes](http://underneaththeirrobes.blogs.com/) under the pseudonym of “Article III Groupie” (because gossiping about judges by night while appearing before them by day, [as a federal prosecutor](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/22/technology/he-fought-the-law-they-both-won.html), is not a good look).

But to be a good gossip, you can’t just spread random rumors. You need to exercise discretion and discernment in what you disseminate — which brings me to the rampant rumors about Justice Anthony M. Kennedy’s supposedly imminent retirement, to be announced possibly as early as tomorrow.

I won’t [bury the lede](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/bury-the-lede-versus-lead), so here it is: based on reports I’ve received from former AMK clerks who attended his law clerk reunion dinner last night, it is highly unlikely that Justice Kennedy will announce his retirement tomorrow.

But before getting into those reports, let me explain the origins of the latest speculation. Rumors of AMK retiring have been galloping around inside the Beltway for months now. On June 22, they gained momentum after Chris Hayes [tweeted](https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/877964123530608641):

Just a reminder: there's a chance Kennedy announces his retirement on Monday, paving the way for the end of Roe.

Matt Drudge and the [Drudge Report](http://drudgereport.com/) soon joined in the wishful thinking fun:

Now, legal nerds and #appellatetwitter types might scoff at taking SCOTUS predictions from the likes of Hayes and Drudge. But Mark Sherman of the Associated Press and Ariane de Vogue of CNN, both highly respected Supreme Court correspondents, wrote stories yesterday flagging the speculation. From [Sherman](http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2017-06-24-US--Supreme%20Court/id-95872f15f4c447a6b0ef40a97014007e):

The biggest news of all [from the Supreme Court] would be if Justice Anthony Kennedy were to use the court’s last public session on Monday to announce his retirement.

To be sure, Kennedy has given no public sign that he will retire this year and give President Donald Trump his second high court pick in the first months of his administration…. But Kennedy turns 81 next month and has been on the court for nearly 30 years. Several of his former law clerks have said they think he is contemplating stepping down in the next year or so. Kennedy and his clerks were gathering over the weekend for a reunion that was pushed up a year and helped spark talk he might be leaving the court.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Will he stay or will he go? The rumors have swirled for months, and the 80-year-old justice has done nothing either personally or though intermediaries to set the record straight on whether he will step down.

Adding fuel to the fire, this morning top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said on ABC’s “This Week” that she [could not confirm or deny](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/339376-conway-wont-confirm-justice-kennedy-retirement-rumors) the AMK retirement talk: “I will never reveal a conversation between a sitting justice and the president or the White House.”

Now, here’s my rebuttal. First, allow me to respectfully dissent from Ariane de Vogue’s comment that “the 80-year-old justice has done nothing either personally or though intermediaries to set the record straight.” Justice Kennedy, through the Court’s Public Information Office, previously has tried to dispel the rumors.

Last November, I offered a [detailed discussion](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/anatomy-of-a-rumor-on-justice-kennedys-retirement-next-year/) of the AMK retirement rumors, identifying three factors fueling the rumors: (1) moving his law clerk reunion up a year, a departure from the customary schedule of every five years; (2) not teaching in summer 2016 at McGeorge Law’s Summer Program in Salzburg, suggesting a possible slowdown for Justice and Mrs. Kennedy; and (3) hiring just one law clerk for the upcoming Term, October Term 2017. (Active justices get four clerks, while retired justices get one clerk, and in the past, some justices have tipped their hands by hiring fewer clerks than usual.)

If you’ve ever dealt with the Supreme Court Public Information Office, you know that the PIO likes to stay above the fray. It doesn’t chime in on every hiccup in the federal judiciary — it’s not Donald Trump’s Twitter feed, after all — and often it simply doesn’t comment on things. But the PIO did respond to my inquiry about Justice Kennedy, issuing this statement (presumably based on information received from the justice himself):

Justice Kennedy is in the process of hiring clerks for 2017. The Justice didn’t go to Salzburg this past summer because it conflicted with some plans with his family, but he is scheduled to return to teach there in 2017. The reunion is scheduled for the end of this Term because the Justice’s law clerks wanted to hold it during the Justice’s 80th year to mark his birthday.

Now, back when I shared this comment with my readers, I offered some caveats:

Is it possible that Justice Kennedy actually is planning to retire next year, but doesn’t want the world to know just yet? Sure. Is it possible that he isn’t currently planning to retire next year, but then changes his mind later? Certainly.

But, on balance, the PIO’s statement weighs in favor of AMK sticking around for a little while.

Second, look at his law clerk hiring. In January 2017, a few weeks after the Public Information Office’s statement, Justice Kennedy [hired his fourth and final clerk](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/supreme-court-clerk-hiring-watch-october-term-2017-is-done-lets-turn-to-2018/) for the next Term.

And wait, that’s not all. As I’ll mention in my next Supreme Court clerk hiring round-up, and as I’ve already tweeted via [@SCOTUSambitions](https://twitter.com/SCOTUSambitions/) (which offers real-time SCOTUS clerk hiring news), Justice Kennedy recently hired [one clerk for 2018](https://twitter.com/SCOTUSambitions/status/869629493119299585): Clayton Kozinski (Yale 2017 / Kavanaugh), son of prominent Ninth Circuit judge Alex Kozinski (who clerked for Justice Kennedy back when he was Judge Kennedy of the Ninth Circuit, and who remains personally close to AMK).

Now, hiring clerks for 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 is not dispositive evidence that a justice will remain on the bench. There’s a nice tradition at the Court of justices picking up “orphaned” hires of their colleagues (which is what happened with Justice Antonin Scalia’s displaced clerks), so the clerks aren’t necessarily left in the lurch. But as a matter of collegiality and consideration — and whether or not you like his jurisprudence, Justice Kennedy is collegial and considerate — it’s not nice to impose upon your colleagues by hiring clerks you know will never work for you, putting pressure on these colleagues to sacrifice their own hiring discretion to scoop up your leftovers (because of SCOTUS tradition).

Finally, let’s turn to the dinner at the Kennedy law clerk reunion, which took place last night. As Kevin Daley noted over at the [Daily Caller](http://dailycaller.com/2017/06/25/these-reports-could-signify-kennedy-wont-retire-this-term/), Eliana Johnson of Politico and Lawrence Hurley of Reuters previously tweeted that AMK didn’t make a retirement announcement last night. I have more specifics of what he did say, which I’ll now share.

I reached out to several AMK clerks who were in attendance, and those who got back to me all opined that they don’t think he will announce his retirement tomorrow. Here’s why (in addition to their [“spidey sense”](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Spidey-sense) from his demeanor).

First, Justice Kennedy generally made forward-looking rather than valedictory comments. For example, he talked about the three pairs of parent-child clerks he’s had — e.g., the Kozinskis — and how he hopes to have more in the future. This doesn’t sound like a justice who’s about to be slashing his clerk hiring to one a year (the allotment given to a retired justice).

Second, Justice Kennedy made a joke about all the retirement buzz. At the end of his remarks, he said something along these lines: “There has been a lot of speculation about… a certain announcement from me tonight. And that announcement is: the bar will remain open after the end of the formal program!”

Again — like the Supreme Court press office statement, and like the law clerk hiring — Justice Kennedy’s reunion remarks are not conclusive evidence of non-retirement. Indeed, a few of his former clerks have said — not in a mean way, just a matter-of-fact way — that AMK doesn’t care enough about his clerks to make the big announcement at the reunion. (Compare him to my former boss, Judge Diarmuid F. O’Scannlain of the Ninth Circuit, who announced his move to senior status [at his law clerk reunion](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/a-leading-light-of-the-federal-judiciary-will-take-senior-status-by-years-end/) — right around the same time he told his colleagues on the bench, and in advance of the first news reports.)

Let’s not mince words: as the so-called “swing justice” on the Supreme Court, Justice Kennedy is one of the most powerful people in the world, and [nobody puts AMK in the corner](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=nobody%20puts%20Baby%20in%20the%20corner). As both liberals and conservatives have discovered to their dismay over the years, he swings his gavel every which way. Trying to predict AMK’s actions is almost as challenging as, well, trying to predict the actions of the man who might appoint his successor. As one of my sources said, “I’d be shocked if he retired this Term after last night — but it wouldn’t be the first time he’s surprised me!”

Truth be told, I would not be surprised if even Justice Kennedy himself hasn’t fully made up his mind (as another source of mine suggested to me). I would not be surprised if AMK has already drafted his letter to President Donald Trump, and if and when the spirit moves the justice, he’ll date it, print it, sign it, and have his chambers aide walk it over to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Kennedy, OUT!

Liberals should hope and pray that the justice wakes up in a good mood tomorrow morning. Despite progressives’ issues with AMK — cough cough, [Citizens United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC) — he’s a heck of a lot better for them than any Trump pick, especially in a [post-nuclear world](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/the-nuclear-age-the-supreme-court-may-never-be-the-same/).

So anything is possible tomorrow when it comes to Justice Kennedy — but in terms of what’s probable, it’s highly unlikely that Associate Justice Anthony M. Kennedy will announce his departure from the Supreme Court of the United States.

P.S. Despite these lawyerly caveats, I’m not betting both sides of the line; put me on record as saying AMK won’t retire tomorrow. If forced to assign a probability, I’d say there’s only a 10 percent chance of a retirement announcement. If Justice Kennedy does in fact retire, then yes, I’ll have a veritable three-egg omelet on my face.

P.P.S. In terms of my own self-interest, I’m fervently hoping that Justice Kennedy doesn’t retire tomorrow morning. I’m in meetings or speaking engagements pretty much all day on Monday — [come see me tomorrow night](http://www.fed-soc.org/events/detail/summer-happy-hour-with-david-lat) if you’re in Minneapolis — so I’ll be majorly annoyed if AMK drops the retirement bomb on a day when I’m mostly offline.

UPDATE (6:40 p.m.): See also this earlier post by Adam Feldman, [Why Justice Kennedy May Not Leave The Court Right Now](https://empiricalscotus.com/2017/06/01/kennedy-may-not-leave/), with which I agree.

Some observers have suggested that AMK might not want to step down next year for fear of making himself an issue for the 2018 midterm elections. But with all due respect to the Supreme Court — and this is coming from me, a huge judicial junkie — there will be many, many other issues for the midterms besides SCOTUS. And, from the Democrats’ point of view, the American people’s indifference to what happened (or didn’t happen) to the Supreme Court nomination of Chief Judge Merrick Garland shows that the Court is not a major voting issue (or if it is, it motivates conservatives more than it motivates liberals and moderates).

UPDATE (6:43 p.m.): A partial dissent from one source on the tone of Justice Kennedy’s speech: “there was a valedictory tone [to some of his comments], all the featured speakers were judges, and Justice Gorsuch was seated as [‘hand of the king’](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Hand_of_the_King) [for the photo op]. Legacy-type stuff, in other words.”

UPDATE (7:29 p.m.): Another attendee had this interesting observation: “note the two judges who did not give speeches: [D.C. Circuit Judge Brett M.] Kavanaugh and [Sixth Circuit Judge Raymond M.] Kethledge. Significance? Maybe nothing, but they are the AMK clerks most likely to get the nod if he retires, and speaking at his final banquet might be awkward.”

So this point weighs in favor of a possible retirement (but not necessarily announced tomorrow, I’d argue, just a retirement during the Trump administration).

UPDATE (7:46 p.m.): A good question from a reader: “Isn’t AMK’s hiring of one clerk for OT 2018 consistent with him retiring? Retired Justices frequently hire just one clerk, correct?”

Answer: no, because Clayton Kozinski was a super-early hire for Justice Kennedy (but not surprising, given that AMK sometimes hires someone early from Judge Kozinski, to whom he’s very close). The justice typically hires in December or January for the following October Term. So if December 2017 or January 2018 rolls around and Clayton has no co-clerks, that would be a sign of possible retirement.

UPDATE (6/26/2017, 7:47 a.m.): As reported by Jess Bravin of the [Wall Street Journal](https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2017/06/25/justice-kennedy-keeps-law-clerks-guessing-about-his-retirement/) (via [SCOTUSblog](http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/06/monday-round-up-353/)), Justice Kennedy’s dinner remarks on Saturday addressed the following themes:

The Supreme Court’s senior member–and frequently its deciding vote on cases involving gay rights, abortion access, capital punishment and other major issues–closed a private reunion of his law clerks with remarks touching on many of his longstanding concerns, according to several people who attended. He spoke of the impact of technological change, the need for civility in political discourse and the importance of public service plans.

If AMK is concerned about “civility in political discourse,” then he should not create a SCOTUS vacancy at a moment in our history that’s this turbulent and politically charged. Just imagine the political armageddon that will immediately ensue if Justice Kennedy reveals his retirement this morning; it will make the Garland and Gorsuch battles look like sandbox squabbling.

Sure, it’s possible that the state of our politics might not improve — but on the other hand, a lot can happen in a year. So even if I might raise my 10 percent estimate of a retirement announcement today to 20 or 30 percent (in light of some of the updates I’ve added here), I still think it’s far more likely that Justice Kennedy will retire next year as opposed to today.

UPDATE (6/26/2017, 11:18 a.m.): Please allow me to take my victory lap. As I predicted, Justice Kennedy [did not announce his retirement](http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/06/view-courtroom-day-drama-bench/) yesterday.

Could Justice Kennedy announce his retirement later this summer — recall how Justice Sandra Day O’Connor announced her retirement [on July 1, 2005](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/01/AR2005070100653.html), after the end of the Term — or later this year? It’s theoretically possible, but not probable. My guess is that AMK will not announce any retirement until around this time next year — i.e., the end of October Term 2017 — at the earliest.

# Boston, We Have A Problem: The Data On Mental Health And Practicing Is In

Massachusetts has a lot going for it. Harvard is there, for one. They also have that funny little way of pronouncing the word “yard” like they’re throwing it from their mouths. And uhm… I’m sure there’s something else, right? That third thing may be just what it takes to make practicing in New England a bit more bearable. Because folks are having a hard time logging those billables at the moment. From Reuters:

Massachusetts lawyers are burned out and experiencing elevated rates of anxiety and depression, according to a study released Wednesday that adds to a growing body of research documenting mental health problems within the legal profession.

Researchers with the Lawyers Concerned for Lawyers and NORC at the University of Chicago surveyed 4,450 Massachusetts attorneys last year for the latest study. Across the state, 77% reported feeling burned out, 26% reported high rates of anxiety, 21% reported depression and 7% reported suicidal thoughts — all higher than average for U.S. adults.

The survey also found high rates of alcohol consumption, with 42% of respondents reporting unhealthy or hazardous use.

Now, barring they didn’t make an methodological error and only got the opinions of people who were basically crying out for help — say lawyers looking to go see Pagliacci or Adult Swifties™, for example, that’s a healthy sample size of people to be that down bad. And[ while lawyers have had disproportionately high rates of drinking for a while now](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/business/dealbook/high-rate-of-problem-drinking-reported-among-lawyers.html), a 42% self-reported rate of unhealthy or hazardous use is too close to comfort to half.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)

One outlier may have colored the data: COVID-19. That said, the results are likely still worth heeding.

“Almost half indicated they considered leaving their legal employer, and 40% reported considering leaving the legal profession entirely in the last three years due to burnout or stress,” according to the study, [Lawyer Well-Being in Massachusetts](https://tmsnrt.rs/3wNdtkt).

The timing of the survey, which was conducted amid the COVID-19 pandemic, likely contributed to higher rates of reported burnout and anxiety, the authors said. But it was consistent with earlier findings that lawyers have higher rates of substance abuse and mental health problems than the general population and other professions.

This gleams some advice even non-Massachusetts based firms may want to keep in mind: it may be in their own best interests to chill on strict return-to-office policies. Who really wants to add gossiping into the depressive brew at this point? Burning through associates may have been a viable economic tactic at one point, but with burnout rates like these, your bottom dollar could get singed too.

Burnout, anxiety and depression was especially high among minority groups, the new Massachusetts study found. The burnout rate among Black and Hispanic lawyers was 86% and 88%, respectively, compared to 77% among white lawyers. Attorneys with childcare responsibilities also reported higher rates of burnout.

The survey found that nearly half of the lawyers who screened positive for depression, anxiety or suicidal thoughts did not seek mental health care. The researchers attributed that to stigma surrounding mental health issues, as well as time constraints and fear of professional reprisals.

The fear of professional reprisal is palpable — remember the guy who wanted to get a woman canned for [“sitting on her ass” during maternity leave](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/collecting-salary-from-the-firm-while-sitting-on-your-ass-is-certainly-one-way-for-a-partner-to-describe-maternity-leave/)? The partner is dead, long live the firm mentality is, oddly enough, great for the firm and very hard on partners and associates. They’re the ones in the oak box, after all. Thankfully, the study ends on a pragmatic note.

Lawyers who reported having a supportive work environment where they are treated with kindness and respect, given flexibility and have access to mentorship had higher satisfaction with life and lower rates of burnout, anxiety and depression, the study found.

So, Boston lawyers and whoever else the shoe fits for, you work all those hours for the firm, why not work on yourself a little? Take a day or two off, talk to a therapist — maybe even find one online. And hey, if that means lateraling to a firm that treats you like an actual person, so be it.

Someone who was very established said to me, ‘I was in your position. All I’m going to say to you is: Don’t question it, get out, and do it sooner rather than later. The longer you’re there, the harder it’s going to be, and the more miserable you’re going to end up before it actually happens. If at all possible, do it tomorrow, as soon as you can.’

—Ari Cohn, a former litigation associate at Mayer Brown now counsel at the nonprofit TechFreedom, [tells Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/former-big-law-associates-share-why-they-left-their-firms-2021-9) advice he got before leaving Biglaw. The article includes reasons other Biglaw attorneys left, include disturbing — but all too familiar — lines like:
“My color was off. I looked like a ghost sometimes.”
“When I was on a really stressful deal, I could barely eat.”
“I threw my phone and started crying. This is not worth it. This is not a way to live.”
“I was a groomsman at a friend’s wedding and got an email about something having to be done. I was told it was urgent and I left the reception for an hour to go take care of it. It didn’t end up getting looked at until the beginning of the week.”

Yesterday, we [had a quote from Hugh Simons](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/wake-up-partners-not-making-associate-life-worthwhile-is-costing-you-a-lot-more-than-you-think/) arguing that firms have hurt themselves by not looking beyond salaries when it comes to attracting and retaining associates. For this reason, he says the cost of “not enhancing the value proposition for associates” is a sustained decline in PPP brought on by the transfer of profits to associate pay. It’s framed in [the Law.com piece he’s cited in](https://www.law.com/2021/06/21/law-com-trendspotter-in-the-law-firm-associate-pay-war-the-only-thing-that-cant-be-bought-is-loyalty/) as catnip for firms hoping to avoid offering pay increases in lieu of less tangible — and cheaper — superficial perks.

This is poppycock.

First of all, there’s not some sort of one-to-one transfer of profits to paychecks. A quick perusal of the figures for the last handful of years show that these firms have seen revenue and profitability go up after each prior round of associate raises. Profits will almost certainly go up after this round as well because demand will be up a touch, productivity will be higher, and firms will quietly tick rates up a little bit and clients will bellyache and then pay the increase anyway because they always do. In short, partners don’t get to add up all the raises and assume that would have bought them another boat this year.

But more importantly, there’s a reason law firms can’t attract good associates with substandard pay but a baller vacation policy. Associates need money, man.

Twenty years ago, associates might take a job at the $125K pay scale and commit to three years of Biglaw before opening their minds to careers that trade top of market pay for other perks. These days, it’s not clear that a new lawyer could get out of debt that quickly. Between undergrad and law school, graduates are walking out of school these days under several hundred thousands of dollars in debt. No matter how much they might prefer earning $180K and leaving the office at 8 or 9 every night, that’s not a luxury they have these days.

It’s not that they’re greedy, they just have more mouths to feed. And all of those mouths are Navient.

Associates will flow to where the money is until their debt is under enough control to provide some freedom, and unfortunately that span grows a little longer every year. Making $15K more a year doesn’t net an associate enough to make a substantial dent in that run of debt servitude, but every marginal improvement matters. Money may not buy loyalty, but it’s going to trump everything else for several years.

Ideally, we’d get some comprehensive education reform that slashes the debt loads that associates carry, allowing them to be more discriminating about where they want to work. Until then, if a firm is looking for top talent… the money will remain the number one factor.

In fairness to Simons, I doubt he meant to pose this the way it’s framed as in that one quote. For example, he also said:

“Old-school partners translate the desire for better work-life balance as not wanting to work hard, or a lack of commitment,” Simons said. “More thoughtful examination of associates’ issues will reveal more subtle, and more readily addressed, issues.”

What firms should be taking away from what Simons counsels here is that pay and lifestyle are not a zero sum game. Law firms that match the market and improve the work environment will catch and retain far more bees.

We’re already seeing a line in the sand between the firms demanding associates back in the office and those embracing flexibility and 3- or 4-day office weeks. The cynic would point out that these policies likely have more to do with the possibility of reducing expensive floorplans, but it’s going to become a powerful recruiting chit when an associate is trying to decide between two equally high-paying firms.

So, yes, get creative about improving the long-term associate experience, but don’t kid yourself into thinking it gets the firm out of issuing raises.

Rich people from the 1800s are a panoply of vicious sociopaths who threw their names on the sides of buildings in a vain hope that society will forget the human misery they left in their path. Sounds… timely.

But the reckoning always comes for these tinpot Ozymandiases. Sometimes the arc of retribution takes a century, but it will always come. They will always be exposed and torn down.

Today, the University of California is taking the proverbial sledgehammer to its own ugly edifice by announcing that the law school will recommend to the university that it [fully end its historical association with the “Boalt Hall” moniker](https://www.law.com/therecorder/2018/11/13/berkeley-law-to-ditch-boalt-name/):

“Whether to keep the formal association between John Boalt and the Berkeley Law was never a simple question: it implicates competing values, and is not easy to answer,” [Berkeley lecturer Charles] Reichmann said. “In the end, though, I think the relevant question was whether the Berkeley Law School of the 21st Century wishes to honor someone whose greatest public legacy was working to exclude Chinese people from the United States, and whose only legacy to the law school was his money.”

And so it ends. The school will try to find some way to honor Boalt’s widow, who was the one who actually gave the school all the Boalt money anyway, but will abandon honoring the name.

Law schools make all sorts of deals with dubious people in the name of cash. Sometimes the way these schools prostrate themselves is [flatly embarrassing](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/law-students-captive-audience-to-racism/). But in the end, the law school marches on. New students and faculty will embrace modernity and shed their distasteful pasts. Berkeley is just the latest in a long line of schools to take a step like this and it won’t be the last.

For John Henry Boalt, the monument to his vile legacy will end.
