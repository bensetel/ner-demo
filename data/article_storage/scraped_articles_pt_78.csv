# Faith Gay Has A Totally Zen Perspective On The John Quinn Email
## John Quinn's email didn't pull any punches, but Faith Gay is looking to the future.

When Philippe Selendy and Faith Gay announced that they’d be [leaving Quinn Emanuel](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/big-name-departures-from-quinn-emanuel/) to start Selendy & Gay, it’s safe to say that John Quinn didn’t take it well. And when Gay sent her departure memo to the firm, Quinn replied to all [with a scathing rebuke](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/john-quinn-is-not-happy-about-selendy-gay-and-he-sent-the-angry-reply-all-to-prove-it/).

Quinn’s email unintentionally laid bare the stress of the business side of building and maintaining a high-stakes legal practice. We spend so much time focusing on good lawyering, we downplay the cold, hard business decisions that go into building a successful practice. And, by extension, we underestimate how devastating a high-profile departure can be — especially if there’s a better than average risk that the departure may result in the poaching of additional talent too.

Despite being on the receiving in of Quinn’s lashing out, Faith Gay seems to understand where Quinn was coming from. In an interview [with Jenna Greene in Litigation Daily](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/03/01/in-depth-with-selendy-and-gay-on-their-new-firm-and-leaving-quinn-emanuel/), Gay addresses the email:

First of all, this is QE’s first experience with a spin-off. I think naturally it would cause some anxiety. It is extremely clear to me that many folks at QE completely understand what we’re doing. They’re entrepreneurial. We’re entrepreneurial. We are working day to day with them on many, many matters, and we intend to continue that and look for opportunities to use them in the future.

In terms of John’s email to us, that is in the past. Our strong feeling is that we did exactly what was required under the Quinn Emanuel partnership agreement, that we were extraordinarily faithful to our former partners and to our clients. We would have had it no other way, because we helped build that practice and we want it to succeed now and in the future.

In other words, she understands why this move would provoke strong feelings, but everyone’s moving on and there’s a big enough pie for Selendy & Gay and Quinn Emanuel to both eat their fill.

Building a career in the legal field can be both challenging and rewarding, especially if your field of interest is uncommon. In today’s episode, I interview [Linda Kornfeld](https://www.blankrome.com/people/linda-kornfeld), partner at Blank Rome. Linda shares why she attended law school and how she landed in her practice area as an insurance recovery attorney. She also gives advice for others who are looking for their career niche, as well as her experiences with business interruption insurance over the past year, and what Biglaw can do to foster diversity.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

# Biglaw Firm Reinstates Coronavirus Work-From-Home Policy After Blowback From Employees
## Which firm made this questionable decision?

Thanks to the incredibly contagious coronavirus outbreak, Biglaw firms across the globe have had to close their physical offices and encourage attorneys and legal professionals to work remotely. Some areas of the world have been more successful at flattening the curve and are now attempting to reopen their businesses — but employees are still incredibly worried about their health.

Earlier this week, a Chicago-based Biglaw firm tried to bring its Hong Kong workforce back to the office and employees were less than pleased considering that COVID-19 had recently started making a comeback thanks to lifted social-distancing restrictions. Lawyers and staff members were so shocked and outraged over the proposal that an anonymous letter was sent to firm management.

Which firm received pushback over its questionable decision?

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Mayer Brown received a sharply worded letter from employees after they found out the firm planned to reopen the office. “You are putting us, our families and our communities at risk for no good reason,” the letter’s authors wrote. [Law.com International](https://www.law.com/international-edition/2020/03/24/mayer-browns-efforts-to-reopen-in-hong-kong-backtracked-after-employees-raise-concerns/) has additional details on the letter’s contents:

The letter blasted Mayer Brown for telling lawyers and staff that they should return to work in the office. It also said the firm had failed to provide any support to those employees who had children at home. Hong Kong’s schools have been closed during the crisis and are not expected to reopen until late April.

“We want to express our dismay at the position the firm continues to maintain in the face of a global pandemic. You insist that we still come to work despite a grand majority of other Hong Kong firms, companies and government offices providing the option for employees to work from home,” the letter said.

The firm has since reinstated its voluntary work-from-home policy for all employees, which is a good thing, because one of its employees recently tested positive for COVID-19 and has been hospitalized. Mayer Brown noted in a statement that “[t]he health and safety of our people—each and every one of us— takes priority over everything else and is the only factor in play as our local leaders react in real time to a rapidly unfolding global human tragedy.”

Is your firm planning to make adjustments to its work-from-home policy anytime soon? Please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20WFH%20Policy) or text us (646-820-8477) and we’ll update our [policy tracker](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-coronavirus-policy-tracker-which-firms-will-let-lawyers-work-from-home/).

# Attorneys Connecting Through Social Media In Times Of Isolation
## Here all of it is shared and it feels like a safe space where one can finally feel heard and understood.

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts on motherhood in the legal profession, in partnership with our friends at [MothersEsquire](https://www.mothersesquire.com/). Welcome Wendy D. Kalwaitis to our pages, with a brief introduction from Michelle Browning Coughlin, founder of MothersEsquire.

In 2013, I felt utterly alone in a firm of more than 200 attorneys. I looked around me and did not see other mothers who were associates, and didn’t have the first clue how I was supposed to simultaneously be the stridently ambitious, “work-above-all-else” attorney and the “perfect mom” at the same time, much less the devoted wife, community and school volunteer, devoted daughter, and all the other hats I wore. I looked for national guidance about motherhood and the law, and found little. It seemed to me that the societal pendulum had shifted far to the side of requiring women not to speak of motherhood and children, as if not speaking about the challenges of the motherhood penalty would make the unconscious bias towards mothers go away. Out of this moment, out of truly my own need for help, MothersEsquire was born. I started a small Facebook group with just five other moms I knew personally who were also lawyers, with the hopes that I would find some secret answers. What I found instead was friendship, joy, brilliance, humor, anger, hope, frustration, and thousands of women who often inspire me with their talents and brilliance. And that is why reading Wendy’s words fill me with immeasurable joy. At a time when we feel more disconnected than ever, MothersEsquire and other social media groups like ours provide needed connection and support. I know that I no longer feel alone, like the only person I know juggling untenable expectations. I’ve got my girls, my sisters, my mommas, my community — the moms of MothersEsquire. And they’ve got me, and my promise to always use my voice to fight for gender equity and an end to the motherhood penalty in the law.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Few things in life come without work and determination, Law and motherhood are no exception. They both are more similar then many realize and for those who carry the title of both Attorney at Law and Mom, it can sometimes feel like you are sailing uncharted waters. The beginning quest to endeavor into either title requires willpower, stamina, determination, and emotional strength that few others truly get.  Sleepless nights, never-ending to-do lists, calendars that do not bend to your will, and duties or conduct that carry dire consequences should one not meet the minimum standards.

These roles of mother and lawyer are not interchangeable. One who takes on both roles does so with the idea that they must at all times carry both titles. What was it they told us in law school? “From now on you will always wear your lawyer hat.” And anyone who is a mom, knows that job is 24/7. The balance that both require is like a strictly choreographed dance, where one misstep can lead to the routine tumbling out of control. We live and die by our carefully crafted calendars and deadlines. Children and clients who look to us to guide and remedy all things from boo-boos on the knees to counseling them in the things that often times define their lives or businesses.

There are no breaks in motherhood and law. There is an expectation from both that we will give it our all and anything less is a breach of our fiduciary duties. This pressure can make mom attorneys feel isolated, especially from other moms and attorneys who do not carry the shared weight of the attorney’s oath juxtaposed with playdates, PTA, and parent teacher conferences.  It is a lot of pressure and few can empathize with just how demanding it can be except those who wake every morning and do the delicate dance daily.  But as I have found, social media is bridging that gap of isolation by connecting these alpha law moms where they can share, vent, question, and connect in ways I only dreamed of in the beginning of my career.

Twenty years ago when I graduated law school, I was lost in the maze of the inner workings of what was next.  How does this work and can I truly ask the questions that I am dying to know? I was single and did not have kids but I knew I wanted them.  There were rumors of what was required, which firms were good and which to stay away from as a female attorney who desired both accomplishment and motherhood. But they were just that, rumors. The very last thing on my mind was what would offer me the opportunity to also be a good mom. I naively thought that was implied and that I would just figure it out. The female partners were not approachable and there was a certain implied competition to rise above the fray and prove yourself as one of the boys. I am not proud that I played that game but I did not have female mentors to guide the decisions that best suited my future desire to have children.  At the most, what I witnessed or heard under whispered breaths was that kids derailed and postponed careers.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Social media wasn’t even a word. Back in the day, you would have networking lunches but many found it hard to pull away from the billable hours or work to meet up. There was the added issue of feeling somewhat more visible given you were face to face.  You could follow up those events with emails, but you were flying blind in that you didn’t really know if that female attorney had children and moreover if they even felt like taking the time to answer your question.  It was hard to connect without a social media profile giving out the subtle cues it does today.

But then social media platforms became our way to connect and sharing pieces of ourselves and even our daily lives became more commonplace. Likeminded people discovered each other and groups were formed. I recall stumbling upon MotherEsquire and thinking, “I finally found my people.” Women who truly understood the struggles and decisions I faced daily and an opportunity to ask “those” questions. I have seen the questions that I was dying to know 20 years ago fill in the gaps where rumors were all I knew. What was a doable billable hour as a mother of two? Was there really a chance to make partner and have more than one child? Was government work or in-house counsel that much less demanding? How do you handle breastfeeding and court? Here all of it is shared and it feels like a safe space where one can finally feel heard and understood.

It might not feel like the old stuffy networking roundtables of old where young attorneys did not dare speak and that is a good thing, I promise. My first job, I was hired straight out of law school by a female attorney with kids. She was a partner and I’m grateful she gave me a chance. But at the end of the day, she was my boss and I did not dare ask the tough questions that may paint me in an unprofessional or weak light.  In places like MotherEsquire, I see the tough questions asked and answered by women who know and who have been through this and understand what that female attorney who has kids is up against. There is power in knowledge and in numbers. Thru social media groups, I observe female attorney moms become more empowered every day to break that glass ceiling and redefine what it means to be both mom and counsel.  We were never alone, we simply needed to find “our people,” and I’m happy to report that I am enlightened a little more every day that I get to be a part of this distinct group of women who balance it all with power, grace, and humility.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Wendy Kalwaitis graduated from Syracuse University Whitman School of Management in New York before returning to Southern California to attend law school at Southwestern University School of Law. She has been practicing law in Southern California for 20 years, half of those which she has balanced as a mom to her three daily saviors, her children, ages, 10, 8 and 3. She has practiced in both large and boutique firms in the areas of litigation, business, employment, and worker’s compensation law. When she is not balancing all things law and motherhood, she lets her husband do the cooking while she escapes to woodworking, renovating, and moments of alone time at Target or the tool aisle at Home Depot. You can also find her irreverent musings or reach her on her Instagram @found_and_followed or email at wdm711@yahoo.com.

# For The First Time In Ages, Associates Are In Control Of The Market

Right now firms are just feeling like, ‘We don’t really have that much of a choice.’ And I think the lawyers realize that and are going to be pushing for as much as they can get.

[Firms are] very cognizant of who has the leverage right now because they’re so busy, they literally can’t find enough people to get all the work done. That’s why you see these tremendous signing bonuses to associates, and the recent salary wars escalating again. [Firms are] very concerned about putting a line in the sand.

Here you may have a situation where the desires of the client are diametrically opposed to the wishes of a larger number of attorneys at the firm, both associate and partner alike. That has the potential to create significant tension within the firm and may even cause some attorneys to vote with their feet.

— Jeffrey Lowe, global practice leader of the law firm practice at Major, Lindsey & Africa, commenting on [“very pro-attorney market” that law firms are dealing with](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/07/19/a-very-pro-attorney-market-the-pandemic-has-given-individual-attorneys-more-leverage/) in the wake of the pandemic. Individual associates and partners have more power, leverage, and autonomy now than they ever did before.

# Top 10 Biglaw Firm Threatens To Dock Bonuses By Up To 50% For Late Timesheets
## No time entry? No money (or at least a lot less money).

When it comes to working as an associate, time is money, and Biglaw firms are dead serious about time entry. After all, that’s how these firms get paid, and if attorneys are delinquent in the submission of their timesheets, then fees won’t be collected from clients. Firms do not appreciate procrastination when it comes submission of timesheets, and that’s why so many of them have implemented policies that financially disincentivize late time entries.

It was [back in 2008](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/02/associate-bonus-watch-dechert-docks-associates-for-dilatory-billables/) that Above the Law first noted the trend spreading among Biglaw firms — associates with too many late time entries would see their year-end bonuses slashed. [Other firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/12/hughes-hubbard-is-the-latest-firm-to-crack-the-time-keeping-whip/) were quick to hop on the trend, with some taking a bite not just [out of bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/11/you-want-your-bonus-we-want-your-time-sheets/),[ but of salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/11/simpson-thacher-threatens-to-withhold-salary-for-delinquent-time-keepers/), too.

But these policies are not relics of the past. Firms are still very serious about the submission of attorneys’ time, and the latest firm to issue bonus threats tied to time entry is none other than Sidley Austin, which has an aggressive daily time entry policy (with a five-day grace period, luckily).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
A source tells us that the firm — which brought in $2,922,634,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 6 on the Am Law 100 — sent a memo this week notifying lawyers that time entry will now impact their bonuses. Here’s the key segment of that memo (available on the next page):



Oof, that’s a pretty hefty chunk of bonus money that’ll be docked if attorneys’ time isn’t entered in a timely fashion.

Yes, this is a very harsh way for a Biglaw firm to make their point, especially when associates tend to be the most delinquent with timesheets because they’re so busy billing their lives away. But slashing bonuses — by up to an eye-popping 50%! — is sure to grab the attention needed to keep those time entries coming in fast and furious.

# Don’t Let Your Yule Log Burn Out

It’s been 90 weeks since “two weeks to flatten the curve” became a thing. I don’t know about you, but that kind of statistic makes me need to sit down and stare off into the distance for a while.

The time-dilating effects of COVID world have been bizarre. March 2020 seemed to run for about six months, and the rest of 2020 was basically one long, endless slog. Then somehow 2021 flashed past, and we’re now staring down the last month of the year when emotionally it feels like we should be up to about the Fourth of July.

As law firm leaders, we’ve been running an ultra-long-distance marathon for what seems like ages. Our feet are bleeding, we’re exhausted, and there’s still no finish line in sight. We just want this to be over. But we need to recognize that COVID Year 3 begins in a month, and the challenges we and our firms have been dealing with aren’t going away any time soon.

Below I focus on some ways you can prepare yourself and your firms for 2022. But first let’s take stock of what the year has in store for us.

Everything’s Still Really Hard

For starters, just when it seemed like we were getting COVID under control, the [Omicron variant ](https://www.who.int/news/item/28-11-2021-update-on-omicron)enters the equation. It might be the next Delta, or it might be another minor bump in the road. Even if it doesn’t make all that many waves, it’s another sign that COVID is here to stay for the foreseeable future — along with all the complications it brings to managing a workplace.

And that’s just the COVID part of the equation. There’s plenty of other business dangers lurking around every corner. Clients continue to pressure us for lower rates, more deliverables, and higher cost predictability. Alternative legal service providers and the Big Four accounting firms continue to eat away market share directly or otherwise provide services to help clients clamp down on their use of outside counsel. Just [a few weeks ago](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/deloitte-and-persuit-announce-a-joint-teaming-to-transform-legal-department-external-spend-and-financial-management-301422076.html), for instance, Deloitte announced it’s pushing all in on legal-spend management consulting and software for in-house legal departments. State governments continue to explore opening the monopoly that’s long insulated us from normal market pressures.

So don’t be fooled by the booming markets and strong gains. Running a law firm in 2022 will be as challenging as it’s ever been, and none of our industry’s issues are going to get any easier to resolve.

Getting Gritty With It

So what is a law firm leader to do? “Despair” doesn’t work, nor does “hide away from the world in your pajamas watching Netflix and eating ice cream.” As George Bernard Shaw said, “Forget about likes and dislikes. They are of no consequence. Just do what must be done. This may not be happiness, but it is greatness.”

As leaders, we need to be preparing ourselves for 2022 to be a time of stoicism. Perseverance and persistence are going to be our watchwords, because we don’t have any choice but to keep going.

And let’s be clear up front, dealing with these issues will be an emotional and physical drain. Even in the best of times, leadership can be a terrible burden. It falls to leaders to keep our chins up and keep pushing forward, even when we’ve got nothing left. We need to be prepared to carry our teammates when they fall, but we often feel like we can’t afford to fall ourselves for fear of what impact that will have on the teams we’re leading. So how do we keep pressing the gas when our tanks feel like they ran dry ages ago?

Fill Your Stocking — And Your Team’s

A good start would be to take this holiday season to reexamine and reaffirm the boundaries between your professional and personal lives. Many law firm leaders (and I firmly count myself among them) spend an exorbitant amount of time on their professional lives. It’s easy to let the practice bleed into one’s personal space, and once that bleed begins it’s hard to stop. The practice of law rewards those who sacrifice their nights, weekends, and personal relationships at its altar. That sacrifice is one everyone in our profession needs to think about before it’s too late. There’s no point in having a fat retirement account if we don’t have anyone to share our retirement with, or worse yet if we stress ourselves out so much that we never make it to retirement at all.

Our personal time and relationships are how we rest, recharge, and grow as people. Time away from the office, ideally surrounded by loved ones and out of your normal headspace, is the perfect time to prioritize and strategize ways to make life better. Understanding your boundaries and keeping them firm are going to be crucial to surviving and thriving in the coming year.

Keeping your home life healthy is just half the battle, though. Once the presents are put away and the holiday decorations taken down, it will be time again to focus on the teams we lead. If the risk of the coming year is disconnection and burnout, the solution is reinforcing the bonds that keeps us together. Take time to get your teams together, building the memories and friendships that can carry them through the doldrums they’ll be going into with their own version of COVID Year 3. Grab lunch or happy hour with a co-worker not because you need to go over strategy or internally network, but because you want to spend time with them. Too many attorneys I’ve known, especially young associates, find themselves feeling like they’re slipping away from the team around them. The more we can do to reach out our hands and show that we value them, the better we’ll all weather this long coming year.

The marathon isn’t even close to over, but you’re not running this thing alone. Take care of your teams and your loved ones this holiday season, and you’ll take care of yourself in the process.

# Vault ‘Quality Of Life’ Rankings: The Best Law Firms To Work For In America (2024)
## There's been a major shakeup in the rankings. Did your law firm make the cut this time around?

Last week, Vault released the [2024 edition](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/vault-100-rankings-2024/) of its closely watched law firm rankings, proving that money — in the form of Cravath’s perennially competitive pay scale — can buy prestige.

But can that money buy happiness?

In a companion ranking to the Vault 100, associates were asked to rank their own law firms based on categories most relevant to their overall quality of life, including satisfaction; firm culture; hours; compensation; quality of work; business outlook; career outlook; associate/partner relations; transparency; formal and informal training; pro bono; and overall diversity.

Fifty firms were ranked for Vault’s 2024 Best Law Firms to Work For survey, which was conducted from January 2023 through March 2023, so we’re getting a bird’s eye view of life at these firms when worries about layoffs are at top of mind and frustration abounds about forced returns to the office. This may be surprising for some, but only one of the firms that made the Top 10 list for being the most prestigious made the Top 10 list for being a best firm to work for.

There was a huge amount of movement in the Top 10 this year. Which firms made the cut? Without any further ado, here are the [Top 10 Best Law Firms to Work For](https://firsthand.co/best-companies-to-work-for/law/best-law-firms-to-work-for) based on Vault’s Annual Associate Survey for 2024:

1. Clifford Chance US
2. O’Melveny & Myers
3. McDermott Will & Emery (tie)
3. Morgan Lewis & Bockius (tie)
5. BakerHostetler
6. Orrick
7. Fried Frank
8. Proskauer Rose
9. Dechert
10. Gibson Dunn

We’ll say it again: only ONE of the firms that listed here made it into the Top 10 of the Vault prestige ranking. Can you name nine firms that have been overworking their associates? We can!

In happier news for associate quality of life, Clifford Chance really stole the show this year, taking not just the No. 1 spot in the overall ranking for each major category (Overall Best Law Firm to Work For, Overall Diversity, and Overall Best Summer Associate Program), placed in the top 10 for every quality of life category, and took home the top spot in 15 out of 26 rankings in all. “If you want to work at a large, prestigious firm with top quality of life attributes, Clifford Chance is the place to be,” said Carter Isham, Senior Law Editor at Vault.

Congratulations to each of the Biglaw firms that made the latest edition of the Vault Best Firms to Work For rankings, and a huge congratulations to Clifford Chance for completely sweeping the rankings.

# Having Summer Associates Work From The Office Is The Perfect Ploy To Make Associates Return
## Biglaw firms are trying to return to the (pre-COVID) old days when it comes to their summer programs.

If summer associates are in the office, they will be assigned mentors, and those mentors are all going to have to be in the office as well to interact with them, train them, and go to events. It’s something that hasn’t happened in the last few years, and if it works, they’ll have full offices next fall.

— [George Wolf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wolf7/), leader of Aon’s Law Firm Advisory Team, commenting on how the large summer associate class sizes that Biglaw firms are soon due to welcome may be a [strategy to draw associates back into the fold](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/05/12/big-law-firms-welcome-larger-summer-associate-classes-to-in-office-work-events-and-entertainment/) as they transition to in-office work post-pandemic. Many firms are expecting their summers to [work in the office three or four days](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/biglaw-firms-want-summer-associates-working-in-person-which-means-lawyers-need-to-show-up-too/) each week. As far as the larger than usual size of firms’ incoming summer classes, Wolf tied it to those who have left their firms in the ongoing associate talent wars. “I think they’re guarding against greater attrition rates.”

# Partners Should Not Fear Their Friends When Making Hiring Decisions
## Beware: Some partners won't hire lawyers from friends' firms out of fear of upsetting those friends.

Partners need to consider a variety of factors when they decide to hire an associate. Often, the academic credentials of an applicant are important so a partner can gauge whether a candidate has the ability to process information well and is wiling to put in the hard work to succeed at the job. In addition, an applicant’s work history is important in determining if an applicant has the experience in an area of law that is relevant to what an applicant will be doing in a new position. However, for some partners, not pissing off their friends is also an important consideration during the hiring process. Sometimes, partners do not wish to hire associates who used to work for their friends at different law firms, and this can make it difficult for associates to advance in their careers. Such behavior is unfair, and partners should choose the best associate regardless of whether this will upset the friends of a partner.

I first experienced this phenomenon within the legal profession about five years ago when I was looking for new opportunities in my career. At the time, I was not seriously considering starting a law firm, and I thought I would be happier working at another law firm. Accordingly, I applied to a law firm that offered a higher salary and which had a team I knew would be a good fit for me based on my background in a given area of the law.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
After submitting my resume, I got a phone call from one of the partners at this shop. I somewhat knew this partner from depositions and court appearances, and I was surprised that she personally called me in response to my application. This partner generally asked me why I wanted to leave my current position, and I told her that I thought I would be a better fit at her shop from what I knew about the firm from my experiences. This partner asked me if there was anything wrong with my current shop, and I responded that there were no glaring issues but that I would be more comfortable in a new position.

However, the partner told me that she was good friends with a partner who worked at my firm. This partner at the other shop conveyed that she did not want to upset her friend by hiring me because this could create ill will between her and one of my current bosses. This potential employer said that she did not want to interrupt the team that her friend, my current boss, had created, and so, that employer would not consider my candidacy for the open position.

This really upset me. I wanted to leave the firm at which I was currently employed. Due to politics and friendships rather than any other factor about my candidacy, I was being prevented from being considered for this new position. I did not care if taking a new position at a different shop would ruffle some feathers among old friends, I just wanted to secure the best position as I progressed in my career.

I think it is really unfair if partners make hiring decisions based on their personal friendships rather than whether a candidate would be a good associate at a firm. The legal industry should strive to be a meritocracy. As such, only valuable factors about a candidate, like their experience in the legal arena, should be the determinants for whether an associate is hired. This helps ensure that a firm gets the best candidates for each job.

In addition, it is completely unfair for job candidates to get punished for working with a friend of a partner from a hiring firm. It is not the job candidate’s fault that interpersonal complexities might make it awkward if a job candidate moves from one firm to another. Associates cannot predict who knows who within the legal industry, and cannot do anything to avoid a situation in which a partner has a friendship that might make a given hiring decision awkward. Another candidate should not be hired based on such interpersonal relationships when this is not really reflective of whether a job candidate will be a good attorney at a given law firm. Partners should be more mature and only base hiring decisions on objective characteristics of an associate.

All told, the legal industry is much smaller than people might think, and it is true that hiring decisions can strain interpersonal relationships. Nevertheless, partners need to grow up and make hiring decisions solely based on whether a job candidate will make a good attorney at a given shop and not whether hiring decisions will ruffle the feathers of a partner’s friend.

# Paul Weiss Launches Supreme Court Practice As Press Spotlight Returns To Partnership Diversity
## The arrival of a partner of color refocuses the discussion on what firms need to do to address diversity.

Paul Weiss has long considered a focused appellate and Supreme Court practice, but never felt ready to pull the trigger until it could land a “superstar” to lead the practice. That all changed over the weekend when the firm announced it would be [bringing in Kannon Shanmugam from Williams & Connolly](https://www.law.com/2019/01/27/kannon-shanmugam-exits-williams-connolly-to-launch-paul-weiss-appeals-practice/) to launch the dedicated practice group and help lead the firm’s D.C. office.

The relocation plays into a rousing match of Supreme Court advocacy musical chairs underway with [Lisa Blatt departing Arnold & Porter to head back to Williams & Connolly](https://www.law.com/2019/01/27/lisa-blatt-rejoins-williams-connolly-this-time-as-supreme-court-practice-head/) to head its Supreme Court practice. Busy times.

Shanmugam’s move would be newsworthy in any event, but the vagaries of timing make it impossible to consider this high-profile move in light of the [Paul Weiss’s recently elevated all-white (and almost exclusively male) partnership class](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/paul-weiss-press-release-captures-everything-broken-about-biglaw-in-one-image/). Just as the firm touted Sahnmugam’s arrival, [the New York Times published a deep dive into Biglaw’s diversity woes](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/us/paul-weiss-partner-diversity-law-firm.html) focusing on Paul Weiss’s new class.

The article by Noam Scheiber and John Eligon frames the discussion by reminding everyone that, among Biglaw firms, Paul Weiss has one of America’s best records when it comes to diversity.

Paul, Weiss, with its 144 partners and about 1,000 lawyers, is, in fact, more diverse at the partner level than most of its peers. It has more African-American partners with an ownership stake, six, than a large majority of the country’s 200 biggest firms, and far more than elite competitors like Cravath, Debevoise & Plimpton and Davis Polk.

Women make up 23 percent of partners at Paul, Weiss, compared with 18 percent across the top 200 firms, according to data collected by ALM Intelligence.

But those laudable successes still don’t paint a picture of perfection. High-profile women like Beth Wilkinson, Alexandra Walsh, and Robbie Kaplan have left of late to start their own firms — great moves for them personally, but losing so many women in these roles forces the firm to work even harder to guarantee the future reflects the diversity it’s lost. The article details the hit-and-miss nature of mentoring programs that attempt to nurture young lawyers, but often can’t overcome the unconscious biases that exist across Biglaw:

But many of these young lawyers described a complicated reality, in which young minorities are welcomed at the firm and then frequently sidelined.

Some complained that people in power held them to different standards than their white male peers, or punished them more severely for mistakes.

“I think associates of color are absolutely justified in feeling like they have less margin for error,” said Jason Williamson, who was an associate at Paul, Weiss from 2008 to 2011 and now works at the American Civil Liberties Union. While this may be true at many workplaces, said Mr. Williamson, who is black, it is particularly so at big law firms.

At the risk of minimizing the significance of the problem, what Biglaw firms — even those making earnest efforts — need to understand is that addressing diversity is a lot like losing weight. What I mean is the slow creep of added pounds, like the cumulative structural impact of unchecked conscious and unconscious biases, didn’t happen overnight and it’s not going to be fixed by having salads for lunch. Mentorship programs and conscious efforts to account for diversity are necessary but they cannot adequately solve the problem by themselves because this isn’t realistically a problem to be “solved.” It’s a lifestyle change that requires a persistent efforts to stave off destructive habits.

And that’s OK! It’s not a “failure” just because a firm can’t solve discrimination overnight. It’s about doing what you can — constantly — and remaining constantly open to doing more. Firms have to be open about needing to scrutinize and be ready to overhaul practices they’ve taken for granted for years. Paul Weiss reacted to the press coverage occasioned by their unfortunate partnership class announcement — complete with an image that conveyed to many women and minority associates, accurately or not, the anxiety over career advancement they often feel in Biglaw culture — with a pledge to address the issue. That’s a good thing and shouldn’t be discounted. One solution offered by the firm was an influx of diverse laterals over the coming months.

And with the arrival of Shanmugam, an established Supreme Court advocate from one of Washington’s top shops, the firm begins to make good on this specific pledge, bolstering the firm’s practice while simultaneously adding a person of color to a high-profile position within the firm.

Now, Shanmugam, a FedSoc lifer who clerked for former Fourth Circuit judge Michael Luttig and Justice Antonin Scalia, finds himself an avatar of Paul Weiss’s efforts to improve the diversity that his mentors long railed against as unimportant.

Interesting times we live in.

# The Law Schools Where The Most Graduates Got Federal Clerkships (2023)
## These law schools may help you get the most prestigious jobs.

Do you like prestige? Of course you do. Is there really a law student who doesn’t? That being said, if you’re like the majority of your colleagues and you’d like to embark upon one of the most prestigious career paths available to recent law school graduates, then you’ll probably want to compete for an elite federal clerkship.

The American Bar Association recently released new employment data for the Class of 2023, and thanks to an analysis made by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/these-law-schools-dominated-federal-clerk-hiring-market-2023-2024-04-25/), we now know which law schools “dominated” the clerkship market by sending the highest percentage of graduates into federal clerkships.

According to the ABA data, just 3.4% of the class of 2023 found work as federal clerks. The 10 law schools that sent the highest percentage of graduates into these clerkships are responsible for a third of all clerkships across the country.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Without further ado, these are the top 10 schools for clerkships:

- Chicago: 25.35%
- Yale: 24.11%
- Stanford: 20.77%
- Notre Dame: 18.18%
- Michigan: 14.01%
- UVA: 13.73%
- Texas: 13.00%
- Harvard: 11.58%
- Duke: 10.92%
- BYU: 9.91%
You can access the full list by clicking [here](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/these-law-schools-dominated-federal-clerk-hiring-market-2023-2024-04-25/).

Way to go, Chicago! The elite school makes its return to the top spot for clerkships after being pushed down to No. 3 for the class of 2022, coming in behind Stanford and Yale. Chicago had previously dominated the list for the classes of 2020 and 2021. Yale and Stanford still clocked in at the top of the heap for the class of 2023, despite conservative judges boycotting hiring from the schools.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
An obvious point to make here is that these rankings don’t distinguish between prestige of clerkship. Were these feeder judges or non-feeder judges, circuit courts or district courts, Article III courts or non-Article III courts? In the land of law, these things are important. Considering how coveted federal clerkships are, we’d absolutely love to see this information. If you have it, please feel free to email us.

Congratulations to all of these law schools on helping their graduates get federal clerkships. Check back with us next year to see if Chicago is able to hold onto the top spot.

# Biglaw Firm Shakes Things Up With New Name, Font, And Office
## Biglaw firm has fun with fonts.

New Milbank logo

Biglaw firms have a reputation for being resistant to change. By their nature, lawyers tend to be risk adverse, and changes — especially big ones — are just loaded with risks. But when the powers that be at Milbank decided to shake things up, they really went for it.

The Biglaw firm that [kicked off the 2018 summer raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) has changed its name — from Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy to just Milbank LLP, its logo — from a chunky red font to a more elegant design complete with serifs, and its location — from the downtown Wall Street area to the [trendy Hudson Yards](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/a-look-at-boies-schillers-brand-new-offices-in-new-yorks-hottest-new-neighborhood/). Phew, that’s a lot all at once — nothing like ripping the change bandaid off!

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Old Milbank logo

The two partners that helped to shepherd the firm through the rebranding process are [Christopher Gaspar](https://www.milbank.com/en/professionals/christopher-j-gaspar.html) and [Paul Denaro](https://www.milbank.com/en/professionals/paul-denaro.html). They told Above the Law the rebranding effort is designed to create a more modern feel that the entire international firm can get behind. The move to ditch [Tweed, Hadley & McCloy](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/when-leaving-cravath-is-the-best-decision-for-your-career/) from the name of the firm was approved unanimously, and will help get the firm united under a single name — no errant MTHMs or Milbank Tweeds anymore.

Denaro told me it was a long process to make the rebranding change, and it was timed to synchronize with the firm’s move away from their downtown Wall Street location such that the move was both “symbolic and physical.” Though the firm maintains a strong financial institution practice, Denaro said the firm has “grown dramatically and moved away from our Wall Street roots.” The rebranding helps the firm “shed the past” and so a new name, new logo, new marketing materials, new business cards, new website, new… everything was pushed out all at once across the entire global firm.

Gaspar said the new logo is “elegant, and meant to be modern” in order to reflect that Milbank is a “modern firm but still not walk away from the 153-year heritage and history.” Gaspar also emphasized the branding change extended beyond the New York office. Milbank is a global firm and the change to the firm’s “visual identity” was made across the board.

# Goodbye To All That
## Our profession is not the only one wrestling with the issue of when the younger people can take control.

Here’s a riddle for you: when is old too old? I can answer that question for myself. However, this is not about me. It’s about other people, like Pauline Newman, Dianne Feinstein, and yes, Joe Biden. (I could include Donald Trump in the mix, but I won’t.) When are you too old to be a judge, to be a senator, to be a president? To be a CEO? To be a managing partner of a law firm?

A lot of people are asking those questions, given the current landscape of old folks still in charge of so much. (And let’s put aside potential age-discrimination issues.) Is it a reluctance to relinquish power? Is it that we haven’t mentored and helped younger generations to take on leadership responsibilities? Is it that we old people are unwilling to acknowledge that age can be more than just a number? I am not suggesting that there should be competency tests for those of us who are of a certain age or older. As we all know, you can be brilliant in your 80s and 90s and dumb as a rock in your 40s. But I wonder if we are depriving leadership opportunities to those younger than us who are chomping at the bit to get going.

Pauline Newman, a federal circuit judge on the D.C. Circuit, is [suing her colleagues](https://www.newsweek.com/95-year-old-judge-sues-colleagues-retire-1804558), claiming that they have tried to force her to retire. She is 95 with a lifetime appointment. Her colleagues have formed an “investigative committee” to determine whether she is able both physically and mentally to continue her work as an appellate judge — the oldest active federal judge in the nation. Newman alleges that, among other things, the chief judge has refused to assign any new cases to her as a vehicle to pressure her to retire.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Newman’s case raises a whole slew of issues about lawyers and judges and how and when they should exit the stage. Part of the problem for many lawyers (and judges as well) is the lack of planning for this next stage of life. In other words, “Now what?” Many lawyers have focused on the law to the exclusion of just about everything else, and so, when they do retire, whether voluntarily or with a well-placed foot on the butt, they are often totally adrift. How to use all the skills honed over decades of practice? How to leverage the legal knowledge that these people have in ways small and large that may benefit others? There aren’t any answers that readily come to mind, and no, pro bono work is not necessarily the answer. Many lawyers, whether paid or not, are done representing clients.

Take comfort, however small it may be, that our profession is not the only one wrestling with the issue of when the younger people can take control. In a recent article in Vanity Fair magazine, the talent agency business (remember I live in Lala Land) is seeing [defections of younger agents](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/03/entertainment-industry-talent-agents) who are tired of waiting for the old guard to leave.

As the article relates, the “old guard,” now in their sixties, has reminded the younger agents that “60 is the new 40.”

One younger agent said, “I was like, fuck no, it’s not,” He thought that the oldsters “are never going to leave.” So, it’s not the old guard leaving, it’s the young ones who see their road to accession blocked, maybe not permanently, but at least for the foreseeable future.

Who wants to wait to be 73 to be crowned king? We all know one who had to do so but given that the rest of us are not royalty in any sense except perhaps in our own minds, waiting is no longer the only option. As the article points out, if these younger ones do wait, they could be chanting the same mantra in 20 years, that “60 is the new 40.” History does repeat itself.

What the article also points out is the generational shift underway and not just for talent agents. It’s for lawyers as well. General counsel and others who referred business to the oldsters have retired or are no longer able to do that. The younger lawyers have their own sources of business (or they should) and so the need to rely upon the largesse of gray-haired leaders is diminishing. Client demands are also shifting. The younger people aren’t impressed with conference rooms the size of bowling alleys nor are they impressed with the trappings that their fees are funding.

We’ve all seen how the pandemic has changed the provision of legal services. And what we’ve also seen is how lawyers want to be more in control of their own lives, their own careers. While there will always be a “Biglaw,” just like “[there will always be an England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27ll_Always_Be_an_England),” work-life balance is no longer just a mantra, but a life-career choice. As one of the younger talent agents in the Vanity Fair article noted, the oldsters run the shop. “But I just kept coming back to, why work for anybody again? It’s their agency. It’s their vision. It just felt the most appropriate next step for me was to do something that was at least partly mine.”

Sound familiar? It does to anyone who has pondered what next and has decided that the best thing is to take a leap, accompanied by the new technologies that are changing the face of practice today and clients who are tech-savvy and want services provided in more efficient and economical ways. This is not your parents’ profession anymore.

And if we need any proof of that, Staci Zaretsky’s post about a would-be Biglaw partner who said “[goodbye to all that](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/eli-albrecht-biglaw-partner-work-life-balance/)” is precisely on point. Res ipsa loquitur.

# Well, That's Dumb
## What do you think is the *worst* law?

As lawyers, we’re obliged to uphold the law…. but that doesn’t always mean you agree with it. Attorneys are in a unique position to know the underbelly of the system of laws that govern our society.

So, we want to know, what is *the* worst law?

Perhaps it’s the fact that qualified immunity — the doctrine that lets police get away with pretty much everything — was a [goddamn scrivener’s error](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/police-can-legally-set-you-on-fire-because-someone-in-the-1800s-made-a-copying-error/). And what about the [immunity of the gun industry](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/the-law-the-needs-to-be-repealed-immediately-to-bring-gun-makers-to-heel/)? That only makes the American gun problem worse. Maybe it’s the[ injustice of the felony murder](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/it-looks-like-sotomayor-is-1-of-3-supreme-court-justices-who-actually-believes-the-whole-do-the-crime-do-the-time-thing/) rule? Speaking of injustice, maybe [mandatory minimums](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/scotus-plays-hell-with-congressional-intent-in-mandatory-minimums-case/) infuriate you. Let’s not get started on the [dumb immigration laws](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/why-does-the-doj-prosecute-20000-people-a-year-for-immigration-crimes/). We’ve all witnessed the wild results the [electoral college yields](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/why-is-the-electoral-college-constitutional/). Or maybe you’re annoyed by the simple power grabs like towns putting an [age limit on trick or treating](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/you-are-too-old-to-trick-or-treat-like-by-law/).

[Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/morning-docket/)
# Morning Docket: 11.15.17
## * Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell thinks that the people of Alabama should choose Attorney General Jeff Sessions as a write-in candidate to replace alleged pederast Roy Moore on the ballot for his former seat, but the AG has no desire to return to the Senate. [[NPR](https://www.npr.org/2017/11/14/564071391/ryan-sessions-add-to-gop-voices-saying-moore-accusers-are-credible)] * The Ninth Circuit has temporarily allowed part of Travel Ban 3.0 to proceed. While that means issuances of visas to citizens of Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen will be restricted, there's a catch. Applicants with concrete ties to the country will be exempt. [[POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/13/trump-travel-ban-federal-court-order-244844)] * Wisconsin is so desperate to get lawyers to help indigent criminal defendants in rural areas that lawmakers have introduced new legislation that calls for the state to fund law school loan payments of up to $20,000 a year in exchange for the representation of these clients in need. [[Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel](http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2017/11/14/get-lawyers-represent-poor-rural-clients-lawmakers-want-state-cover-their-student-loans/858514001/)] * Newsflash: In-house legal departments are planning to spend more on outside counsel in 2018. This is the first time this will have happened in more than a decade. Hopefully Biglaw's fee hikes don't come back to bite them. [[Corporate Counsel](https://www.law.com/sites/corpcounsel/2017/11/14/general-counsel-looking-to-increase-outside-counsel-spend-in-2018/)] * After a two-month national postal survey, Australians have voted ""overwhelmingly"" in favor of same-sex marriage. Now it's up to the country's government to work out the details of the bill that will bring marriage equality down under. Congrats!

# Biglaw Partner Accused Of Sexual Harassment Comes Out Swinging
## He's not taking the allegations lightly.

Joel Katz

Yesterday we [told you about the allegations](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/01/biglaw-partner-accused-of-sexual-harassment-by-former-grammys-ceo/?rf=1) swirling around Greenberg Traurig partner Joel Katz. The founder of the firm’s entertainment practice was accused by the former president and CEO of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Academy, Deborah Dugan, of sexual harassment. According to the complaint, Katz made overtures to Dugan, repeatedly calling her “baby” and making comments on her appearance at a work dinner.

Dugan also says that when she reported the “boys’ club” mentality of the Academy to HR she was put on administrative leave. The Academy takes the position that Dugan didn’t complain about the alleged harassment until there were allegations that Dugan created a “toxic and intolerable” work environment.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Now that you’ve gotten that quick refresher on the allegations at play, it’s time for Katz’s statement on the matter. His comments go on the offensive, calling the claims in the complaint “false” that he “categorically and emphatically” denies. The full [statement](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/deborah-dugan-sues-recording-academy-ouster-1271820), made by Katz’s attorney Howard Weitzman of Kinsella Weitzman Iser Kump & Aldisert, is as follows:

“Ms. Dugan’s allegations of harassment and her description of a dinner at the steakhouse in the Ritz Carlton, Laguna Niguel are false and Mr. Katz categorically and emphatically denies her version of that evening,” says Weitzman. “This dinner meeting was 2½ months before Ms. Dugan started her job. Mr. Katz believed they had a productive and professional meeting in a restaurant where a number of members of the Board of Trustees of the Academy, and others, were dining. Ms. Dugan’s claims are made, for the first time, 7 months after this dinner took place. Mr. Katz will cooperate in any and all investigations or lawsuits by telling the absolute and whole truth. Hopefully Ms. Dugan will do the same.”

Given the strong feelings that seem to be on both sides, it’ll be interesting to see how it all plays out.

# Law School Grads: Spend Your $190K Salaries Wisely -- Or Else

‘I see MONEY in my future!’

Try to keep everything in perspective. It’s great you are making a lot of money, but it might not last forever, or even for several years. We are one recession away from law firms drastically cutting head count. And law firms have had a history of increasing salaries at precisely the wrong time.

— [Jeffrey Lowe](https://www.mlaglobal.com/consultants/jeffrey-lowe), global leader of the legal recruiting and consulting firm Major, Lindsey & Africa’s law firm practice group, advising law school graduates who may be headed to Biglaw firms that are [doling out $190K salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises-2018/) to first-year associates to [focus on their long-term goals](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/06/06/your-law-firm-is-paying-you-190k-right-out-of-law-school-now-what/), and not just their starting salaries. After all, as Lowe notes, the next [Great Lathaming](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/02/nationwide-layoff-watch-latham-cuts-440-190-associates-250-staff/) is a recession away.

With salaries in Biglaw climbing higher and higher, the only way to compete when it comes to attracting and retaining talent is to keep offering raises for associates. One firm knows this all too well, because it’s just sent word out about its third round of salary increases. Yes, you read that correctly. This firm has bumped associate salaries three times thus far in 2021… but it still hasn’t quite reached the $205K starting salary that associates have long been dreaming of. Which firm could it be?

It’s none other than Taft Law (the firm formerly known as Taft Stettinius & Hollister prior to its merger with Briggs and Morgan), a firm where salaries have been on the rise since April. As we noted previously, the firm’s first set of raises weren’t effective until July 1, and their second set of raises won’t come into play until October 1. Associates won’t have to wait a moment longer for their third set of raises, as those will be enacted on October 1 as well. This time around, each of the firm’s Ohio offices got another salary bump.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The firm will not be increasing its 1,850 billable hours requirement in light of these raises, which is even more good news for associates. Congratulations to all. Maybe before the year is out, the firm will finally meet the market.

We depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post.

[Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/morning-docket/)
# Morning Docket: 12.28.16
## * ""Absent a showing that the requested enforcement action could not shake loose a few more emails, the case is not moot."" Because 2016 isn't over yet and we love kicking horses thought to be dead, the D.C. Circuit has revived a legal challenge regarding Hillary Clinton's private email server that was once considered to be moot. [[Reuters](http://reuters.com/article/idUSKBN14G1M4)] * The Supreme Court may be taking a turn to the conservative side come 2017, but not immediately.

# This Biglaw Firm May Have Matched Bonuses, But Associates Won't See The Money For Months
## Money's nice, but people are still pissed.

To make a good bonus announcement the money has to be there, that’s a given. But there are other factors that go into delighting associates — something Paul Hastings knows all too well.

First, the good news. They’re giving associates a match of the market bonus scale set by Milbank early last month. For those that need the reminder, the prevailing bonuses are as follows, by seniority:

Class of 2018 – $15,000
Class of 2017 – $25,000
Class of 2016 – $50,000
Class of 2015 – $65,000
Class of 2014 – $80,000
Class of 2013 – $90,000
Class of 2012+ – $100,000

The bad news is that associates won’t actually get that sweet, sweet cash until March. Even though the delayed payday is standard at the firm, it doesn’t mean folks aren’t pissed. From a tipster:

Even though they matched market bonuses, I’m very disappointed with the payment dates, and I’m sure other associates are as well. All of the other top firms pay bonuses in December (or January at the latest!).

# Maybe Non-Litigators Don't Understand: No Matter What You Do, You're Always Wrong
## Why didn't you do whatever it was that you finally did do earlier?

Non-litigators have (to my eye) an unusual way of looking at the world. If you made a mistake, non-litigators wonder why you made the mistake, and they assume that, if you hadn’t made the mistake, then life would be better.
Thus: You run a pharmaceutical company. The result of some study comes in.  The study suggests that your drug could cause a previously unknown side effect.  You immediately ask your internal scientists to validate the result of the study, so that you don’t act too quickly (and incorrectly) based on information that later proves to be wrong. You confirm with the FDA that it has no objection to your warning about the new side effect. You change the label on your product to warn about the new side effect.

This sounds responsible, right?

Not to the plaintiffs who had previously suffered the side effect and immediately sue you for not having warned about it.

Why didn’t you warn about the side effect earlier, they ask.

Because the study hadn’t been done earlier.

Why didn’t you do the study earlier?

No one was focused on this possible side effect. It came out of the blue.

Why wasn’t anyone focused on this side effect? You run a billion-dollar company, for heaven’s sake. It’s your drug. Who the heck was supposed to focus on the possible side effects if not you?

Not only that: Why did you take so long to warn about the side effect after you knew the result of the study?

Because we had to validate the result of the study.

And that took you two months? You run a billion-dollar company filled with hot and cold running scientists. You couldn’t have assigned a few more scientists to the project and validated the study more quickly? How irresponsible of you!

See? It doesn’t matter what you do; you’re always wrong.

Here’s another example:

You get sued for a billion dollars for breach of contract. Clause 1, which governs this dispute and which the plaintiff focuses on, is in fact a little ambiguous. A non-litigator might think: “What a shame that someone drafted clause 1 that way.  If clause 1 had only been drafted differently, there would be no lawsuit.”

But every litigator knows that’s wrong.  Suppose the contract had been drafted differently.  You still would have been sued.  With a billion dollars on the line, the lawyers on the other side weren’t going to give up just because clause 1 looked okay.  They were instead going to find some other ambiguity in clause 1. Or maybe they wouldn’t have sued you over clause 1; they would have sued you for the ambiguity in clause 2 instead. Or clause 3 or 4. The one thing that’s inconceivable is that the other side would say you did a fine job drafting the contract. There always was going to be a lawsuit; no matter what you did, you always did something wrong.

In this respect, politics is precisely the same as high-stakes litigation. The other side has lots of money and lots of people thinking about how they can criticize you, and those people are motivated entirely by finding fault with what you did. It doesn’t matter what you do; the other side will always say that you did something wrong.

Suppose there’s a war in Ukraine. You fund the Ukrainian defense. Why did you give so little money to Ukraine? Why didn’t you give better weapons more quickly? Why didn’t you give even better weapons even more quickly than that?

In the end, Ukraine wins. Look at the turmoil that you created in Russia! By supporting Ukraine, you’ve created the possibility of civil war in Russia, which means that nuclear weapons may fall into the hands of thugs. Why didn’t you anticipate that and prevent it?

Or Ukraine loses. Look at all the money and weapons you wasted in Ukraine, and Ukraine lost anyway! And Ukraine isn’t vital to any American interest! What kind of idiot are you?

See? It doesn’t matter. You were always wrong, no matter what you did.

As a litigator, you develop an immunity to this. Over the course of years, you stop worrying about whether you (or your client) could have avoided a problem, and you focus only on what the plaintiff’s next argument will be.

I hope you, as a politician, figure out what you believe to be the best course of action, and you act.

But you act with absolute knowledge that you’ll be criticized for whatever you do.  It makes no difference what you do, because you have a well-funded, smart opponent who is highly motivated to find fault in your conduct.

Don’t be surprised. This is the way of the world. But maybe only litigators and politicians realize it.

Yesterday, the Department of Justice announced that the Biglaw firm of Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer, along with legal staffing company Law Resources, will pay a civil penalty to settle discrimination claims. The settlement, totaling $56,500, is for claims that Law Resources, at the direction of Arnold & Porter, refused to hire U.S. citizens with dual citizenship and non-U.S. citizens with work authorization for a document review project in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2020/07/23/arnold-porter-to-pay-civil-penalty-for-discrimination-in-doc-review-project/) Law.com, the claims were originated by attorney Temitope Ogunrinu. A DOJ investigation revealed dual citizens and non-citizens with work authorization were excluded from the project as a result of Arnold & Porter’s improper interpretation of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. It also found that Law Resources retaliated against Ogunrinu as a result of her objection to the restriction.

Assistant attorney general Eric Dreiband made a statement about the settlement:

“The United States of America is the land of opportunity, and the United States government remains committed fully to the fundamental principle that in this country, all people authorized by law to work should be able to pursue happiness by earning a living without suffering the indignity of discrimination because of where they came from,” assistant attorney general Eric Dreiband of the Civil Rights Division said in a statement. “Our law protects this ideal in many ways, including by prohibiting unlawful citizenship status restrictions in hiring.”

Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer said the following about the case:

“This case involves a single incident where the firm mistakenly provided a third-party vendor inaccurate information about the criteria for selecting contractors for a document review,” the firm said in a statement. “As soon as this inadvertent mistake was brought to our attention, the Firm took steps to prevent it from happening again. Additionally, we cooperated fully with the IER in resolving the matter.”

And, as Dreiband went on to say, “We look forward to working with Law Resources and Arnold & Porter to ensure their hiring procedures fully comply with the Immigration and Nationality Act’s prohibition against citizenship status discrimination in employment.”

# Bar Tabs: High Life Dreams Meet A Sober Reality
## At least you'll be able to afford a therapist with that Biglaw money!

Law ain’t for everyone. And for the 0L reading this who thinks, “Yeah, maybe not for them, but I’m different,” please re-read the first sentence. While I don’t have the data on this, I think that a lot of people start law school assuming that this will be the thing that lets them live the life they’ve deserved for so long. Money, prestige, the ability to use Latin conversationally and be understood — all the stuff they sell you in the brochure. And the truth is, it may very well be. But committing to law schools, like most investments, is best made with a sober mind and information about the windfalls and the downturns.

I got swept up in the excitement of OCI last year and landed what I thought would be a really great job at a large firm in a large market. With the summer program ending in the next few weeks, I have come to the realization that this just is not right for me.

No number of happy hours or fancy lunches can obscure how stressed everyone is. The work I’m doing is pretty uninteresting and very unsatisfying. The pay is obviously unmatched, but I’m realizing that I can live a happy and more balanced life on much less (Note: I’m lucky to have very little debt, which is a huge privilege when I talk about this stuff).

I’m now looking at some legal services offices in my area, but I’m worried that I have not demonstrated sufficient commitment to public service. I’m also looking at clerkships and positions in my local government. Meanwhile, I keep hearing people worry about a recession and I’m scared that if an offer comes from my firm, turning it down would be a huge mistake.

This comes from a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/vvq8ym/biglaw_is_wrong_for_me/) asking fellow associates-to-be if they’ve got any advice on dealing with the stress and boredom that firm life can come with (outside of the job security, happy hours, and free food). If you’ve ever been cautioned about the importance of getting to know the culture of a workplace and brushed it of because hey, six figures are six figures, I heavily encourage you to read some of the feedback from folks who’ve spent some time at Biglaw firms. Some folks did their best to avoid the golden handcuffs:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
I hated every second of BL. I banked enough over 2 years to buy a house then called it quits. There’s life at the end of the tunnel.

…

I made the mistake of working at an elite litigation boutique (because prestige is a powerful drug). All that meant was lean staffing so a ton of work at unpredictable hours. I stayed because it was good experience and I didn’t know where I wanted to go next.

And it is always nice to see what firms say about gender, equity, work/life balance and the like, but you should also do your due diligence and [see what they do about those issues](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/this-biglaw-firm-is-flip-flopping-harder-than-ihop-on-supporting-the-right-to-choose/) when push comes to billable hours. And this isn’t an attempt to doom and gloom you out of what could be your dream — we at ATL occasionally hear legends of people in Biglaw who actually enjoy their jobs — I just want for you to [make sure that your assumptions about getting paid post-JD are accurate](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/the-bimodal-salary-of-starting-lawyers/).

I think you should sit down and really think about your goals. The first few years of your career are going to be hard and stressful no matter what you do; the learning curve from law student to lawyer is just really steep. I hated most of my time in biglaw, but it was 100% the right choice for me. It allowed me to buy my first home and set me up for a really great job that I could not have gotten straight out of law school. If you go into BL knowing your goals, exit strategy, and how long you want to stay, you can mitigate a lot of the stress/unpleasantness. The people truly working themselves to the bone are usually people operating under the delusion that they’ll make partner one day. You don’t have to be that person.

Are you in touch with anyone in their first few years out of law school? It may be a good idea to get their input on what you should expect. I usually make alcohol puns here, but much information can be gained over a cup of coffee.

# In-House Counsel Are More Than Just Their Job Descriptions
## What surprised me when I went in-house, though, was the phone calls from other employees in the organization with questions that were about everything and anything under the sun.

Over the past 12 years, I have held a variety of in-house roles at several different organizations. In these organizations, my duties and responsibilities were exactly what I expected. In fact, my duties and responsibilities were much like the duties and responsibilities of other lawyers working in-house I knew had.

- I provided advice to the organization’s executive officers, board, and staff on a wide variety of legal issues.
- I served as legal advisor on employment law-related matters, including strategic human resources initiatives, employee relations, benefits, compensation, and recruiting.
- I provided business-minded legal guidance and direction to relating to matters such as hiring, transitions, discipline, investigations, and wage-and hour matters.
- I provided strategic counsel supporting the development and drafting of employment-related policies and procedures.
- I supervised outside counsel handling civil litigation and administrative proceedings.
- I assisted with the development of litigation strategy and coordinated with outside counsel.
- I provided legal support to business units regarding procurement, contracts, and brand protection efforts.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
What surprised me when I went in-house, though, was the other thing I did consistently on a day-to-day basis that was not in my job description. I fielded phone calls from other employees in the organization with questions that were not purely “legal” in nature. They called about everything and anything under the sun. Sometimes they had a problem they needed help solving and just did not know where to turn. Other times they had a solution to a problem, but they wanted to run it past someone to make sure there was not something they were missing.

Some say that taking these calls is not an efficient use of an in-house counsel’s time. I, however, would beg to differ. For me, it was these very calls that helped me do my job better. When I was able to approach these calls with an enthusiastic and helpful attitude, I could turn them into pleasant and productive interactions that allowed me to establish a rapport with my fellow employees. When you establish rapport, you can build positive relationships necessary to do your job well.

Providing Good, Old-Fashioned Customer Service

Establishing rapport and providing top-notch, first-class customer service should matter to everyone regardless of direct customer contact. Even if you don’t work directly with customers, you work with employees who do. It’s your job as in-house counsel to assist and support these employees so it only makes sense for you to consider them as your customers.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
How do you ensure you are providing first-class customer service? Start by thinking of the legal department as a business. For a business to survive, it needs a service potential customers want or need. To succeed and thrive, a business needs to convert potential customers into actual customers.

How does that happen? You make a prospective customer feel like you care about their problems. You work hard to provide a service that makes their life easier. You help customers resolve their problems. You create a customer-oriented culture. When a business unit within the organization is satisfied with the work of the legal department, that unit will not only continue to engage with the legal department, that business unit will encourage other business units to do the same. These referrals boost the legal department’s brand internally and foster a sense of trust and partnership. When this happens, it means that there is a greater chance business units will bring you in earlier when there is a potential legal problem.

How Do You Provide Good Customer Service?

It is not as difficult as it might seem. When you field calls, it doesn’t mean that you always tell your customers what they want to hear. It does not mean that every strategic initiative for which you provide support will likely be successful. It just means that you will show you care by getting to know your customer, getting to know what your customers do, and helping to make their jobs easier.

For an in-house legal counsel, getting to know the customer means learning all there is to know about your organization as well as each of the individual business units within it. Take the time to learn what each business unit does, how the business unit does its work, and how that business unit interacts with internal and external partners. Take the time to do these things and you’ll be in a better position to support the business units and make their day-to-day work easier.

Serve your customers well and you’ll serve the organization well. You’ll be in a better position to anticipate needs and provide input, and identify and describe potential risks, which may have gone unnoticed by the executive team. When you understand the needs, goals, and daily activities of the organization’s business units, you’ll be able to speak for them when it counts internally. In short, you’ll help ensure outcomes that satisfy organizational needs and provide value to the executive team while mitigating risk for the organization.

In the end, the question really is, why wouldn’t you care about customer service?

# Dictators And Democracy In Biglaw

I’ve found myself thinking about [John Quinn](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/being-john-quinn/) lately, and not just because I’ve been in the mood for sushi at his personal restaurant. I’ve been thinking instead about the leadership style he practices and preaches as the founder and managing partner of Quinn Emanuel, one of the most successful firms in the country.

If there’s a spectrum of leadership styles with “Single Decision Maker” on one end and “Democratic Bureaucracy” on the other, Quinn Emanuel has planted its flag firmly on the side of single decision maker. I don’t think Quinn would take issue with me describing his leadership style as “benevolent dictator.” Bureaucracy is functionally nonexistent at Quinn Emanuel, at least compared to most Biglaw operations. Major decisions go through Quinn, and what he says goes.

This is very much by design. In the Quinn model, you have a dedicated leader who installs a senior team that aligns with their vision. Debate is minimized, action is prioritized, and when all goes well you have a lean, nimble leadership structure that picks a goal and moves directly toward it.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
When I interviewed Quinn a few months back, he spoke to me at length about his distaste for law firm bureaucracy. In his view, law firms default far too often to distributing their decision making, which hampers a firm’s ability to move swiftly and with a clear vision. Worst of all, per Quinn, are the firms that intentionally insert lawyers with fringe, contrarian views onto committees where their beliefs are far outside the consensus. The thought behind these kinds of moves is typically either to spark a fiery dialogue in search of better answers, or perhaps just to throw the contrarian a bone in hopes they’ll quit making so many waves. In either event, Quinn sees it as insanity. It’s a recipe for logjam, and the few changes that make it out of committee will either be milquetoast compromises or at cross-purposes with the firm’s other goals and strategies.

Given the success that this model has brought about for Quinn Emanuel, it’s something that obviously deserves to be considered seriously. But it’s also pretty easy to see that there are downsides to this sort of top-down approach.

For a start, it puts all of a firm’s leadership eggs in one basket, which leaves a firm vulnerable and directionless if something happens to that leader. It could be something like leadership [stepping down](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/burnout-flame-out-or-timeout/) to engage in some self-care, a scenario that, while it hamstrings the firm for a while, can at least be mitigated by proper planning. The nightmare scenario is the firm leader who gets hit by a bus, leaving her firm without leadership, bereft of vision, and instantly in need of a new identity.

There are also the more mundane, day-to-day challenges of the benevolent dictator style of leadership. It demands a lot of the leader in question, while also potentially leaving other members of the partnership feeling undervalued and out in the cold. For lawyers who just want to show up, build their books, and make money without worrying about firm administration, this setup can be ideal. For lawyers that want to take an active part in determining their firm’s future, it could be a nightmare.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Plenty of Biglaw firms tend toward the distributed, democratic side of the spectrum. By delegating out leadership authority, a firm creates checks and balances within the firm to ensure everyone feels like they have a voice. The firm also ensures that its systems and vision outlast the individuals who fill the current leadership roles. For a firm with a well-crafted bureaucracy, having the managing partner hit by a bus becomes more a tragic inconvenience than an existential threat.

The bureaucratic style of leadership also probably feels most natural to attorneys because, in many ways, it’s the one closest to our everyday work structures. Our clients hire us to assess problems and advise them on their next course of action. We give advice on complex issues every day. Our profession is in some ways a highly compensated “Dear Abby” column. Most attorneys are used to counseling decision makers and having their counsel valued. It’s entirely natural that most of us come to think of ourselves as pretty good at formulating and giving that advice. Is it any wonder most of us would want to be heard within our firm’s management levels as well?

Even the concept of putting contrarians on the same team makes perfect sense to the right kind of attorney. Litigators work every day within a judicial framework that assumes if you pit opposing viewpoints against one another, the better argument will eventually prevail. What John Quinn sees as insanity, many litigators would see as a normal, healthy system of keeping a firm’s decision making honest, and leaving open the door for change if a better idea comes along.

There are successful firms with management styles all along the spectrum, from absolute iron-fisted rule-by-one to fully distributed power structures. And I’ve seen attorneys flee from or gravitate toward either kind of structure. I’ve known attorneys that tired of what they thought of as a slow, unresponsive leadership structure that demanded too much of them, and chose to go somewhere that they could worry less about firm management. I’ve known other attorneys that were frustrated to no end by their inability to be heard or effect change, and chose to go somewhere more democratic to scratch that itch. In either case, the firm failed to create a reasonable expectation on the part of its attorneys of how much voice they would be expected to have. That disconnect damages morale, damages relationships, and costs firms money.

The core of the problem is that too many firms ended up with their management structure by accident of history. Maybe the firm started out ruled by a strong-willed, charismatic attorney who refused to cede power as the enterprise grew, and it remains centrally controlled long after that first great leader left their role. Maybe the firm started out tending toward voting, committee, and popular rule, and never questioned whether that continued to make sense as the number and diversity of voices grew. In either instance, if the firm hasn’t taken time recently to examine its structure, understand what it is, and ask itself if it wants to remain that way, the firm is doing a disservice to itself and its members.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Time and again, I find myself coming back to the core questions that too few firms are asking of themselves: Who are we? [Why are we here](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/why-are-you-a-lawyer-and-why-are-you-here/)? How do we best achieve our goals. A firm that knows what it wants to be will always outperform in the long run over a firm that just ambles along blindly. And a firm that can tell its partnership what to expect of its leaders is a firm that has a better shot at retaining that partnership and recruiting like-minded attorneys in the future.

Dictator or democracy, I don’t think it matters in the end. What matters is communication, clear expectations, and purposeful decision making. John Quinn knows who he is, and Quinn Emanuel is exactly what he wants it to be. Once you’ve got that, everything else will follow.

# Vault Ranks The Best Law Firms For Diversity (2024)
## Did your law firm make the cut this time around?

Over the course of the past month, Vault has rolled out a variety of law firm rankings — from the firms that are the [most prestigious](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/vault-100-rankings-2024/) to the firms that offer the [best quality of life](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/vault-best-firms-quality-of-life-2024/) to the firms with the [top-ranked practice areas in their region](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/vaults-top-law-firms-by-practice-area-and-region-2024/) — and there’s yet another important one that we’ll dive into today.

Money can buy prestige and can certainly improve your quality of life, but the diversity of your colleagues is worth more than what any Biglaw salary scale can pay.

In a companion ranking to the Vault 100, associates were asked to rank their own law firms based on categories most relevant to how the firm does at creating, maintaining, and fostering a diverse workforce, including racial and ethnic diversity, as well as diversity related to women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and individuals with disabilities. To create the overall Best 30 Firms for Diversity ranking, Vault averages the scores from all four ratings.

There was a huge amount of movement in the Top 10 this year. Which firms made the cut? Without any further ado, here are the [Top 10 Best Law Firms for Diversity](https://firsthand.co/best-companies-to-work-for/law/best-law-firms-for-diversity) based on Vault’s Annual Associate Survey for 2024:

-
- Clifford Chance US
- O’Melveny & Myers
- Morgan Lewis
- BakerHostetler
- Orrick
- McDermott Will & Emery
- Littler Mendelson
- Proskauer Rose
- Ropes & Gray
- Robinson + Cole
It’s worth noting that like almost all the Best Firms to Work For categories, Clifford Chance swept Vault’s diversity rankings. Here are some kind words from an associate on Clifford Chance’s work to improve diversity, inside and outside of the firm:

There were new No. 1s in each of the Diversity Rankings, with Clifford Chance claiming the top spot in Overall Diversity, Diversity for Women, Diversity for LGBTQ+ Individuals, and Diversity for Individuals with Disabilities. As one Clifford Chance associate said, “The firm is shockingly proactive and enthusiastic about diversity—I am a diverse individual and a natural Scrooge about these initiatives, but they have won me over. Lawyers participate, programs are sponsored, and affinity groups are active.”

# How To Increase Document Productivity And Efficiency Throughout Your Legal Drafting Workflow

The very process of creating and delivering legal documents only exacerbates the ever-present sense of concern about their quality. Collaborating with multiple drafters and reviewers — especially on complex documents with tight deadlines and high stakes — all too often results in unstable documents with inconsistent formatting and styling.

Join us on June 30th at 1 p.m. ET for this webinar to uncover how law firms and corporate legal departments alike can manage their document workflows effectively and efficiently by using a succession of technology tools that work to complement your workflows and not dictate them. Meeting their clients’ — and their own — expectations without breaking the bank or driving their associates away. This webinar is available for 1.0 CLE for all attendees.

There are more job cuts at Reed Smith. The firm, ranked 26th on the Am Law 100 with $1,310,596,000 in gross revenue in 2020, [eliminated](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/08/25/reed-smith-cuts-66-pa-roles-across-us-uk-offices-405-89987/) jobs last August — a round of layoffs which included lawyers. Now they’re back at it with another 66 jobs on the line. As[ reported by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/08/25/reed-smith-cuts-66-pa-roles-across-us-uk-offices-405-89987/) Law.com, following a redundancy review, the role of legal secretary will be gone at the firm, replaced by executive assistants.

In total, 66 legal secretaries have taken the firm’s buyout package:

The firm said on Wednesday that it expects 44 legal secretaries in the U.S. and a further 22 in the U.K. to take part in voluntary redundancy programs with enhanced severance packages as it launches its so-called Connectivity Initiative. The initiative will reimagine and streamline the firm’s administrative function, resulting in the creation of executive assistant (EA) roles replacing the legal secretary roles.

The firm provided a statement about those who took the severance package and the future of administrative support at the firm:

“In June 2021, recognizing that some of our secretaries may lack interest in the EA role, we offered a voluntary separation program to all legal secretaries in the U.S. and a voluntary severance program for all legal secretaries in the U.K., with an enhanced severance package.”

The statement added that the firm is grateful for the secretaries’ contributions.

“Those who chose to remain with Reed Smith will now move into the EA role and be provided with personalized development to ensure they have the necessary skill set for their new role. The firm has created a transition team to ensure continuity in administrative support during the transition to the EA role,” the statement continued.

Best of luck to those exiting the firm.

# People Wrongly Believe All Lawyers Make Bank
## People should be more transparent about the actual compensation most lawyers can expect to earn in the legal profession.

Many people believe that all lawyers are wealthy and earn a very comfortable living. This idea is likely reinforced by depictions of lawyers in movies and television shows such as “Suits.” In these representations, lawyers are shown spending their wealth and enjoying the high life off their earnings. Although some lawyers are extraordinarily wealthy, being a lawyer alone is rarely a means to achieve extreme wealth. Indeed, the vast majority of lawyers earn relatively modest incomes among other professionals in the workforce.

Like most applicants to law school, I was drawn to the legal profession by promises of a comfortable life as a practicing attorney. I was fortunate to earn a summer associate position and later a full-time associate gig at a Biglaw firm, and the position did not disappoint me in terms of compensation. In this role, I earned more money at 25 than many of the people with whom I attended college, and it was easy to satisfy my student debt and other financial responsibilities.

After leaving Biglaw, I earned a much more modest salary. I won’t be specific, but the salary was in the five-figure range, and was not too close to breaking the six-figure threshold. A relative of mine who was in the hospitality industry — and did not have a graduate degree — earned more money that me.

While earning this salary, I did not really want for anything. At the time, I had a roommate, and my living expenses were pretty low. Moreover, since I had paid off most of my student loans while working in Biglaw, I did not need to devote too much of my salary to student debt. At this time, I also started working a number of side hustles, and this gave me access to more money that I could use to fulfill my financial goals.

However, lawyers in other situations would have a much more difficult time supporting themselves and their families on the lower salary I earned after leaving Biglaw. Granted, some of the attorneys who were at that firm longer than me were paid more money than the junior associates. But people generally made around half or even less than what attorneys in Biglaw earned.

After leaving that law firm, I worked at a few shops as I progressed throughout my career. Each of these firms paid more than the one before, but I never made anything comparable to Biglaw money while working as an associate attorney at those shops. It was only when I started my own practice about five years ago that I started to earn money that was comparable to the Biglaw role I worked at the beginning of my career.

Lawyers are often compared with other learned professions when it comes to careers that can ensure comfortable earnings. However, this is not always accurate. I review a fair amount of physician contracts, and it seems that medical professionals earn significantly more than even highly paid lawyers. Moreover, individuals who work in finance can earn even more, and many financial professionals do not need to spend the time and money on graduate degrees. I am willing to bet that of the learned professionals that people tend to group together when discussing comfortable careers, attorneys on average earn the least. Of course, I would appreciate any feedback if someone can think of another professional career that tends to be less compensated.

Inflated notions of how much lawyers make can lead to a number of negative outcomes since people might be persuaded to enter the legal profession for the promise of a higher payday and be disappointed when they become an attorney. As a result, people should be more transparent about the actual compensation most lawyers can expect to earn in the legal profession. Of course, lawyers usually do well for themselves, and being a lawyer can be the pathway to a comfortable life. However, people should have a realistic understanding of how much an attorney can expect to earn that is divorced from depictions of lawyers in television shows and movies.

# Associates At This Biglaw Firm Are Taking A 20 Percent Pay Cut
## COVID-19 means more salary cuts in Biglaw.

Stoel Rives had a good 2018, making $225,921,000 in gross revenue and ranking 134th on the Am Law 200. But that historical success is no match for COVID-19. Even Biglaw firms with strong financials find themselves worried about cash flow and the coronavirus economic downturn. As such, austerity measures are the order of the day.

The firm, like so many others, is using a combination of cost-cutting measures to weather the COVID-19 storm. Salary cuts and staff furloughs feature prominently in their austerity plans:

• Reducing partner distributions by 20% effective April 1.
• Effective May 1: implementing tiered hourly reductions for staff with corresponding pay reductions: 5% for those earning less than $75,000; 10% for those earning $75,000-$100,000, 15% for those earning $100,000-$150,000 and 20% for those earning over $150,000.
• Also effective May 1: Implementing a 20% pay reduction for associates, staff attorneys, and of counsel attorneys; on an annualized basis, a 20% cut starting in May through the end of the year would equal a 13% reduction.
• Furloughing approximately 10% of staff members, beginning April 17, 2020 for at least 90 days. Furloughs are temporary, and staff can be called back to work if economic conditions improve. Benefits will continue during the furlough period at the same level they exist now.
• Continuing the existing hiring freeze and spending freeze.
• Deferring staff bonuses.
• Eliminating associate bonuses based on hours and implementing discretionary-only bonuses.
• Eliminating firm reimbursement for perks such as parking and public transportation.
• Evaluating administrative budgets for additional spending reductions.

Back in late January, I teased on these [pages](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/another-litigation-funding-splashdown-in-houston/) the agenda for the third installment of LITFINCON, the perennial world-class litigation finance conference held in Houston. As with last [year](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/3-takeaways-from-litfincon-the-sequel/) and the year [prior](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/3-takeaways-from-the-inaugural-litfincon/), I am pleased to report that this year’s LITFINCON was another runaway success, with a mix of content and networking that made the trip to Houston well worth it. Like the two prior installments, LITFINCON’s hallmarks remained in place — from the posh venue (where this year’s NBA denizens du jour were the San Antonio Spurs and LA Clippers) to the unique conference diversions (a pre-event Texas Toast and another lunchtime live stand-up comedic [performance](http://nathanmacintosh.com/)) to the varied and interesting panels that I discussed in my event preview column of last November. I also heard that the [WOLF](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rebecca-berrebi-esq-01596159_google-forms-sign-in-activity-7107739177504395264-8BIi?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) (Women of Litigation Finance) breakfast was a sold-out start to the first day of the conference. Taken all together, the time flew by, capped by the Casino Night networking event that was full of good cheer and socializing among the attendees, who apparently hailed from over 140 companies or firms.

The camaraderie amongst LITFINCON attendees was, of course, most welcome. At the same time, there was also an air of seriousness to the proceedings, spurred on by the collective experiences of those operating in the litigation finance industry in the past year. While litigation finance remains a space full of opportunity, there is also no doubt that 2023 was a year of retrenchment and focus in the industry, driven by a need to deliver returns to early investors even as the legal system continues to reset post-pandemic. Add in the specter of increased regulation, an election year, and the market-changing potential engendered by the entry of insurance options around litigation finance and LITFINCON’s tone of measured optimism for 2024 and beyond felt on point. And in case IP litigators needed a reminder, once again the importance of the patent litigation ecosystem to the health of the burgeoning litigation funding industry in America was reinforced by various speakers.

For my first takeaway from this year’s conference, I would start — as LITFINCON itself did — with insights from the opening panel of the conference, the Judicial Panel styles as “Deciders: A View from the Bench.” As usual, the insights on offer were as varied as the composition of the panel itself, with a sitting district court judge joined by a Texas Supreme Court justice, an appellate jurist from a Texas appeals court, and a federal magistrate judge from the much-discussed Western District of Texas, home to the USA’s busiest patent litigation docket. Despite sitting in various judicial capacities, the panelists shared some common ground in discussing their views of litigation finance as a tool to advance the worthy cause of increased access to justice for under-resourced litigants with meritorious legal claims, as well as with respect to the fact that they have not had to deal (yet) with much in the way of disclosure fights in funded cases. At the same time, there was an undercurrent of concern expressed around the ethical issues that the presence of litigation finance could create, including with respect to a potential scenario where a large-scale buyside investment group or hedge fund decides to invest in, or even buy, a leading law firm. At bottom, however, there was a sense that litigation finance is something that the judiciary recognizes is here to stay. As a result, helping the monopoly that is the legal profession move forward with additional resources available to countermand the “rich husbands in a divorce dispute” approach to litigation espoused by many commercial defendants was discussed as a benefit to litigation finance, albeit one that required stewardship by the judiciary to avoid abuse. It was also clear that, at least in Texas, there may be some appetite for using existing tools for regulating the legal profession as a primary means of regulating the litigation finance industry as well. What that might look like is an interesting question to monitor.

For our next takeaway, I would like to highlight the considered diversity of viewpoints that was found on many of LITFINCON’s panels. In particular, I want to spotlight for this audience both the IP panel, which addressed at length a variety of hot-button topics of interest to IP litigators, as well as the panel I moderated, which debated the merits of litigation finance’s impact on the legal industry. We can start with the IP panel, which comprised a group of seasoned IP litigators with experience handling funded cases, as well as the head of patent-related investments at one of the industry’s largest pure-play litigation funders. There was plenty of discussion of the risk factors inherent in big-ticket patent litigation, including the fact that many cases take quite a bit of time to resolve in this age of IPRs and crowded court dockets. The panel also recognized that with the extra time to resolution comes increased costs, creating an increased demand cycle for litigation finance to help carry such cases forward. Good news for funders, as well as the law firms and patent owners they are choosing to fund.

As with the IP panel, the panel I moderated had an interesting discussion of various hot-button questions surrounding the litigation finance space. As a group, the panelists shared their diverse viewpoints on questions around whether litigation finance is truly increasing access to justice, or whether litigation finance is leading to the filing of more meritorious cases, or even whether the industry needs additional regulation. The audience benefited from hearing answers to those questions from a practicing litigator, a litigation funding executive, and the head of IP policy at one of America’s most important technology companies, respectively. It is a credit to LITFINCON that such a diverse group of perspectives could share the stage in such a respectful and engaging way — as was true with all the panels throughout the conference.

Lastly, for the final takeaway, I’d like to focus on a leitmotif that played throughout the conference in response to the various calls for, or predictions of, increased regulation of litigation finance as an industry. Over and over again, the need for the litigation finance industry to do a better marketing job in terms of highlighting its successes and potential social benefits was highlighted as an important rejoinder to calls for structural reform. By now, there are surely positive results in cases for worthy clients that can be spotlighted, where, but for the presence of litigation funding, those claims would not have been brought. Yes, public relations matter, even for — or precisely needed most by — an industry that has seen explosive growth in a very short time. Let’s see if we start to hear more vigorous public pushback from industry participants in response to the claims advanced by opponents of the industry.

A lot more can be discussed with respect to this year’s LITFINCON, but I hope the above at least gives a flavor for the level of discourse at this important industry event. As good as this year’s event was, I would continue to expect that future LITFINCONs, whether in Houston or in the  [Los Angeles](https://litfincon.com/losangeles/) event this September, will continue to exceed expectations as a must-attend event in the litigation finance space.

I interview [Lauren Drake](https://www.macrae.com/lauren-drake) and discuss, among other things, how her career evolved to her position at Macrae. We talk about how the “Female Law Firm Leaders Roundtable” — FLFL, known as “falafel” — got started and how the pandemic shaped that launch. We also discuss how FLFL benefits its members and issues tackled by the roundtable over the last year. Additionally, we dive into how women leaders can leverage the hot lateral market to benefit their careers.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

# It's A Mixed Bag As This Biglaw Firm Hands Out Individualized Bonuses
## Some good news and some bad news.

Nobody thinks they are the ones who will be screwed by individualized bonuses, but almost inevitably someone feels like they got the shaft when they find out their bonus numbers. Take, for example, associates at Alston & Bird.

Above the Law has gotten some feedback from associates that indicates the individual bonuses are great and led to pretty generous (read: market) bonuses provided you met your billing targets:

Alston & Bird announced bonuses in individual emails today. Sounds like a full market match if you hit hours, plus they awarded a “special bonus” to people who hit hours that matched summer bonuses.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
This is in sharp contradiction with a senior associate in a non-New York market (we’ve obscured some details to maintain the tipster’s anonymity) who says that despite billing 1950+ hours, they earned less than 25 percent of what their peers at firms paying [lockstep market rates](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/breaking-cravath-announces-annual-bonuses/) are making.

But at least they’ve kept their sense of humor about it:

[The bonus is] horrible. [Hiring partner] Liz Price did thank me for my service to the firm in an email.

So A&B associates, what do you think about this year’s bonuses?

UPDATE: More A&B associates weigh in below.

One senior associate (and high biller) was happy with their above market bonus:

Explanation was market bonus at 1950, then for billers over 2150 they gave something extra, which seems to match the market summer bonuses that they didn’t give. Overall, feeling taken care of.

But that was not the numbers/explanation others received:

To add more clarity on bonuses, you can only hit market in major markets if you bill at least 2150 hours. 1950 hours is approx 33% market and 2050 is 66% market. Even if you hit 2150, you still may not get market. Let’s just say some people are happy and some people are disappointed.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And these differing perspectives is exactly the problem with non-lockstep bonuses. There’s an obvious lack of clarity on what exactly are the expectations for associates. Instead of a firm-wide, transparent discussion on hours and work product, there’s a rumor mill filled with partial information trying to fill the gap.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477).

# Did A Toxic Combination Of Trump And Brexit Kill This Biglaw Merger?

Brexit: Killing more than just David Cameron’s career.

Well, at least stalling more than just Cameron’s career. According to a [report from Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/08/25/transatlantic-law-firm-merger-talks-stall-due-to-brexit-uncertainty/), a merger that had been in the works since 2015 between U.S. Biglaw firm Hunton & Williams and the U.K.’s Addleshaw Goddard is hitting the skids, as world events are becoming just a little bit too real for the law firms:

Merger talks between Hunton & Williams and U.K.-based Addleshaw Goddard have stalled due to uncertainty caused by Britain’s shock decision to leave the European Union, according to partners at the two firms.

Discussions between the two firms have been ongoing since late 2015 and had reached a [relatively advanced stage](http://www.legalweek.com/sites/jamesbooth/2016/05/24/addleshaw-goddard-and-hunton-williams-in-merger-talks-uk-firms-management-to-talk-to-partners/), but the pair have now taken pause to assess the impact of Brexit and the upcoming U.S. presidential elections.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Even if world events weren’t seemingly conspiring against the merger, it is incredibly challenging to put together two firms with different cultures, methods of accounting, and compensation systems, as firms separated by the Atlantic Ocean frequently are:

If the merger does go ahead, it would be a rare combination between two large U.S. and U.K. law firms. For all the talk of transatlantic consolidation, such deals have been relatively thin on the ground. That’s not surprising: law firm mergers are incredibly hard things to get right. Only a small fraction of discussions between firms end up leading to a deal. In March, Greenberg Traurig [ended its merger talks](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202755431562/Greenberg-Traurig-Says-No-to-a-Transatlantic-Merger?slreturn=20160725033547) with London-based Berwin Leighton Paisner amid concerns about the U.K. firm’s practice mix and culture, and having grown disillusioned with BLP’s management. There are countless other examples of failed deals and no doubt many more than never make it to the press.

Best of luck to Hunton and Addleshaw as they try to make the bigger, better versions of themselves. There are always other fishes in the Biglaw sea.

# Clients Need To Mind Their Own Business About Returning To The Office

Jones Day continues to be a black box — let’s break that open. Morgan Stanley is urging its outside counsel to get back to the office. To what extent do clients get to dictate how law firms run their business? And we talk about cruise lines suing Florida and a Catholic school suing Michigan claiming that making schoolchildren wear masks is sacrilegious, which seems like a stretch.

# Biglaw's Summer of Love?
## Will it pass quickly, or does it represent the beginning of a major change?

Shares[](http://twitter.com/share?url=http://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/biglaws-summer-of-love/&text=Biglaw’s%20Summer%20of%20Love?)[](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/biglaws-summer-of-love/&display=popup&ref=plugin&src=share_button)[](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/biglaws-summer-of-love/)[](javascript:void(""#ea-share-count-email""))
Fifty years ago, the United States experienced what became known as the “Summer of Love.” Part political event and movement, part social phenomenon, and part hippie celebration, that summer saw an increased emphasis on sharing and community, across many cities around the United States (grounded of course in the Bay Area – then and now a region at the forefront of change).

While much has changed since then, the summer of 2017 in Biglaw seems to be all about collaboration, sharing and community, within and among the various players in the Biglaw ecosystem. Could this be Biglaw’s summer of love? If so, does it foreshadow major changes to the industry? Or, like 1967’s Summer of Love, will it pass quickly, and become remembered more as a moment in time and lost opportunity, rather than the beginning of a major change (i.e., a revolution) in the industry?

In early 2010, we presented at a Thomson Reuters event for large law firms. At the time, we quoted a survey that showed that the top areas where law firms looked for innovation were all internal — including firm executive committees, other partners, and the like. We commented at the irony that firms, in the quest for “new ideas,” were simply talking to themselves, rather than looking outward at, and taking ideas from, clients, vendors, consultants, or academics. That survey confirmed our experience when we started Pangea3 in 2004. At that time, the general counsel and in-house departments we pitched were grateful for something new, explaining that for years they’d felt that the alternatives were either using a large law firm or hiring full-time staff. So much has changed since then.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Now, nearly every week, we read about a new partnership, venture or collaboration in the legal industry. Make no mistake about it – many of these arrangements are driven by the goal of future profit or IP ownership. And, without a doubt, there have been partnerships, joint ventures and relationships between Biglaw and others for many years. Nonetheless, the level of collaboration and joint effort seems, to us, unprecedented.

Usually, technology is the anchor or focus of the partnership. A growing number of law firms have set up and now run LegalTech incubators, including Dentons, Mishcon de Reya, Allen & Overy, and others. Likewise, law firms such as MinterEllison are launching joint ventures or co-investing with technology companies to create AI companies or AI tools for their own use (full disclosure – Sanjay is advising an Am Law 50 firm here in the U.S. on just such an effort). Littler’s ComplianceHR effort, a 2015 collaboration with NeotaLogic, is already well-known. And earlier this month, Cravath (yes, Cravath) inked an agreement with UK legaltech company Luminance to deploy an artificial intelligence product. Interestingly, Luminance itself is part-owned by famed UK Magic Circle firm Slaughter and May.

Interestingly, many of these collaborations involve or aspire to technology tools that enable lawyers to be more efficient by eliminating or automating lower-value tasks, such as contract authoring tools, which at the same time require a fundamental re-thinking of traditional billable hour pricing. We are seeing exactly this type of re-thinking in our advisory practice.

Sometimes, the spirit of community goes beyond partnership and manifests as one company unilaterally giving something away in the hopes of accelerating change. Examples include (1) tech company DoNotPay announcing the creation of [legal bots for free](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/donotpay-adds-1000-legal-bots-plus-service-for-others-to-create-their-own/), for anyone who can send in a detailed plan for a Q&A legal bot designed to fill in a form or legal document, and (2) U.S. legal analytics company [LexPredict](http://www.lexpredict.com/) making its contract analysis platform open source and free to use.

But there are also examples of collaborations around other areas, including mission-critical areas such as diversity and inclusion. One significant example is 30 domestic law firms [agreeing to the Mansfield Rule](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/get-ready-for-the-biglaw-rooney-rule-as-firms-try-to-actually-do-something-about-diversity/), a policy requiring them to consider women and minority lawyers when it comes to promoting and hiring talent.

And it’s not just law firms and tech companies collaborating. [AdvanceLaw](http://www.advancelaw.com/), a consortium of dozens of law department leaders, helps GCs identify the right law firms for their needs and share performance related information, with a goal of “greater transparency and better decision-making.”

And nearly everyone following the industry has watched the rapid rise and growing influence of [CLOC](http://www.cloc.org/), the Corporate Legal Operations Consortium. Among its offerings, CLOC provides members with “best practices in areas including legal department tools, technology, templates and knowledge bases; and work[s] with key legal service providers to drive efficient & effective solutions for corporate legal customers.”

As entrepreneurs, we are of course optimists. But we aren’t idealists or dreamers. Obviously, the current collaborative environment could easily give way to the legal market of the past, where players competed in what was often a zero-sum game, and rarely a client-centric market where the whole was greater than the sum of its parts. Nonetheless, we believe that we are in a period of real and substantial collaboration, the results of which are benefitting clients, their in-house legal departments, law firms, technology providers and newer, alternative legal providers. Here’s hoping that it takes root and becomes a permanent part of our industry, and that 2017’s Summer of Love continues for years to come.

New White House Director of Information Control.

Yesterday, the Washington Post revealed classified transcripts of Donald Trump phone calls to world leaders. The fact that the leaks could have revealed sensitive, classified information got the [“respectable journalism” world](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/why-leaking-transcripts-of-trumps-calls-is-so-dangerous/535809/?utm_source=atltw) in a tizzy. The fact that all the transcripts did show was Trump being a lying, ineffectual, nincompoop wasn’t the real issue, we’ve been told.

I get it. The easiest story in the world to write right now, after the Washington Post or the New York Times scoops your publication into the ground, is the “counter-narrative.” That the President of the United States is a serial liar who embarrasses America every time he speaks for it — that’s “old news.”

From Pilot and Above The Law  
The thought that the real issue is the leaks, not the culture of lies and incompetence that produces the leaks, hasn’t just seized mainstream media outlets, it’s the operating principle of the White House.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions came out today and delivered a thoughtful message, recognizing that the leakers are afraid for their country. Sessions committed the administration to fostering the trust and pride that keeps employees from running to the press.

Just kidding. Sessions came out and threatened everybody like a drug kingpin who’s sick of people sampling the product. [From the HuffPost](http://Jeff%20Sessions%20Floats%20Media%20Subpoenas%20As%20Part%20Of%20Crackdown%20On%20Leaks):

“I have this message for our friends in the intelligence community. The Department of Justice is open for business and I have, this morning, this warning: Don’t do it,” Sessions said. “For the past several months we have made changes and are seriously ramping up our efforts.”…

“This nation must end this culture of leaks,” he went on. “We will investigate and seek to bring criminals to justice. We will not allow rogue anonymous sources with security clearances to sell out our country.”

I’ve got a name Sessions can start investigating: [John Miller](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/05/16/donald-trumps-john-miller-interview-is-even-crazier-than-you-think/?utm_term=.5d69d695564b). That guy seems to know everything.

Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, went full Liam Neeson on the issue:

“For those out there who may be listening or watching these announcements, or who would later learn about what is said is morning, understand this,” he said. “If you improperly disclose classified information, we will find you. We will investigate you. We will prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law.”

Taken 45: I don’t have any particular skills, I don’t know what I’m looking for, and I have no idea what I’m doing.

Look, here at Above the Law we know a thing or two about anonymous sources with stories to tell about the places they work. A consistent thread — I’ve been here nine years this weekend — is that these people are not looking to “burn it down.” They don’t want their firm or company to suffer so much as they want it to “get better.” Disgruntled employees quit. Disheartened employees stay quiet. Dedicated employees fight (internally) and fight (externally) in the press when they believe that transparency will spur the organization into better policies or treatment.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Leakers are optimistic, sometimes stupidly so, that things can get better.

On the other side of the phone is a reporter and, let me tell you, there are a bunch of them who would gladly go to jail to protect a source. There’s not a thing that you could do better for my career than jail me for refusing to give someone up. You’d turn me into a political prisoner. Come at me, bro. I’ve got my “Notes From A Jail Inside Trump Tower” halfway written already.

Of course, Sessions doesn’t want his fusillade assault on the First Amendment to sound like an assault on the First Amendment, so he couches this all in the language of “security.” Lekaers, and the reporters who publish their stories, put “lives at risk.” Like I said up top, that’s an argument that many mainstream media outlets are all too eager to parrot.

Given that messaging, it’s important to remember what Sessions and crew are really getting all pissy about. There’s only one person who is put in “danger” because of the leaks. Don’t lose the plot.

Here’s my favorite part of the leaked Trump conversation with Mexican President Peña Nieto:

We cannot say that anymore because if you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I do not want to meet with you guys anymore because I cannot live with that. I am willing to say that we will work it out, but that means it will come out in the wash and that is okay. But you cannot say anymore that the United States is going to pay for the wall. I am just going to say that we are working it out. Believe it or not, this is the least important thing that we are talking about, but politically this might be the most important talk about. But in terms of dollars – or pesos – it is the least important thing. I know how to build very inexpensively, so it will be much lower than these numbers I am being presented with, and it will be a better wall and it will look nice. And it will do the job.

And my pick for his conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull:

Malcom [sic], why is this so important? I do not understand. This is going to kill me. I am the world’s greatest person that does not want to let people into the country. And now I am agreeing to take 2,000 people and I agree I can vet them, but that puts me in a bad position. It makes me look so bad and I have only been here a week.

If Jeff Sessions wants to put people in jail for exposing that Trump is the “the world’s greatest person that does not want to let people into the country,” and reminding people that Mexico won’t pay for the wall, in dollars OR pesos, then he can bring it.

Patriots have gone to jail for far less worthy causes than holding this administration accountable. Leaking and publishing information on how this president lies and deceives the world is not an American right, it’s an American duty.

# Diversity Work Is Surging For Biglaw As Companies Scramble To Keep It Legal

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Lots of clients are wanting to do audits, review all DEI efforts, board diversity, socially conscious investing to assess risk and figure out what — if any — changes they want to make. There is a never ending tide of stuff.

Right now, you need a lot of creativity and tolerance for risk. All of the banks I have been talking to, their view is we are not going to overreact and abandon our programs. ‘We don’t want this place to look like it did in 1950. We want to do it in a lawful way but we’re not going to run away from it.’

— [Jason Schwartz](https://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyer/schwartz-jason-c/), a partner who runs a DEI taskforce at Gibson Dunn, in comments given to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/business-is-booming-for-dei-lawyers-as-firms-ask-whats-legal) on the whirlwind of work concerning corporate diversity programming that has resulted from the Supreme Court’s [dismantling of affirmative action](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/the-affirmative-action-cases-went-about-as-well-as-youd-expect-them-to-what-now/).

Ever feel like being a lawyer just isn’t the ideal career for you? Sure, you may have spent too much money on a legal education but something about the job just doesn’t fit. Maybe you find your way to an investment bank or two, but still you can’t shake the feeling you should be doing something more with your life.

Malik Russell can relate. He’s a former [Simpson Thacher associate](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/01/style/weddings-sara-naison-phillips-malik-russell.html) that did [stints at investment banks](https://www.linkedin.com/in/malik-russell-51125b8/) before a total career shakeup. Now he’s the principal of an elite New York City charter school. As the Daily News reports, the change was for the best:

As a lawyer “I felt uncomfortable in my clothes, like a clown in a fancy suit,” Russell said. “Now being a principal I feel more comfortable in my own clothes.”

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Russell grew up in Brooklyn, the child of a single mother and got scholarships to elite schools and eventually made his way to [Georgetown Law](https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/bitstream/handle/10822/1042233/gulc_facebook_1997.pdf?sequence=1). But his days as a corporate lawyer were numbered when he ran into an old friend:

During a subway ride nearly a decade ago, he ran into a childhood friend who said that many of the crew from their old neighborhood were in trouble with the law, or worse.

When the friend told Russell that one old pal was in jail and another was dead, he felt the need to change his lifestyle immediately.

For his second career Russell began as an assistant teacher at Success Academy Bronx 1. Now he’ll be the founding principal of the Success Academy Hudson Yards Middle School when it opens this fall, and was honored as a Daily News Hometown Hero. Russell is a great inspiration for anyone who feels Biglaw life isn’t a great fit.

# What You Need To Know About COVID's Impact On White-Collar Litigation
## There have been some recent major policy developments that have the potential to significantly impact white-collar enforcement going forward.

When you think about the impacts of the pandemic, white-collar crime might not be the first thing that comes to mind.

Nonetheless, there have been some recent major policy developments that have the potential to significantly impact white-collar enforcement going forward.

In an October 28, 2021, memorandum from Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, the Biden administration announced plans to prioritize corporate enforcement in the white-collar arena. What, exactly, this means for companies in terms of risk mitigation remains to be seen.

Given the significance of the potential consequences that can come from being involved in a criminal investigation or prosecution, both corporations and their lawyers need to be paying extra attention to how the white-collar landscape is changing and how COVID has altered the practice of law in this area.

Among the key issues you need to understand are:

- How could white-collar enforcement and defense change in a post-COVID world? To date, practitioners are seeing impacts on the setting of trial dates, the prior limitations on international travel, remote work realities for investigators, targets, and counsel, and more.
- How has the DOJ’s October 2021 announcement that they’ll be prioritizing corporate enforcement played out six months later? White-collar practitioners should expect to see changes in how recidivist corporations are treated, the imposition of monitors, and requirements for identifying participants in misconduct, among other things.
- What are the DOJ’s enforcement priorities post-COVID? So far, it appears that there’s an increased focus on criminal antitrust enforcement in the labor context, but the landscape will continue to evolve. As a result, corporate compliance will be more important than ever going forward.
A panel of experts in the field of white-collar law will discuss all of these issues and more in an upcoming one-hour PLI program, [White-Collar Crime in a Post-COVID World: What to Expect and How to Prepare](https://www.pli.edu/programs/white-collar-crime-in-a-post-covid-world-what-to-expect-and-how-to-prepare?t=live). Register today to get the latest information on how post-COVID DOJ priorities are impacting white-collar crime enforcement and defense.

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm To Roll Out Relaxed Reopening Plan For Associates
## This firm's plan is so chill.

Thus far, Americans have received almost 250 million COVID vaccinations, and more than half of those eligible have received one shot in the fight against the novel coronavirus. We still have a long way to go, but progress like this has inspired law firms to announce plans for office reopenings and returns to business as usual — or the new usual.

Today, we have news from a top 50 Am Law firm whose reopening plan will gently ease attorneys and staff back to work through various transition phases leading up to a full(ish) return after Labor Day.

According to our sources, Sheppard Mullin — a firm that brought in gross revenue of $867,416,00 in 2020 — has announced a return-to-office plan that will have all employees familiarized with their new office lives for a September return, on “some days,” meaning that remote work is still very much on the table for associates and staff. These are the three reopening phases that will be happening at the firm, as detailed in a memo that reiterated information spoken about during a town hall meeting yesterday (full memo available on the next page):

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
- Now we invite those who are Fully Vaccinated to come to the office on some days.  If you are not FV or have other reasons why RTO does not make sense for you at this point, no worries.
- Starting July 6 after the Independence Day Holiday we will move to “do your best” to come to the office on some days.  This is with the usual caveats including that you may have other obligations that keep you at home.  And of course we will apply our Intentional Flexibility concept to your individual situations.  (Remember our Summer Associates start the in-office phase of their time with us on July 6.  Please do your best with them!)
- After doing our best for the summer, we will on September 7 after the Labor Day Holiday move to an expectation that we will come into the office on some days.  This expectation including the number and choice of days in the office will involve individual and team conversations about what is best for you, the Firm and our clients and will again be based on our Intentional Flexibility concept.  We do know for most of us there will be more time, and in many cases significantly more time, spent working remotely.
“No worries”? “Do your best”? “Come into the office on some days”? Sheppard Mullin’s office reopening plan is perhaps the most relaxed one we’ve heard of to date, and that’s sure to make a lot of people very happy. We’ve also been told that the firm has announced a program for associates and staff to take each other out to lunch or coffee on the firm’s dime to get back into the flow of office life.

Congratulations to Sheppard Mullin on creating what seems to be an incredibly easygoing reopening plan for all employees — a plan that fully embraces remote work because “work life will never be the same in our industry or in our Firm.”

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

# After Hyping Above-Market Windfall, Kirkland & Ellis Releases Their Bonuses
## Sure, bonuses are above market but the firm needs to manage expectations.

Kirkland & Ellis is, by a healthy margin, the richest law firm going. Their revenue numbers are just ridic. But rather that offer lockstep bonuses that share the wealth in a transparent fashion with associates, they offer individualized bonuses. But, K&E also has a reputation for repeatedly beating market bonuses. Indeed, that above-market compensation is a key recruiting point for the firm and allows them to kick ass in the lateral market as well.

But 2020 is a year full of upheaval, and we all were wondering exactly what bonuses at the mega firm would look like.

In an associate town hall meeting, the firm began the hype machine touting the bonus numbers, and that almost everyone was going to crush it. But when actual individualized bonuses started to come in, not everyone was impressed. Sure, they were above market, but, again, that’s [kinda Kirkland’s thing](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/kirkland-ellis-bonus/). We’ve gotten word from tipsters that some were left disappointed, and that, particularly when you factor in other firms’ fall special bonuses this year, ([which K&E pointedly did not participate in)](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/kirklands-not-giving-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-salty-about-it/) this year’s bonuses simply didn’t wow. From some insiders:

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Mid-level in corporate, with class, 24-2500 hours, about 35% above market on the year-end component, but only 25% above market all in. Either way, I’ve had higher multiples in past years with materially lower hours. And given what was said on this morning’s zoom call that multiples were greater than ever, etc., the general consensus is that associates aren’t super thrilled. The firm took the opportunity to rave about killer bonuses but could only (misleadingly) do so by factoring in the one-time special COVID bonus and otherwise lowering what the year-end component would have been in any other year. All things considered, these aren’t market shattering bonuses by any stretch of the imagination (and certainly not worth the hype they were given this morning), and I think as a result, this will be the beginning of a mass exodus of associates, whether shortly after they’re paid out or after the firm’s financials come out showing another year of significant revenue and PPP growth.

we got our K&E bonuses and they’re terrible. I’m a junior and they kept telling us how big our bonuses would be and “substantially above market” and we would be so happy and me and everyone I know got barely above market. We’re all incredibly pissed since we’ve been billing insane hours.

But proving it’s all a matter of perspective, others are still happy with whatever above-market bonus they’re taking down:

Individualized, no memo, but they’re huge. Made up for not paying the special bonus in the fall. Mid-level in transactional group with high hours and I received 2x the DPW full year (fall + winter) scale

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
here’s a tip on Kirkland bonuses – individual bonuses were announced yesterday with all associates in good standing (99% of associates) receiving above market bonuses + pandemic bonus. Extra high bonuses were awarded this year, and even more for high hours – Im in 2014-2016 class range and received 50% above market for the normal bonus, plus the regular pandemic bonus. The firm treated everyone well and were so supportive throughout the year with the pandemic (understanding of personal challenges, child care, etc.), this just ends the year on an even higher note! People are happy!

Kirkland crushes bonuses. Automatic special Covid match. No billable requirement and automatic above NY market firmwide. 5th year, >2400 hours, >$140k.

# Foley & Lardner’s Wild Week
## The firm said Cleta Mitchell went rogue, but that was only the start of their issues.

Note: This podcast was recorded before [Mitchell resigned from Foley & Lardner](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/cleta-mitchell-out-at-foley-lardner-after-troubling-donald-trump-call/), but that actually just adds to how wild this week was for the firm.

As the post-election drama gets even weirder, Biglaw partner Cleta Mitchell turned up on a call seeming to represent Donald Trump as he attempted to solicit election interference from Georgia officials. Joe and Kathryn revisit the difference between professional consequences and business consequences when it comes to lawyers and boggle over how a lawyer could let a call like this happen without confidentiality provisions. Also, Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz have elite law school educations and their classmates wish they’d act like it.

# All Associates Get Raises And Special Bonuses At This Biglaw Firm -- But Not On The DPW Scale
## More money is more money. Congrats!

Biglaw raises continue to be this summer’s hot new craze. Associates are absolutely thrilled about the prospect of being paid on a salary scale that starts at $205,000. With special bonuses on top of those huge salaries and year-end bonuses coming in just a few months, 2021 is shaping up to be a splendid year indeed. Unfortunately, not everyone is getting raised up to the Davis Polk scale, but a raise is a raise, so let’s get excited, folks.

Kelley Drye & Warren brought in $221,916,000 gross revenue in 2020, and was ranked No. 141 in the most recent Am Law 100. Instead of matching the most generous Davis Polk scale, the firm has increased salaries for all associates and special counsel by $10,000. In addition to those raises, the firm is finally handing out special bonuses to attorneys — but again, they aren’t on the Davis Polk scale. Here’s what special bonuses look like at Kelley Drye:

Discovery Attorneys: $5,000

Junior Associates (Class of 2018-2020): $10,000

Mid-Level Associates (Class of 2015-2017): $20,000

Senior Associates & Special Counsel (Class of 2014+): $30,000

Special bonuses will be split into two payments (July 31 and December 2021), the first of which will be available to those who have 1800 hours, annualized and accountable. The second payment will go to those who have billed 1800 hours for the year — and those who were ineligible for the first payment will be able to catchup at year-end if their hours are on point.

Congratulations to everyone at Kelley Drye — including summer associates, who will also be getting a raise!

# A Look At Biglaw's Tough Trial Tactics
## Are aggressive Biglaw attorneys the difference maker?

The Biglaw firm of Weil Gotshal & Manges lived up to their nickname of We’ll Getcha & Mangle-ya in a recent trial. The firm, led by partners Diane Sullivan and Allison Brown, was defending Johnson & Johnson against allegations their baby powder contained asbestos and contributed to plaintiff’s mesothelioma. J&J’s already lost a similar lawsuit — to the tune of a $117 million verdict (though that case is being appealed), so Sullivan and Brown decided a case of hardball was in order.

According to a[ report ](https://www.law360.com/articles/1097534)on the case from Law360, Sullivan reveals the key to the case was successfully portraying the theory of the case as a “sham” perpetrated by lawyers for the plaintiff.

Looking at what lawyers for the pharmaceutical giant had done in other cases, Sullivan said she and Brown “took what we thought had worked … and kind of shook up the arguments a little bit … when we thought some things didn’t work,” and “went hard on what we think is the truth, that this is just … a litigation concocted by plaintiffs’ lawyers.”

With the Weil Gotshal attorneys framing the instant action as “a sham created by plaintiffs’ lawyers” in a more overt way than had been done in prior cases, “the jury, it looks like, accepted that wholeheartedly and we were … obviously heartened by the verdict,” Sullivan added.

And it certainly didn’t hurt to have testimony that the USDA and other third parties have extensively tested the baby powder and found no evidence of asbestos.

Brown noted “there is no epidemiological study that shows an increase in [mesothelioma] in the miners and millers of cosmetic talc, and there’s no government authority that says cosmetic talc increases the risk, and I think those two facts really resonated with some smart, perceptive jurors who paid a lot of attention.”

After a four-week trial, the jury came back with a verdict for the defense in less than two hours.

But still, cases alleging baby powder contributed to mesothelioma have been a mixed bag for J&J with them winning and losing at trial. It just might be that aggressive Biglaw attorneys are the difference maker.

Host Steve Nadel dressed for the occasion.

Biglaw keeps [imposing draconian office policies](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/you-didnt-see-your-kids-before-the-pandemic-you-shouldnt-expect-to-see-them-now-says-elite-law-firm-partner/) or passive aggressively spilling to the media that hybrid policies “just aren’t working.” But the overarching question remains: why?

Is it the work product? No, firms made money hand over fist during the lockdown. Is it training? A valid concern, but not one that hinges on 3 vs. 4 days in the office. Is it that some partners just want to haul their employees into the office to be surrogate friends? Well… probably actually.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But most office discussions boil down to vague worries about “culture.” Though we’re only a few months removed from a Biglaw firm training presentation scolding young associates “[you are online 24/7](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/biglaw-training-presentation-says-you-are-online-24-7-and-thats-not-even-the-worst-advice/)” so maybe firm “culture” isn’t always what it’s cracked up to be.

If firms are serious about culture, they need to stop forcing people into an office and hoping culture develops like you’d pen in a retired thoroughbred and a broodmare and think about building an office environment that people actually want to come in for.

We’ve chronicled Seward & Kissel’s efforts on this score in the past. They built the unofficial [world’s longest miniature golf hole](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/seward-kissel-designs-worlds-longest-miniature-golf-hole/). The held [a Pi Day baking contest](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/law-firm-celebrates-pi-day-with-greatest-baking-show-on-earth/). The firm is putting in the effort to get people into the office (but out of their individual offices) to mingle and build genuine relationships across groups.

And the firm did it again with a Family Feud tournament.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  

Good answer, good answer.

Partner Steve Nadel, who quarterbacks these efforts, explained that two associates from the Investment Management group — Katie Agoglia and Connor Smith — asked to set up a tournament just for their floor. With the help of the IT Department’s Chris Cao, they managed to get a full scale version of the game going on the screens in the conference area. That prompted the Management Committee to ask for a firm-wide event.

Seven floors across two offices took part in the tournament across a couple of days this week to win a catered lunch and, if they successfully achieved a 200+ point final money round, the players each won an Amazon gift card.

“We want all our culture events to be so memorable that people will be talking about it years later,” Nadel said. “And their friends at other law firms who hear about it say ‘Seward & Kissel sounds like a great place to work!'”

Ultimately, Floors 20 & 21 and the DC office got through the quarterfinals, with floor 20 and (the quarterfinal bye team) floor 24 making the finals. Floor 24 won the whole thing, scoring 202 points to win the Amazon gift cards.

Family Feud isn’t necessarily for everyone, but that’s why it’s just one piece of a broader strategy. Mini golf, baking, the Feud… maybe a trivia night. Throw in more traditional socializing events like organized lunches and happy hours. This isn’t something you confront from one angle. It takes time and folks willing to put in the effort, but it makes the firm a place that makes people want to come to the office because they have friends there worth coming in to see.

Congrats, yet again, to Seward & Kissel for understanding this.

No word on whether Nadel opted for a Louie Anderson or Steve Harvey approach to hosting. Maybe more of a John O’Hurley?

A couple of stories out of Littler Mendelson this week, as one partner disappears from the website after pointing the finger at his client in federal court while the firm itself ducks special bonuses for associates by handing out hats. By contrast, Kirkland went over the top on associate appreciation with free food. Joe and Kathryn unsurprisingly think the latter is a better approach. The team also discusses new anti-riot legislation legalizing running over protesters.

# Unlocking Client Loyalty: The Art Of Being Indispensable
## In a profession teeming with talent, how can you achieve true differentiation?

In the competitive landscape of legal services, Paul Grewal from Coinbase [recently cast a spotlight](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/paul-grewal-288978b4_law-is-as-much-a-service-business-as-any-activity-7164761659096461313-Gtoj#:~:text=1h%20Edited-,Law%20is%20as%20much%20a%20service%20business%20as%20any%20other,and%20attention%20to%20the%20details.) on a fundamental truth: 

“Law is as much a service business as any other. In my experience, most lawyers delude themselves into thinking they are qualified to win client loyalty by their unique expertise. In reality, their only chance to win is by unique responsiveness and attention to detail.”

This insight not only challenges the conventional wisdom that legal expertise is the sole path to client loyalty but also echoes the ethos of high-end concierge services, where going beyond the call of duty to ensure satisfaction is paramount. 

In a profession teeming with talent, Grewal’s words remind us that true differentiation and client loyalty require a profound understanding of clients’ needs and businesses, akin to the anticipatory service provided by elite concierges. 

As legal professionals, stepping into the role of a legal concierge means embracing this level of unique responsiveness to transcend mere expertise and truly secure client loyalty.

What Unique Responsiveness Looks Like:

- Proactive Communication and Accessibility: Embodying the anticipatory service of a concierge, attorneys should not only await client inquiries but actively reach out with updates and insights, ensuring they are as accessible as possible. This includes adapting to clients’ schedules and preferences for communication, whether it means being available outside traditional office hours or employing various communication platforms to suit their convenience.
- Customized Solutions and Business Insight: Tailoring legal strategies to fit the unique challenges and goals of each client’s business is crucial. Beyond offering legal advice, providing insights on industry trends, regulatory changes, and potential business opportunities positions you as a valuable business advisor, enhancing the client’s trust and reliance on your services.
- Personalized Engagement and Educational Resources: Deepening client relationships through personalized engagement — recognizing milestones and understanding their business deeply — fosters a connection that goes beyond the professional. Complementing this with educational resources, such as workshops or tailored briefs, empowers clients and demystifies complex legal issues, illustrating your commitment to their success.
- Efficiency and Innovation with Feedback Loops: Leveraging technology and innovative practices enhances service delivery efficiency, showing clients that their time and resources are valued. Establishing regular feedback mechanisms allows for continuous service improvement, demonstrating a commitment to evolve in alignment with client needs and preferences.
By integrating these practices, attorneys can transcend traditional roles, becoming indispensable partners who clients trust not just for legal expertise but for comprehensive, anticipatory, and personalized service.

Navigating the Challenges of Unique Responsiveness

Achieving unparalleled client loyalty through unique responsiveness presents its own set of challenges, from maintaining personal engagement within professional boundaries to managing a heavy caseload with efficient time management. 

Additionally, staying ahead of rapidly evolving industry nuances requires constant vigilance. Tackling these issues head-on, attorneys can harness technology and engage in creative problem-solving to enhance their service. 

Clear communication protocols can set realistic client expectations, while legal tech solutions streamline case management, freeing up valuable time for deeper, more personalized client interactions. 

This strategic use of technology, paired with innovative approaches to common hurdles, ensures that attorneys can provide the high level of anticipatory service that clients value, mirroring the adaptability and resourcefulness emblematic of the finest concierge services.

Evolving from Legal Expert to Indispensable Partner

In the competitive landscape of legal services, distinguishing oneself goes beyond showcasing legal expertise; it demands a deep, personal connection with clients and a keen understanding of their business landscape. 

Attorneys excel not just by addressing the legal needs but by becoming ingrained in the very fabric of their clients’ strategic planning and execution. This holistic approach transforms the attorney-client relationship from a traditional, transactional model to a dynamic, strategic partnership.

Achieving this level of integration requires more than just familiarity with the law; it necessitates a commitment to understanding the client’s industry, challenges, aspirations, and even the nuances of their personal journey. 

It’s about offering tailored advice that resonates with the client’s specific business goals and personal values, thereby fostering a bond that transcends the conventional boundaries of legal counsel.

The transformation into a trusted advisor signifies the pinnacle of this journey. 

Attorneys who reach this status do so by proving themselves as not merely legal experts, but as invaluable assets to their clients’ businesses. 

They anticipate needs, mitigate risks, and provide innovative solutions that contribute significantly to the client’s success. 

This role evolves through consistent demonstration of value, adaptability, and unwavering dedication to the client’s objectives.

Such trusted advisors are characterized by their proactive approach to communication, their ability to offer customized solutions that align with business strategies, and their dedication to personal engagement that solidifies deep-rooted trust. 

By embodying these qualities, attorneys cement their role as indispensable partners, ensuring their place not just in the boardroom but in the client’s vision of future success.

This seamless integration of legal expertise with business acumen and personal connection is what sets apart the modern legal professional. It is the essence of not just meeting but exceeding client expectations, paving the way for enduring loyalty and mutual success.

Measuring the Impact of Your Client-Centric Strategies

The journey toward a client-centric legal practice begins with implementation, but its true value is gauged through continuous assessment.

Simplified metrics such as client retention, repeat business, and feedback scores are critical in understanding the effectiveness of your strategies.

Regular feedback mechanisms, whether through surveys or discussions, along with monitoring the impact of personalized interactions, provide a clear picture of client satisfaction and areas for refinement.

This strategic evaluation aligns with Paul Grewal’s insight into the legal field’s competitive nature, emphasizing that client loyalty is not solely won through expertise but through a harmonious blend of attentiveness, personal connection, and alignment with client needs.

Such a comprehensive approach ensures your role as a legal professional evolves from traditional advisory to an indispensable partnership, consistently exceeding expectations and fostering enduring client relationships.

Your Next Steps Toward Client Loyalty

Transforming your legal practice with the dedication of a concierge requires more than just legal acumen — it demands a commitment to unique responsiveness and deep personal engagement.

The journey may be challenging, but the rewards are unparalleled.

Start today by choosing one area to improve upon, whether it’s enhancing your communication tactics, deepening your understanding of a client’s business, or simply making a more personal connection.

Remember, small steps can lead to significant changes. Let’s redefine the standard of service in the legal profession, one client relationship at a time.

# Burnout, Flame Out, Or Timeout?
## Burnout can affect anybody, and our industry isn’t doing enough to fix that.

I wrote in this column a few weeks back about Biglaw’s problem with [George Costanza Syndrome](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/biglaw-is-turning-associates-into-george-costanzas/): the relentless pressure we place on one another to always be working, to always be striving for the next level. I focused at the time on associates, but shocking news from last week highlights the fact that the risk of burnout isn’t limited to the younger generation. The Global Chairman of Baker McKenzie, Paul Rawlinson, has [taken a leave of absence](https://www.law.com/legal-week/2018/10/22/baker-mckenzie-chairman-paul-rawlinson-to-temporarily-step-down-from-role/?slreturn=20180931112950) to recover from the sheer exhaustion of running the second-largest law firm in the world.

It’s no secret that law is a demanding job. That was drilled into all of our heads from long before we took our first practice LSATs. But the game is changing. Attorneys of all stripes are on demand for their clients 24/7 — facing an ever-broadening pool of competition. Our work is being commoditized and devalued. Those market forces are increasing pressure on every single person in the legal space.

Just as the job of being a lawyer has gotten more difficult, the job of leading a law firm has increased in complexity and pressure exponentially. Mr. Rawlinson should be applauded for his decision. But the news is also a moment to ruminate on the issues facing practice group leaders, office leaders, and management teams across the country.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Keep Calm And Bill On

If a law firm leader’s job performance is measured in dollars earned, clients developed, and practice groups grown, all of those metrics have become more challenging to fulfill over the past decade. There are fewer dollars to go around, as industry growth has lagged behind attorney recruitment, and what growth we have seen has mostly been [confined to the upper stratosphere](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/in-defense-of-more-sizzle-less-steak/?rf=1) of the legal profession. Alternative legal service providers are scooping up otherwise reliable clients with repeatable, commoditizable work. Maintaining staffing has become increasingly cutthroat, as more and more lawyers and practice groups come to think of themselves as free agents, and lateraling becomes ever more commonplace. Law firm leadership is a full-time job before you even remember that you’ve got to maintain your existing practice and client base, too.

I’ve said it before and will say it again: the genteel, golden age of Biglaw is over. We’re in a more rough-and-tumble age, and I see no signs that it’s going to get any gentler from here on out.

The classic, easy answer to an attorney’s job getting harder is for the attorney to get harder in response. We muscle through and keep our chins up. Keep Calm And Bill On. That strategy doesn’t work forever, though. And when it breaks down, it breaks hard. We’re all human beings, and we can only perform at superhuman levels for so long before something snaps. For Paul Rawlinson, who reportedly traveled to over 40 offices across six continents in the last two years, he finally hit bottom and tapped out, probably not a moment too soon. He’ll get some time to recuperate, reevaluate, and come back strong.

Others don’t land so softly. Some attorneys flame out, quit their practices, and [go sell cake pops](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/international-lawyer-swaps-her-six-figure-job-for-a-career-in-cake-pops/2018/03/16/a33030f6-26ea-11e8-874b-d517e912f125_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.17f0b44175e0), resulting in a happier and healthier attorney but a poorer legal industry that has lost a promising talent and learned nothing. Others turn to substance abuse, or suffer from stifling depression. Our industry’s mental illness and self-harm rates remain unacceptably high. We’re only now starting to recognize how poisonous the strategy of just toughing it out can be in the long term.

Biglaw Needs A Timeout

If the classic answer to the increasing demands of the legal marketplace has been to get tougher, let me once again advocate for a new approach: getting “realer.” We need to let go of the outdated concept of the inhuman, never-tired, always-working hero attorney and replace it with the vision of actual human beings, because that’s what we all are. We’re people, with physical and mental limitations, lives and families outside of work, and interests beyond briefing, drafting, and billing hours. We need to take better care of one another, at all levels, and [take better care of ourselves](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/the-reverse-golden-rule/).

Biglaw lawyers need a timeout. I’m not talking about the age-old kindergarten punishment. I’m talking about a moment of reflection — a time where we stop thinking about ourselves and start looking at what’s happening in the broader business world. Overwork and superhuman expectations aren’t limited to the legal industry, but we too often limit the resources available to our leaders to meet those expectations. Most CEOs have much larger executive staffs and teams than we do in the legal world. Lawyers don’t seem to think this is necessary, being happy to request their firm leaders serve as HR professionals, interior decorators, and partner dispute mediators, at the same time they’re driving the long-term strategy for the firm. This is not only bad for burnout, but it doesn’t make business sense.

We need to get comfortable letting practice group leaders, office heads, and management teams spend time on leading. That necessarily means that that managers will spend less time generating clients and grinding out hours. That’s not only scary for the firms because it could mean a revenue dip, but that’s also a terrifying prospect for most attorneys, since there is no guarantee the work will still be there when the leadership job ends. But trying to be a full-time lawyer and a full-time leader is a full-blown recipe for disaster. But if done right, the losses in the lawyer’s personal productivity will be gained by the profits that comes along with an effectively-run practice group, office, or firm. Firms and leaders that want to succeed need to know that effective leadership is a calling, not a side gig.

The Value Of Community

We need to focus our leadership’s efforts on building places where attorneys want to work. There will almost always be a firm willing to pay us more if we lateral over. Creating a sense of safety, home, and community is something that a deep-pocketed competitor can’t buy.

Lastly, we need to be kind. In a cutthroat profession in an ever-more vicious world, our fellow firm members should be the people we can always count on. We’re lawyers, so we’ll always have our disputes, but disputes are no reason to forget that it’s human beings we’re sharing our careers with, not just a set of opposing viewpoints. We’re all in this together, from the managing partner to the freshest associate. Let’s start acting like it.

# Moneyball Meets Attorney Recruitment
## Failing at diverse hiring means leaving money on the table.

Have you ever watched a friend miss a big opportunity and then spent the next few hours doing the [Captain Picard facepalm](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/facepalm)? It hurts, doesn’t it? It’s tough to see someone you care about miss out on a chance at happiness, or romance, or professional fulfillment.

What if you saw an entire industry leaving money on the table? What would you say if I told you that law firms across the country, staffed by lawyers who pride themselves on their cool, analytical reasoning ability, have been objectively missing huge opportunities and costing themselves money for literally decades, all in plain sight?

The problem is diversity, and the legal industry’s lack thereof.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

The National Association for Law Placement (“NALP”) publishes an annual report on diversity in law firm hiring, and found in its most recent study that [representation of minorities in law firms in 2016 still lags behind the levels found prior to 2009](https://www.nalp.org/uploads/2016NALPReportonDiversityinUSLawFirmsPressRelease.pdf), back when the recession led to massive layoffs that hit those groups hard. NALP further found that, although minorities make up nearly 1/3 of law firm summer associates, minorities end up making up [less than 15% of practicing law firm attorneys overall, and only around 8% of law firm partners](https://www.nalp.org/uploads/Membership/2016NALPReportonDiversityinUSLawFirms.pdf). In short, the pipeline from law student to firm partner is leaking, and minority attorneys are dropping out of the pipeline at disproportionate rates.

This isn’t just bad politics. It’s not just bad PR. It’s bad business. [Study](https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriklarson/2017/09/21/new-research-diversity-inclusion-better-decision-making-at-work/#36be47824cbf) after [study](https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter) after [study](https://hbr.org/2016/09/diverse-teams-feel-less-comfortable-and-thats-why-they-perform-better) confirms that diverse teams are better teams. They bring more ideas to the table. They view problems in different, unique, and productive ways. They do a better job of avoiding groupthink and self-defeating mentalities. Smart businesses that want to make better decisions are making a concerted effort to get more diverse voices into their structures, and smart law firms need to be doing the same.

You don’t have to take the academics’ word for it, though. Major League Baseball’s opening day was last week, and we started up yet another season of the sport that’s become consumed by [Sabermetrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabermetrics), the fine slicing and dicing of large swaths of data in search of an edge on the competition. Sabermetrics had been creeping up in relevance in baseball circles for decades, but it was the 2003 book Moneyball, and the subsequent movie, that pushed the concept into the general public consciousness.

Moneyball followed the Oakland A’s, a struggling team without the deep financial resources of other teams like the Yankees or Dodgers, that leaned hard into Sabermetrics. The conventional wisdom of the day put a premium on statistics such as batting average and RBI, and players who excelled in those areas were highly sought after, and paid handsomely by the market. Sabermetric analysis had left those statistics in the dust, though, and was focused on deeper, less intuitive, but wholly objective ways of valuing player performance. Oakland’s manager, Billy Beane, focused on recruiting players who excelled in those underappreciated areas, reasoning that by doing so he’d pick up players on the cheap who would outperform their paychecks, letting him compete with the rich kids on a shoestring budget.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
In the book and the movie, the A’s clear-eyed, data-driven approach leads to success and fortune. [One can argue whether that’s a correct interpretation of the A’s history](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/09/the-many-problems-with-moneyball/245769/), but what’s inarguable is that Sabermetrics has absolutely taken over Major League Baseball. Every team in the league has made deep statistical analysis a permanent part of its repertoire. As one sportswriter put it, “[In less than 15 years, the culture inside major league front offices has changed so profoundly that where once teams were mocked for using analytics, they’re now mocked for not using them](https://www.theringer.com/2016/11/3/16038274/2016-world-series-chicago-cubs-theo-epstein-analytics-war-9f1248c44eb7).”

Let us draw two lessons from this for the legal world. First, lawyers are no better than baseball managers at making objective decisions about talent. Even the most woke of attorneys brings unconscious bias to the table. A [2014 study by consulting firm Nextions](http://nextions.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/written-in-black-and-white-yellow-paper-series.pdf) submitted a legal memorandum to 60 law firm partners and asked them to grade it. Each memorandum was the same, and had deliberately inserted errors throughout. Each memo was supposedly drafted by Thomas Meyer, a third-year law firm associate who graduated from NYU Law School, a top-tier program. The only difference was that half the partners were told that Thomas Meyer was Caucasian, and the other half were told he was African-American.

The results were striking. The law firm partners were much harsher, both qualitatively and quantitatively, to the memo produced by the associate they thought was black. Partners noted more spelling, technical writing, and factual/analytical errors, and were far less forgiving in their written feedback. While “Caucasian” Thomas Meyer was considered a “generally good writer” with potential and good analytical skills, “African American” Thomas Meyer needed “lots of work” and was “average at best.” One reviewer wrote that they “can’t believe he went to NYU.” Again, there was zero difference between the actual memoranda these attorneys reviewed — the only variable was the grader’s perception of the author’s skin color.

These unconscious biases appeared to run deep, and to have no correlation with the race, ethnicity, or gender of the partner grading the memo. This type of bias is quite likely the hardest to root out, and potentially the most damaging overall to the profession’s efforts to increase the diversity, backgrounds, and perspectives of its members.

The end result of this very human failing is that some attorneys get undervalued due to their heritage, rather than their content or character. It’s deeply unfair to those attorneys, and it means law firms are passing on hiring potential rainmakers without giving them the chance to prove what they can do.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
A law firm that wants to be on the cutting edge needs to recognize that the conventional wisdom of what makes a lawyer needs to be questioned. Focusing on increasing diversity solves the problem both by compensating for built-in bias, and by helping firms develop smarter organizational decision making structures. Diversity gets us better attorneys, which makes us better lawyers, and makes us more money.

The other lesson of Moneyball? The competition is eventually going to catch up. The arc of the universe is long, but it bends toward both justice and economic efficiency. Diversity hiring is a secret weapon that’s going to break out into the open eventually. Until it does, it’s both good policy and good business to be ahead of the pack.

# On The Retirement Of Miles Ruthberg And The Rise Of Litigation At Latham & Watkins
## The legendary litigator's retirement offers a window into the evolution of Latham as a firm, litigation as a practice area, and Biglaw writ large.

“Back then, if you worked 1500 hours in a year, you got a lecture on how you were ruining the place.”

That’s how [Miles Ruthberg](https://www.lw.com/people/miles-ruthberg), now one of the nation’s top trial lawyers, recalled his early years as an associate at Tuttle & Taylor, where the partners sometimes told the associates they were working too hard. Today, of course, a law firm associate who billed 1500 hours in a year would also get a lecture — of a very different sort.

On January 1, 2020, Ruthberg will retire from the partnership of Latham & Watkins, where he is currently a senior partner and previously served as Global Chair of the Litigation & Trial Department. During more than 40 years in practice and almost a quarter-century at the firm, he has witnessed the world of large law firms, aka “Biglaw,” change dramatically — in some ways for the better, in some ways for the worse, and in some ways whose import remains to be seen.

When I learned of Ruthberg’s planned retirement, writing a retrospective of his long and distinguished career struck me as an excellent opportunity to explore several interesting and important subjects: the rise of Latham’s world-class litigation department, the transformation of Latham from what Ruthberg called “a small L.A. firm” into a global giant, and the evolution of Biglaw more generally.

On an individual rather than industry-wide level, Ruthberg’s rise is fascinating and valuable as well. It shows how it’s possible to achieve spectacular success in a dynamic, often difficult profession, while still retaining every ounce of one’s decency, integrity, and humanity.

One may as well begin with Harvard Law School. After graduating from Yale in 1973, summa cum laude and first in his class, Miles Ruthberg made his way north and matriculated at HLS.

[Peter Wald](https://www.lw.com/people/peter-wald) first met Ruthberg in the summer of 1975. They’ve been best friends ever since.

That summer, after his 1L year at Harvard, Wald learned that he had made it onto the Harvard Law Review. He returned to campus in August, before the start of classes, to begin his work as an editor. Ruthberg, a year ahead of Wald, was one of the 3Ls who was supervising and training the new editors.

“It was a beautiful Saturday afternoon in Cambridge,” Wald said, “and everyone was reporting for duty. And there was Miles, in shorts and a white Lacoste shirt, carrying the Columbo-esque briefcase that he’s had for 40 years.

“This was Harvard Law School, and the Harvard Law Review, in the mid-1970s. There were a lot of people there who were quite full of themselves. But my first impression of Miles — which stood in such stark contrast to the rest of us, these pumped-up masters of the universe — was his humility and kindness.”

Ruthberg was the Developments Editor, and based in part on his first impressions of Ruthberg, Wald decided to join the Developments team. Over the next ten months or so, the two worked together closely, holed up in the rabbit warren of rooms on the third floor of Gannett House, on what would become the seminal law review article addressing class actions. (Working across the hall from them was another member of Wald’s class, an Articles Editor who would go on to fashion an impressive career of his own: one Merrick B. Garland.)

In June 1976, Ruthberg graduated from Harvard Law School, magna cum laude, and moved down to Washington to clerk, first for Judge Carl McGowan of the D.C. Circuit and then for Justice Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court. After Ruthberg was done clerking, he and his then-girlfriend faced a choice: where to live?

Originally from the D.C. area — specifically, Rockville, Maryland — Ruthberg wanted to remain in the region. His girlfriend wanted to move to New York to pursue her acting career. They compromised on a city where they could pursue both of their careers at a high level (and enjoy better weather to boot): the City of Angels, Los Angeles.

In 1978, Ruthberg joined what was then one of L.A.’s leading law firms, Tuttle & Taylor. Numerous luminaries passed through its halls over the years, including Governor Jerry Brown and two future Ninth Circuit judges, William Norris and Raymond Fisher. It was an intellectual, civilized place to work, where 1600 billable hours was [more than enough](https://books.google.com/books?id=kynKDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT133&lpg=PT133&dq=1600+hours+norris+tuttle&source=bl&ots=81lX6PzBIe&sig=ACfU3U092XTbV7IbpnoPGi0clVQPkjgU6Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi3or_D5anmAhUQx1kKHdo4CjkQ6AEwAHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=1600%20hours%20norris%20tuttle&f=false). But Tuttle & Taylor no longer exists, having [closed its doors](http://watanabenason.com/2000/10/16/10-16-00-twelve-tuttle-taylor-lawyers-join-luce-forward-la/) in 2000.

“It’s indicative of what has happened in the profession,” Ruthberg said. “When I went to L.A., there were a dozen or more excellent boutiques in the city. They’re now all gone, except Munger Tolles, the sole survivor.”

One challenge for Tuttle was trying to be an elite boutique in an age that was coming to be dominated by Biglaw. Another challenge flowed from its focus on the L.A. legal market, which has shrunk as a general corporate market over time.

“It’s no accident that so many L.A.-originated firms have become global,” Ruthberg said. “Latham, Gibson Dunn — we expanded nationally and internationally because we had no choice. Quinn Emanuel wouldn’t be what it is today had it stayed only in L.A. and depended on L.A.”

By the time Tuttle & Taylor folded in 2000, Miles Ruthberg was long gone. He left in 1988, as a young partner, for a San Francisco-founded firm that was expanding regionally by opening a Los Angeles office — a firm by the name of Heller Ehrman.

Who brought Ruthberg over to Heller? None other than his old friend from his Harvard Law Review days, Peter Wald.

After his own graduation from HLS in 1977, Wald moved to San Francisco to clerk for then-Chief Judge James Browning of the Ninth Circuit — and, after falling in love with California, Wald never looked back. In 1978, he joined Heller Ehrman, then one of San Francisco’s top firms, and embarked upon a successful litigation career.

By the late 1980s, Heller had settled on a strategy of geographic expansion, to go from being a San Francisco firm to at least a West Coast regional firm. The management committee decided to open a Los Angeles office — and Peter Wald knew the perfect lawyer for the launch. He said to his Heller colleagues, “My best friend is a partner at Tuttle & Taylor and a great lawyer. Shall I call him and see if he’d be interested in opening our L.A. office?” The answer: absolutely.

[](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2019/12/Miles_Ruthberg_Peter_Wald_1986-e1575935237655.jpg)

In 1988, recruited by Wald, Ruthberg left Tuttle to launch the new L.A. office of Heller Ehrman. Over the next eight years, the office expanded rapidly, growing to 70 lawyers from three. Heller’s California litigation practice — featuring Miles Ruthberg and fellow Tuttle alum Ray Fisher in Los Angeles, Peter Wald and legendary antitrust litigator [Larry Popofsky](https://www.orrick.com/News/2017/05/Orrick-Mourns-the-Loss-of-Larry-Popofsky) in San Francisco, and a host of other talented litigators up and down the coast — flourished.

The firm as a whole, however, was experiencing certain issues. Heller was known for having superb lawyers and a collegial firm culture, but it was never viewed as the best-run business. And by the early 1990s, Peter Wald was getting concerned. (Wald turned out to be prescient; Heller later tried to revamp itself, but failed, and in September 2008, the firm [dissolved](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/09/heller-ehrman-anatomy-of-a-dissolution/), more than a century after its founding in 1890.)

In 1993, Wald came close to leaving Heller for a rival firm, but ultimately decided not to make the move (in large part out of loyalty to Popofsky, his mentor and friend). But by late 1995, Wald had decided it was time for him to move on. In December 1995, Wald called Ruthberg to share this thinking — and to see if Ruthberg might be interested in moving too. And Wald had a particular destination in mind: Latham & Watkins.

Founded in Los Angeles in 1934, Latham & Watkins grew slowly at first. By 1960, more than 25 years after opening, it was still an L.A. boutique, with only 19 lawyers. But starting in the 1960s, Latham embarked upon a path of growth and expansion. By the time that Robert Dell took over as managing partner in 1994 (at the tender age of 42), the firm was in the midst of going global, with offices in San Francisco, London, Moscow, and Hong Kong.

One of the founders of Latham’s San Francisco office (along with Bob Dell) was Christopher “Kit” Kaufman, a prominent M&A lawyer. Also a Harvard Law School graduate, Kaufman had recruited Wald to Heller out of HLS. But in 1990, Kaufman left Heller to launch Latham’s San Francisco office. By 1995, the new office was thriving — and hungry for more talent. It didn’t take long for Kaufman and Dell to woo Wald and Ruthberg over to Latham.

In April 1996, Ruthberg and Wald “crossed the street,” in the parlance of the time. They left Heller Ehrman to join Latham & Watkins in Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively.

And the rest, as they say, is history. Over the next 25 years, the two best friends, working with each other and with wonderful colleagues across the globe, helped build one of the world’s great litigation departments — and one of the world’s great law firms.

And the seeds for that success were sown decades ago, back when they were both still law students.

“The law is a puzzle, a paradigm,” Peter Wald said. “You peer over the edge, trying to understand the hierarchies and relationships of different principles and values. That’s the work that Miles and I tried to do at the Harvard Law Review, toiling on the cramped third floor of Gannett House beneath that pitched roof for a full year, trying to make sense of Rule 23 and class actions.”

“It was hard work, interesting work, great work. It’s work we carried over into our future careers, our decades together at Heller and then Latham. We handled major cases, like Enron for Arthur Andersen, and Lehman for Ernst & Young. And we got to do that work together.”

Twenty-five years ago, in 1994, Latham’s litigation department had 166 lawyers, and the entire firm had under 700 lawyers. Today the firm has 2,800 lawyers, including almost 800 in litigation — making the Litigation & Trial Department alone bigger than many a Biglaw firm (e.g., Debevoise & Plimpton, a few doors down Third Avenue from Latham here in New York).

As for revenue, if Latham’s litigation department were a standalone law firm, it would be in the Am Law 50. For 2019, departmental revenue will exceed $1 billion, again larger than all but the biggest of Biglaw firms. (For more data points, see the addendum to this post, “Latham & Watkins Litigation — By the Numbers.”)

Latham’s Litigation & Trial Department has accumulated [ample accolades and awards](https://www.lw.com/AwardSearch.aspx?searchtopicids=276) over the years. Most recently, it scored a spot on BTI Consulting’s [Fearsome Foursome](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/09/fearsome-foursome-is-exactly-the-kind-of-name-that-biglaw-attorneys-think-is-cool/) list — the four firms that general counsel and other in-house leaders would least like to see as opposing counsel in litigation.

Miles Ruthberg himself has also earned many honors. He has been recognized for his excellence by [Chambers and Partners](https://chambers.com/lawyer/miles-ruthberg-usa-5:147616), described as “brilliant” and “the epitome of the trusted adviser.” He is an elected member of the American Law Institute. After being named repeatedly to the Lawdragon 500, he was inducted into the [Lawdragon Hall of Fame](http://www.lawdragon.com/2019/02/20/lawdragon-2019-hall-of-fame-inductions-announced/) earlier this year. (For praise of Ruthberg of a more personal nature, see the addendum, “Testimonials and Tributes for Miles Ruthberg.”)

How did Latham’s Litigation & Trial Department achieve that prominence, prestige, and profitability? The transformation of the firm’s litigation practice over the past 25 years was driven by, and emblematic of, certain key developments in both the practice of litigation and in Biglaw writ large.

First, the expansion of the litigation department that was already underway when Ruthberg and Wald joined in 1996, which they then helped accelerate, reflected the rise of full-service law firms — of which today’s Latham is a preeminent example.

At Latham’s founding in 1934, it was far from full-service. Dana Latham was a tax lawyer (and future Commissioner of the IRS under President Eisenhower), and Paul Watkins was a labor lawyer. But over the ensuing decades, the firm grew dramatically, especially in the transactional practices for which the firm is so widely known today.

In the 1980s, the firm represented such names of the age as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Drexel Burnham Lambert, developing a national reputation in M&A and high-yield debt work. But when the economy turned, and the takeover business went south, Latham suffered accordingly — and had to [remake itself](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB849638669500974000).

The hiring of Ruthberg, Wald, and other leading litigators reflected a conscious decision on the part of Latham to transform itself from a deal-focused to a diversified firm. This would allow the firm to better serve its clients, assisting them with the full panoply of their problems — and it would be better for Latham too, helping it to access new revenue streams and to diversify itself.

Second, the evolution of Latham’s litigation department reflected another critical Biglaw trend: specialization.

“I remember being at Heller in the early 1980s, and the head of our corporate department would still occasionally go into court for clients,” Wald recalled. But as the years passed, as laws and regulations proliferated and grew more complex, and as the litigation market shifted, practicing as a generalist to that degree become more and more untenable, at least in Biglaw.

“GCs were becoming increasingly sophisticated consumers of legal services,” Wald explained. “They had been partners at firms like Latham, they understood the economics of law firms, and they didn’t want to pay to train a very good litigator who didn’t know securities or antitrust or IP. Instead, they wanted great litigators who were also steeped in a particular area or areas of law.”

“When I joined the firm in 1996, the litigators saw themselves as fighter pilots: We can do anything, we’re trial lawyers,” Ruthberg recalled. “That model was great for the time, but I knew it wasn’t where we needed to be.”

Three years later, when Miles Ruthberg took over as Global Chair of the Litigation & Trial Department in 1999, he knew things had to change.

“We had to become leaders in certain specialties within litigation, not to claim that we’re good at everything,” he said. “In 1999, we put a practice-group strategy in place.”

The early major practice groups included antitrust, intellectual property, securities/professional responsibility, white-collar defense and investigations, and mass torts/environmental. A somewhat smaller but very high-profile and elite practice group was Supreme Court and appellate litigation, founded by the estimable [Maureen Mahoney](https://www.lw.com/people/maureen-mahoney) and now led by another leading SCOTUS advocate, [Gregory Garre](https://www.lw.com/people/gregory-garre).

Transforming a far-flung department with hundreds of lawyers, getting them to think of and organize themselves along practice-group rather than geographic lines — e.g., I’m a securities litigator, not just a New York litigator —  was no easy task. But Ruthberg had both the intellectual vision to develop the strategy and the interpersonal skills to implement it.

“Law is a traditional profession and industry,” Wald said. “Requiring lawyers to excel not just in their chosen venue but in a specialized practice area was new. Miles, with his incredible skill set, was able to get people comfortable with that change.”

“During Miles’s reign as chair, we worked very hard to move the department toward a practice-area orientation. It started on his watch, and it became the law of the land during my seven years as chair,” said Wald, who succeeded Ruthberg as Global Chair in 2004. “Associates wouldn’t be promoted unless they were supported not just by the global and local department chairs but by the global practice group as well.”

The practice-area strategy was a smashing success. As Wald put it, “It moved our litigation practice into the next tier — where we didn’t just have excellent lawyers, but we were working for the biggest clients, on their most dangerous cases, in the most exciting practice areas.” In 2004, just five short years after institution of the practice groups, Latham was a finalist for the American Lawyer’s Litigation Department of the Year.

Third, Latham’s litigation practice participated in the trend of globalization: the need for major, full-service law firms to grow alongside their clients, in an increasingly international and interconnected world.

While certain smaller firms and boutiques, generally with a certain specialization or expertise, can survive and even thrive without going global, firms of a certain size, scope, and scale will have no choice but to expand. A firm can be a Wachtell Lipton or a Latham & Watkins, but it will get harder and harder to be a “biggish” Biglaw firm with no particular identity, specialty, or strength. Bruce MacEwen calls these doomed institutions the “Hollow Middle” in his [law firm taxonomy](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/05/from-across-the-desk-a-law-firm-taxonomy-introduction/). Some of them — Heller Ehrman, arguably — are no longer with us.

“When I took over as Chair, and Miles moved on to the Executive Committee, we worked together to make the department truly global,” Wald said. “We looked for the best and the brightest, in the United States, in Europe, and later in Asia, so we could serve clients by managing their litigation risk globally, both in the courts and through international arbitration. Miles was front and center in that change.”

“When I first joined Latham in 2006, someone from a competitor firm asked me, ‘Why do you want to go to a satellite office of an L.A. firm? That misapprehends who we are,” said [Sean Berkowitz](https://www.lw.com/people/sean-berkowitz), the former federal prosecutor who rose to fame for his work on the Enron case and joined Latham shortly thereafter. “Although I live in Chicago, I practice on a global basis. I’ve flown over 100,000 domestic miles this year, going to Boston, New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Washington (D.C.), San Diego, and San Francisco. I work with people in all of these offices, on a daily or weekly basis.”

“A competitive advantage of Latham is that we are one of the largest of our peer firms, with more A-plus talent in more places than most of our competitors,” said [BJ Trach](https://www.lw.com/people/bj-trach), another former federal prosecutor, who joined Latham in 2012, after it opened in Boston. “We then put the best lawyers for a given problem in front of the client, regardless of where those lawyers might sit.”

Consider one headline-making matter that Berkowitz and Trach are handling together now: representing actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, clothing designer Mossimo Giannulli, in the “Operation Varsity Blues” college admissions case. They work on the case with colleagues across the country, including [Perry Viscounty](https://www.lw.com/people/perry-viscounty) (Orange County), a veteran trial lawyer, and [Roman Martinez](https://www.lw.com/people/roman-martinez) (D.C.), a former Supreme Court clerk and assistant to the solicitor general.

So the days of Latham as “an L.A. firm” are long gone. Los Angeles is not the firm’s largest office, and it hasn’t been for quite some time. Today the three largest offices by headcount are New York, London, and D.C., with Los Angeles and Chicago going back and forth for fourth place. (As for the largest litigation departments by headcount, the order is actually D.C., New York, San Francisco, Chicago, and Los Angeles.)

As globalization has taken hold throughout Biglaw, many firms no longer have their founding office as their largest office. Gibson Dunn, Latham’s fellow “Los Angeles gone global” firm, also has its largest office in New York. Two Chicago-founded global giants, Kirkland & Ellis and Sidley Austin, still have their largest offices in the Windy City — but their New York offices are second, catching up quickly. Dechert and Morgan Lewis, both founded in Philadelphia, now have their largest offices in New York and D.C., respectively. And the list goes on.

Fourth and finally, in terms of trends shaping the Litigation & Trial Department, in the past decade or so we have seen what could be called “the rise (or return) of the trial lawyer.” In response, Latham litigation has stayed successful by maintaining, growing, and promoting its excellence as a firm that knows how to try cases.

“Maybe eight or ten years ago, the litigation world evolved to a point where firms known as ‘trial-ready’ firms became huge players in the market,” Ruthberg said. “Think of Bartlit Beck, Boies Schiller, or Quinn Emanuel.”

(Or, for that matter, other great litigation shops like Holwell Shuster & Goldberg, Kaplan Hecker & Fink, Keker Van Nest, Kellogg Hansen, Kobre & Kim, Lankler Siffert & Wohl, MoloLamken, Spears & Imes, Susman Godfrey, Wilkinson Walsh + Eskovitz, and many more.)

“We were doing tons of trial work,” Ruthberg said, “but we weren’t marketing it separately. Under the leadership of Sean [Berkowitz], Jamie [Wine], and now Michele [Johnson], the last three Global Chairs, we started doing that — and it’s now probably the fastest-growing part of our practice.”

Latham took two concrete steps to promote its trial work. First, the department adopted a new name, the “Litigation & Trial Department.” Second, it launched a new practice group, Complex Commercial Litigation, since so many trials and arbitrations arise in this space. After Sean Berkowitz transitioned the role of Global Chair over to [Jamie Wine](https://www.lw.com/people/jamie-wine), he assumed leadership of the new CCL practice.

It might seem surprising to some, in the age of the [supposedly vanishing jury trial](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/08/nyregion/jury-trials-vanish-and-justice-is-served-behind-closed-doors.html), to focus even more on trial work — but it actually makes a certain kind of sense.

“There has been an undeniable decrease in jury trials, but this just places a premium on the small number of lawyers who know how to do them,” Berkowitz said. “You never know where a case might end up, and if you hire someone to settle a case, you’ll end up paying more.”

“And you can’t overlook arbitrations,” he added. “Although many of them are confidential, they can involve billions of dollars, and they are basically bench trials.”

What does the future hold for the Litigation & Trial Department? [Michele Johnson](https://www.lw.com/people/michele-johnson), who became Global Chair in April, identified some areas of focus for her tenure.

“One of my priorities as Chair is simply for the world to know what we are already doing, as one of the top litigation practices in the world,” she said. “We’ve built it; we want people to know about it. I want our brand to be commensurate with our talent, the matters we’re handling, and the results we’re getting for our clients.”

“Some of the most well-known litigation firms operate on a ‘star system,’ but we have more of a ‘constellation system.’ We have at least 30 stars, including many first-chair trial lawyers, who operate across practice groups. We don’t have a ‘trial group,’ because we’re all trial lawyers. And we have lots of women, kickass women. Six of our biggest wins in litigation have been led or co-led by women.”

(For more, see Jenna Greene, [Latham Leads With First-Chair Women Litigators](https://www.law.com/litigationdaily/2019/11/07/daily-dicta-latham-leads-with-first-chair-women-litigators/). As Greene notes, Latham’s litigation department has now been led by two women in a row, since Johnson was preceded by Jamie Wine — definitely one of the firm’s “kickass women,” who obtained a massive [$666 million arbitration award](https://www.law.com/litigationdaily/2019/08/22/shout-out-a-666-million-win-for-latham/) in August.)

“In terms of areas for strategic growth, we are looking at data privacy and cyber security, as well as copyright and its intersection with antitrust — for example, how to price music,” Johnson said. “We are trying more cases, for both plaintiffs and defendants. We are increasingly partnering with our clients on alternative fee arrangements, working on partial or even full contingent-fee arrangements. We are eager to bet on ourselves.”

“In terms of our future priorities, we take the long-term view. A lot of firms are focused on next year’s PPP. We are focused on the next generation.”

*            *            *

The evolution of the Litigation & Trial Department must be understood not just against the backdrop of changes in Biglaw and in litigation, but in the context of Latham as a firm. Much of the department’s success flows from having great lawyers, but much of it is can be traced to Latham’s firm culture. Having great lawyers is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a successful firm; just ask Tuttle & Taylor, or Heller Ehrman.

Because of Latham’s size, scale, and success, its status as a Biglaw behemoth, some outside observers imagine the firm as an [“aggressive”](https://www.chambers-associate.com/latham-watkins/true-picture/3689/1) or sharp-elbowed environment. But nothing could be further from the truth. Although Latham is ambitious in its desire to be the biggest and best, and its lawyers are aggressive in protecting and advancing their clients’ interests, the firm’s internal culture is very team-focused, a little touchy-feely, verging on “Kumbaya.” (Actually, if I had to pick a Latham [theme song](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/27/business/media/27lawsuit.html), I’d probably go with [“Shiny Happy People.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYOKMUTTDdA))

“We don’t have internal jostling,” as Miles Ruthberg put it. “Instead, we’re like the Washington Nationals, hugging each other in the dugout.”

The firm is run by a nine-member Executive Committee, consisting of two junior partners, two senior partners, two at-large partners, two vice-chairs, and a chair. The EC appoints department chairs and sets partner compensation, but it is not as powerful or dictatorial as its counterparts at many other firms.

“Management at Latham is not very top-down,” Ruthberg said. “Instead, things bubble up through multiple channels, many matters get handled by the committees, and the firm proceeds through broad consensus.”

“We do have great management, but individual lawyers at the firm retain a lot of autonomy,” said Michele Johnson, a former Executive Committee member. “At certain other firms, there’s a guy at the top — almost always a guy — and you have to be in his orbit to have power. At Latham, we have a diffuse and democratic distribution of power.”

This decentralized approach explains how a firm as large as Latham isn’t lumbering. It encourages individual partners to act entrepreneurially, supported but not controlled by firm leadership.

“Leadership at Latham is in many ways about letting lawyers run their own practices, rather than telling them what to do,” Sean Berkowitz said. “It’s like the formula for success on D-Day: empower the people on the ground to do what they feel is necessary to be successful, and give them the tools they need to accomplish their goals.”

Instead of being about power, as it is at many other firms, leadership at Latham is about service.

“It’s like being dean of a college,” Ruthberg said. “Your job is to establish a system that promotes other people’s opportunities, to figure out how to help them succeed. You’re also expected to maintain your practice; we don’t have a ‘management class’ here at Latham. The only people at the firm who are full-time managers are the chair and two vice chairs.”

Viewing management as about tendering service rather than exerting power shapes how Latham partners select their leaders. It’s not about who has a big book of business, but who can do a good job.

“At Latham, we focus on leadership qualities when electing the Executive Committee,” said Jamie Wine, a former Committee member. “At many other places, the executive committee members are just the top business generators. This often doesn’t allow for diversity — not just gender or racial or ethnic diversity, but other forms of diversity as well, such as in practice areas, geography, or seniority.”

“One important development in the evolution of the firm is the increase in diversity in leadership. When I joined in 1995, a woman had never served on the Executive Committee. A number of women have served on the Executive Committee since then, and today three of the nine members are women.”

Latham’s emphasis on teamwork, promoted by its view of leadership as service, gets further reinforced through its compensation system.

“Many firms talk about their culture as being collaborative and collegial,” said BJ Trach, a current Executive Committee member. “Latham puts its money where its mouth is, using a compensation system that makes sure people are collaborating.”

“Our compensation system is one of the most important factors in our firm’s success,” Ruthberg said. “It’s the best system I’ve seen, and I’ve been in the compensation function at every firm I’ve been in.”

Latham’s system contains both lockstep and incentive elements, seeking to combine long-term stability with short-term scrutiny. The lockstep portion involves partnerships units, a minimum of 300 and a maximum of 900, for a 3:1 spread. The incentive portion comes in the form of bonuses or “fund awards,” which come from a pool amounting to 15 percent of firm profits. (It’s like the [Paul Weiss system](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/a-peek-inside-paul-weiss-10-secrets-to-biglaw-success/) of lockstep plus bonuses, although the Paul Weiss bonus pool is smaller than the Latham bonus pool.)

Units are stable, while bonuses go up and down. Fund awards can be larger than unit compensation, which allows Latham to compete for talent at the high end. And competing for talent is critical in this age of lateral movement.

“We have not lost any of our top partners over the past few years, but it has gotten relentlessly competitive,” Ruthberg said. “That’s why you have to remain extremely profitable — if you’re not, you start losing your people.”

The Executive Committee sets partner pay. Its compensation decisions are informed but not controlled by Latham’s credit system, a “double-credit” system with an origination credit for bringing in the client and a proliferation credit for generating more business from the client. Either credit can be split, in two or more ways; if three partners pitch and land a new client, the origination credit can be split three ways.

“Over the years, the system has gotten more complicated, but the principles remain the same,” Ruthberg said. “You’re rewarded for creating the client relationship, and you’re rewarded for deepening the client relationship. The system promotes bringing in younger partners, cross-selling practice areas, and teamwork.”

And teamwork, in the end, is what it’s all about — at Latham, and in life. Just ask Peter Wald.

“Back in our Harvard Law Review days, when Miles and I talked about possibly practicing together someday, we made a commitment to help each other and support each other always, so that together we’d be better than either of us could be standing on our own. That’s the ethos of both the Latham litigation department and the entire firm.”

*            *            *

For Miles Ruthberg, what will life look like after January 1, 2020? Upon his retirement from Latham’s partnership, Ruthberg will become “of counsel.” He will serve as a resource and strategic advisor to the firm’s lawyers and clients, but he will no longer be in the litigation trenches. So perhaps he will come full circle and return to the days of billing 1500 hours a year, like when he was a junior associate at Tuttle & Taylor.

Should he cut back to that degree, Ruthberg will have earned it. He has certainly spent more than enough years at the firm. Latham has no mandatory retirement age, but most partners retire by 65 — making Ruthberg, at 67, one of the five oldest partners out of some 700 partners worldwide.

And he has certainly given the firm more than enough hours. During his busiest years as a Latham partner, including his entire time as Litigation Chair and on the Executive Committee, he worked 3200 to 3500 hours a year, roughly twice the hours he worked as a young associate at Tuttle. That difference in total hours reflects the difference between Tuttle and Latham as firms, the increasing demands of Biglaw over time, and Ruthberg’s assumption of management responsibilities at Latham, which can add 1000 or more hours in a typical year.

Of course, people’s retirements don’t always turn out as planned — and considering how much he loves his work and how much his clients and colleagues love him, don’t be shocked if Ruthberg finds himself busier than expected in his “retirement.” To paraphrase an [old saying](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/314053/early-usage-you-can-take-the-boy-out-of-the-country), you can take the boy out of Biglaw, but you can’t take the Biglaw out of the boy.

That said, Ruthberg will have plenty of other ways to spend his time. He’s a white male Biglaw partner in his late 60s, so yes, he enjoys golf. He has two children, a son and a daughter — both in medical school (go figure) — and he plans to spend more time with them and their families. But most notably, Ruthberg told me, “I plan to follow my wife around” — which could itself be a full-time occupation.

Ruthberg’s wife, [Catherine Schreiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Schreiber), is an acclaimed theater producer who works in both the United States and the United Kingdom. She has earned two Tony Awards (for Clybourne Park in 2012 and Angels in America in 2018), four other Tony nominations, four Olivier nominations (for her work in London), and the Broadway Global Producer of the Year award in 2017. (For my first interview with Ruthberg, I caught him right before he left for London for the opening of Schreiber’s latest production, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe — which has garnered [excellent](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/nov/26/the-lion-the-witch-and-the-wardrobe-review-magical-escape-from-the-perils-of-war) [reviews](https://www.timeout.com/london/theatre/the-lion-the-witch-and-the-wardrobe-review).)

In Biglaw, Miles Ruthberg is a big deal. But in the theater world, he’s “Mr. Schreiber” or “Catherine’s husband.” And that’s fine with him: “Having spent so many years as Miles Ruthberg the lawyer, with Catherine’s support, it’s a beautiful thing for me to reciprocate and support Catherine as she continues to soar.”

Earlier this month, on December 7, Miles and Catherine celebrated their [33rd wedding anniversary](https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/07/style/ms-schreiber-actress-marries-mn-ruthberg.html). Perhaps reflecting Ruthberg’s continuing dedication to his clients, they dined that evening with the general counsel of Ernst & Young and his wife. (Ruthberg and his client were coming from a golf game that afternoon; the two couples had a lovely dinner, and Ruthberg and Schreiber agreed to celebrate their anniversary again privately on a different night.)

Looking back over his more than two decades at Latham & Watkins, Miles Ruthberg has no regrets, only gratitude: “I feel blessed beyond belief, getting to work every day with people I love working with.”

And in typical Miles Ruthberg fashion, when asked to describe his greatest accomplishment at the firm, he made it not about himself.

“When I get up in the morning, I have no internal conflict or concern about this transition, because the firm is in fabulous shape and will only continue to ascend. And as I approach my retirement as a partner, I’m most proud of the people that I have worked with and recruited to Latham.”

“There is no one else I have met who combines such raw brainpower with the deep wellspring of humanity that Miles exhibits in every minute of every day. His empathy, his compassion, his concern for other people — these qualities alone would make him a huge contributor, but combining them with his sheer brilliance is what makes Miles the extraordinary individual he is.”

“Teamwork, collegiality, mutual support and respect — Miles embodies all of these things. And he inculcates those values in other people — not by telling them how to act but by setting an example himself.”

“Miles is a lawyer’s lawyer. He is who I would call if I were in trouble, and he’s who I would hire for an enterprise threatening matter if I were a general counsel. I am a better lawyer and better person for having had the opportunity and privilege of working with him. We won’t see someone with Miles’s combination of brilliance, warmth and perseverance again in my lifetime.”

“On issues of culture and diversity, Miles has always been ahead of his time. Every firm needs a Miles Ruthberg. From day one, he was all about surrounding himself with the best people, mentoring them, and giving them the best opportunities. And if you look at the people he has mentored, like looking at a coaching tree in the NFL, so many of them are women or diverse — like me, Michele [Johnson], and BJ [Trach].”

“I had a trial with Miles when I was a sixth-year associate. This wasn’t my first trial, but it was my biggest to date, for Ernst & Young, a longstanding client of the firm. It was important enough that the general counsel was there, sitting through the whole trial.”

“I was given the opportunity to handle some witnesses, even though I wasn’t a partner yet. I was almost done cross-examining a witness, and then we had a break. There was one more question I wanted to ask before the witness got off the stand — a risky question, but if we got the right response, it could be devastating.”

“Miles and the client and I discussed it during the break. Miles noted how risky it was, and he seemed to be leaning against asking the question. But I made my case for asking, and in the end he said, ‘You know the case and this witness best — I defer to you.’ After the witness took the stand again, I got up and asked the question. I got exactly the answer I wanted, and it was devastating.”

“Miles let me make this important judgment, on the fly, as an associate, in a major trial with the GC in attendance. That’s what it’s like working with Miles: he trusts you, he respects you, and he empowers you.”

“I remember working with Miles on the reply brief for a summary judgment motion, back when I was a fourth-year associate and he was a partner. We were on the phone, going over the draft, and on every critical issue, Miles asked, ‘Michele, what do you think?’ As a young associate, that meant so much to me. I thought to myself, ‘If Miles cares what I think, then what I think must have value.’”

“Shortly after I joined Latham, I had the chance to pitch for a relatively small matter, but my first at the firm. I called Miles in New York to get his advice. After hearing a bit about it, he said to me, ‘This sounds like a great opportunity — I will fly up from New York and pitch it together with you.’ At the time he was one of Latham’s most senior partners, but he was willing to go out of his way to help me, a junior colleague who had been at the firm for all of a month. That’s just the kind of colleague he is.”

“Miles is a great lawyer, a brilliant legal thinker. It’s amazing to see him in a courtroom arguing. These incredible insights come out of his mouth in the exact way they’d be written in a brief that would take us normal people days to get right. His standards could not be higher. He is constitutionally incapable of not making sure that work product is perfect before it’s circulated to the client or filed with the court. It makes all of us better at what we do.”

“But he’s also a wonderful mentor. He cares deeply about the development of younger lawyers in his practice, and he’s so generous with his time. He knows that Latham gets super-smart people at every level, and he wants everyone’s input to be valued.”

“Miles has just done such a great job of embodying the Latham culture, everything that is the best of the firm. I have never heard him say a bad thing about anyone. He is cool all the time, even under the highest-pressure situations. And on the matters he oversees, he creates a culture of collaboration and enjoyment, where everyone feels welcome and is having fun.”

“It makes such a huge difference to have leaders like Miles. I’ve learned so much from him, and his retirement, while deserved, is bittersweet for me and many others.”

# Biglaw Firm Touts Its Success, But Doesn't Praise Associates With Special Bonuses
## Associates say morale at the firm is 'at an all-time low.'

Considering the fact that many firms conducted salary cuts due to COVID-19, Biglaw’s 2020 bonus season numbers were actually quite generous. This year’s bonus haul consisted of traditional year-end bonuses coupled with special bonuses that were given to associates in appreciation of their hard work during the pandemic. Firms that didn’t hand out both bonuses were considered below market, which is not a great place to be — but that’s where this Am Law 200 firm reportedly finds itself.

Stroock & Stroock & Lavan — a firm that brought in $258,000,000 in gross revenue in 2019, placing it at #122 on the most recent Am Law ranking — [slashed salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/stroock-cuts/) in June, but gave attorneys the opportunity to recoup lost pay through their annualized billable hours. We recently learned that Stroock handed out bonuses just before the holidays, but associates aren’t exactly thrilled.

The firm doesn’t send out bonus memos, but instead calls associates individually. Here’s what our sources say about 2020’s bonuses at Stroock:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Associates were given the standard end-of-year bonus scale as in past years but were NOT given a special “COVID” bonus – neither in the fall nor at the end of the year. This is extremely troubling as Stroock has always been a “market rate” firm, yet now gives sub-market-rate bonuses while less prestigious firms with lower payscales and much lower profits per partner are awarding special bonuses.

Morale at the firm is at an all-time low. All this while the firm touts [how busy our Financial Restructuring practice has been](https://www.stroock.com/#slide1) right on the front page of the website. It seems from all firm communications that 2020 was a great year financially for the firm despite COVID, so to make less than my peers at firms that have struggled is anything but fair.

UPDATE (1/6): Here are some additional quotes from Stroock associates, who are less-than pleased with the situation at the firm.

Stroock gave Cravath bonuses in the New York and DC offices (smaller bonuses in Miami and Los Angeles) to associates who billed over 2000 hours. We heard the firm would pay “special COVID bonuses” to associates who made “extraordinary contributions” to the firm (i.e., 2300 hours or more). It seems like the firm is trying to pull a fast one on terminology here. They always offer special bonuses for high billers, but they’re not equivalent to the special COVID bonuses that were offered by other firms in 2020. Morale here has been very low. I think an associate exodus may be coming.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
I just want to emphasize that, in addition to the lack of special bonuses, the firm is not paying backpay for pay cuts unless you make you hours (with no backpay for staff!!), which clearly breaks with almost all other firms. At the beginning of COVID, Stroock talked about how we are all in this together and it would do everything it could to preserve jobs and salaries because we are family. Those words have not been backed up with action. Despite having what appears to be a good year (bolstered by litigation and financial restructuring), taking $8M in PPP funding, and having profits per partner that far exceed our size and ranking, the firm is refusing to provide even close to market compensation. The partners should be ashamed of their greed during this pandemic.

# Associate Tells Biglaw To Buzz Off So He Can Start New Career As Beekeeper

The pandemic brought more to Biglaw than just record revenues — it also inspired some associates to find their true calling outside of the law. If you’ve been dreaming about escaping from behind your desk, you’re not alone. Read on to learn more about a highly pedigreed lawyer who left the Biglaw hive to pursue his passion for beekeeping.

Meet Michael Walsh, a Cambridge law graduate who worked in the London offices of Clifford Chance and Covington & Burling. In December 2021, Walsh decided that his career in project finance was no longer the bee’s knees, so he quit. It’s not all about the money, honey, so Walsh opted to start a business that would “both help a species in need and help the environment.”

Walsh now runs [The Urban Apiarist](https://theurbanapiarist.com/), a corporate and residential beekeeping company, and he recently sat down with [Legal Cheek](https://www.legalcheek.com/2022/03/why-i-quit-the-london-office-of-a-us-law-firm-to-pursue-my-passion-for-beekeeping/) to give them the buzz:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
How has your background in law helped in what you do now? Were law firms generally supportive of your interest in the environment and sustainability?

Law has helped me with my business. It’s helped me in negotiating contractual terms with clients and organising the tasks I need to complete. The nature of a conditions precedent checklist has come in handy when splitting up the tasks and requirements to get the company going. It’s been like a transaction, where you work through all the tasks to help a client with financing or in the case of the bees work through all the tasks before you can install beehives.

Law firms have been really supportive of bees! A number of firms across the city have hives on their roof. There has been a trend over the last few years of law firms realising the importance of the environment and sustainability. This has been positive for pollinators, whether that’s through working on helping pollinators on-site or using their legal skills in an attempt to prevent the bee-harming neonicotinoid pesticides from being reintroduced into the UK.

Walsh reports that he’s got law firm clients and that he’s eager to work with companies that will help this species in need, explaining, “Companies can always help if they have the space, from installing pollinator-friendly flowers or installing beehives if appropriate. I’m keen to work with companies to help them develop their environmental goals and advise on what they can do to achieve these goals.”

Congrats to Michael Walsh on his un-bee-lievable new business. We wish him the best of luck on his goal of “[t]aking over the world, one hive at a time!”

# The Am Law A-List: Ranking The Most Elite Law Firms In America (2019)

Another day, another ranking for lawyers to ogle in a search for meaning as they attempt to get through the day’s billables. Such is the life of a Biglaw attorney, always on the hunt for confirmation that their firm is the best firm, the one that’s hitting all of its essential metrics year after year. If that sounds like you (and you might as well admit it, it probably does), then you should check out the latest offering from the American Lawyer, the annual [A-List](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/07/24/the-2019-a-list-law-firms-think-holistically-to-make-the-cut/) ranking.

Are you somehow unfamiliar with this ranking? Here are all of the metrics that it measures to determine which Biglaw firms are the best of the best:

The American Lawyer’s annual A-List ranking doesn’t measure size or profits. Rather, it highlights the best of the best law firms for their commitment to a variety of financial and cultural markers: revenue per lawyer, pro bono work, associate satisfaction, racial diversity and gender diversity among the partnership. The last metric was added to our calculation in 2017 to recognize firms for supporting women and making them partners.

# Top 20 Biglaw Firm Isn't Matching Associate Salary Increases (Yet)
## Associates at this firm will just have to wait and see about raises....

‘Where’s my raise?’

For the second time in less than a year, cash compensation in Biglaw is increasing. Eager to attract and retain associates during this hot lateral market, many firms have already adopted the new salary scale [set by Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/) just last week. It’s still early in the cycle, but with salaries now ranging from $215,000 to $385,000, we suspected that some firms would wait for compensation leaders like Cravath and Davis Polk to make their own announcements prior to making a move, while other firms would simply not be able to match what the market would bear.

Some of Biglaw’s highest-grossing firms have already adopted Milbank’s new salary scale, but one top-ranked firm just isn’t in the mood yet.

Yesterday, associates at Norton Rose Fulbright — a firm that brought home $1,877,933,000 gross revenue in 2020, ranking it at No. 13 on the most recent Am Law 100 — received a memo from U.S. managing partner Jeff Cody informing them that a Milbank match was not yet on the way.

With a new salary scale that looks like this, associates weren’t exactly pleased:

Class	Salary
2021	$215,000
2020	$225,000
2019	$250,000
2018	$285,000
2017	$325,000
2016	$350,000
2015	$370,000
2014+	$385,000
Here’s what Cody had to say (full memo available on the next page):

“I wanted to let you know that we are monitoring these changes while recognizing that, as was the case in May and December last year, an additional increase may be forthcoming. We discussed the increase with the National NPAC and appreciated its members sharing their comments and concerns. As always, while we believe that other considerations drive retention, we understand that compensating our talented lawyers at market is essential. Rest assured that if and when we announce an increase, it will be retroactive to January 1, 2022.”

A source from inside the firm said, “Norton Rose is sitting out until DPW or Cravath (re)establishes dominance, I guess. Bonus memos regarding 2021 bonuses and 2022 compensation come out any day… guess they don’t want to have to update them.” Indeed. NRF is supposed to distribute compensation letters to associates this week, and in his memo, Cody noted that they will “not be reflective of any potential change in 2022 base compensation.”

On the bright side, Cody concluded his memo by stating, “We hope to be back in touch by the end of the week.” All eyes, of course, are now on Cravath and DPW. Are they prepared to meet Norton Rose’s deadline? We — along with thousands of Biglaw associates at firms across the country — will be waiting.

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Norton Rose Fulbright.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Milbank) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Milbank”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# The International Crime Of Ecocide
## The addition of ecocide would also expand the International Criminal Court’s jurisdiction to times of peace.

The international legal order should end impunity for environmental violations. Unfortunately, free trade agreements often create one-way rights, impeding the ability of governments to exert their own claims against environmental violations. Two months ago, however, an independent expert panel of top international criminal and environmental lawyers [proposed](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ca2608ab914493c64ef1f6d/t/60d7479cf8e7e5461534dd07/1624721314430/SE+Foundation+Commentary+and+core+text+revised+%281%29.pdf) a fifth international crime alongside genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and crime of aggression: ecocide.

In the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), ecocide would include “unlawful or wanton acts committed with knowledge that there is a substantial likelihood of severe and either widespread or long-term damage to the environment being caused by those acts.”

The ICC’s limited personal jurisdiction can prove effective against fighting environmental violations. Article 25(1) of the Rome Statute restricts the ICC’s personal jurisdiction to natural persons, which means that the ICC cannot investigate or prosecute governments or corporations but may investigate individuals who are members of groups. The addition of ecocide as an international crime could make key corporate actors, like investors and executives, personally liable to criminal prosecution. Ecocide would deter individuals from committing environmental violations where ESG funds or carbon credits have failed.

Most importantly, the addition of ecocide would also expand the ICC’s jurisdiction to times of peace. Presently, the ICC can only prosecute for environmental violations if they occur during the four other international crimes. Indeed, ecocide does occur during war. For example, in the Vietnam War, the U.S. military used chemical weapons such as Agent Orange to destroy agricultural land. But as scientists and diplomats now recognize, the most severe environmental damage does not occur during armed conflicts. Rather, mines and pipelines continue to explode without any link to actual warfare.

The legal climate movement must give teeth to international agreements such as the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. The crime of ecocide would shift how the legal community views harms against nature. Jojo Mehta, the Stop Ecocide campaign’s co-founder, [observes](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201105-what-is-ecocide?), “If something’s a crime, we place it below a moral red line. At the moment, you can still go to the government and get a permit to frack or mine or drill for oil, whereas you can’t just get a permit to kill people, because it’s criminal. Once you set that parameter in place, you shift the cultural mindset as well as the legal reality.” As Justice William O. Douglas ideated in Sierra Club v. Morton, to include ecocide as a crime is to include nature’s voice in the courtroom. The addition of crime of ecocide may be what is necessary to protect the rights of nature.

# Young Lawyers In Trouble
## Why a recent survey is bad news for attorney retention, and what we can do about it.

It’s hard to be a lawyer. Our profession is tough on us mentally, emotionally, and physically. I’d argue it’s especially hard on young attorneys still struggling to figure out their practice and their niche. Associates work long, hard hours under immense pressure. It’s not surprising to think that many struggle with maintaining their desire to practice.

But I don’t think anyone was prepared for the [recently released](https://www.ibanet.org/document?id=IBA-Young-Lawyers-Report-2022) results of a survey of young attorneys commissioned by the International Bar Association. The responses on workplace satisfaction were striking — and disturbing. When asked their odds of moving to a new workplace within the next five years, over half, 54%, responded they were somewhat or highly likely to do so. One out of three respondents said they were likely to move to a new branch of the legal profession, such as shifting from private practice to in-house, government, or academia. What’s more, 20% of respondents reported they were likely to leave the practice of law entirely.

Although most of the respondents were surveyed in countries outside the United States, that doesn’t give me much comfort. The U.S. is reputed as one of the most hard-driving, hard-working business cultures on the planet. I can’t imagine the same survey would have any better results if taken stateside, and it could well be worse. How did we get to the point where one out of five young attorneys is willing to throw away the years of difficult, expensive education they went through to become a lawyer by leaving the practice of law entirely?!

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It’s A Long Way Up

Luckily, the IBA survey contains some of the answers to the questions its headline-making statistics raise. The biggest culprit appears to be young attorneys feeling a lack of ability to better themselves professionally. Fully 90% of young attorneys surveyed reported encountering barriers to their career progression preventing them from having a clear path to the future they wanted. The biggest culprit was a lack of work-life balance at 37%, but close on its heels were lack of mentorship (36%) and lack of opportunities for promotion (31%).

These are some practical concepts worth exploring. Work-life balance is a perennial challenge in law, but one that many firms have been increasingly willing to tackle. Increased flexibility with work-from-home and nontraditional hour structures offer the promise of helping attorneys get their work done on a schedule that meshes better with their home life. Biglaw’s slow creep toward results-oriented billing structures — and away from measuring associate output purely by billable hours and dollars collected — could also help relieve some of that stress from attorneys young and old.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The challenges of lack of mentorship and lack of promotion opportunities are likewise curable, but they require real thought and effort to make them effective. It’s easy at a management level to slap together a list matching up associates with partners, declare that a mentorship relationship has been formed, and ask people to meet regularly to work on the associate’s progress. Real mentorships require a significant investment of time and care by both parties, and that can’t just be assigned into existence.

A firm looking to develop its mentoring culture would be better served by finding opportunities to make partners and associates spend time working side-by-side on problems unrelated to just briefing, drafting, and billing. Proximity and time are the magic ingredients to real affinity and friendship. It can be challenging to make that happen during a pandemic and [with remote working becoming the norm](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/remote-working-isnt-just-a-perk-anymore/), but if you find a way to give your people space and time to develop real care for one another, mentoring will naturally follow.

Creating promotion opportunities is also doable. The path to partnership must be achievable. Pumping out massive profits-per-partner to a handful of “chosen lawyers” thwarts this goal. Metrics for making partner should be clear and consistently applied. But it’s more than just becoming partner. Harness what young attorneys are best at: putting energy into identifying and mastering problems that no one else in the firm has yet developed skills in. Give them the chance to become a subject-matter expert on some matter of firm governance, and then give deference to the conclusions they want to run with. We all want to have an impact on the places we spend our time. We want our associates to feel at home, and nothing makes a person feel at home like letting them put new paint on the walls.

It’s Not Just In Their Heads

Lastly, the nature of this survey itself should give us some hope. Every piece of data in the survey is a self-reported feeling, not an objective reflection of a concrete fact. Temperature is an objective measurement; whether we feel hot or cold is up to us. To be clear, the problems need to be addressed either way. Young attorneys leaving, and taking their knowledge, skills, and potential with them. Firms thus need to make the structural changes to address the problems and then work on ensuring that young attorneys understand how the firm is evolving to address those needs — and how the firms will back it up with actions.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

The current market conditions, unfortunately, don’t give them many choices.

This hiccup so early on in their careers will pass. In the long tenure of their legal careers, this will be a blip in their story.

— [Katherine Loanzon](https://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/recruiters/katherine-loanzon/), managing director of Kinney Recruiting, in comments given to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/work-or-take-100k-to-wait-cooley-associates-face-tough-choice) on Cooley’s incoming corporate associates who recently received [year-long deferral offers](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/cooley-deferral-corporate-associates/), complete with a $100,000 stipend. Loanzon told [Bloomberg](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/work-or-take-100k-to-wait-cooley-associates-face-tough-choice) that she thinks affected associates should accept the deferral offers.

# Paul Weiss Taking Leadership Role In The Wake Of Dobbs
## Oh look, a Biglaw firm that's been planning ever since the draft opinion leak.

Honestly, the way some firms reacted to the Dobbs opinion, you’d think they didn’t have a month to prepare. And maybe that’s a meta move — you see, making momentous decisions in the span of a couple weeks is difficult! — but if that was the intent, it’s [falling flat](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/abortion-rights-are-about-to-be-destroyed-so-biglaw-firm-piles-on-the-bullsht/).

Thankfully, since it’s easier for multimillion-dollar professional organizations to respond to the [failed 1L writing assignment made flesh](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/06/roe-overturned-supreme-court-samuel-alito-opinion/661386/) that is Justice Alito than regular folks figuring out 10 days late that they have to navigate — in the best of states — a veritable obstacle course of trauma, some law firms were able to use this time to get ahead of our new dystopia.

Paul Weiss doesn’t have any offices in states with new abortion rules, but that doesn’t mean the firm isn’t committed to lending its [talents to important causes](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/more-law-firms-step-up-to-match-donations-for-ukraine/):

Although our offices are located in states where abortion is likely to remain available, we are recommitting to protect reproductive choice for all. In the coming days, we will be taking action on multiple fronts, in New York and nationally. To that end, as I reported last week, we are spearheading the coalition of law firms and reproductive rights organizations, pursuant to the initiative led by New York Attorney General Letitia James to ensure that access to abortion remains available in New York to all who desire such access, including residents of other states. Our San Francisco office is working with the San Francisco Bar Association and the City Attorney to ensure access to legal abortions in California.

The work with the NY AG’s office includes leading an effort to get a reproductive rights hotline to respond to inquiries about access to safe and legal abortions in New York. The firm also informed its community about nonprofit organizations providing grants to those seeking abortion for travel and childcare expenses that the firm will match “up to $1,500 annually via our giving platform, Benevity.”

In a world where so many are failing, Paul Weiss was planning. That’s… actually a good lesson for how to lawyer.

Christopher Wray, at his Senate confirmation hearing (via YouTube).

Here at Above the Law, we love a good [departure memo](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/departure-memos/) (almost as much as we love a good bonus memo). We especially enjoy the [bridge-burning ones](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/does-this-memo-a-burn-every-bridge-or-b-burn-most-of-the-bridges/) (especially when they [come from partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/05/a-partners-bizarre-departure-memo/)).

But we appreciate classy goodbyes as well. For example, in 2014 we wrote about Jeh Johnson’s [eloquent farewell to Paul, Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/01/departure-memo-of-the-day-jeh-johnson-parting-with-paul-weiss/), when he left the firm to become Secretary of Homeland Security.

Today’s classy missive comes from Christopher Wray, who was [nominated to serve as director of the FBI](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/president-trump-selects-doj-veteran-christopher-wray-as-f-b-i-director/) by President Donald Trump in June. Last night, after the Senate voted to confirm him as FBI director — by an overwhelming vote of [92-5](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/us/politics/chris-wray-fbi-director-confirmed.html?_r=0) — Chris Wray sent the following email to his colleagues at King & Spalding, where he has been a partner since 2005:



Short, sweet, and heartfelt. Here’s what one K&S source had to say Chris Wray and his goodbye message:

[He] was generally well regarded and respected at the firm — and I think the sentiments he shared in his farewell email are indicative of how he was viewed at the firm. When was the last time you heard a Biglaw partner emphasize the fact that they were proud of the fact that they’d achieved success without “compromising our commitment to kindness”?

Congratulations to Chris Wray on his confirmation, and good luck to him as FBI director. The [pay in his new post](http://www.newsweek.com/james-comey-net-worth-salary-fbi-director-trump-fired-pay-606406) is a fraction of what he was [earning at King & Spalding](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/king-spalding-pays-christopher-wray-9-2-million-a-year/), but public service has its own rewards.

# Biglaw Firm Boosts Salaries, And New York Money Will Play Second Fiddle To Philadelphia
## NYC isn't the Big Apple of this firm's eye in terms of cash compensation.

It’s October and that means it’s officially spooky season, and we know of at least one Biglaw firm that’s handing out treats, not tricks, to its associates. Bonus season is nearly upon us, but law firms are still making money moves in terms of salary raises. Which firm is the latest to make to scare up an increase in associate compensation?

That would be Armstrong Teasdale, a Missouri-based firm that came in at No. 174 in the latest Am Law 200 ranking after bringing in $149,239,000 gross revenue in 2020. Last week during an associate town hall presentation, the firm informed associates that salaries would be going up come January 1, 2022.

Only first-year salary increases have been announced thus far, and yes, you’re reading that correctly: First-years in the firm’s Philadelphia office will be making more than first-years in the firm’s New York office. Opened in 2018, Philadelphia is the site of Armstrong Teasdale’s first East Coast office, and the firm will [continue its intense focus there](https://www.armstrongteasdale.com/news/coming-home-armstrong-teasdales-focus-on-philadelphia/) to compete in the hot lateral market.

Insiders at the firm believe that salaries for all other class years will be pushed north for associates in good standing. Armstrong Teasdales’s 1900 billable hours target will remain in place, as will the firm’s current bonus structure.

This salary bump may not match the Davis Polk money that’s become the prevailing rate in most major markets ($202.5K for the Class of 2021 and $205K for the Class of 2020, to be specific), but more money is more money, so congratulations to everyone at Armstrong Teasdale!

We depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

What she means:

“I see you’re running for the bus. Don’t stay late to do this. If you get it done first thing tomorrow morning, that will be fine.”

What he hears:

“I have authority for $75,000.”

What he hears:

“She just offered $100,000. I bet I can squeeze $150,000 out of her.”

Third, the partner talking to the associate.

What she says:

“I need it by Tuesday.”

What she means:

“Monday would be nice.”

What he hears:

“It can probably wait until Thursday.”

Finally, talking to the client about the cost of preparing for trial.

What she says:

“The case should probably cost $500,000 to the morning of trial.”

What she means:

“But nothing is predictable. And the Lord works in mysterious ways. And if it goes to a million, I wouldn’t be surprised.”

What he hears:

“I’ll budget $500,000, and I might beat that by a few bucks.”

Say what you mean. Maybe it would help.

# Morning Docket: 05.01.17
## * Checks and balances, how do they work? President Donald Trump seems to be looking for anyone and anything to blame for his first 100 days in office being bungled, and he's finally settled on the rule system that controls the Senate, calling it a ""very rough system,"" an ""archaic system"" that's ""really a bad thing for the country."" [[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/29/trump-blames-constitution-for-first-100-days-chaos-presidency)] * In other news, according to Reince Priebus, President Trump's chief of staff, something that the White House has looked into is changing libel laws to make it easier to sue news organizations, but ""[h]ow it gets executed or whether that goes anywhere is a different story."" Wow. [[CNN](http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/30/media/reince-priebus-libel-laws/)] * One things for sure -- there's no Supreme Court retirement watch here: Described as ""exuberant,"" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg recently exclaimed that she ""love[s] her job,"" and that Justice Elena Kagan must be absolutely thrilled about Neil Gorsuch's confirmation, since that means she'll no longer have to suffer through the incredibly boring tasks typically given to the high court's junior justice. [[National Law Journal](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/04/28/invigorated-justice-ginsburg-says-i-love-my-job/)] * ""The logic of the decision is hard to accept. You're OK'ing a system that perpetuates the inequity in compensation for women."" In a disheartening opinion, the Ninth Circuit said employers may legally pay women less than their male counterparts for the same work based exclusively on differences in their prior salaries, even though those differences were recently ruled discriminatory under the Equal Pay Act by a lower court. [[CBS News](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/employers-can-pay-women-less-then-men-past-salaries/)] * A second suspect has been arrested in the fatal April 10 shooting of Cook County Associate Judge Raymond Myles. Earl Wilson, 45, a man who is ""no stranger to the criminal justice system,"" was charged with first-degree murder. Per prosecutors, this was a robbery gone wrong, and Myles was not supposed to be killed. Myles is the first Chicago-area judge to be fatally shot in more than three decades. [[Chicago Tribune](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-judge-slaying-person-of-interest-held-met-20170427-story.html)] * Late last week, the Hollywood Reporter released its annual ranking of the best attorneys who serve the nation's most glamorous celebrities -- the Hollywood 100 -- which is always celebrated like ""lawyer Christmas in Hollywood for a day."" How many Biglaw attorneys made the list in the tenth edition of the rankings, and how well represented are each of their firms? We'll have more on this later.

# Am Law 100 Firm Goes With Good News / Bad News Approach To COVID-19 Austerity Measures
## The Biglaw firm leads with the good news, natch.

It’s an anxious time to work at a Biglaw firm. Scratch that, it’s an anxious time to be alive, period. But with all of the [layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-announces-associate-layoffs-and-other-cost-cutting-measures/), [furloughs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firm-furloughs-associates-firm-hopeful-they-can-return-to-work-soon/), and [salary cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/another-am-law-100-firm-turns-to-furloughs-and-salary-cuts-amid-covid-19-crisis/) making their way through the industry, Biglaw is feeling the strain.

In a move that’s an example of transparency, Fox Rothschild, a firm with 2018 gross revenue of $498,000,000 making it 74th on the Am Law 100, laid all the cards on the table with employees. As part of the firmwide announcement of COVID-19 austerity measures, the firm went with a good news/bad news approach that foregrounded that they are not considering layoffs, at least not now:

The Firm has determined that it will not currently engage in a program of layoffs or furloughs for its staff or attorneys. The steps we are taking as described further below are designed to maintain the employment of our existing compliment of attorneys and staff. This decision will also be subject to review depending on the length of the current crisis and our financial performance.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And the firm was clear that they intend to go forward with promotions as planned:

In the meantime, the Firm intends to continue with its annual processes for elevating associates to partner and elevating income partners to equity partner, and intends to make the compensation decisions that evolve from attorneys being promoted in each of those cases, in the normal course of business.

Then came the tougher news. The firm is also planning salary cuts for all employees making over $100,000. The methodology is detailed, but boils down to cuts between 10 and 15 percent:

Those who have salaries in excess of $100,000 will have their bi-weekly pay reduced by 10% of their first $200,000 in annual compensation and 20% of their compensation in excess of $200,000, subject to the following two conditions. First, reductions in salary for those earning between $100,000 and $110,000 will be limited to the amount required to reduce the salary to $100,000. Second, the total reduction in salary for those earning in excess of $200,000 will be limited to 15% of that person’s salary.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Mark L. Morris, Firmwide Managing Partner of Fox Rothschild, provided Above the Law with the below statement which also details the firm’s cost-cutting measures:

Like many other law firms throughout the country, Fox Rothschild faces a future that will be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The firm has adopted a series of measures to ensure financial flexibility. Fox Rothschild recently completed a successful fiscal year, and these steps are designed to mitigate the potential economic effects of the uncertain times ahead.

· Fox Rothschild is not presently planning or undertaking any layoffs or furloughs of staff or attorneys.

· A tiered salary reduction of between 10% and 15% for all attorneys and staff earning above $100,000 takes effect in May. The firm plans to revisit this salary reduction periodically to determine if it remains necessary as economic conditions improve.

· No reductions will occur for anyone at the firm with a salary of $100,000 or less.

· A special capital contribution has been made by equity partners, who are also reducing their monthly draws in tiers, between 10% and 20%, beginning in May.

· The summer associate program will have a reduced term.

· First-year associates will begin their employment in January 2021.

We recognize that throughout the country, in every industry, companies both large and small are facing an unprecedented set of challenges, circumstances and choices. We have taken these measures in the spirit of retaining our attorneys and staff and remaining nimble as the impact of the pandemic unfolds, while at the same time sharing the potential burdens of the crisis across all constituencies of the firm. We are confident these measures will enable Fox Rothschild to emerge from the pandemic stronger than ever while continuing to provide our clients with the services and support they need throughout these trying times.

Good luck to the firm as they navigate these difficult times.

# Biglaw Firm’s Managing Partner Unexpectedly Gives Up Leadership Role
## His resignation from the leadership role was quite abrupt.

And just like that… Davis Wright Tremaine lost its leader. After serving as the firm’s managing partner for just under three years [Scott MacCormack](https://www.dwt.com/people/m/maccormack-scott-w) has decided to step down from his role immediately. His predecessor, Jeff Gray, served as the firm’s managing partner for six years. The firm has already appointed an interim MP to replace MacCormack.

As first reported by the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/therecorder/2024/03/13/davis-wright-tremaines-managing-partner-suddenly-steps-down/), Seattle partner-in-charge [Pete Johnson](https://www.dwt.com/people/j/johnson-peter-s) will serve as the firm’s interim managing partner and will continue his practice. Here are some of the details on the curious timing of MacCormack’s move, courtesy of Am Law:

MacCormack’s resignation comes as the firm is handling end-of-year meetings focused on strategy and financials and in advance of an executive committee election scheduled in the coming weeks, according to the spokesperson, who declined to comment on the timing of the resignation.

The firm is now launching a search to find its next managing partner.

During his time as Davis Wright Tremaine’s managing partner, MacCormack not only successfully guided the firm through the pandemic but also through its robust financial expansion as well as a merger. The firm’s executive committee offered this statement on his departure:

“We are thankful to Scott for his service to the firm—guiding us through several years of the pandemic, helping oversee the launch of our new firm-wide strategic plan, leading us through the successful combination with McGonigle, and helping us finish 2023 in a very strong economic position.”

MacCormack will remain a partner at the firm.

# Top 25 Biglaw Firm Will Roll Out 3-Day, In-Office Workweek Plan In September

Is the three-day, in-office workweek the new status quo for Biglaw firms? Based on the return-to-office plans we’ve seen thus far, this certainly seems to be the case.

We recently received word that Covington & Burling — a firm that brought in $1,321,296,000 gross revenue in 2020, placing it at No. 25 on the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — will expect employees to return to the firm on September 7, and will be using a hybrid work model for attorneys and staff. Here’s a relevant excerpt from a memo that was sent out by the firm last month:

[T]he Management Committee has determined that, once our offices are fully open, our lawyers, advisors and staff (whether full-time or part-time) should plan to spend at least three days per week in the office. We believe this will provide flexibility and the benefits of working remotely, while at the same time preserving the benefits of people collaborating in person.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Lawyers will be able to choose whether they want to work remotely, and the three days they’d prefer to work in the office. At present, Covington doesn’t plan to require all lawyers to be in the office on any specific days of the week. But things are a little different for newcomers and summers:

Associates (and trainees in London) who are new to the firm will be encouraged – although not required – to work in the office more than three days per week during their first year at the firm, to facilitate the establishment of relationships and work habits and familiarize themselves with the firm’s culture and processes. Our summer associates will be expected to work in the office five days a week.

Flexibility continues to be the way of the future when it comes to the post-pandemic law firm way of life. Hopefully your firm will implement a reliable remote policy.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to the office.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Announces Latest Return-To-Office Date Yet, With Masks Required -- For Now

Flexibility is the name of the game at Perkins Coie, where attorneys and staffers won’t be expected to return to the firm until October 1. To our knowledge, of firms that will be requiring personnel to return to the office in 2021, this is the latest reopening date that’s been announced yet.

The firm’s decisions on hybrid schedules have yet to be announced, but earlier this week, managing partner Bill Malley said, “We’re considering that whole range of issues. We know that firms are landing all over the map. A reason we’re taking our time here is that we want to get it right.” For the time being, it looks like lawyers will be coming into the office a set number of days (days they’ll able to choose themselves), while staff remote options will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. “For staff that have fixed work schedules [that will dictate their in-office requirements]. For lawyers there’s much more autonomy,” Malley said. “Expect broader guidance and recommendations.”

What the firm has done so far is commendable. From the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/05/25/perkins-coie-plans-october-return-with-vaccines-masks-and-hybrid-work-in-mind/):

Malley said Perkins Coie held a firmwide webinar with doctors and vaccine experts to educate employees about the COVID-19 vaccines and answer questions. Late last month, the firm sent also out a survey to all employees and staff to gauge how many have been vaccinated. He says that 90% of the firm filled out the survey, and 75% of those who did said they were vaccinated.

But, as Malley noted, there are still some things to work out. For now, the firm is not hewing to Centers for Disease Control guidelines and is still requiring employees in the office to wear face masks and social distance—although Malley said firm leadership is reviewing this policy.

The firm hasn’t even mandated employee vaccination, and the majority have already received their shots. Not too shabby, Perkins Coie!

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# Marc Kasowitz Might Be Responsible For Trump's First Diplomatic Blunder
## Who needs the State Department when you have Marc Kasowitz?

Technically we’re still waiting on Robert Mueller to confirm that Trump’s first diplomatic blunder was giving urine-stained kompromat to Vladimir Putin, so until then, we’ll pin his first major screw up on a phone call to the Prime Minister of Vietnam. In the immediate aftermath of the election, Trump called Vietnam’s leader without any coordination from the State Department — the professionals who choreograph these calls to make sure no one accidentally starts a war or greenlights a genocide.

Why would Trump randomly call the Vietnamese in contravention of all these conventions? That’s when it all comes back to Marc Kasowitz.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
ProPublica has a new in-depth look at [Trump’s Vietnam call and Kasowitz’s role](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-vietnam-casino):

The contact with Vietnam was not set up by the State Department. Instead, Trump’s personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, helped arrange the call.

Kasowitz had another client with a keen interest in Vietnam: Philip Falcone, an American investor with a major casino outside Ho Chi Minh City. After the Trump call, Kasowitz traveled to Vietnam with Falcone. They met with government officials as part of an effort to persuade Vietnam to lift a ban on gambling for its citizens. Such a shift would deliver vastly more gamblers to Falcone’s casino.

“Phil asked if Marc could arrange a phone call between the president and prime minister of Vietnam,” said a person familiar with the call. “Marc did that.”

What kind of business genius builds a casino in a country full of people who can’t gamble? That’s almost as dumb as building multiple casinos to suck business away from each other in a crumbling relic like Atlantic City.

It’s not clear whether Trump mentioned the casino on his December 2016 call with the prime minister or in any other communications with the Vietnamese. A White House spokeswoman referred all questions to Kasowitz. The Vietnamese embassy in the U.S. didn’t respond to requests for comment.

U.S. embassy officials in Vietnam heard about the call in advance from Falcone’s casino company, not the Trump transition.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
There’s so much going on in this passage. Note that the White House, when confronted with the accusation that they have abdicated their ultimate responsibility for America’s foreign policy, opted to refer the inquiry to an outsider. It’s like they don’t get what’s even at stake here. When the problem is “we think this might have been a favor to Kasowitz rather than a key component of foreign policy” the answer isn’t, “gosh, you’ll have to ask Marc about that one!”

And the embassy finding out about it from a casino company? Priceless.

Falcone says he never asked for the call and has gotten nothing out of the president’s outreach to the Vietnamese government. Kasowitz’s people also say he never “used any access [to Trump] to help a client of the firm.” But even if the call didn’t delve into murky ethical waters, the mere fact that Marc Kasowitz “provided a ‘telephone contact’ to the Vietnamese government to call Trump” is already a black eye for the administration.

But no one involved seems to realize that.

# Is This The Beginning Of The End For This Biglaw Firm?
## The firm provided notice of mass layoffs.

Here’s what we already knew about the state of affairs at the Biglaw firm of LeClairRyan — partners are leaving in droves. We’ve reported on this extensively in the past, what with the firm losing almost 10 percent of its headcount in 2018 due to lateral moves, and [partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/biglaw-firm-loses-over-a-dozen-partners-as-more-firms-spread-to-boston/) are continuing to[ depart](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/biglaw-firm-that-just-lost-over-a-dozen-partner-loses-even-more/) for [greener pastures](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/the-partner-departures-at-this-biglaw-firm-are-really-piling-up/) in 2019. Indeed, its been [reported](https://www.law360.com/articles/1171316/leclairryan-blocked-from-paying-ex-members-letters-show) that at the end of 2015 the firm had 156 equity partners, but by June of 2019, that number was down to 45.

The firm responded to these departures by [reorganizing](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/the-biglaw-firm-that-keep-losing-partners-is-revamping-their-leadership-structure/) around “law firm 2.0” and embarked on a partnership with alternative legal service provider, UnitedLex. But there’s been some indictions that law firm 2.0 wasn’t an immediate cure for what ailed the firm — [last month we reported](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/biglaw-firm-prohibited-by-lender-from-returning-former-partners-capital-contributions/) that the firm was barred by its lender from returning the capital contributions of former partners. And the rumors about the future of the firm have continued to swirl.

Now Above the Law is hearing from multiple sources that the firm issued Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act mass layoff notices earlier this week to staff. That federal law requires employers with 100+ to provide a 60 calendar-day notification of mass layoffs of employees. So, yikes.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
What happens next is still speculation. Will the firm formally dissolve? Attempt to spin of into a new entity? What we have heard from folks on the ground is that LeClairRyan attorneys and other professionals are eager for a way out. Just today, [Fox Rothschild confirmed](https://richmondbizsense.com/2019/07/24/leclairryan-defections-continue-15-jumping-fox-rothschild/) they were taking on a 15-attorney group from LeClairRyan — the aviation group led by Mark Dombroff. With the writing seemingly on the wall, you have to imagine more departures are imminent.

Above the Law reached out to LeClairRyan for comment but have received no response. We will update the story should they provide a comment.

Pop quiz, hot shot: When is a Cravath match not really a match?

One acceptable answer: When the bonus isn’t paid until the next calendar year, and the 2018 tax code is very much in flux.

Today, Weil, Gotshal & Manges announced they are going to pay their associates top-of-the-market compensation, and you’d think that good news would be the end of the story, wouldn’t you? But here’s the thing — Weil [traditionally pays ](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/weil-matches-market-bonuses-but-when-will-they-get-paid/)bonuses on January 31… of the following year.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Weil (see what I did there?) that is usually crapy for holiday gift-giving purposes, this year, it could be even worse. With the radical changes to the tax code [currently being considered ](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/we-read-the-429-page-tax-bill-so-you-dont-have-to/)by Congress, Weil associates could wind up paying more taxes on their 2017 bonuses than associates at peer firms. That’s got to sting.

That’s the bad news (potentially, the Senate may still save the day), but the good news is that their (January) payday will be a nice one:

Class of 2017 — $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2016 — $15,000
Class of 2015 — $25,000
Class of 2014 — $50,000
Class of 2013 — $65,000
Class of 2012 — $80,000
Class of 2011 — $90,000
Class of 2010 — $100,000
Class of 2009 — $100,000

So, Weil attorneys, how do you feel about the bonuses (or when you’ll actually see the money)? Feel free to sound off [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

What about the bonuses everywhere else? Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text (646-820-8477), or tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). We always keep our sources anonymous — and that includes our sources for bonus stories. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine.

# Dear Bar Examiners: We Still Need Breast-Pumping Accommodations
## Unfortunately, bar examination policies are still not sufficient.

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts on motherhood in the legal profession, in partnership with our friends at [MothersEsquire](https://www.mothersesquire.com/).

I did not enjoy the bar exam. Like many others, I was saddled with $250,000-plus in student loans and worried about what would happen if I failed. I worked part-time to support myself and spent the rest of the summer buried in bar prep books and feeling perpetually behind. And then my computer malfunctioned on the day of the test, causing me to lose half of my essays and finish out the test with paper and pen. Needless to say, it was stressful!

But, it could’ve been a lot worse. I wasn’t up all night nursing a newborn while I was studying. And I didn’t have to worry about pumping breast milk during the exam. I also didn’t have to fill out any forms to request accommodations, play phone tag with the bar examiners’ office, or wait months for a decision about whether my request would be granted.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Yet, this is the reality that many women face every year. In 2015, the ACLU and the Law Students for Reproductive Justice did a [50-state survey](https://www.aclu.org/issues/womens-rights/pregnancy-and-parenting-discrimination/breastfeeding-policies-during-bar-exam#:~:text=Illinois&text=A-,Examinees%20who%20are%20breastfeeding%20are%20eligible%20to%20seek%20accommodations.,additional%20break%20time%20as%20needed.) of bar examination procedures for breastfeeding examinees. The [results](https://www.aclu.org/news/womens-rights/nationwide-bar-exam-policies-force) were eye-opening:

- 45 state bar examiner websites suggested that only individuals with documented “disabilities” were eligible for accommodations. (“Since breastfeeding is not a disability,” the ACLU explained, “many candidates may not even bother seeking accommodations.”)
- Two states — Alabama and Louisiana — had explicit policies making breastfeeding examinees ineligible for accommodations.
- Several states ostensibly reviewed applications for breastfeeding accommodations on a case-by-case basis, but experience suggested that those accommodations were “only available in theory” in some states.
- Only 12 states confirmed that breastfeeding examinees were eligible to receive additional time.
This survey prompted some progress. Ten states have since revised their policies for lactation accommodations, and another six states have committed to conducting a review of their current policies and procedures.

But work still needs to be done. In May 2021, MothersEsquire conducted a follow-up survey as part of its [PumpUpTheBar](https://mothersesquire.org/pump-up-the-bar) project. Whereas the ACLU-LSRJ survey relied on written responses from each state, MothersEsquire focused on the information published on each jurisdiction’s website. This was strategic because, in order to be helpful to examinees, lactation policies must be both clearly explained and publicly available. MothersEsquire determined:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
- 19 states still only published accommodations for ADA disabilities, of which lactation does not qualify, or simply no accommodation information at all.
- Six states provided lactation accommodations, but did not include adequate details regarding what accommodations may be available or how to request those accommodations.
- 16 states had an administrative or courtesy accommodation policy published, but not including any additional break time for breastfeeding or pumping.
- Nine states had published comprehensive breastfeeding accommodation policies which included extra “stop-the-clock” break time to pump or breastfeed.
- Of the states that did offer lactation accommodations, those accommodations were most often granted on a case-by-case basis, meaning that some mothers could end up being denied accommodations and that accommodations were potentially subject to unconscious bias and/or inequitable administration.
While these results show that some progress has been made, it is still far too difficult for breastfeeding applicants to obtain basic accommodations in many states.

The ABA has recently recognized these significant gaps in accommodations for breastfeeding examinees. In February 2022, the ABA adopted [Resolution 501](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/directories/policy/midyear-2022/501-midyear-2022.pdf), after a presentation that included the MothersEsquire 2021 survey results. This resolution “urges” all bar admissions authorities to “provide reasonable and accessible accommodations to lactating individuals,” such as designated spaces for pumping, written policies that are publicly available online, and “off-the-clock break time” so that examinees are provided the same amount of time to take the exam.

The regulatory climate has also become increasingly supportive of breastfeeding accommodations. In December 2022, two laws were enacted: the PUMP Act and the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA). The Pump Act expands the right to receive pumping breaks and a private space to nearly 9 million more workers. Likewise, the PWFA requires covered employers to provide “reasonable accommodations” for conditions related to pregnancy, even if they do not rise to the level of a “disability” under the ADA.

Unfortunately, bar examination policies are still lagging behind. Many states still only have vague policies available online or policies that only discuss accommodations for “disabilities.” Now, more than ever, these bar examination policies need to be updated.

# The Best Way To Improve Mental Health For Lawyers? Kill The Billable Hour!

To an extent there are many things we can do as individuals to promote healthy mental well-being, but this ignores the bigger challenge in the practice of law: the business model. The billable hour system often sets an impossible standard for attorneys, who in order to hit firm minimums, need to work at least 60 hours a week.

On top of this, according to ABA surveys, young attorneys’ greatest dissatisfaction with their legal careers is a lack of connection to the social good. The billable hour system prevents many attorneys from making the pro bono contributions that would have otherwise given them more purpose in their careers.

— Jennie Fagen Malloy, president and founder of wellness consulting firm [Lights Camera Kale](http://jenniefagen.com/), commenting on ways the billable hour not only [contributes to attorneys’ sometimes poor mental health](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/05/07/as-law-firms-look-to-ease-strain-some-hope-wellness-dollars-can-help/), but also how the hourly system can prevent them from finding true meaning and purpose in their careers.

# Cahill Beats The Market On Special Bonuses For All Associates -- Even The Class Of 2021
## This firm has beaten Davis Polk at its own game. Will the market respond?

Associates want more money. They’ve been working their asses off all year, and while they seem to be happy with their year-end and special bonuses, they wouldn’t mind more. Well, what if there were a firm that was willing to buck the market and offer associates a premium on their special bonuses? As luck would have it, one firm is doing that.

Cahill Gordon & Reindel just unleashed its annual bonus memo, and while it’s following market for its year-end bonuses, its special bonuses are above market. The firm even includes the Class of 2021 in its special bonuses — and this is something that no other firm has done thus far. Now this is what we like to see. Take a look at Cahill’s bonus matrix, below:

Cahill is a firm that’s known to routinely give its associates a little extra on top, and the market generally doesn’t move. But in a year like this, where the lateral market is red hot, these money moves could actually matter. Cahill’s most junior associates are getting $6,000 more in special bonuses while the firm’s most senior associates are getting $37,000 more in special bonuses. Cahill is even offering its stub-years special bonuses, which no other firm has done.

Will this be enough to reset the market for special bonuses? Let’s wait and see.

Congratulations to Cahill and its associates on a great year!

Don’t tell Cravath that mergers and acquisitions has been[ slow in 2019](https://files.pitchbook.com/website/files/pdf/PitchBook_1Q_2019_MA_Report.pdf)!

For the relatively short timeframe — the two weeks between April 29th and May 10th — the Biglaw giant advised on eight deals with a total value of more than $100 billion. The biggest deal of the bunch is Occidental Petroleum Corp.’s acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum Corp., valued at a whopping $57 billion. As [reported by](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2019/05/14/ma-slowdown-tell-that-to-cravath-389-68659/) New York Law Journal, the other deals in this recent run of M&A work included quite a few noteworthy players:

In addition to its work on multiple aspects of the Anadarko deal, in which Occidental won out over a competing bid by Chevron Corp., Cravath advised Parker Hannifin Corp. in its $3.67 billion acquisition of LORD Corp., Disney in its $10.6 billion sale of 21 regional sports networks to Sinclair Broadcast Group, Brunswick Corp. in the sale of its fitness business to KPS Capital Partners, RELX Group in LexisNexis’s joint venture with LEAP Legal Software and Buckeye Partners L.P. in its $10.3 billion acquisition by IFM Investors.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The impressive recent M&A performance comes on the heels of a successful 2018. Last year, the firm’s profits per partner rose a healthy 15 percent, now at $4.62 million. Given this strong financial performance, you can’t blame associates for hoping for an even more generous bonus (or perhaps a summer bonus) for all their hard work.

# Why Are British Partners Fleeing The Magic Circle To Join U.S. Firms?

For some partners, doubling or even trebling their compensation can be attractive because it means they can accelerate their retirement. A young partner can think: either I can be on OK pay for the next 15 years, or I can spend the next 10 or five years on spectacular pay, and then retire.

— [Tom Wilkinson](http://www.wilkinsonpartners.com/tom-wilkinson), managing partner of legal recruitment firm [Wilkinson Partners](http://www.wilkinsonpartners.com/), commenting on the [“increased trickle of talent from English firms to U.S. firms”](https://www.ft.com/content/0532a6ae-25f0-11e8-b27e-cc62a39d57a0) that’s been occurring in recent years as British lawyers gain a better understanding of U.S. firms, the way they operate, and how much money partners leave on the table by remaining within the Magic Circle.

# Cheapskates At Jones Day Bill Former Associate For Bar Prep
## Just because you CAN bill someone doesn't mean you SHOULD.

Last week, we heard about a law firm [suing its former associates for not billing enough hours](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/law-firm-sues-associates-for-not-billing-enough/). Asking associates to pay for your own book of business failings marks a new low in an industry fraught with lows. The firm’s employment agreement explicitly laid this out, but putting aside the factual and legal arguments about unconscionable contracts and rewriting employment conditions mid-lockdown, the real issue was, “Why does a firm think this is an acceptable business model even if it’s legal?”

Speaking of employment agreements, Jones Day isn’t billing associates for missing on hours, but it does include in its offer letter a provision requiring associates to provide Jones Day with two years of service to cover bar study costs covered by the firm. And it’s seeking to collect from former associates. Forcing us to ask again, “Why does a firm think this is an acceptable business model even if it’s legal?”

I guess times are tough over at Jones Day.

On the one hand, the firm laid out money for the associate expecting to get at least a couple years worth of work in return. Bar prep is costly, and the firm has made the arbitrary decision that the expense is worth about two years of associate work.

On the other, more important hand, this is stupid.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Most law firms see their network of former associates as an asset. Others… do this. Former associates are future referrals or even clients. Most attorneys lateral out because they see a better opportunity, not because they have deep hatred for their firm. Why sour that relationship? Even the disgruntled attorneys out there find their hard feelings softening with time as they focus more on positive connections with mentors and officemates who end up as partners down the road. It’s why firms spring for fancy departure dinners that end up costing… well, almost as much as the firm is asking the associate to pay them back.

Second, the fact that this is an entirely arbitrary deadline can’t be stressed enough. When does an associate “earn back” $5000 worth of bar prep? Even throwing the summer stipend in there, we’re talking about, what, $50K or so total? Average associate billing rates were [$546/hour](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221013005141/en/Wolters-Kluwer-ELM-Solutions%E2%80%99-2022-Real-Rate-Report-indicates-that-timekeeper-rates-continue-to-rise) last year and Jones Day was almost certainly higher. Assume it was $600/hour (and I’m fairly sure it’s even more) and the firm collected 85 percent of 2000 hours billed… that’s over a million dollars. Subtract salary and bonus and the firm is still up around $800,000 a year. [UPDATE: I’ve been reminded that Jones Day’s black box compensation model doesn’t pay “bonuses” as opposed to pumping up the next year’s total comp by the amount of the “bonus.” Which voids this argument for Jones Day since it would only relate to a lump sum payment.]

AND IT’S QUIBBLING OVER $3400?!?

The firm might be thinking that letting one associate leave early without consequences could spiral into associates en masse taking bar prep funds and bolting. This is an absurd spillover fear. There’s just not a market for hundreds of class of 2021 associates out there.

It’s also a standard doomed to be selectively applied. My guess is the firm didn’t demand its money back when it shelled out clerkship bonuses to [an associate who left after 10 months to be an ABA non-qualified federal judge](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/shocking-no-one-aba-thinks-biglaw-associate-not-ready-for-federal-bench/). And, yeah, those bonuses probably aren’t contractually tied to an explicit work expectation like the bar prep advance is, but that misses the point. The firm treats up front payments in expectation of future work as a write-off in one case and a billable debt in another. But at the end of the day, both expenses are about the firm investing in an associate with the expectation that it will exact some amount of future billables out of them.

And it’s terrible publicity, though at this point [Jones Day may have just given up on building a favorable public profile](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/jones-day-is-divided-between-maga-jones-day-and-lawyers-who-enable-maga-jones-day/) in favor of [whining about it on the back end](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/jones-day-whines-about-law-review-article-so-now-were-all-going-to-go-read-that-law-review-article/).

I completely understand Jones Day’s position in wanting to maximize on its investment. They thought they could squeeze another four or five hundred thousand dollars out of this $3400 expense. But discretion is the better part of valor. Cherish the hundreds of thousands you already made and just let it go. Better yet, don’t even put this provision in the offer letter.

It reads as cheap.

And for all the slings and arrows hurled Jones Day’s direction, “cheap” usually isn’t one of them.

# Why The Federal Circuit's PACER Ruling Is A Mixed Bag
## If PACER is ever to be fully free, it will happen only through an act of Congress. God help every single one of us.

Headlines last week were touting the opinion Thursday on PACER fees by the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. The judiciary “[can’t use PACER as IT slush fund](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/agency-oversight/2020/08/federal-judiciary-cant-use-pacer-as-it-slush-fund-appeals-court-rules/),” one said. “[PACER Fees Are Too High, Federal Circuit Says](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/federal-circuit-affirms-limits-on-how-government-uses-pacer-fees),” another reported. “[Federal judiciary is overcharging for access to public records online](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/federal-judiciary-is-overcharging-for-access-to-public-records-online-court-says/2020/08/06/3a8d7930-d7ed-11ea-aff6-220dd3a14741_story.html),” still another said.

While none of these headlines are wrong, they could lead a reader to conclude that the judiciary’s loss in the case is a clear victory for public access and will significantly reduce PACER fees. Unfortunately, neither is true. Rather, the opinion delivers only a partial win for plaintiffs and will reduce PACER fees only a limited amount.

Nothing about [this opinion](https://lawsites.lexblogplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/509/2020/08/19-1081.OPINION.8-6-2020_1631951.pdf) will change the fact that PACER is a 32-year-old system that is, as I [once wrote](https://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/service_offers_a_better_way_to_search_federal_court_records_than_pacer), “cumbersome and crotchety to use, often cryptic in its naming and coding, and archaic in its document handling.”

Nor will anything in this ruling change the fact that PACER is not free to use. To the contrary, the ruling reaffirms the authority of the judiciary to charge Electronic Public Access (EPA) fees for its use sufficient to cover the expenses of operating both PACER and the corollary CM/ECF electronic filing system.

What the ruling does do, however, is open the door to a reduction in those fees — albeit a small one — and the repayment to users of excessive fees collected from 2010 to 2016.

Notably, the Federal Circuit affirmed in its entirety the [2018 decision in the case](https://www.lawsitesblog.com/2018/04/federal-judiciary-misused-pacer-fees-court-rules.html) by U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle, stating that she “got it just right.”

In her ruling, Huvelle had rejected the principal arguments of both the plaintiffs and the defendants. The plaintiffs had argued that the judiciary could recoup PACER fees only to the extent necessary to cover the total marginal cost of operating the PACER system. The judiciary had argued it could use PACER funds for anything related to “dissemination of information through electronic means.”

Of the $920 million that the judiciary collected in PACER fees from 2010 to 2016, Huvelle had found that the judiciary misspent some $200 million of it. That ain’t hay, for sure, but it is only 22% of the total collections.

Both the Federal Circuit and Huvelle agreed that the judiciary’s expenditures of PACER fees from 2010 to 2016 were appropriate for the following purposes:

- Public access services, which was money spent directly on the operation of PACER and totaled $129.9 million for the six-year period.
- Case Management/Electronic Case Files System (CM/ECF), which totaled $217.9 million for the period.
- Communications infrastructure, services, and security, which totaled $229.4 million for the period.
- Court allotments, which totaled $74.9 million for the period.
- Electronic Bankruptcy Noticing, the system that produces and sends bankruptcy notices to creditors, which totaled $73.3 million for the period.
The expenses that both the Federal Circuit and Huvelle deemed inappropriate were all unrelated to the direct operation of PACER and the CM/ECF system. These inappropriate expenditures were:

- State of Mississippi, a one-year electronic-access pilot in 2010 that cost $120,988.
- Victim notification, a program that electronically notifies local law enforcement agencies of changes to an offender’s case history, which cost $3.7 million for the six-year period.
- Web-based juror services, which cost $9.4 million for the period.
- Courtroom technology, which cost $185 million during the period.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Put those sets of numbers together, and we see that while the rulings invalidated expenditures of $198.2 million for the six-year period, they upheld expenditures of $725.4 million for that same period.

Now, this may be an overly simplistic analysis on my part, but if PACER currently charges 10 cents per page, and these rulings have invalidated 22% of the expenditures for which those fees were used, then it seems to follow that the judiciary can still charge nearly 8 cents per page.

All of that said, the Federal Circuit did open the door to one further possible reduction in EPA fees, and that involves the judiciary’s expenditures to operate the CM/ECF system. The circuit court said that the district court record lacked sufficient information for it to decide whether EPA fees could permissibly be used to cover all the costs of maintaining the CM/ECF system.

On remand, the Federal Circuit said, it would be up to Huvelle to decide whether to permit additional argument and discovery on this issue.

This case is far from over. On remand, Huvelle will have to decide whether to consider the CM/ECF issue and then go on to decide damages. Whatever she does, there will almost certainly be further appeals.

If PACER is ever to be fully free, it will happen only through an act of Congress. Three bills currently pending (H.R. 1164, S. 2064 and H.R. 6017) would do exactly that — make PACER free and also mandate development of a modern system.

Of course, if there is anything more dysfunctional than PACER, it is Congress. For the time being, that means this much remains true: The clunky PACER system will continue to operate as is, and we will continue to be charged fees for its use.

# Well, At Least First Year Associates Will Be Happy...

Ah, the lure of $180,000. Obviously, associates enjoy making bank, but firms love it too. They want to be able to throw around that number as if it answers every other question about their compensation structure. That’s why since the moment that Cravath announced their new compensation grid, we warned about compression of the scale, where first years make the requisite $180,000, but more senior associates are not treated as generously.

Enter [Barack Ferrazzano](http://www.bfkn.com/about.html). The Chicago-based firm is very proud that they’ve matched first year starting salaries at $180,000. But as for the rest of the associates… well, they aren’t sure what they are going to do. A firm representative told us:

Since this is a new change, we are still in the process of determining the scale for 2nd year associates and above, but wanted to make sure it was public that we are competitive with other firms and match the 1st year salary.

As data has infiltrated nearly every facet of the legal industry, legal analytics are in high demand. [Lex Machina](http://bit.ly/2xJNRF7), a recognized leader in the legal analytics field, offers practice area modules that provide valuable, strategic insights into federal district court claims for many of the most popular legal specialties in today’s market. 

The latest addition to Lex Machina’s legal analytics arsenal is its new torts module, which provides data on civil claims in federal district court for torts, including premises liability, negligence, assault and battery, defamation, invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and medical malpractice.

We recently sat down with [Carla ](https://bit.ly/2ZPfewP)[Rydholm](https://lexmachina.com/about/team/), Director of Product Management at Lex Machina, to discuss some of the features of the new torts module and how it can change the practice of law for torts practitioners.

Can you give us some background on why the torts module was created? 

[Lex Machina](http://bit.ly/2xJNRF7) wants to bring legal analytics to all areas of the law. This is the latest in a series of modules we’ve created on different topics. Torts is a big data set in terms of total cases. It’s also an everyday aspect of doing business — torts are everywhere and have a very broad social and economic impact. 

Lex Machina is an expert at legal analytics for federal district court. We’ve been offering our product since 2010, and we’re now adding a torts module because we know we have a large, high-value data set on damages and dispositive rulings, and excellent data for counsel, parties, judges, and expert witnesses. The new module is really exciting to us because we’re able to uncover a lot of meaningful trends. We’re bringing data to an area of law that’s ripe for analysis and analytics.

What does the torts module cover? Can you give some examples of how it can be used?

Torts has a large volume of available data. There are nearly 200,000 cases, covering a breadth of situations, with the common theme that a party seeks compensation for loss or harm caused by personal injury or reputational harm. With that much litigation out there, knowing what your prospective client has seen before in their prior cases, or what’s happened recently, can be helpful to informing case strategy. 


Carla Rydholm

The torts module can be used to obtain analytics in a number of ways, including running party searches, brushing up on how often elements of a given tort have been ruled on, searching for a particular court or judge,  searching for specific law firms or counsel, and analyzing the damages typically awarded in similar cases. 

For example, with damage awards, you can focus your analysis from all tort cases down to damage awards resulting in a particular court, for specific subsets of cases, including premises liability, motor vehicle, medical malpractice, Federal Tort Claims Act, and mass tort cases. Once you’ve identified the relevant awards in the district court of interest, for example “pain and suffering (torts)” in the Southern District of New York, you can narrow them down even further by judgment source, such as jury verdicts and filter by the torts premises liability case tag. So, in a matter of seconds, you can go from 200,000 tort cases to just a handful of jury verdicts in premises liability cases in the Southern District of New York with a damage award for pain and suffering.  For any results, the full underlying cases are always available.

Damage awards is just one example. Other common uses for the module include running party searches, getting information on typical case timing for budgeting purposes, and understanding both your potential clients and your competition in order to best pitch for new business. 

Can you talk about some of Lex Machina’s apps that might be useful for torts law?

Apps work very differently than the main module. The idea with apps is that they’re an easy way to get an answer to a very specific question — you would use apps when you want to answer pre-curated questions.

Right now we have nine apps that work across all our different practice areas. For example, Courts & Judges Comparator can be relevant if you’re considering transferring venues. Law Firm Comparator could either be used by one of our corporate users to assess law firms, or by a law firm that wants data to anchor real world objectives on experience and success rates. Early Case Assessor is a quick way to gain insight on a party and their attorney, while Attorney Team Analyzer has a corporate use case when in-house counsel is trying to understand the difference between different attorney teams. 

There’s also a tenth app, Expert Witness Explorer, that’s specific to product liability and torts. This is where we’re continuing to expand what we’re doing with expert witnesses, starting with these two practice areas, where experts are especially vital. Having experts is a critical part of trial strategy in torts in terms of establishing that there was an injury or what duty the defendant owed the plaintiff, whereas experts are more commonly used for determining damages in other practice areas. In product liability and torts, liability itself often hinges on that expert testimony, so we’ve developed this app specifically to address the needs of those fields. You can see if an expert witness has previously been challenged, what the outcome was, or if their testimony has been limited in any way.

How can lawyers make the best use of the new torts module?

One major use case is counseling clients — talking through what the case strategy is, budgeting, expected case outcomes, and how to make important case decisions. Having objective, real-world data definitely anchors your ability to provide sound counsel. 

We also have a customer base that’s more strongly rooted in litigation. People who are in the business of litigation, for example litigation finance, have a particular need for data analytics because they deal with cases that could result in big damage awards, and torts certainly falls in that category. 

Finally, we also have customers that use litigation data to set big picture business strategies. Analytics help them understand how they did financially in the previous year and provide a very holistic market analysis of what’s currently happening. When Lex Machina first started, even explaining what we were doing took a long time. Now there’s an expectation that databases exist and that you should be able to access every case that ever happened before and evaluate patterns for cases like yours. These clients expect to be able to easily assess everything that’s happened across a business or a firm. Lex Machina makes that possible. So that’s a big internal use case for us as well.

When will the [torts module](http://bit.ly/2xJNRF7) be available to the public?

We released it to our current customers on June 30th. Our full launch, including a [webcast](https://bit.ly/31cQZuG), will be on July 9.

# Benchslapped Biglaw Partner Says Judge In Mueller Case Is Big Meanie In New Filing

[T]he Court did not consider the fact that while the mainstream media has largely ignored Defendant’s pending motions, when the word “Judge” appears before a person’s name, this political adornment suggests to the public that there now is some higher level of wisdom than among the mere mortal lawyers in the case, and as such, every single mainstream media organization repeated the Court’s words as gospel. The direct consequence was swift and clear; that is, undersigned counsel have received overnight and continuing today a flow of hatred in the form of voicemail and electronic mail from self-proclaimed patriots containing threats, intimidation, and the desire that both undersigned counsel promptly die. One communication specified that the cause of death for Ms. [Katherine] Seikaly should be by fire. Apparently some of these brave self-proclaimed patriots were whipped into their frenzy by a cable television entertainer unknown to undersigned counsel named Rachel Maddow who devoted a significant portion of her variety program to the words spoken by the Court yesterday. So while counsel’s words used in advocacy can hurt, the words of a Judge can have devastating consequences.

— Reed Smith partner [Eric Dubelier](https://www.reedsmith.com/en/professionals/d/dubelier-eric-a), in a [filing](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5677570/Dubelier-Russia-20190108.pdf?et=editorial&bu=The%20American%20Lawyer&cn=20190109&src=EMC-Email&pt=Litigation%20Daily) submitted in the wake of [being benchslapped](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/judge-benchslaps-biglaw-partner-bagging-on-the-mueller-investigation/) by Judge Dabney Friedrich (D.D.C.) for his “unprofessional, inappropriate, and ineffective” filings made on behalf of his client, Concord Management and Consulting, in the Mueller investigation. Dubelier was summarily chastised by the likes of widely known MSNBC host [Rachel Maddow](http://www.rachelmaddow.com/) for using [profanity-laced quotes from the movie “Animal House”](https://www.law.com/2019/01/09/in-petulant-filing-reed-smiths-dubelier-blames-judge-for-being-mean/) in the motion that made Judge Friedrich call him out.

If you haven’t been hanging out in the comments section at the ABA Journal then… well, we wouldn’t blame you at all actually. The reporters over there put out consistently top-notch legal industry news and there’s not much more one can expect to learn from some JD with enough time on their hands to hang out for hours on a chat board regaling an audience of literally tens.

But if you have hopped into the ABA Journal’s comments lately, you might notice some pure unfiltered wackiness slipping into the discussion. Like the first comment on a post about [Trump’s border policy](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/trump_threatens_to_close_border_after_cbp_deploys_tear_gas_is_there_a_wait/) being “This invasion must be stopped.” Or a recent article [about Michael Cohen](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/trumps_former_lawyer_michael_cohen_pleads_guilty_to_lying_to_congress1/) where the comments started off with an interesting discussion about the procedural requirements of an impeachment trial… before a crazed rant from a Dinesh D’Souza acolyte named “Hope” trying to make the “Democrats are the real racists” trope hunt.

At least the other side is more civil:

You’re not tired of sucking Osama Bin Laden’s dead dick, Hope. You are a fuccing America-hating scumbag!

Hooboy. Seems like everything’s nice and normal down in the bowels of the comments.

Somehow, we here at Above the Law can’t help but feel somewhat responsible. After all, it was our decision to [finally pull the plug on comments](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/a-farewell-to-comments/) that likely sent some of these people ABA Journal’s way. It’s been nearly three years since we closed the comments, a forum that was once witty, subversive, and insightful before devolving into 20-40 disgruntled attorneys making the same racist jokes over and over. At the time, we discussed the possibility of stepping up comment moderation as an alternative to killing off the forum, but as the ABA Journal may be learning, moderation can never be perfect and ultimately it just steals resources from reporting and writing for the millions to cater to a paltry circle-jerk. It’s just not worth it.

And it’s sad to shut down a forum for a website’s most ardent readers, but at a certain point it’s important to realize that the readers who really want to constructively engage can do so in a million other ways. They can reach out through third-party social media or set up their own managed boards to discuss the content. In many ways, just removing the thrill that the trolls can see their name on a website with millions of clicks is all it takes to let the substantive commentary reassert itself.

And that’s the saddest part of the ABA Journal’s comments — there are the beginnings of smart, relevant discussions in there that can’t help but get sidetracked into a back and forth with conspiracy mongers about how “the left” is trying to abolish ICE so they can force everyone into a Pizzagate sex cult.

In the end, lawyers like to think better of ourselves. We like to believe that an open forum of smart people can only elevate any discussion. But we need to remember that no matter how much you admire and respect your peers in the profession, the worst person from your 1L Torts class also became a lawyer, and that’s why we just can’t have nice things.

Women continue to soar to new heights in Biglaw, and today, one of the top firms in the country welcomes a woman into its top leadership role.

Cooley recently announced that [Rachel Proffitt](https://www.cooley.com/people/rachel-proffitt/), who currently serves as head of the firm’s San Francisco corporate practice, will become its next chief executive officer. Proffitt will assume the role from firm veteran Joe Conroy, who has served as CEO for more than 15 years.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Proffitt, a graduate of UC Law SF (née UC Hastings), joined Cooley in 2017 from Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati. She currently serves as a member of the firm’s board of directors and currently co-chairs the firm’s legal education committee. In an interview with [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/cooleys-rachel-proffitt-will-become-its-first-ever-female-ceo), Conroy said, “Rachel really stood out as the clear choice. She’s the perfect steward for us, and the next generation.”

Cooley has experienced some pain points over the past year or so, with [layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/cooley-layoffs-2022/) and [deferrals](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/after-layoffs-last-year-cooley-delays-start-date-for-first-year-associates/) disrupting the firm’s trajectory, but Proffitt hopes to change things for the better. Here’s more from [Bloomberg](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/cooleys-rachel-proffitt-will-become-its-first-ever-female-ceo):

Top of mind for Proffitt as she steps into her role in a few months is to strengthen and reinforce the firm’s culture, leaning into its innovative spirit that will allow it to continue to shape its unique, strategic vision for the future ahead, she said.

“There’s no perfect roadmap,” Proffitt said. “There’s an evolving landscape ahead of us and just as our clients are dynamic, we’re going to need to be the same and continue to evolve as their needs do.”

Proffitt will officially take the reins as Cooley’s CEO on January 1, 2024. Congratulations!

# Powerhouse Compensation Leader Raises Salaries For All U.S. Associates
## The firm that started the salary raise movement is making history, again.

Back in 1999, one incredibly daring law firm laid the groundwork for associate salaries to soar. This firm made huge waves when it offered new associates a starting salary of $125,000 — significantly higher than the $100,000 that was standard at the time. The pay raise soon spread to firms across the country, and nothing has ever been the same since.

The firm we’re speaking about is Silicon Valley powerhouse Gunderson Dettmer, a gutsy institution that could very well be referred to as the O.G. of Biglaw salary raises. Today, the Silicon Valley-based firm is matching the Cravath base salary raise across all of its offices. With other offices in Ann Arbor, Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, and San Diego, Gunderson will improve associates’ wealth across the country.

Here’s an excerpt from Gunderson’s salary raise memo, sent by chairman and founding partner [Robert V. Gunderson Jr.](http://www.gunder.com/people/robert-v.-gunderson,-jr):

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
As most of you know, the firm has long been a leader in the area of Associate compensation. On behalf of the Partners, we are delighted to announce these increases and we thank you for your extraordinary efforts in providing clients with outstanding service as well as in helping us build the pre-eminent firm in the markets in which we operate.

Gunderson’s salary raise is being applied to summer associates currently working at the firm, while compensation for more senior associates will be communicated separately. As we mentioned previously, we will be discussing compensation for senior associates and counsel in a future post. (It should also be noted that the firm’s Ann Arbor office was not included in the firmwide email to associates announcing the salary raise. Perhaps this was a clerical error, or perhaps since the office was [opened in September 2015](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150924006534/en/Gunderson-Dettmer-Opens-Midwest-Office), there aren’t any associates working there yet to take advantage of these salary raises.)

Congratulations to everyone at Gunderson Dettmer! You’re joining three large firms and three boutiques who’ve already made history. It’s time to celebrate!

Remember, we are covering this trend extensively, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

# With Historic Offer And Acceptance Rates, COVID Was No Match For Biglaw Summer Associate Programs
## Some exciting news for would-be Biglaw associates during the pandemic!

This is how we celebrate offers in 2020…

For the past few years, law student recruitment for summer associate programs has been incredibly successful, harkening back to a time when law students quickly accepted the offers that Biglaw firms handed out like candy. The 2020 recruitment cycle, however, was just a tad different in that law firms and law students were dealing with a deadly virus that threatened to completely destroy the typical summer associate experience — and it did, it a way. Some programs were canceled entirely, and others were pushed into the virtual space, but they all had the same thing in common: offer rates were plentiful, and like the vaccine, they offered hope for the future.

According to the latest recruiting figures from the National Association of Law Placement (NALP), offer rates from Biglaw summer programs were just shy of last year’s historic highs. Despite all of the challenges that were created by the coronavirus crisis, not only did Biglaw’s aggregate offer rate for summer 2020 programs (including those that were held and those that were canceled) hover at nearly 97 percent, slightly below last year’s historic high of nearly 98 percent, but the acceptance rate for those offers reached an historic high of 87.8 percent. What’s even more exciting is that this historic acceptance rate is significantly higher than acceptance rates measured before the recession, which tended to hover between 73 to 77 percent.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Here’s what James Leipold, NALP’s executive director, had to say:

The high-level takeaway is: Not withstanding how difficult this summer was in putting these virtual summer programs on at the last moment—the outcomes were very strong. … Offers and acceptance rates both remained at historic highs. The summer class size was down, but those decisions were made before the pandemic, and that was part of a three or four years of pulling back that we’ve seen over time with firms trimming back their summer classes. There was none of the interruption we saw in 2009 when nobody got offers, and all these students had to graduate without jobs.

Here are some interesting facts about the unprecedented summer programs of 2020:

- For programs that were actually held, more than 86 percent were entirely virtual, while 8 percent were a hybrid model of some in-person and some virtual programming. Only 6 percent of summer programs were held entirely in-person. The average 2020 summer program length was 5.6 weeks, whereas in 2019, summer programs averaged 9.7 weeks.
- Law students didn’t seem to mind that their first experiences at their firms were virtual. At 97 percent, offer rates for summer programs that were held were a bit higher than those that were canceled (93.3 percent). Relatedly, acceptance rates were higher for summer programs that were held (88 percent) than those that were canceled (85.6 percent).
- At 11, the average summer program class size decreased from 13 in 2019, and it had previously been flat at 14 from 2016 to 2018. At the biggest of Biglaw firms (700+ lawyers), these class sizes have continuously fallen since 2016 (from 22 in 2016 to 20 in 2017 and so on until we reach 14 in 2020).

Congratulations to all law students who went through the entry-level recruitment cycle in 2020, as things seem to have worked out marvelously for them, no matter how much the pandemic tried to derail their plans. Let’s be thankful that a new generation of associates wasn’t lost thanks thanks to COVID.

# The Future Of The Bar Exam
## The NCBE just published some forceful critiques of its bar exam.

The next generation of the bar exam is coming. Well, hopefully.

The National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE) released its Testing Task Force’s [Phase 1 report](https://www.testingtaskforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FINAL-Listening-Session-Executive-Summary-with-Appendices-1.pdf) this week. The report summarizes what people throughout the legal profession think about the current licensing process and exam. While readers will not be surprised by the general sentiments — people are generally dissatisfied with the current bar exam — they may be surprised that the NCBE published such forceful critiques.

But first some background.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The NCBE is the nonprofit organization that state regulators in all U.S. jurisdictions outsource between some and a lot of the work that goes into determining whether someone should receive a law license. The NCBE is the group behind the Multistate Professional Responsibility Exam (MPRE), Multistate Bar Exam (MBE), Multistate Essay Exam (MEE), and the Multistate Performance Test (MPT). The NCBE also coordinates the Uniform Bar Exam (UBE), a compact among 36 jurisdictions to uniformly administer, grade, and score the MBE, MEE, and MPT. A test-taker’s results can then be transferred to any of the other UBE jurisdictions. Each state still sets its own passing score, so you can pass the UBE in one state but not another.

The NCBE created its Task Force as part of its efforts “to sustain confidence by all stakeholders in the testing process.” While some consternation stems from falling bar pass rates, legitimate criticism of the exam’s validity from some of legal education’s best thinkers has plagued the bar exam for several decades. That is, the exam may not measure what it says it does: whether an individual is minimally competent to practice law.

From my conversations with NCBE’s new leadership over the past few years, they are deadly serious about the exam’s validity. The Testing Task Force’s transparent process is a tacit acknowledgment that the NCBE has not listened very well in the past, and that there are meaningful questions about how the exam measures minimum competence.

Phase I involved listening sessions with lawyers, judges, examiners, and educators. Phase II involves a practice analysis to “gather current, empirical data on the knowledge, skills, abilities, other characteristics, and technologies that newly licensed lawyers use to accomplish the job tasks they perform.” Phase III will involve turning the results of Phase I and II into exam design recommendations by the end of 2020.

(If you practice law, go take the [20 minute practice analysis survey](https://www.testingtaskforce.org/2019pasurvey/).)

That brings us to the Phase I report and some common threads throughout all the listening sessions.

- The exam tests both too much and too little. That is, it should emphasize more lawyering skills and less subject matter knowledge.
- The exam should utilize more writing, less multiple-choice, and additional methods like simulation.
- Jurisdictions should consider breaking the exam into different parts over more than just a few days.
The report also includes notes for each session. The following bullets are directly from the report but paraphrased from attendees.

- “The MEE is the least valuable component of the bar exam because it is not realistic: it requires answering short essays based upon memorization of the law, which is not consistent with how lawyers practice (e.g., with access to electronic databases like Westlaw or LexisNexis)”
- “The inconsistent passing scores implemented across states raise questions about the legitimacy of exam results; states need to agree on a definition of minimum competence”
- “The MBE tests arcane, obscure, or trivial aspects of the law that new practitioners should not be expected to know and are not reflective of minimum competence; the MBE tests too deeply on subjects; memorizing black-letter law for the MBE to answer multiple-choice questions (MCQs) does not mimic real practice because lawyers would look up the law and not rely only on memory in representing clients; too much focus on memorization; the MBE tests only memorization and no skills; the MBE questions are full of red herrings and intentionally tricky”
- “MCQs are not realistic or an effective way to test what lawyers do; if retaining MCQs for the MBE, reduce the number of questions or increase the amount of time allowed”

From Pilot and Above The Law  
I’ve focused on these negative sentiments because they tell us something important about NCBE’s approach. Because NCBE paraphrased what session attendees said, it could have softened these remarks without anyone being the wiser. Session attendees also provided enough material that NCBE could have told a completely different story in its executive summary and declined to publish such extensive session notes.

Instead, the report showcases an array of dissatisfied stakeholders who directly question whether the exam actually measures minimum competence at all. Each of these critiques cut right to the heart of the bar exam itself. If the test methods and content are not effective or realistic or relevant to law practice, it’s difficult to imagine how the exam could be valid.

We operate in a world of standardized tests for some good reasons, and the bar exam is no exception. Not only do state regulators expect the exam to be valid, but also to be reliable and thus able to yield stable scores over time. Often, however, test-makers sacrifice validity for reliability because the principal means for achieving reliability is through multiple-choice questions that don’t quite reflect what people in the real world do. I’m hopeful that the bar exam of the future will focus significantly more on validity.

NCBE is not the only organization concerned about validity. I am working with a team of researchers on the [Building a Better Bar](https://iaals.du.edu/projects/building-a-better-bar) project at the Institute for the Advancement of the American Legal System ([IAALS](https://iaals.du.edu/)) to explore the work that new lawyers do during their first year after licensing. We’re holding 60 focus groups in 12 states to shed light on the “minimum competence” that lawyers need to serve clients in a wide variety of practice settings. Our focus-group approach, we believe, will complement NCBE’s job analysis surveys.

The only fair reason to limit licensure to those who pass the bar is to protect the public. If the bar exam does not measure minimum competence, it needs to change or be eliminated. Fortunately the NCBE seems poised to oversee that change in the near future.
