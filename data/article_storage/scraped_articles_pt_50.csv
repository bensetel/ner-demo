# Relieved Associates Finally Get Raises, But No Summer Bonuses
## Anxiety was rising, but the firm finally announced raises.

Look who has decided to finally raise associate base compensation! Arnold & Porter just announced that they were on board with the new normal in attorney salaries, bumping up associate paydays by $10,000 to $25,000, depending on seniority — retroactive to July 1st.

And it came not a moment too soon. Here at Above the Law, we were getting deluged by angry associates wondering where in the hell their money was. Peer firms, including Wilmer and Covington, had already announced their raises, so the anxiety was rising. Savvy associates knew the firm wouldn’t want to start the recruitment season behind the market, so it was only a matter of time — even if that time would be spent fretting.

But now the money has arrived:

But it’s not all good news. The special bonuses many firms are doling out are not coming to A&P, though the firm assures associates the mid-year bonuses paid by other Biglaw firms will be taken into account during end-of-the-year bonus time. Hopefully associates’ overall compensation will match the market standard, but it does suck for associates considering a lateral move this summer — the golden handcuffs will keep them in place until year’s end.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

Bruce Stachenfeld

I guess I am not sure this is “reinventing” the law business, but it sure is something you don’t want to have happen — if you fall into these traps, you might not have a law business to reinvent in the first place. Of course no one wants to find herself inadvertently in an ethical mess. And, of course, we all know the rules and obvious things like don’t lie, cheat, steal, “pad” your bills, or do things like that. However, there are two places where I have seen even completely honorable and ethical people go astray without realizing it. Since these two traps are so easy to fall into, I am outlining them here.

The first one is you do something wrong because “he did it first!” We all learn this when we are young kids. Some kid steals your toy truck so you steal that kid’s toy truck. Despite your righteousness and your unimpeachable “he did it first!” defense, you learn that the argument just doesn’t work on your mom or dad. You still stole the other kid’s truck, and that was “wrong.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Despite us knowing this, I still see it happen. Someone is rude to you, so you are rude back. Someone lies to you, so you feel that now it is okay to lie to that person. Someone does something that you perceive is “wrong,” so you feel a license to do that to the wrongdoer. It feels right at the time, but then when you think on it – after the fact – you realize you have been tricked into doing something you are not proud of by the actions of the other party. I advocate not giving that party that power over you – to coax or goad you – ever – into doing any behavior you are not proud of.

The second one is that you do something wrong because “everyone else is doing it so it must be okay.”  Often many people are doing whatever it is and 99 percent of them get away with it, until a third party – usually the government – cracks down and picks a few random people to “make an example of.”  Those people are horribly treated – maybe even go to jail – and everyone else sneaks off with a sigh of relief. Those who are victimized by the crackdown feel how unjust it is – and from a fairness point of view it is indeed unjust, as usually just a few get punished for the sins of many – but if you break the rules, this is a risk you have. Consider steroids, doping, and other scandals in sports. Everyone supposedly does it/did it in some sports, but if you are the one who gets caught, no one has any sympathy for you based on this argument.

I have tried my best not to fall into these traps, and the only way I can think of is to be mindful of the following:

- Try to be a class act – always – don’t let someone ever trick you into behaving in a way you are not proud of.
- Be friendly and flexible in all things except one – which is rigidly hewing to the laws, the rules, and ethical conduct.
- Be mindful of the fact that whether you realize it or not, everyone is “watching” your behavior. If someone sees you fall into one of the traps above, she will in the back of her mind always see you as someone who behaves in this manner. If, however, you are one who follows the foregoing rules, she will see that too, and it will help you in your life.

# Leading Biglaw Firm Joins In On Associate Salary Raise Frenzy
## Even Canadian firms are getting in on the action. Congrats!

Raises continue to spread through the legal profession, and if your firm has a New York office, then associates better believe — or hope/pray, depending on the firm — that they may have a raise coming. We’ve heard from all the Magic Circle firms with U.S. offices, and now it’s time for a member of the Seven Sisters to give this a try.

What are the Seven Sisters, you may ask? It’s a group of leading law firms in Canada with offices in Toronto, specifically (in alphabetical order), Blakes, Davies, Goodmans, McCarthy, Osler, Stikeman, and Torys.

The latest firm to join in the U.S. raise game is none other than Torys. The firm [handed out special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/torys-special-bonuses/) to associates and counsel back in April, and now it’s offering even more cash compensation to its New York associates in the form of salary increases, effective July 1.

# Yesterday Was The Day America Learned What We've Known About Jones Day All Along
## Welcome to the party. Yes, Jones Day is as awful as you think.

So, we uh, well, we really went after Jones Day yesterday. And I regret nothing. If you try to overturn the results of a free and fair election with courtroom machinations, well, you’re going to piss some people off.

But between the New York Times [article blowing them up](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/even-jones-day-lawyers-are-giving-trumps-election-lawsuits-some-serious-side-eye/), and the Lincoln Project [promising an ad campaign](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/jones-day-to-prepare-for-a-bad-pr-campaign-the-likes-of-which-theyve-never-seen-before/) targeting not just the Biglaw firm over its election litigation, but their clients too, well, it couldn’t have been a good day to work in their PR office. And Above the Law tipsters from all around Biglaw were noticing the cracks in the firm’s armor.

Like folks taking note of their social media presence during the controversy:

FYI, just thought you should know Jones Day’s Twitter is getting filled with negative comments. Their LinkedIn posts was also getting filled with negative comments until Jones day deleted them all and disabled the comment function!

And quite a few people noted that the firm’s servers seemed unable to keep up with the sudden deluge of attention.



When their website was finally up and working, a link to a[ Jones Day Statement Regarding Election Litigation](https://www.jonesday.com/en/news/2020/11/jones-day-statement-regarding-election-litigation) appeared. Oh, this’ll be good.

First off, Jones Day issued a strong, categorical rebuke of the negative coverage:

Jones Day is not representing President Trump, his campaign, or any affiliated party in any litigation alleging voter fraud. Jones Day also is not representing any entity in any litigation challenging or contesting the results of the 2020 general election. Media reports to the contrary are false.

Wow. Well, then let us be the first to express our apolo… oh wait, there’s more.

Jones Day is representing the Pennsylvania GOP in pending litigation brought by private parties in April 2020 and the Pennsylvania Democratic Party in August 2020. In that litigation, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court issued an order extending the statutory deadline to return mail-in ballots established by the Pennsylvania General Assembly.

There it is.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Jones Day isn’t representing anyone alleging “voter fraud”… Jones Day just represents the GOP in the case that forms the basis of all the allegations that this is a stolen election. It’s a distinction that seems trivial, but in reality is actually still trivial.

The Republican Party of Pennsylvania, through Jones Day, has sought review in the United States Supreme Court on the ground that the order is unconstitutional because it usurped the Pennsylvania General Assembly’s plenary authority to determine election procedures including the deadline for absentee ballots. The United States Supreme Court is currently deciding whether to grant certiorari. Four justices agreed with our client’s position, and voted to grant a stay, indicating that they believed there was a fair prospect of review and reversal by the Court. Three justices have issued a statement that there is “a strong likelihood that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s order violates the U.S. Constitution.” On November 6, Justice Alito ordered Pennsylvania election officials to segregate ballots arriving after the statutory deadline to preserve the issue and to have a record of the vote with and without the segregated ballots.

Basically, Jones Day is shouting to the world that they are not the kind of two-bit outfit that will get caught getting berated over [hearsay within hearsay](https://twitter.com/JosephPatrice/status/1324788875684913154?s=20), as if the flack they’re taking from the Times article is for being bad lawyers as opposed to being evil lawyers. They’re taking flack because they are good lawyers trying to disenfranchise thousands of people in the middle of a pandemic.

Jones Day will not withdraw from that representation.

Everyone is entitled to hire the counsel of their choice. And we shouldn’t judge attorneys as attorneys based on the cases they take. However, lawyering is also a business, and part of business is protecting the brand. Jones Day saw a global pandemic that sparked serious public health concerns and thought it was good business to slap their name on forcing people to risk their lives to vote in person rather than voting absentee — a completely safe form of voting — simply because that could improve turnout and undermine the gerrymandered Pennsylvania state legislature that routinely brags about how its unconstitutional voting restrictions were [created for the purpose of helping them retain power](https://www.politicspa.com/turzai-voter-id-law-means-romney-can-win-pa/37153/). Jones Day is welcome to take on that representation… and Jones Day should be prepared to face the associated market backlash for that move.

Or they could whine like children.

Jones Day expects that the media will correct the numerous false reports given the facts set forth above, all of which were readily verifiable in the public record.

I see we’re taking the latter path.

# Bonuses That Wow For Associates At Top 10 Biglaw Firm
## Big money's on the table for associates.

The days are getting shorter, but — seasonal affective disorder to one side — that doesn’t mean there is just despair. Biglaw had a pretty excellent 2021 (monetarily speaking; the whole
living-through-a-pandemic thing sucked for everyone) and they are showing associates just how much their hard work is appreciated.

The latest firm to say thank you with cold, hard cash is Sidley Austin. The firm took in $2,462,935,000 in gross revenue last year, making is number 6 on the Am Law 100, and they are happy to share their good fortune with the associates who made it all possible.

As expected, the firm matched the prevailing market bonuses as detailed in the chart below:

Those who “have higher productivity and/or exceptional performance” will get additional bonuses. Congratulations to Sidley associates!

[UPDATE: [Bloomberg is also reporting](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/sidley-austin-to-raise-associate-base-pay-to-375-000-in-2022) that Sidley has increased salaries by “up to $35,000.” We believe this is a misreading of the memo — rather we read the memo on the next page as acknowledging that each class year is graduating to the pre-established salary for an associate that’s one-year older (though with the eldest class receiving an additional $10K for a $375K base). We will update with clarification from Sidley.

[UPDATE 2](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/no-sidley-has-not-increased-their-compensation-scale/): Confirmed.]

# Leading Biglaw Firm Now Offering $110K Signing Bonus For Federal Clerks
## Will other firms match these big bonuses?

With Biglaw salary news sweeping the industry, it’s easy for those on the outside looking in to feel left out. But there’s good news for those who aspire to clerk for federal judges: there’s a ton of money waiting for you on the other side of your clerkship — six figures of it! — should you decide to become a Biglaw associate.

It’s well known that federal clerkships are incredibly prestigious, and many high-end law firms really want people with that experience to work for them. That’s why the high end of bonuses for federal clerks who decide to join Biglaw firms post-clerkship reach six figures. Another firm has hit that threshold, and upped the financial ante, which other Biglaw firms eager for clerk firepower may soon match or even exceed.

Boies Schiller Flexner, a litigation-focused firm that brought in $250,000,000 gross revenue in 2020, recently announced that it would be offering a $110,000 signing bonus to federal law clerks. [Law.com](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/03/21/boies-schiller-offers-110k-signing-bonuses-to-federal-court-clerks/) has the details:

In a letter to clerks from managing partners Matthew Schwartz, Sigrid McCawley and Alan Vickery, … the firm wrote that “because judicial clerks are crucial to our success, BSF has increased the signing bonus for all federal district and appellate law clerks to $110,000 for one clerkship.”

The managing partners went on to say that clerks joining the firm can choose their own compensation structure.

“When joining BSF, you will also be able to opt into BSF’s unique formula compensation system, which often results in performance-based bonuses far surpassing the market,” the letter stated.

So, why did the firm increase its signing bonus for federal clerks? According to Schwartz, having former judicial clerks among their ranks provides a “competitive advantage” to Boies Schiller. “We want to be sure we continue to position ourselves as one of the law firms where judicial clerks most want to go when they begin practicing law,” he said.

While other firms offer six-figure signing bonuses for federal clerks (averaging $100-105K), the Boies bonus is on the higher end of what’s currently out on the market. In fact, most Biglaw clerkship signing bonuses hover around $50- $75K.

With the rush on salaries in a hot lateral market, what are the other firms waiting for? Don’t they want to capture some of the magic that former federal clerks can offer? If you have information about any firm’s clerkship bonuses, you should [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Clerkship%20Bonuses) or text us (646-820-8477) with all the details. Thanks.

# Elon Musk Settlement Agreement As Unconstitutional Taking Is... A Theory
## Musk's legal team cites landmark Property case to undermine SEC settlement agreement.

In order to escape the wrath of the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2018, Elon Musk agreed to a settlement that required an attorney from Tesla’s compliance team look over his future Tweets. The SEC signs agreements where folks agree to never violate securities laws again every day, and while Musk had to commit his company to exercise some compliance oversight to sweeten the deal, the core of the agreement aligned with standard practice.

Musk is trying to get the entirely reasonable agreement that he entered at arm’s length to avoid enforcement tossed out. He drapes this in some new age pro-free speech anti-government argle-bargle, but people are overlooking his practical needs. The man is [having so many legal staffing problems](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/tesla-legal-department-on-self-driving-mode-or-maybe-not-whos-the-gc-over-there-anyway/) across [all his companies](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/if-only-he-were-as-good-at-maintaining-a-legal-department-as-he-was-at-racking-up-sec-charges/) that he can’t even commit to having a compliance person anymore!

Whatever the motivation, Musk’s outside counsel Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel [wrote the court this week](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/21/elon-musks-lawyer-asks-court-to-throw-out-sec-twitter-sitter-deal.html), offering the jury verdict in the recent shareholder suit absolving Musk of liability over the behavior underlying the SEC settlement. If Musk isn’t liable to the shareholders for a securities law violation, then how can he be held to an agreement he made to avoid SEC enforcement?

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Given that the SEC’s interest in the consistent application of securities laws to protect the sanctity of the market differs from whether or not an individual shareholder lost money, the proper answer to the above question is “pretty easily, actually.” Remember, the jury essentially let Musk off after determining that no one should take him seriously. In fact, Spiro said at the time that the shareholder suit was the product of investors “[gambling and looking for lawsuits as insurance](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/02/musk-lawyer-blames-tesla-investors-for-their-losses-as-funding-secured-trial-ends/).” But that’s exactly what the SEC exists to prevent by imposing rules on the leadership of publicly traded entities blasting out gambling opportunities that aren’t backed by reality.

But the letter makes a game effort at it anyway, deploying a curious precedent:

Now, in light of the jury’s finding that Mr. Musk’s tweets did not violate Rule 10b-5, the SEC lacks support both for the consent decree itself and for its arguments on appeal. The jury’s verdict provides further reason why the public interest in avoiding unconstitutional settlements easily subsumes the SEC’s purported stake in the consent decree.Likewise, the jury’s verdict confirms the propriety of applying the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, which prohibits deals achieved “through gimmickry, which converted a valid [settlement] into ‘an out-and-out plan of extortion,’” Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374, 387 (1994) (citation omitted), to excise the unconstitutional prior restraint from the consent decree.

Now… I’m from the “City of Tigard,” so this specific Supreme Court precedent sticks in my memory a bit. The word “settlement” is in brackets because the case has nothing to do with settlement agreements. The replaced phrase is “regulation of land use” and dealt with the downtown plumbing supply store asking for a permit to develop more of its property and the city granting the request on the condition that part of that development become a public use bike path. The Supreme Court decided that a land use permit contingent upon ceding land to public use amounted to an unconstitutional taking without any nexus to the reasonable justification of limiting the expansion for drainage issues. Now… the fact that the city had every legitimate reason to deny it unless the owner ceded some land to the city for the purpose of controlling drainage, the bike path was incidental to the clearly valid drainage issue, and that granting the expansion at all amounted to some degree of compensation and no one in the record bothered to calculate the value of any of this stuff, rendering the whole opinion largely divorced from the lived reality of Tigard and just a vehicle for a right-wing Court to handcuff local governments from catering to those granola-eating, bike-riding hippies in Oregon and around the country.

But I digress.

The point is, how does this relate to a settlement agreement? Expanding takings analysis to apply to any impairment of constitutional rights, Musk is arguing that… what? The government granting the benefit of concluding an enforcement action contingent on Musk giving up a constitutional right? THAT’S EVERY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT EVER. Can someone plea to manslaughter and then toss the agreement if the wrongful death suit comes up short?

Giving the argument more benefit of the doubt, perhaps it’s that the specific concession to require a compliance monitor to lacked a nexus to an agreement to settle with the SEC. But “I will take steps to guarantee that I don’t violate securities laws” seems pretty directly related to “a settlement agreement over violating securities laws.”

Also, how does the verdict play into this at all? His argument seems to be that because he won the shareholder action, agreeing to a monitor is now unconstitutional, but those things aren’t related. This generous reading of Dolan would suggest that if the provision was an unconstitutional ask, it was an unconstitutional ask from jump, regardless of whether shareholders were personally damaged.

Unless the SEC defrauded a billionaire with access to sophisticated counsel, it would seem that Musk’s opportunity to get out of this settlement agreement was to never agree to it in the first place.

# Biglaw Partner's Conviction For Murdering His Wife Overturned By State Supreme Court
## It's not yet clear if he'll be retried.

[Back in 2018](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/tex-mciver-guilty/), Claud “Tex” McIver was found guilty on charges of felony murder, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, and three counts of influencing witnesses. The former Biglaw partner — pre-conviction he was a partner at labor and employment giant Fisher & Phillips — had his convictions for felony murder and possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony[ overturned](https://www.gasupreme.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s22a0093.pdf) by the Georgia Supreme Court.

The charges stemmed from the[ 2016 death of McIver’s wife, Diane](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/biglaw-partner-killed-his-wife-allegedly-because-of-black-lives-matter/). She was killed by a gunshot to the back while riding in an SUV. The car was being driven by a friend of Diane McIver, Diane was in the front seat, and Tex McIver was in the backseat behind Diane. Tex McIver claimed he has his gun out and ready to shoot because he feared the neighborhood they were driving through. A spokesperson for McIver specifically noted he feared Black Lives Matters protestors. At trial, Tex McIver said he accidentally shot his wife after falling asleep.

The state supreme court overturned the conviction because, while the trial judge allowed jurors to consider a felony involuntary manslaughter charge for a slaying without intent that happens in the commission of an unlawful act, the judge did not send a misdemeanor involuntary manslaughter charge for a slaying without intent that happens in the commission of a lawful act in an unlawful manner to the jury. The difference in mens rea for those charges [was reportedly sufficient](https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/former-fisher-phillips-partners-murder-conviction-is-reversed-he-claimed-wifes-shooting-an-accident) for a reversal:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“We cannot say that the error was harmless because the evidence of McIver’s guilt of aggravated assault and felony murder was not overwhelming or even strong, and the evidence of criminal intent was disputed and circumstantial,” the Georgia Supreme Court said. “Indeed, the state’s evidence of intent was weak, as no witness testified to any disagreement or quarrel between McIver and Diane, and many witnesses testified that they were very much in love.”

“If McIver intended to fatally shoot Diane, why would he do it in the presence of [the woman driving the SUV], and why would he do it in midtown Atlanta, within a few miles of several major hospitals, instead of on a rural interstate, far from any medical aid?” the state supreme court asked.

As reported by the ABA Journal, the Georgia Supreme Court also had a lot to say about what evidence could be presented, should there be a retrial:

If the case is retried, the court should not allow evidence that lacked relevance or that created a danger of unfair prejudice, the state supreme court said.

The court said the prosecution should not be able to introduce evidence of Diane’s supposed second will, which was never found. Nor could it introduce evidence that McIver directed the SUV driver to take his wife to a hospital that was not the closest facility.

But prosecutors could introduce evidence of McIver’s sale of Diane’s clothing, jewelry and furs after her death and could introduce evidence of McIver’s calm demeanor at the hospital, the court said.

The court also warned prosecutors to be aware of the impropriety of arguments implying that McIver harbored racial prejudice.

McIver had been sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole. He has served almost four years and 10 months. His attorney, Don Samuel, [said](https://www.11alive.com/article/news/local/tex-mciver-trial/what-happens-next-tex-mciver/85-54ae6dd6-e3da-4182-aa81-28c3563753a6) he’s working to get McIver released from prison as soon as possible. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has not yet announced if McIver would be retried.

# Goodbye To 2021: Don’t Let The Door Hit You On The Way Out

David Sedaris (Google him) has said that [if he thinks he’s gotten nothing done](https://www.whatshouldireadnext.com/quotes/authors/david-sedaris), he has only to look at his filled wastebasket and think that the time wasn’t totally wasted. Our 2021 wastebaskets are overflowing. All the hopes for a return to normal that we had have been shredded. Let’s stipulate that everyone is delighted to see this year end.

What a lousy year. Would anyone disagree? Those who have received huge bonuses for all the arduous work done this year might, but are those enough to compensate for the losses, the heartaches, the headaches, the illnesses, the upside-down nature of lives this year? How to decide what’s important and what’s not at this year’s end? Who is important to you and who isn’t?

But I couldn’t let this year end without a little bit of snark, which is the only thing in adequate supply, unlike COVID-19 home tests.

We always like to have the last word, and judges always have it. Lawyers (remember that judges were lawyers first) also like to have it, be it in court or on the phone or email or a text, but will we ever learn how just to let it go? The last word isn’t necessarily the best, as we have seen during this past year.

January 6th, to vax or not to vax, to booster or not to booster, to mask or not to mask, sorry Will, but those have been the questions this year. Courtrooms closed, courtrooms reopened, but only to a limited degree. Courts twisting themselves into pretzels in efforts to say, in a temperate way, that stare decisis is a lot of hooey and has no precedential value anymore.

We can disagree but not be disagreeable, but agreement is a relic of olden times when compromise was not a dirty word and people worked together for the common good. Is there a common good anymore? What if extra-terrestrials attacked us? Would we, could we, unite to fight a common enemy? If the pandemic is any example of how we’d react as a country, we are toast.

The antics of those in our profession, both lawyers and judges, continued to amaze this year. Did all of them really pass the bar? And for those who rose to the bench, where was their judgment? I forgot, they left it back in chambers, or it’s in David Sedaris’s overflowing wastebasket. Here’s [a classic example](https://apnews.com/article/business-lifestyle-media-alabama-social-media-2acafdead6108e2161dd4bca8188fca2) of a judge who was tossed off the bench for a variety of reasons, including calling another judge an “Uncle Tom,” an employee a “heifer,” and using Facebook aliases to communicate with parties about their pending litigation. Wait, what? There’s more but that’s enough to give you a sense of why she was removed.

I’m repeatedly stunned that people who are supposed to be smart leave all their brains behind them when they post on social (aka unsocial) media. I see the trail of discarded brains, akin to the Hansel and Gretel (Google them) crumbs, when lawyers and judges post. You would think (assuming facts not in evidence) that judges would be able to distinguish when personal comments on social media make sense and when they don’t. Neutrality? What’s that?

And don’t get me started on lawyers on social media. Is an apology sufficient for “overheated rhetoric”? You tell me. Once it’s on social media [it’s out there, forever](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/voting-rights-lawyer-apologizes-for-tone-of-tweets-in-confirmation-hearing-group-buys-ads-to-oppose-him?utm_medium=email&utm_source=salesforce_483733&sc_sid=04744929&utm_campaign=&promo=&utm_content=&additional4=&additional5=&sfmc_j=483733&sfmc_s=83087486&sfmc_l=1528&sfmc_jb=19017&sfmc_mid=100027443&sfmc_u=14001031).

And whose bright idea was it to [insert nasty comments](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/biglaw-partners-benchslapped-over-bitter-post-trial-claims-of-anti-semitism/) (e.g., antisemitic) about opposing counsel in post-trial filings? This conduct took the concept of “sore loser” to new depths and once again showed that prejudice against minorities is still alive and well. The essence of cheap shots, the trial court agreed and benchslapped counsel for its reprehensible remarks. Just because the plaintiff was an Israeli company and the defendant was Amazon was no basis for finding antisemitism.

Sanctions? Plaintiff’s counsel have been ordered to take 30 hours of ethics MCLE.  BFD. How about reporting them to their bar disciplinary offices and mandating pro bono work for Jewish organizations helping the very last living Holocaust survivors receive reparations from Germany? And they ought to review the history of Jewish law firms in New York City, when Biglaw firms were not hiring more than token Jews, if any, and so many Jewish firms were startups, long before the term came into being because the lawyers didn’t have any other options. It wasn’t all that long ago.

My hope is that this coming year will be better for all of us, that the profession will continue to grow in diversity, equity, and inclusion, that civility will be the rule, rather than the exception, and that lawyers will “show, not tell,” driving a stake through the heart of prejudice, in whatever forms, and above all, just not being a jerk.

The late humorist Sam Levenson (Google him) said: “It’s so simple to be wise. Just think of something stupid to say and then don’t say it.” If even one person heeds his words, then 2022 will be off to a good start. Here’s a New Year’s resolution for us all: STFU.

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

# Debevoise And Plimpton Does The Nice Thing And Matches Cravath

Here comes the neighborhood. Debevoise and Plimpton has matched the [Cravath associate salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/), which itself was a match of the Milbank scale, with $5,000 – $10,000 extra than Milbank as you get more senior.

It’s the nice thing to do, and Debevoise is always nice (full disclosure, I used to work at D&P and was a much nicer person when I was there than I am now).

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Here’s the memo:

Subject: Base salary and bonus adjustments

On behalf of all of the partners, I am pleased to announce that the Firm will increase base salary rates for associates on the US scale and in good standing effective July 1 as follows:

2017 $190,000
2016 $200,000
2015 $220,000
2014 $255,000
2013 $280,000
2012 $305,000
2011 $325,000
2010 and senior $340,000

In addition, we will pay summer bonuses this year to associates on the US scale and in good standing as follows:

2017 $5,000
2016 $7,500
2015 $10,000
2014 $15,000
2013 $20,000
2012 and senior $25,000

The usual pro rations will apply to the summer bonuses for those on part-time arrangements or who started with us after the beginning of the year.

Counsel on the US scale and in good standing will receive base salary increases and summer bonuses as determined on a case by case basis consistent with past practice.

Base salary increases and summer bonuses will be reflected in the July 5 payroll.

Thank you for your hard work and dedication to the Firm and its clients.

Yep, that’s also a match of the Simpson Thacher special bonuses.

I expect all of the top firms will get this done in the next two weeks, setting themselves up for summer on-campus interviews.

There is a logic to this nod-wink collusion, of course. You want your people to feel fairly compensated. You want them to be positive and pleasant when they come into work. You want them to feel like they’re choosing a firm based on their “culture” or whatever, not just going to whichever of 100 similar firms pays a little bit more money.

Congratulations, Debevoise associates, and soon-to-be Debevoise associates. It really is a nice firm that respects personal difference but pays just as well as everybody else.

******************************

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or email us (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

# Snapchat For Lawyers -- Is It Really Happening? 
## Is Snapchat an immature, unprofessional platform? Well, that's what we said about Facebook and Twitter too.

Law firms using Snapchat for publishing commentary and engaging their audience? Sounds a little crazy, but so did law firms using Twitter for sharing news in 140 characters just five years ago.

Snapchat, an image messaging and multimedia mobile application launched just five years ago, is going public within the next month with a valuation of close to $20 billion. A lot of people in the investment community believe Snapchat is here to stay and that the number of users, now 160 million, and revenue are only going to grow.
I’ll confess. Though I have a Snapchat account, I have never used it.
But when Ken Doctor at Newsonomics [reports](http://newsonomics.com/newsonomics-as-post-times-explore-snapchat-quartz-messaging-app-celebrates-its-first-birthday/) that the New York Times is going to devote a half dozen staffers to publishing a daily Snapchat edition, it makes me think that there’s a publishing opportunity that awaits us in Snapchat.
The Times is not alone, the Washington Post [shared](https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/wp/2017/02/13/the-washington-post-will-be-the-breaking-news-source-on-snapchats-discover/) last week that it will be the breaking news source on Snapchat’s “Discover.”
CNN which has been using Snapchat for a couple years, publishes a mix of content, [per Digiday](http://digiday.com/media/publishers-approaching-snapchat-discover/), including international stories, entertainment news, and political coverage — in text and video form. It has also experimented with creating Snapchat-exclusive interactives, such as one it made about the Supreme Court.
Snapchat is seen to represent a new direction in social media, with its users wanting a more in-the-moment way of sharing and communicating. With less emphasis on an accumulation of ongoing statuses leaving permanent material, Snapchat focuses on fleeting encounters.
Messaging apps with these characteristics surpassed social networks in unique digital audience within the last year, per Doctor, and Snapchat takes advantage of this trend. Snapchat, a mobile app company, also takes advantage of the growing mobile networking phenomenon.
How do users communicate or publish on Snapchat?
By creating multimedia messages referred to as “snaps,” consisting of a photo or a short video, which can be edited to include filters and effects, text captions and drawings.
Snapchat “publishes” content via “Stories” and “Discovers.” Stories allow a user at a specific event to contribute “snaps” to a curated story promoted to all users.
“Discover” is an area containing channels of ad-supported short-form content from major publishers, including BuzzFeed, CNN, ESPN, Mashable and People.
I thought Snapchat enabled users to share pictures and video that disappeared upon the recipient’s viewing. But “Memories” allows snaps and story posts to be saved into a private storage area, where they can be viewed alongside other media stored on the device, as well as edited and published as snaps, story posts, or messages. Snaps can also be retrieved by search.
If I am butchering how Snapchat works, please excuse me. Like I said, I’ve not used it.
The amount of media being delivered via Snapchat is staggering. In May 2015, users were sending 2 billion videos per day, which jumped to 6 billion by November. By 2016, Snapchat had hit 10 billion daily video views.
Like social networks before it, Snapchat’s user base is gradually getting older. Three years ago, Snapchat was only being used by 5% of smartphone users age 25-34 and 2% of users age 35+, according to comScore Mobile Metrix. By last year, the numbers moved to 38% and 14%, respectively — probably not too far off Facebook’s maturity.
Marketers are attracted to Snapchat because it allows brands to be more genuine. There is apparently room to be real rather than to run display ads.
What could all this mean for lawyers and law firms?
- We may have a new and growing medium for engaging clients, prospective clients, referral sources and influencers.
- A new medium that will enable genuine exchanges establishing trust and relationships.
- How Snapchat will be used by lawyers, who knows?
- Of course, not everyone needs to use Snapchat, there’s only so many hours in the day.
- Those who choose to use the medium will need to use it like the masses, free of the constraints lawyers and bar associations place on innovative social apps.
- Learning to use Snapchat effectively will come, like it has with other social media before it, through trial and error,
- Lawyers and law firms using Snapchat will likely have an edge on others who are not reaching such a large audience on the audience’s terms, just as lawyers have had an edge via other social media.
But I remember blogging about Facebook and Twitter in their early days, blowing off each as inappropriate for lawyers and business development.
If I have learned anything since, it’s that social media for cryptic communication that looks unprofessional and that could only be used for personal exchanges can become a very real way of building a name and relationships, professionally — the linchpins of business development for lawyers.
Where are we going with Snapchat? Who knows? But if I’m a betting man, I’m not betting against Snapchat being used by lawyers for business development.

# 3 Questions For A Leadership Coach For Women (Part II)
## Even the most forward-thinking law firms can benefit from periodic review of their retention and employee satisfaction metrics.

This week, we continue our written interview with [Worthmore Strategies’](https://worthmorenegotiations.com/) [Kathryn Valentine](https://worthmorenegotiations.com/about-us)[.](https://caldwellip.com/team/boston-biotech-patent-lawyer-katie-rubino/) Last week, Kathryn shared her views on how law firms and corporate legal departments can more effectively retain female and minority talent. In particular, she stressed the importance of “bottoms-up programming,” where empowered employees and committed employers can work together to implement positive change — one lawyer at a time. That focus, coupled with the significant and admirable efforts by leading law firms and corporate legal departments to offer various types of employee support programs in a top-down manner, is quite promising as we navigate through 2022 and beyond as a profession.

Now to the remainder of my interview with Kathryn. As usual, I have added some brief commentary to the answers below but have otherwise presented her answers to my questions as she provided them.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Gaston Kroub: Why is it important for female lawyers, whether they work in-house or for outside firms, to learn effective negotiation skills?

Kathryn Valentine: Top-down DEI programming instituted by firms has helped make a significant change in equity, but the results have slowed. The next tranche is bottom-up interventions. It’s equipping women to identify what they need to be successful at work and learning how to ask for those things without igniting backlash. When companies do this, we see a significant change in retention — one company cut the number of women saying they were “highly likely” or “likely” to leave in the next two years in half, saving themselves over a million dollars in recruitment costs. This is great for them, their employees, and our economy.

The ideal situation is corporate-level programming. However, you do not have to wait for your employer to catch up to this thinking in order to enjoy the benefits.  Learning to advocate effectively for yourself enables you to be more successful, less stressed and happier at work. There is a surprising amount of research on this topic, going back over a decade, that shows HOW you ask is much more important than WHAT you ask for. If you ask the “traditional” way — i.e., “I deserve X,” there is a high risk of backlash as a woman.  However, if you ask using a relational account — explaining what the impact of your ask is on others like the clients, firm, team, etc. — the risk of backlash is virtually eliminated. This means you can freely ask for whatever will help you be more successful.

Learning to negotiate specifically as a woman is a powerful professional tool — much like networking or communication — that enables individual women to truly reach their potential.

GK: At a basic level, Kathryn is proposing that female lawyers demonstrate the same level of considered advocacy for their career prospects as they do for their clients. Because law firms and corporate legal departments can be slow to adopt a bottoms-up approach that considers the specific needs of their female employees, it thereby behooves those very same employees to push the conversation in productive directions. How one approaches negotiation can of course have significant impact on the outcome — and it seems to me that if an expert like Kathryn advocates a more inclusive relational approach by employees making demands of employers, then there is a substantial likelihood that female lawyers who really do consider how best to present their case will do better in the long run than colleagues that adopt a more adversarial, entitled, approach. What is important to remember is that law firm owners and corporate legal departments are very much aware of the costs of replacing talent, which commands that they take reasonable requests from productive employees seriously.

GK: How can law firms work with consultants like you to increase job satisfaction levels for female lawyers?

KV: My company, Worthmore Strategies, is a consulting firm focused on achieving gender parity in the workplace by empowering women to ask for what they need to be happy, productive, and successful in their careers. Companies engage with us in two ways. The first is as a consultant, where we talk confidentially with women who have left and women who are still there to understand what your flight risk is, and what factors are driving that specifically for your company. Secondly, we customize our advocacy training to fit those specific factors. This training equips women to identify and ask for what they need to be successful — and therefore to stay — at your company. We also provide leadership training so that everyone — not just women — are informed on the issues that are driving women to leave and equipped to productively handle those conversations. We’ve found that by training both parties to the conversation we are able to deliver significant reductions in attrition, reducing recruitment costs and improving culture. You can learn more at [www.worthmorenegotiations.com.](https://worthmorenegotiations.com/) 

GK: Even the most forward-thinking law firms can benefit from periodic review of their retention and employee satisfaction metrics. And it is clear that an expert like Kathryn has a lot to offer in terms of understanding the drivers of female employee satisfaction, as well as the roadblocks that employers might face in terms of improving in this all-important area. Moreover, every lawyer can benefit from leadership and negotiation training, which at bottom involves committing to becoming better listeners and communicators, along with a mutual commitment to the success of the institution as a whole. I am not saying it is easy to get there, but it does seem like open communication in an effort to do so is a lot better than letting things fester to the point where parting ways makes more sense than working things out. Having someone like Kathryn involved can only help focus things on a positive track.

My thanks to Kathryn for the insights and cooperation, especially for her willingness to think through how her work can be of benefit to female lawyers. I wish her the best of luck in 2022 with Worthmore Strategies and hope it is a year of growth for her practice. There is no doubt that Kathryn has insights to share that are worthy of our attention, especially for law firms and corporate legal departments fed up with seeing promising talent walk away despite their best efforts at retention. Voices from outside our profession, like Kathryn’s, can surely enrich our understanding of what we can do personally and collectively to improve the experiences of our female and minority colleagues.

# Ex-Wall Street Lawyer Finds Work-Life Balance

Quick, what do Legos evoke in your mind? Childhood nostalgia? Pain? It’s hard to think of anything else [if you’ve ever stepped on a 1×1 barefoot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0P8RW9yqZ8c). It may take a few hours of brainstorming to think of Legos as a ticket out of Wall Street lawyering, but that’s only if you’ve never heard of Nathan Sawaya. His work speaks for itself, but it never hurts to have an unexpected answer to the eventual “What can you do with a law degree besides Biglaw?” that inevitably gets asked every once in a while. [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/apr/17/nathan-sawaya-art-of-the-brick-lego-sculptures-interview-melbourne-showgrounds) has coverage:

[Nathan Sawaya] made a living out of building sculptures from Lego and his work has been shown in 100 cities and 24 countries, attracting millions of visitors. But you won’t find any Lego in Nathan Sawaya’s home. Call it work-life balance: “I love what I do, but it is a job … not a hobby,” the 50-year-old American artist says.

Trust, his Lego art is a lot more complex than what you’re used to:

You ever see a person create art with a medium and wondering if you’ve been doing something wrong? You aren’t the only one. Despite Sawaya’s excellence, he got a cease and desist order from Lego early on in his sculpting. Artistic liberties or not,[ gotta be careful with those trademarks](https://codebluehmhs.org/8544/ae/interview-with-nathan-sawaya-the-award-winning-lego-artist/).

Bound to stay in your city because of a mandatory in-person policy? Sucks to suck, but as you think about [the side gigs you can do to keep you afloat](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/lawyers-with-side-hustles-are-becoming-more-commonplace-in-biglaw/), it may be a good idea to walk through a toy store. You never know when or where inspiration can hit.

# Morning Docket: 09.27.17
## * Former Alabama Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore has won the Republican primary runoff election for the Senate seat that was once occupied by AG Jeff Sessions. Perhaps we can look forward to history repeating itself and Moore being twice suspended if he wins the special election. [[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/senate-special-election-primary-runoff-alabama)] * Senate Republicans don't have the votes for the Graham-Cassidy effort to repeal Obamacare to pass, but not to worry, because they'll be back at it again soon via the 2019 budget reconciliation process, and next time, they're going to be transparent, hold committee hearings, and even consult Democrats. [[CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/26/politics/health-care-republican-senate-vote/index.html)] * The Trump administration's Department of Homeland Security has refused to waive Jones Act shipping restrictions that are preventing Puerto Rico from getting the gasoline and supplies that are so desperately needed for the island's recovery efforts following Hurricane Maria. Senator John McCain is pissed, and says it's time to repeal the ""archaic and burdensome"" Act. [[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-maria-puertorico-shipping/u-s-denies-request-for-puerto-rico-shipping-waiver-idUSKCN1C12UI)] * Freedom hangs in the balance for Making a Murderer's Brendan Dassey, whose case was heard before the full Seventh Circuit yesterday. According to court watchers, the judges seemed split, and we can't help but to wonder what Judge Richard Posner would have thought. [[Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel](http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/crime/2017/09/26/u-s-appeals-court-today-weigh-brendan-dassey-conviction-making-murderer-case/702392001/)] * Irell & Manella's Andrei Iancu, President Trump's pick to lead the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, is awaiting confirmation. There's no better way to bide our time while we wait than to discuss the fact that he'd been pulling down a $4 million paycheck at the firm. We'll have more on this later. [[Am Law Daily](http://www.therecorder.com/id=1202798948598/How-Much-Did-PTO-Pick-Andrei-Iancu-Pull-In-at-Irell)] * ""How can you expect companies to do the right thing when you[r] agency has not?"" U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton is taking heat over the fact that his agency was hacked in 2016, but nothing was mentioned about it until last week. He's set a great example. [[Big Law Business](https://biglawbusiness.com/secs-clayton-criticized-by-both-parties-over-hack-response/)] * According to a recent study, no matter what women do, in most cases, they'll continue to earn less than men. The ban on asking employees about their salary history is doing nothing for women; in fact, they're being penalized for refusing to disclose their salaries, while men are being rewarded.

A Biglaw firms go, Choate Hall & Stewart is on the small side. The firm only has its Boston office, and about 200 attorney, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t getting on the associate raise train!

On Friday the firm announced raises for associates, counsel, staff scientists and patent agents. The associate/counsel raises are on the now familiar market scale:


While patent agents will receive an extra $7,500 in base compensation and staff scientist get an additional $5,000.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Plus there are the special summer bonuses to go around (patent agents and staff scientists will get $5,000):



To receive the special bonuses associates (and staff) have to be on track to bill 2,000 hours. However, if that don’t meet that threshold mid year they have the opportunity to make it up and receive the full special bonus at year end.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# This Biglaw Firm Should Do Associates A Favor And Announce Special Bonuses
## The firm's own associates think it would be a prudent move to help with retention.

According to Am Law 100, Shearman had the highest increase in revenue per lawyer last year, but Shearman never leads the market in announcing bonuses. I feel like Shearman could announce a special bonus first, to indicate to the market and its associates that it appreciates their value — as opposed to waiting weeks after.

— a midlevel associate at Shearman & Sterling, in response to a question found in the [American Lawyer Midlevel Associates Survey](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/08/03/the-2022-midlevel-associates-survey-quotable-associates/) about what their firm could do better in order to retain associates. More notable and quotable responses can be found [here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/08/03/the-2022-midlevel-associates-survey-quotable-associates/).

# Former Biglaw Partner Calls Trump 'Gravest Threat To American Democracy' -- And He Should Know Since He Helped Legitimize Trump

Ty Cobb

Former Biglaw partner [Ty Cobb](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/ty-cobb/) is back on the [cable news circuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/former-trump-lawyer-not-one-of-the-indicted-ones-on-how-the-former-presidents-latest-legal-strategy-could-backfire/) talking smack about Donald Trump. And honestly? You love to see it. Cobb — and his signature mustache — have a [folksy ](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/former-biglaw-partner-ty-cobb-declares-trumps-mugshot-looks-like-a-batman-villain/)way of [cutting through](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/former-trump-lawyer-not-one-of-the-indicted-ones-on-how-the-former-presidents-latest-legal-strategy-could-backfire/) the [right wing BS](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/former-biglaw-partner-ty-cobb-shows-utter-contempt-for-trumps-proposed-defense/) and shooting straight with audiences.

Last night Cobb was on CNN commenting on Trump’s argument in the D.C. Circuit claiming “absolute immunity.” And though it’s pretty clear the [judges were not receptive](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/01/trump-lawyers-magical-immunity-arguments-take-a-real-world-beating-at-dc-circuit/) to that line of argumentation, Cobb is still ringing the alarm, saying, “I think you have to take Trump seriously because he poses the gravest threat to American democracy that we’ve ever seen.”

He continued, comparing Trump to some pretty authoritarian rulers, “I think the lack of accountability which he desires, which Putin has, which the Ayatollah has, which Xi has… he may want an America like that.” And though he predicts Trump will lose “fast and forcefully,” he still depicts the argument as “very scary.”

While it’s nice to see Cobb speak out against Trump, let’s not forget he lent his own credibility to the former president. Cobb [left Biglaw ](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/the-incredible-growing-presidential-legal-team/)— Hogan Lovells to be precise — to work in Trump’s White House. There he was considered one of the few[ competent people](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/trump-contemplates-axing-ty-cobb-his-only-competent-attorney/) in Trump’s sphere, and brought that sheen of respectability to the whole affair. And though he ultimately yeeted out of[ that job](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/ty-cobb-out-emmet-flood-in-constitutional-crisis-looms/), the damage was already done.

# Spring Has Sprung, And So Has The Cash Compensation At This Top 50 Biglaw Firm
## Congratulations on your money!

Spring is officially here, and Biglaw salary increases keep budding up at firms across the country. There are just a few Am Law top 50 firms that have yet to match the new market salary scale (more on that to come), but one by one, slowly but surely, they’re making salary moves to remain viable as competition to attract and retain associates in this hot lateral market. Which firm is up next in this financial beauty pageant?

It’s Perkins Coie, a firm that brought in $1,001,498,000 gross revenue in 2020, which helped it to land at No. 42 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking. The Seattle-based firm let associates and counsel know on Friday that salary increases would soon be arriving soon. This is what the new salary scale looks like at the firm’s major-market offices:



Perkins Coie associates will see their raises reflected in their March paychecks, retroactive to January 1. Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Perkins Coie.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

Welcome to the party, [Fenwick & West!](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/fenwick-west/) Good to see you here. You are now a member of the elite compensation club, affectionately known as [“MoneyLaw”](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/what-firms-miss-the-moneylaw-cut/) around these parts. This evening — alright, afternoon for California people — the technology and life sciences firm announced that they will be meeting the scale set by Cravath earlier this week.

The raises are firm-wide, that’s right; folks in their China offices are also going to make bank. As you can see, Fenwick divides up the salary grades by tiers, rather than the typical class year, but the dollar amounts are those we’ve now become very familiar with:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Note that the compensation package is performance- and hours-based — associates have to be on the “1950-track” to qualify. The memo doesn’t specifically address the question of summer associates, but we understand they were provided with the [memo](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/that-180k-payday-is-spreading-on-the-west-coast/2/), so it seems likely they’ll benefit too.

Congrats, Fenwick associates!

We are covering this story as market conditions develop, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

(You can read the full Fenwick memo on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/that-180k-payday-is-spreading-on-the-west-coast/2/).)

# What The Hell Is Perkins Coie Doing?
## They can't announce raises because they're ""nuanced""?!? What does that mean?

The last time we checked in on Perkins Coie, they’d helped kick off a [much-needed salary war in the Northwest](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/10/which-firm-just-gave-its-first-years-a-20000-raise/). So when raises came rolling through the major markets, one might have expected Perkins Coie to be — well, if not “ready” then at least “unsurprised.”

And yet the firm seems as flat-footed as Dick Cheney on draft day.

Perkins Coie gets voicemail from managing partner. Some offices getting raises, but absolutely no detail because we’re more “nuanced” than other firms. Said that each office will have a meeting with their office managing partners next week. Doing their best to avoid Above The Law shaming by hiding information and only disseminating things locally.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As a fan of the word “nuance,” it’s a shame to see it coopted to mean “cheap.”

Perkins Coie remains [the top Am Law 100](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/the-firms-that-are-losing-the-battle-in-biglaws-salary-wars/) firm that hasn’t announced a salary adjustment, clocking in at 42nd this year and boasting a PPP of $1.10 million. However, averages can be deceiving… Perkins Coie’s partnership is noted for a [whopping 23 to 1](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/07/the-haves-and-the-have-mores-partner-pay-spreads-at-leading-law-firms/) differential, as of 2014, between the most compensated and least compensated partners. So there’s a lot of relatively cash-strapped partners out there who may not be eager to hand over their earnings in new raises.

In any event, we should be hearing Perkins Coie’s plan in the coming days. We’ll pass it along as soon as we see it…

Remember, when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Am Law 100 Firm Announces Attorney Layoffs And Furloughs
## The firm's austerity measures continue.

It’s become increasingly obvious that attorneys, despite the fancy (and expensive) degrees, are far from immune from the economic downturn brought on by COVID-19. Biglaw has been awash in cost-cutting measures designed to keep the firms afloat during these hard times. The latest example of that comes from Am Law 100 firm, Nixon Peabody.

The firm already [announced massive staff layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/massive-furloughs-hit-this-biglaw-firm/), and now lawyers are also seeing the axe. According to multiple tipsters at the firm, the firm is cutting 10 percent of non-partner attorneys, and tipsters report even senior associates were impacted. The cuts are divided by approximately 5 percent layoffs (with three months of health insurance) and 5 percent furloughs (presumably with full benefits).

Best of luck to those that suddenly find themselves without a paycheck in the middle of a pandemic/economic decline.

# Associates Billing Their Butts Off, Hoping For Last Year's Bountiful Bonuses
## Soon their bank accounts will be stuffed like Thanksgiving turkeys.

Could today be the day that kicks off the 2017 Biglaw bonus season? Based on your responses to our survey, the answer, unfortunately, is probably not. Only 5 percent of survey respondents thought this year’s Biglaw bonus bonanza would begin before Thanksgiving, as it did in 2014, when Simpson Thacher announced its bonuses [ahead of the holiday](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/bonus-season-comes-early-and-its-not-cravath/) (and perhaps even more notably, ahead of Cravath).

What will 2017 bonuses look like?

- No change from 2016 bonuses (72%, 634 Votes)
- Higher than 2016 bonuses (24%, 213 Votes)
- Lower than 2016 bonuses (4%, 32 Votes)
Total Voters: 879

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Based on past precedent, it seems much more likely that bonuses will be announced on either Monday, November 27, or Monday, December 4. Cravath tends to stick a schedule as far as these things are concerned, and in recent years, it has announced its bonus news on either the last Monday in November or the first Monday in December. Either way, Biglaw associates can soon look forward to their bank accounts being stuffed like the Thanksgiving turkeys they’ll gobble down later this week.

While associates are busy counting down the hours until B-Day, they’re likely even busier counting up the hours they’re on track to bill in 2017 to meet their targets for bonus eligibility. Last year, many firms announced increased billing requirements to go hand in hand with their increased salaries, and some associates continue to scramble to make up the difference. That being said, a whopping 70 percent of survey respondents are on track to bill 2000 hours or more in 2017.

Here are the full results from our survey:

How many hours are you on track to bill in 2017?

- More than 2400 (19%, 225 Votes)
- 2000 - 2099 (18%, 211 Votes)
- 2100 - 2199 (14%, 169 Votes)
- 2200 - 2299 (11%, 125 Votes)
- 1900 - 1999 (10%, 123 Votes)
- 1800 - 1899 (8%, 93 Votes)
- 2300 - 2399 (8%, 89 Votes)
- Fewer than 1600 (6%, 66 Votes)
- 1700 - 1799 (4%, 50 Votes)

Remember these strong numbers when bonuses begin to hit bank accounts. You may have worked your Biglaw bums off, but 72 percent of survey respondents thought that this year’s bonuses would be no different than last year’s bonuses. Keep this in mind: Instead of complaining, be thankful that your salary is larger than it ever was before and that you’re receiving very generous bonuses on top of it.

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks for your help.

Don’t forget, if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please enter your email address in the box below. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish — including, of course, the first such announcement.

Keep your fingers crossed for happy bonus news this season! Happy Thanksgiving!

# So Long As We're Buying Votes, Why Not Buy Them Effectively?
## Here are a couple of ideas that are quite bold, but might not seem quite so shady.

North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, the billionaire who’s now running in the Republican primaries for president, undeniably wants to be on the debate stage in August.  He’s offering a [$20 gift card to the first 50,000 people](https://radio.wpsu.org/2023-07-12/doug-burgum-is-offering-20-to-people-donating-1-to-his-campaign-is-that-legal) who donate $1 to his campaign.
That’s nearly an instantaneous 2,000% return on your investment. It’s a pretty good deal for folks like you and me, though I doubt Burgum got rich making offers like this.

This offer did, however, get me to thinking: The political parties are mired in tradition; tradition has limited their thought. The parties spend literally billions of dollars in presidential election cycles. (In 2020, it was over [$14 billion](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2021/02/2020-cycle-cost-14p4-billion-doubling-16/#:~:text=Political%20spending%20in%20the%202020,of%20Federal%20Election%20Commission%20filings) for all elections, combined.) That’s a lot of money, and the parties waste that money on things like polling, advertisements, rallies, and encouraging voter turnout.

How old-fashioned.

Finally, Burgum has moved the ball forward: Why not just buy votes? This might seem a little shady, but as long as the parties are spending this much to prompt each voter to act, why not forthrightly spend the money to buy the votes?

I have a couple of ideas that are almost as bold as Burgum’s, but might not seem quite so shady.

Why not fund a third-party candidate who would steal votes from your opponent, thus guaranteeing that your preferred candidate would win the election? For example, Ralph Nader, running as a third-party candidate, probably took enough votes from Al Gore to give Florida to George W. Bush in 2000. Jill Stein, running as a third-party candidate, may have taken enough votes from Hillary Clinton to give Pennsylvania to Donald Trump in 2016. Third-party candidates change elections. Let’s make this a feature, not a bug.

Some Republican PAC could give, say, $100 million to the third-party campaign of Cornel West, which would probably throw the 2024 election to Trump. Or the PAC could give $100 million to “No Labels,” and the campaign of, say, Joe Manchin could again give the election to Trump.

Of course there are two sides to that coin. Suppose that Trump is the Republican nominee for president.  Why don’t the Democrats entice Ron DeSantis, if he’s willing, or Chris Christie, to run as a third-party candidate, offering to contribute $150 million or $200 million to the campaign to get things rolling? That would be a much easier way to defeat Trump than just running more ads. (The Democrats basically legitimized this tactic in the most-recent election cycle, when Democratic-leaning organizations donated money to Republican election-deniers in the primaries to give Democrats easier opponents in the general election. I don’t see much difference between that shenanigans and mine.)

Better yet, let’s entice our side’s voters to move permanently to the swing states where their votes would make a difference. Democrats could, for example, identify committed Democrats who live in New York or California (which will be Democratic states even if they lose some Democratic support) and offer those voters $10,000 or $20,000 or $50,000 a head if the voters would agree to move permanently to Arizona or Georgia. Those states are often decided by very thin margins; move 20,000 Democrats to each, and you’d have purchased elections for the next few cycles.

The more I think about this, the more I like it! By moving just 100,000 people from lopsided Democratic states to key swing states, the Democrats could buy elections for a long time. Unlike get-out-the-vote drives, which influence only one campaign, my 100,000 voters who physically relocated to swing states would buy you the 2024 election, and the 2028 one, and probably 2032 to boot! If each side managed to raise (and spend) $7 billion in the 2020 election cycle, how much could they raise if they explained to contributors that they were buying not just the 2024 election, but also several more elections into the future?

The parties have been much too narrow in their political thinking. It’s time to broaden our thinking and realize how, with just a little creative thought, America could become corrupt right to its core.

# A Look At The Staggering Sexual Harassment Numbers In The Legal Profession
## These numbers should serve as a wake up call to the legal industry.

A new international survey reveals that sexual harassment in the legal profession is truly at epidemic proportions. The survey, with almost 7,000 respondents, was [conducted by the International Bar Association and market research company Acritas](https://www.ibanet.org/bullying-and-sexual-harassment.aspx) and asked both lawyers and nonlawyers in the legal profession from 135 countries questions about sexual harassment and bullying within the industry. The results are disheartening, to say the least.

Over a third of women — 36.6 percent of women and 7.4 percent of men — say they’ve been victims of sexual harassment. When in comes to bullying nearly 1 in 2 women say they’ve been a target, compared with 1 in 3 men who say the same.

Another [interesting aspect of the survey](https://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/1159613/the-legal-jobs-where-sexual-harassment-is-most-common) parsed out which jobs in the legal industry experiences the highest incidences of harassment. Surprisingly, those in government legal jobs reported the most harassment — 52.5 percent of women, and 18.2 percent of men reported they’d been sexually harassed at work.

There were also higher than average rates of harassment reported in the judiciary, but only by women — 46.6 percent of women in the judiciary reported harassment and 0 percent of men did. In-house legal departments also seem to have a disturbing amount of harassment, 42 percent of women and 9 percent of men said they’ve been sexually harassed in the workplace.

Law firms had the “best” numbers when it comes to sexual harassment — not that harassment at these levels is good. 32.7 percent of women and 6.7 percent of women at law firms reported they’ve been sexually harassed at work.

According to the survey, the most common forms of sexual harassment were: sexist comments, including inappropriate humor or jokes about sex or gender (67.9 percent); sexual or sexually suggestive comments, remarks or sounds (66.8 percent); being looked at in an inappropriate manner that made them feel uncomfortable (52.2 percent); and any inappropriate physical contact such as patting, pinching or brushing up against the body (48.6 percent). But even the less common forms still happen at a disturbing rate: sexual propositions, invitations or other pressure for sex (24 percent); seriously inappropriate physical contact, for example, kissing, fondling or groping (21.6 percent); receiving sexually explicit content or propositions via email or social media (13 percent); implicit or explicit demands for sexual favors in exchange for employment or promotion (6.7 percent); and physical assault or rape (3.1 percent).

These numbers should serve as a wake up call to the legal industry — we need to do better.

# Vault 100 Rankings: The Most Prestigious Law Firms In America (2021)
## For the first time in history, there's a new firm in the No. 2 spot.

What do associates at major law firms care about more than money? Prestige, of course. But, at the end of the day, sometimes being a leader when it comes to compensation is enough to boost a firm’s prestige. As luck would have it, the closely watched Vault 100 rankings are here to remind lawyers at the nation’s largest law firms about exactly which ones are considered the most prestigious.

In last year’s Vault 100 rankings, Cravath — the firm that matched [Milbank’s $190K associate salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) two summers ago with [over-the-top monetary compensation](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) for senior associates — managed to retain its number 1, with Wachtell Lipton clinging to its spot in second place, even though the firm had once dominated Vault’s top spot for more than a decade. Was Cravath able to keep its cachet as the most prestigious Biglaw firm in the country in the latest Vault rankings?

Obviously. Here’s what Mary Kate Sheridan, Vault’s senior law editor, [had to say](https://www.vault.com/blogs/vaults-law-blog-legal-careers-and-industry-news/introducing-vaults-2021-top-100-law-firms) about Cravath’s placement in the latest rankings: “Cravath is the undeniable leader in the legal field, as the top firm in our ranking for five years running and the only firm to achieve a prestige score above ‘9’ this year. Associates at peer firms recognize Cravath not only for how elite it is, but also for its consistent leadership when it comes to industry practices and standards, such as associate compensation and training.” Cravath keeps crushing it in every way imaginable. Way to go!

Although Cravath kept pace, this year, there was some historic drama when it came to the tippy top of the Top 10 in the latest edition of the Vault rankings. Without any further ado, here are the Top 10 Most Prestigious Law Firms based on Vault’s Annual Associate Survey for 2021:

For the first time in the history of the Vault rankings, Skadden has overtaken Wachtell for the No. 2 spot. (And it was just by a hair, as Skadden earned a score of 8.577, while Wachtell earned a score of 8.567, making Skadden 0.010 points more prestigious than Wachtell.) Associates at Skadden — a firm described by Vault respondents as “esteemed,” “excellent all around,” and “top of the field” — are sure to enjoy the schadenfreude of Wachtell’s fractional rankings tumble. Let’s see if Skadden is able to hold onto the silver medal next year.

Congratulations to all of the Biglaw firms that made the latest edition of the Vault 100 rankings. How did your firm do this time around? [Email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BLaw%20Firm%5D%20Vault%20Rankings), text us at (646) 820-8477, or tweet us [@atlblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog) to let us know how you feel.

# 3 Of My Favorite Things About The ACC Annual Meeting
## The networking with other in-house counsel is excellent. Almost everyone you meet is someone who uniquely understands your perspective and pain points.

Even though I have been in-house for over seven years, last week, I attended my first Association of Corporate Counsel Annual Meeting. I had always heard that it was a not-to-be-missed conference for in-house counsel, but as someone who is naturally skeptical, I felt the claim was suspect, despite how many in-house colleagues told me so. Now that I have attended, I can admit that my skepticism was misplaced. Although I am still recovering from the experience, I now understand its value.

Networking

First, the networking with other in-house counsel is excellent. Almost everyone you meet is someone who uniquely understands your perspective and pain points. While people may be at companies of different sizes and have responsibilities and experiences that also differ, they all intimately understand that the in-house counsel struggle is real. I loved how friendly and open everyone was. Admittedly, it was a bit overwhelming for this introvert, but the conference organizers created unique and fun opportunities to meet others and have authentic conversations.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Although I had to miss a speed networking opportunity that was intriguing at the very first day of the conference, I thought that it was a great opener because, through the experience, you would have had the opportunity to make connections early on, and you could find a “buddy” with whom to navigate the conference, if you wanted. It was also fun to meet people I have only met on LinkedIn in real life.

Lastly, every night, I was invited to happy hours, receptions, dinners and after parties by generous law firms and vendors. Having to choose where to go was also overwhelming — but admittedly, is a first-world problem. Confession: as a big nerd growing up, suddenly being “cool” and getting invited to everything was a bit disconcerting but definitely something I could get used to.

CLE

As someone who doesn’t need any continuing legal education until 2025, I don’t need any more CLE. But what I loved about the sessions at this conference was that the content was extremely relevant because it was planned, organized, and given mostly by in-house counsel just like me. Legal education aside, there were great sessions about career exploration and personal and professional development. A session — about being a law professor — that I was really interested in, I had to miss because of work. A session I attended and loved was how to read financial statements. I have never seen such unique offerings as the ones at this conference before.

Swag

Although I have recently embarked on a self-imposed journey of minimalism, this conference and all the generous vendors made it very difficult not to bring anything home. Some colleagues I met joked that attendees should bring an extra piece of luggage to tote all the goodies back home. Beyond the usual pens, hats, and notepads, I was especially tempted by a boot-shaped plastic beer stein that lit up, a light-up cowboy hat the kids would have loved (and fought over), a mini Yeti cooler, and a portable speaker. I am very pleased that the only thing I brought home was a small utility bag that I could wear across my shoulder and chest that was the perfect size for my essentials, especially because I don’t carry a purse.

If I had to choose, the one conference that is still the most valuable to me is the Littler Employer because I am an employment lawyer, but the Association of Corporate Counsel Annual Meeting is a close second. If you are in-house counsel, it is worth checking out, hopefully sooner than your seventh year as in-house counsel.

This is the third (and final) article of a three-article series on succession planning for law firms. In the first article, entitled [Succession Planning – Yuck](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/reinventing-the-law-business-succession-planning-yuck/), I pointed out that many firms started in the past twenty or thirty years – both within and without the legal world – are facing this situation, and it is not an easy one. In the [second article](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/reinventing-the-law-business-succession-planning-my-top-15-recommendations-items-1-7/), I gave roughly “half” of my advice (items 1-7) for effective and intelligent succession planning. In this final article, I give the remaining half of that advice (items 8-15).

To save you from having to refer back to the prior articles, I remind you that the original founder’s name is “Jane” and the new managing partner’s name is “Toby.” My advice continues as follows:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
- I would avoid the Peter Principle; namely, promoting someone to their level of incompetence. If this applies at the managing-partner level, the firm is likely in very serious trouble, as what can you really do about it once someone not competent for the office is ensconced therein? You know this when you see this. The suggestions I outlined in my previous article for long-term grooming can avoid this problem, as the proof of incompetence will be seen by Jane hopefully before it is too late.
- I would avoid promoting someone from the outside into a firm with a strong culture. I cannot say it would “never” work, but it is a poor risk/reward decision. One way or another, the culture likely just won’t accept it. People will feel that the new managing partner “is not one of us” (or similar emotions).
- Recognize that for the succession plan to work smoothly, Jane has to “let go” and not try to cling to things or undermine Toby. Jane has to really want a law firm that survives her and thrives after she leaves – or sticks around in a different capacity. Hopefully, Jane is the type of person who will take pride in that.
- Along the way, build future leaders beyond Toby. The firm is in a pickle due to the “Jane Dependence.” Don’t let that happen again and have “Toby Dependence.” Groom the next generation of future leaders early on. The odds are that they are already there among the more junior partners or even senior associates. Look for leadership and management skills and start grooming these future tigers very early.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
- Building on this, Jane does not need to leave. Jane can stick around at a different level, such as an advisor, industry thought leader, continuing rainmaker, and many other ways. She just has to resist the urge to “run things.” Some Janes will do this with ease and relief; others will have more problems with it. The strength of the relationship between Jane and Toby will often have some bearing on how this will work.
- I would push partners who are dependent upon Jane to build business of their own. This will change the dynamic of a firm dependent on one rainmaker and probably just a few clients to a law firm with a more diverse set of rainmakers and clients, which is a very healthy transition. This is no easy task, since these partners may be set in their ways and see themselves as “service partners.” This is just hard to do, but must be done even if the erstwhile “service partners” are upset at being shoved out of their comfort zones.
- Recognize that there will likely be a power vacuum when Jane moves onward – no matter what – so don’t pretend there isn’t. Embrace it honestly and openly and solicit input from others. Toby shouldn’t just walk around and pretend “hey – everything is just fine – don’t worry about a thing.” No one will believe that. Instead, Toby’s view should likely be more like “Jane’s shoes are big ones – we are all going to miss her – but we are not going to curl up in the fetal position and just lie there – I will be the new managing partner – I will need everyone here to step up and help me lead the firm to a very successful future – it won’t be the same as it was with Jane at the helm – but it is going to still be a great thing in a different way – I am excited about what we can accomplish and I am going to give it 1,000 percent – who’s with me??!!”
- Finally – this is not Jane’s problem and Toby’s problem – it is everyone’s problem. As I started this article, I will end it by saying that the firm has to be worth preserving in the first place. There has to be a reason for existence for the firm and, if so, all of the partners need to be eager to “step up” and to back Toby and to push the firm to the next level. Indeed, if the firm survives this critical transition point, the odds are that it will have staying power to last a long time indeed and accomplish many amazing things.
Lastly, opening the Duval & Stachenfeld kimono a bit, I admit we are confronting these issues at my firm. While I am “only” 58 years old, we have been talking about succession planning for the past few years and intend to make it a focus going forward in order to combat any potential issues arising from not having a clear succession plan. No one can predict the future, of course; however, we will control all of the variables we can control and hopefully create a succession plan that sets the Firm up for long-term success for decades to come.

# Back To Biglaw: Former BoA Vice Chair Returns From Whence He Came
## Gary Lynch is ready to practice law again.

Gary Lynch (via Association of Corporate Counsel)

Who says you can never go home again? Certainly not [the powers that be at Davis Polk](https://www.davispolk.com/news/gary-lynch-returns-davis-polk/), and especially not if the person doing the asking is former Bank of America general counsel and vice chairman Gary Lynch.

Lynch announced yesterday that he was returning to his former firm, where he was a partner from 1989 to 2001. Lynch retired from BoA last year, and took some time off before deciding to jump back to Biglaw. Now,[ as reported by](https://biglawbusiness.com/bank-of-americas-former-top-lawyer-leaves-retirement-for-davis-polk/) Big Law Business, he is ready to practice again at Davis Polk:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“I’ve practiced law for 43 years, so it’s something I think I know how to do, and I’m reasonably good at,” [Lynch] said. “So I got to the point where I thought maybe I should do it again, so here I am back at Davis Polk.”

Before joining Davis Polk — the first time around in 1989 — Lynch was the Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement director. And when he left the Biglaw firm it was to go in-house — first at Credit Suisse First Boston and then at Morgan Stanley, before landing at BoA in 2011.

Lynch’s tenure at BoA was marked by trying to get the bank out from under the legal mess left in the wake of the financial crisis:

“At that point, I thought was actually going to retire,” Lynch explained. “And basically the objective there was to help Bank of America get through the fallout from the mortgage crisis, and I accomplished that. It took several years longer than I thought it would.”

Lynch said the most challenging part of the job was responding to claims by the Department of Justice over the bank’s sale of residential mortgage-backed securities and its underwriting of mortgage loans, which it ultimately settled for $16.65 billion in 2014.

# The Benefits Of Establishing Trust And Building Influence
## Influence is a critical tool for leaders when implementing changes within an organization.

The benefits of establishing trust and building influence should be of paramount importance for any general counsel especially during times of great change.  Successfully implementing change can be a challenging process. Why is influence important in the change management process? Change often meets resistance from employees who are comfortable with the status quo. Influential leaders can persuade and motivate those employees to embrace the change by first explaining the benefits of change and addressing concerns. GCs who take the time and effort to establish trust and build influence within their organizations can be uniquely positioned to support the executive leadership during the change management process.

The GC Can Help Build Support

Influence helps garner support from key stakeholders, including senior leaders, middle managers, and front-line employees. When the GC supports the change, others in the organization may be more likely to follow suit.

The GC Can Help Communicate

As a lawyer, the GC is trained in the art of persuasion and is often a skilled communicator. The GC can convey the vision and objectives of the change initiative clearly and persuasively, ensuring that everyone understands the rationale behind it. The GC can also effectively convey the benefits of change to employees by highlighting how it will streamline processes, improve outcomes, and ensure compliance.

The GC Can Inspire Trust And Credibility

Influence is closely tied to trust and credibility. GCs who inspire trust and credibility are ones who are open and honest when communicating (to the extent possible). They create channels for employees to ask questions or seek clarification on legal issues. They address concerns promptly and clearly, even if it means admitting they don’t have all the answers. GCs who are trusted and credible may be helpful in gaining buy-in from employees during times of change.

The GC Can Facilitate Collaboration

Change often requires negotiation and collaboration with various departments and teams within an organization. Because the GC is often involved in facilitating discussions on a day-to-day basis, the GC is naturally suited for this role. When discussions become difficult, the GC can help bridge gaps and build consensus across the organization during times of change.

The GC Can Help Mitigate Fear And Uncertainty

Change often brings about fear and uncertainty. GCs who lead by example and promote a culture of ethical behavior throughout the organization are uniquely positioned to help alleviate the concerns that may come with change. When employees trust that the GC is committed to ensuring that the organization’s leadership is acting ethically and in the best interest of the organization and its constituents, the GC can help reduce fear and uncertainty of everyone involved in the process.

Influence is a critical tool for leaders when implementing changes within an organization. It enables them to guide, persuade, and inspire people to embrace and support the change, ultimately leading to successful outcomes and long-term organizational growth. Influence is not just about starting the change process. It is also about sustaining momentum. Influential leaders, including the GC, can keep employees engaged and committed throughout the entire change journey.

Leveraging your online presence to create influence is a great way to do this, and it involves building a strong and authentic personal brand, engaging with your audience, and strategically using various platforms to reach and impact your target audience. For many lawyers, LinkedIn has become the platform of choice.

# Trump Nominates Sullivan & Cromwell Partner To Lead SEC
## The president-elect really can't get enough of Biglaw partners.

Earlier today, we quipped that President-elect Donald Trump “can’t get enough of Biglaw partners” — and we really weren’t kidding. As we noted previously, partners from McGuireWoods, Morgan Lewis, Morrison & Foerster, Kirkland & Ellis, and Jones Day are present on his [Justice Department transition team](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/the-biglaw-attorneys-on-trumps-doj-transition-team/); a Jones Day partner will [serve as his White House counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/biglaw-partner-to-be-trump-administrations-white-house-counsel/); a Kasowitz Benson partner will serve as his [ambassador to Israel](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-israel-ambassador-david-friedman-232717); and a Skadden partner will [serve as U.S. trade representative](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/skadden-partner-tapped-for-key-trump-administration-trade-role/). Now, news has spread that Trump has selected yet another Biglaw partner to serve as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Which firm is grabbing the brass ring of a Trump administration appointment this time? Although it was [originally thought](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/morning-docket-12-07-16/) that [Debra Wong Yang](http://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyers/dwongyang) of Gibson Dunn would take over for Mary Jo White at the helm of the SEC,[[1]](#f1) the honor will be going to [Walter “Jay” Clayton](https://www.sullcrom.com/lawyers/Jay-Clayton) of Sullivan & Cromwell, whose practice specialty involves advising clients on public and private mergers and acquisitions and capital-raising efforts.


Jay Clayton

According to his firm profile, Clayton, a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania Law School, has represented high-profile clients like Goldman Sachs, Barclays Capital, Alibaba, and Och-Ziff Capital, just to name a few. Why would Trump select Clayton for this role? According to a report from [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-sec-idUSKBN14N1Y9), the president-elect may be signaling that the SEC will “scale back regulations that some critics see as burdensome and may be hindering corporate growth.” In fact, Trump said as much himself in a statement earlier this afternoon:

“Jay Clayton is a highly talented expert on many aspects of financial and regulatory law, and he will ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time,” Trump in a statement.

“We need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers.”

Congratulations to Jay Clayton on his new role. We’d wish him luck in his Senate confirmation hearings, but we don’t think he’s going to have much of an issue.

[[1]](#reff1) It’s worth noting that even when choosing between two elites, President-elect Trump goes for the white male. Yang is a Chinese-American woman.

Simon Malko

Over the course of 2023, law firms across the country have been launching new offices and recruiting new lawyers to staff them, all in the hope of expanding their practices across different regions and growing their client rosters. On the flip side of the coin, other firms are still trying their best to achieve growth, not by opening new offices, but by enhancing what they already have. Are there any firms that have achieved success by using this kind of a model?

I recently had the pleasure of chatting with [Simon Malko](https://www.mmmlaw.com/people/simon-malko/), managing partner of Morris Manning & Martin, a well-regarded Am Law 200 firm, to get his thoughts on the matter. Here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our lively conversation on how law firms can focus on opportunities for growth and innovation by building upon the positive outcomes they already have.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Staci Zaretsky (SZ): This year, many law firms have been growing their headcount by opening new offices and recruiting new lawyers. With just four offices, your firm has taken a different path. Tell us a little more about what Morris Manning & Martin has done to expand its reach.

Simon Malko (SM): Our firm’s reach has always extended far beyond our geographic locations. We handle litigation and transactional matters throughout the United States, and our International Trade practice, for example, has global reach, representing clients across the Americas, Europe, and Asia. In a post-pandemic world, we have found it is easier to expand our reach without opening additional “brick–and–mortar” offices, as clients are much less focused on a firm’s physical location.  

Our strategy has been to grow and enhance our existing offices, particularly in Atlanta and Washington, D.C., by expanding our depth in core practice areas and enhancing them with new areas of expertise. This year alone, we’ve launched new tax controversy, ADR, LGBTQ, and sports and entertainment practices.

SZ: Last year, Morris Manning added the most new partners in its history. How has this helped the firm enhance its core practice areas?

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
SM: Our approach is to provide excellence in the practice areas for which we are recognized, including litigation, real estate, and technology, and our large 2023 partner class illustrates our commitment to those practice areas by providing additional bench strength.

Our location has also made it easier for us to recruit quality talent. Atlanta has really become a destination city for both employers and employees. More companies are opening their doors or expanding their footprint in the Southeast, which gives us more opportunity to hire strong leaders to support the additional work.

Finally, we have always been committed to providing our associates with advancement opportunities and a clear path to partnership. We were thrilled to recognize so many talented associates this year and grow the firm’s leadership organically from within the firm.

SZ: Your firm has been named as a regional powerhouse in Georgia. What are your plans for deepening your bench in Atlanta, your largest office?

SM: Atlanta has been our home for nearly 50 years. We have grown from 10 employees to over 400, and we plan to expand our existing national and international practice by continuing to grow our Atlanta office. We are exploring all of our options to make that happen, especially as our current lease expires in mid-2026.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
We know that in order to make “return to office” attractive, the office needs to be a destination where attorneys want to come to collaborate. We believe the timing of our next lease is optimal because we can tailor our next office environment to the demands of the post-pandemic world. Regardless of where we land, we will continue to offer the resources that have really resonated with employees this year, including an on-site therapist for employees seeking mental support. Resources like that are what really matter, and they set us apart.

SZ: Size matters when it comes to law firms, and Morris Manning has achieved great success by staying “small” while thinking big. What are your next steps to keep your great progress going?

SM: We will continue to focus primarily on the core practices for which we are recognized. We are not trying to provide all things to all clients. By continuing to play to our strengths, we can continue to be extremely competitive against significantly larger firms. We may not offer as many practice areas as an Am Law 50 firm, but we have the talent and the bench strength to compete against any firm in those practice areas for which we are recognized.

On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, we’d like to thank Simon Malko of Morris Manning & Martin for taking the time to help answer some pressing questions on how law firms can achieve growth by enhancing their existing offerings.

Money, money, money: It’s something Biglaw associates love to hear good news about, especially when more of it is about to land in their bank accounts for all of their hard work during the pandemic. Dozens of firms have already offered special bonuses to their associates and counsel, and one more firm recently joined in the bonus craze.

McDermott Will & Emery — a firm that brought in $1,172,114,000 gross revenue in 2019, putting it in 30th place in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — emailed attorneys to share the wealth yesterday afternoon. The firm is matching the Davis Polk scale. Here’s what that looks like at MWE (full memo on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/mwe-special-bonus-2021/2/)):

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Associates at the firm are expected be on track to meet a threshold of 1850 annualized client-billable hours to receive these bonuses, which are payable in late June and late October. Additional details, like whether catch-up payments are available if associates miss the mark for the June payment, will be announced later this week. Congratulations to everyone at McDermott!

(Flip to the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/mwe-special-bonus-2021//2/) to see the full memo from McDermott Will & Emery.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks for all of your help!

# Biglaw Firm Announces Raises To Align With Market
## Raises are running rampant through Biglaw.

If you want to prove to associates that they are well and truly valued — a necessity, given the white-hot lateral market — Biglaw firms know they’re going to have to pony up the top-of-market salary scale.

The latest firm to announce raises is Katten Muchin Rosenman. With profits per equity partner that top $1.9M, and an Am Law 100 ranking of 67, the match of the top of Biglaw scale isn’t much of a surprise.

The scale that Katten announced is as follows:



As you can see there’s a bit of compression at the top. The [Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cravath-raises-22/) guarantees $415,000 for the class of 2014, while others are promising $425,000 for the class of 2013. However, Katten’s memo specifies that counsel’s compensation will be individualized. So it may well be that the bulk of those classes fall off the grid and into the murky waters if individualized compensation.

The increases are retroactive to January 1 and will hit associates’ bank accounts with their April 1 paycheck. You can read the [full memo on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/katten-raises-22/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

As you surely know by now, the lateral market has been exceptionally hot in 2021. From record signing bonuses to flexible work arrangements, law firms are offering unprecedented carrots in the battle for associate talent. It’s undoubtedly a great year to make a lateral move.

But one side effect of the rapidly shifting market has been a cascade of misleading rumors. Many candidates are entering the process with unrealistic expectations, failing to appreciate that the factors shaping the terms of a lateral offer are multifaceted and individualized. In addition, the focus on flashy inducements like signing bonuses is leading some candidates to pursue opportunities at firms that may be a poor long-term fit.

Rumor mill: signing bonuses, practice group retooling, remote work

In our experience at Lateral Link, rumors about signing bonuses, practice group retooling, and remote work opportunities are especially widespread. Let’s address those topics in turn.

When it comes to signing bonuses, everyone has a story about an eye-popping figure that some lateral associate achieved. But even assuming the number being bandied about is accurate, it’s essential to place it in a broader context. The bonus offered to a particular candidate depends on several factors, including practice area, location, and personal compatibility with interviewers. Candidates sometimes interpret a signing bonus as a judgment on their intrinsic worth, but that’s not how firms determine the number. Signing bonuses are driven primarily by the firm’s idiosyncratic needs, not the candidate’s credentials. For example, where a firm is seeking to fill slots in a particular office and needs lateral candidates willing to move from outside the region, there is greater leeway for an outsized signing bonus. The bonus that a firm offers a fourth-year M&A associate to join its Boston office is not necessarily transferable to a fourth-year lateral joining the same practice in New York. 

Similarly, you should not presume that a firm’s past decision to hire a particular lateral associate to retool into a new practice area is predictive of future offers. Firms’ willingness to facilitate retooling is driven by specific practice area and location needs. The more liquid the local market in the relevant practice area, the easier it is to hire an associate who already has the skills, and the less likely the firm is to consider a candidate who needs to retool. For that reason, you are more likely to find retooling opportunities in Boston or Austin than in New York or Los Angeles.

Unfounded rumors about remote work opportunities are especially common, driven by the fact that permission to work remotely is often partner dependent. The fact that one associate succeeded or failed in negotiating a flexible arrangement when joining a firm tells you little about the prospects for a different candidate who would be working with different partners. It’s also worth noting that a candidate’s leverage to negotiate more flexible terms may improve based on strong interview performance.

Don’t lose focus on the long term

The excitement around bonuses and other carrots can cause candidates to lose sight of what should be the primary goal of the lateral process: finding an opportunity that sets you up for long-term professional success. As great as it feels to negotiate a lucrative signing bonus, don’t let a one-time payment dictate your decision. If the firm offering the largest bonus is a poor fit for your culture preferences or career goals, you should turn it down.

At the outset of the lateral process, think carefully about why you are seeking to switch firms and how the next step fits into your broader career plans. Having that clarity of vision upfront will help you make a smarter choice when the numbers are in front of you. As you go through the process, keep an open mind. Don’t talk yourself out of opportunities before you’ve explored them properly — especially if your initial assessment has been shaped by rumors. And assuming you’re working with a good recruiter, trust the information they give you. The market changes from week to week and month to month: you can be assured that a plugged-in recruiter will have more reliable, more current information than the rumor mill.

# Biglaw Firm Announces Layoffs And Job Cuts Among Lawyers, Staff
## These layoffs are meant to ‘streamline’ the firm’s operations.

Layoffs continue to roll through Biglaw this summer, with job cut announcements popping up almost every week. Unfortunately, news like this may not be coming to an end anytime soon.

The leaders of Armstrong Teasdale — a firm that brought in $197,300,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 167 on the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — just announced that it would be conducting layoffs among its staff while parting ways with lawyers. It seems that about 6% of the firm’s staff will be affected by these cuts, while almost 3% of the firm’s attorneys will be let go.

In a statement offered to Above the Law, [Patrick Rasche](https://www.armstrongteasdale.com/patrick-rasche/), the firm’s managing partner, said that 24 staff roles had been eliminated, but that “[t]his difficult decision allows us to streamline the Firm’s operational structure for better integration, improve efficiency in the provision of services, and ensure our ability to continue to exceed our clients’ expectations.”

On top of that, Rasche noted that 11 lawyers had been dismissed following “a review of productivity and performance.” (Gee, this method of slashing lawyer head count sounds [awfully familiar](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/stealth-layoffs/).)

These layoffs and job cuts come to Armstrong Teasdale in the wake of a 16.7% decrease in net income, despite an 11.7% increase in gross revenue. This, coupled with a 14.4% dip in its profits per equity partner, was likely a recipe for trimming the firm’s ranks.

“We recognize that these decisions affect people who have been an important part of the Armstrong Teasdale team,” Rasche said. “We thank them for their service and have communicated ways that we will support their transition out of the Firm.”

Best of luck to those who are being let go from Armstrong Teasdale.

# Do You Have A Mentor? Do You Want One?
## Law schools and law firms invest a lot of blood and treasure in recruitment, but how are they doing on mentoring?

Back in the day, the only way you could become a lawyer was by first becoming a lawyer’s [apprentice](http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/07/31/do-it-yourself-lawyers/apprenticeship-should-be-an-option-instead-of-law-school). It was a glorious time when the old would teach the young until the young were strong enough to throw the masters into the reactor core.

Now, some lawyers are lucky if they have a “mentor” who will show them how the phones work. Law schools and law firms invest a lot of blood and treasure in recruitment, but how are they doing on mentoring? Once you are in the door, who is around to help you find your way about the room?

[Please take this reader survey](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8uhPH7DsZSVSFCJ). We’re going to use some of the results for our panel at the annual [NALP conference in Boston](http://www.nalp.org/boston2016).

# Apple Porn Guy Wants To Marry His Porn-Filled Computer
## Chris Sevier is back at it, now he's trying to use his addiction to computer porn to keep gay people from getting married. And if that doesn't make sense, you should try reading his motion.

Our old friend Chris Sevier is back and wackier than ever. Sevier, you may recall, is the lawyer (or at least Vandy law grad) [who filed suit against Apple](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/07/lawyer-apple-should-protect-me-from-my-porn-addiction/) for building a computer that let him get addicted to porn so very easily. The complaint was 50 pages long and riddled with tirades and typos. It was all good fun. In the end, the remedy Sevier sought was basically a nanny state — a hot nanny state, with a schoolgirl uniform and daddy issues.

Anyway, with marriage equality cases bubbling up across the country, it was only a matter of time before Sevier said, “Hey, I’m litigious and enjoy drafting frivolous filings about sex stuff!” And with that, he filed to intervene in Florida’s ongoing marriage equality case on the compelling argument that his rights needed to be heard.

Specifically, his right to marry the love of his life: his computer.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
I’m assuming if the Florida judge allowed that, Sevier’s wedding would have to feature a toast by Apple telling everyone how the couple met.

Well, we have Sevier’s latest tour de force. Let’s take a look….


Judge Robert Hinkle has [put the kibosh](http://gawker.com/florida-wont-let-this-guy-marry-his-laptop-full-of-porn-1572004058) on Sevier’s efforts to fight for the rights of everyone to marry their computers (I mean, the State of New York lets you marry [realistic holograms](http://archer.wikia.com/wiki/Krieger's_Virtual_Girlfriend)). But that shouldn’t stop us from marveling at the mockery of the legal system that is this filing.

Sevier wants in the gay marriage debate because, he argues, other classes of sexual orientation are being left out:

Respectfully, I am here to, in effect, make the Federal Court’s “put up or shut up” about expansion of the equal protection clause to include “sexual orientation.” “Sexual orientation” classification has never existed, until President Obama said that it does in advancing his social agenda to make America a “gay nation.” Ever since one state in the union legalized “same-sex marriage,” a proverbial “crack in the damn” has been created, so that now all states are forced to, despite the majority’s decision to band same-sex marriage. Now proponents of same sex marriage have mobilized in multiple states — acting in concert — to force down their will down the throats of the voting majority so they can feel less ashamed of their life-style.

First of all, it’s good to see that his rage with Apple still extends to not investing in a spelling and grammar check. That means typos abound. Especially when your addiction forces you to draft all your documents one-handed. Second, gays are forcing their will down our throats. Oh! I get it.

Make no mistake, despite providing 16 detailed instances of people marrying inanimate objects — most of which I presume are mischaracterized — Sevier isn’t really interested in marrying his computer as much as he’s interested in using his microcelebrity to parrot the tired bulls**t we all pay Rick Santorum to spout. Because remember, Chris Sevier [loves him some Duck Dynasty](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/12/apple-porn-guy-sues-obama-for-firing-duck-dynasty-guy/).

Who is to say that a person cannot “love” their dog more than one of the Plaintiffs “loves” a member of the same-sex? If the Plaintiffs can marry a person of the same sex, then others should have the right to marry their dog, pillow, blowup doll, computer, and any other object they can have sex with and want to marry.

I suppose it’s thinking “love” is a two-way street and in the latter case there’s another human being involved in making a consensual decision. There’s pretty good traction on that slippery slope.

Or maybe not. Because Sevier drops some science about just how “real” those gay relationships are:

Proponents of gay behavior had made the choice to have sex with members of the same sex, and due to the straight forward science of dopamine, they have become bonded together with a person of the same sex upon repeated orgasm, naturally developing a preference that they argue is worth having state recognition and ratification.

Thankfully, Judge Hinkle offered a concise take on the motion:

Chris Sevier has moved to intervene, apparently asserting he wishes to marry his computer. Perhaps the motion is satirical. Or perhaps it is only removed from reality. Either way, the motion has no place in this lawsuit.

And then suggested that Sevier got very, very close to contempt for trying to pass himself off as speaking for the actual Plaintiffs when he filed another document that Judge Hinkle has blocked. Sevier needs to be careful.

Florida prisons have notoriously bad Wifi.

Sevier’s complete motion, in all its insane and typo-filled glory, is available on the next page. In particular, enjoy all 16 tales of non-traditional marriage that Sevier cobbled together.

Judge Hinkle’s order denying Sevier’s motion is also available….

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Donald Trump Super PAC Spent Almost $2M On Biglaw Firms In First Half Of 2023
## Notably, he wasn't spending his own money here.

On the plus side, firms actually get PAID when Donald Trump pays attorneys from his Super PAC. Trump notoriously [stiffs his attorneys](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/trump-stiffs-rudy-for-all-his-amazing-legal-services/) when paying out of pocket, but doesn’t have a problem paying from his fundraising outfit, flush with donations from gullible voters who simultaneously see him as an impossibly rich businessman AND someone who desperately needs their $50 donation.

The downside is that everyone gets to see exactly which firms continue to do business with the toxic tinpot former president.

Former Florida AG candidate Daniel Uhlfelder dug through the FEC reports so you don’t have to and uncovered all the firms [that billed Trump over the first half of last year](https://twitter.com/DWUhlfelderLaw/status/1748826692024467469?s=20).



Uhlfelder’s full post is embedded below, but let’s consider a few of the highlights revealed in the nearly $19 million of legal bills Trump paid out of campaign coffers over the first half of the year.

HABBA MADAIO & ASSOCIATES LLP – $1,503,915.14

The parking garage lawyer may be [botching courtroom procedure](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/01/donald-trumps-lawyer-keeps-botching-basic-trial-procedure-dont-grow-up-to-be-alina/) and [collecting disturbing ethical allegations](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/alina-habba-you-got-some-splainin-to-do/), but her haul proves that being [prettier than she is smart](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/alina-habba-trump-lawyer-court-b2481296.html) pays off.

BINNALL LAW GROUP – $1,031,788.33

Jesse Binnall, a veteran of Sidney Powell’s “Kraken” team that endeavored to overturn the election and only managed to rack up sanctions, scored a cool million as well for his team’s work on such masterpieces as the RICO LOLsuit — [as Liz Dye would say](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/trump-on-the-hunt-for-a-florida-attorney-willing-to-light-their-career-on-fire-in-miami-tomorrow/) — that accused every Democrat in the world of running a criminal conspiracy against Trump when the firm isn’t busy [defending law professors who admit to sleeping with their students](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/law-professor-who-slept-with-1ls-now-seeks-piece-of-ass-law/).

The other usual suspects are in there too — Todd Blanche, Chris Kise, John Lauro, etc. — but the most interesting entries are the Biglaw firms still inviting this public relations nightmare under their roofs.

CADWALADER, WICKERSHAM, & TAFT LLP – $344,950.21

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Blanche used to work at Cadwalader before striking out on his own, presumably because the firm weighed the projected fees against the reputational risk of keeping their name on the arguments Trump’s making.

BALLARD SPAHR LLP – $109,174.55

[Ballard Spahr is constantly at odds with Trump](https://www.ballardspahr.com/insights/news/2020/08/trump-nda-put-staff-at-intolerable-risk-press-group-says) so this may be some sort of attorneys’ fees award.

MINTZ, LEVIN, COHN, FERRIS, GLOVSKY AND POPEO, P.C.- $269,424.39

Trump’s organization paid Mintz legal bills in the past for the firm’s work on behalf of his flunkies. Not sure what this one was for.

SQUIRE PATTON BOGGS (US) LLP – $193,750

Trump paid Squire Patton Boggs [to represent former speechwriters in 2022](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/21/politics/trump-leadership-pac-legal-services-2022/index.html).

But the biggest Biglaw haul belongs to…

KELLOGG, HANSEN, TODD, FIGEL & FREDERICK PLLC – $1,042,479

Kellogg [represented Ivanka](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zacheverson/2023/04/26/ivanka-trump-ditches-attorneys-in-fraud-suit-splitting-from-don-jr-and-eric/?sh=3050932f256b) in the NY fraud case before getting replaced by Troutman Pepper. How that would become an expense for his Super PAC is a mystery.

All of this feels improper, given that campaign finance laws ban using donor money for lawyers when the cases do not relate to either campaign or officeholder duties, which a daughter’s role in a civil fraud case over the candidate’s private business would certainly not meet. On the other hand, the [Federal Election Commission has ruled that the ban does not apply to leadership PACs](https://campaignlegal.org/update/fec-waves-white-flag-yet-another-issue-leadership-pac-abuse) so… flame on!

Congratulations, donors! You made all this possible.

UPDATE: There are even more firms in here, including Greenburg Traurig, who represented a bunch of witnesses and Trump co-defendants. Those totals are included below too.

FEC records show that between January 1, 2023, and June 30, 2023, Donald Trump's Super PAC, SAVE AMERICA, made payments to the following law firms in these amounts:
BALLARD SPAHR LLP – $109,174.55

BEDELL, DITTMAR, DEVAULT, PILLANS & COXE, P.A. – $351,040.77

# Law School Rankings Show Which Schools Offer Best Deal

The latest edition of the [ATL Top 50 Law Schools ranking](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/the-2022-atl-top-50-law-school-rankings-are-here/) is out and provides some interesting insights into legal education. As the ATL system privileges “outputs” by focusing on job placement and costs rather than incoming student GPAs and LSAT scores, the ranking gives prospective students a look at the best bang for their tuition buck and gives law schools a great way to game the system: be cheaper and get your grads jobs that will let them pay off debt. We talk about the rankings and some curious schools dropping down the list. We also discuss associate resistance to the “3-day in-person work week” model. It seems as though lawyers [don’t want to return to the office at all](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/ropes-three-days-a-week/) and that might not be in their best interest.

# Simpson Thacher's Bold Plan For Summer Associates
## The firm wants law school students to give back.

Nothing about this year’s class of Biglaw summer associates (SAs) is going to be typical. Whatever preconceived notions you have about the summer party before the work of Biglaw starts, throw them out the window. The coronavirus’s impact on summer programs has been varied — from cancellation, to shortened programs, to online only. But even among the different options we’re seeing in Biglaw, the summer associate plan at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett is the most unique.

The program starts with fairly typical moves — it will be a shortened (five weeks), online-only program running from July 13 through August 14. For that work, SAs will take home eight weeks’ worth of pay. But SAs at Simpson will have the opportunity to earn even more — an additional $7,500 stipend — if they complete community service work. And as has been [reported](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/05/08/simpson-thacher-says-summer-associates-can-earn-more-money-though-giving-back/), the firm revealed this an email to SAs:

“We are incorporating a focus on giving back into our 2020 summer associate program,” the email said. “The combination of 8 weeks’ salary and the $7,500 stipend will result in total compensation of slightly more than 10 weeks of summer associate pay, which is the average duration of our traditional summer program.”

Though some of the details of the community service (like how many hours SAs must volunteer) have yet to be disclosed, actual legal work isn’t required. This distinction sets the Simpson program apart from others like Milbank, Cahill, and Wilson Sonsini which encourage pro bono legal work. The firm has designed the program to encourage community outreach and a wide variety of activities will count toward fulfilling the obligation:

The firm said the services don’t need to be legal in nature and could range from organizing food drives or safely helping the elderly with shopping, leading nonpartisan voter registration initiatives, continuing to help a client from a law school clinic, assisting a nonprofit or small business with Paycheck Protection Program paperwork, “or otherwise identifying a need in whatever community you are living in this summer and developing a way to meet it.”

“Now more than ever, we are in this together, and our approach to community outreach is designed to reflect that,” the email said.

The firm also noted they anticipate “providing full-time offers in the normal course, just as we have done historically, upon the successful completion of our program.”

# Associate Bonus Watch: The First Cravath Matches
## These two firms were the first matchers last year as well.

That didn’t take long. Cravath Swaine & Moore [announced bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2016-associate-bonuses/) shortly before 3 p.m. (EST), and now, less than three hours later, we have two top Biglaw firms matching the CSM scale.

Interestingly enough, they’re the two firms that matched first last year. In 2015, [Milbank Tweed](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-the-first-cravath-match-wow-that-was-fast/) matched Cravath in half an hour, and less than three hours later, we had a match from [Paul, Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-a-second-firm-falls-in-line/).

In 2016, the two firms have switched places. The bonus memo of Paul, Weiss went out shortly after 4:30 p.m., while the bonus memo of Milbank went out shortly before 5:30 p.m.

Flip to the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-the-first-cravath-matches/2/) to see both bonus memos. The Paul, Weiss bonuses will be paid on December 23; the Milbank bonuses will be paid on December 30. These dates are slightly later than the Cravath payout date of December 16, which might be annoying from a holiday shopping perspective, but it’s not a huge difference.

Congratulations, Milbank and PW associates, on the nice year-end bonuses!

Remember: as soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. You can also text us if you prefer, at 646-820-8477.

If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

UPDATE (5:54 p.m.): In 2015, Milbank announced that bonuses would be paid “on or before [January 15, 2016](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-the-first-cravath-match-wow-that-was-fast/2/),” so a December 30 pay date is an improvement. [Actually, see the 6:32 p.m. update below — Milbank paid in December last year.] Paul, Weiss paid its 2015 bonuses on [December 18](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-a-second-firm-falls-in-line/2/), so December 23 is later, but only slightly.

UPDATE (6:02 p.m.): From a PW source:

- “Unsurprised but pleased. The firm has made clear that it is devoted to paying top of the market, so anything other than this would have been a huge shock.”
And from Milbank sources:

- “Totally as expected. Never really any doubt in my mind that a market leader would came back with the same bonuses as las year and that Milbank would quickly match.”
- “Everyone expected bonuses to stay flat and people are generally pleased with the announcement, but there certainly was a sense of false hope that one of the leaders would raise and as always, Milbank would follow.”
- “Very happy. The firm is having a strong year all around. It’s nice to work at a Biglaw shop that makes an affirmative effort to ensure its associates always know they will match market without drama or fine print.”

UPDATE (6:32 p.m.) We have been advised that despite announcing a January 2016 payday for its 2015 bonuses, Milbank actually paid them at the end of December 2015 (as communicated to associates in an email from the Executive Committee sent on December 18, 2015, which we have reviewed).

# Biglaw Firm Restores Pay Cuts -- Retroactively
## For most of the firm's attorneys, there are no more salary cuts.

Good news for associates at Hogan Lovells — a firm that took in $2,246,050,000 in gross revenue last year, making an impressive [8th on the latest Am Law 100 ranking](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/04/21/the-2020-am-law-100-ranked-by-gross-revenue/#) — the COVID-19 salary cuts are a thing of the past.

[Back in May](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/holove-cuts/), the Hogan Lovells announced a pu pu platter of salary cuts. Equity partners’ monthly draws were slashed by 15 to 25 percent, and they also deferred the payment of profits. Nonequity partners and highly compensated senior counsel and specialists got a 15 percent cut. While the rest of the counsel, associates, attorneys, specialists and knowledge lawyers saw a 10 percent cut.

Now, thanks to a “solid performance” over the summer, HoLove is reversing most of those salary cuts — and making the change retroactive to May, meaning a tidy little make-whole payment is on its way. So who is lucky enough to benefit from this retroactive salary change? Associates, counsel, attorneys, specialists, and knowledge lawyers in the U.S., Mexico and Brazil. As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2020/09/04/hogan-lovells-makes-some-lawyers-whole-restoring-pay-retroactive-to-june/) Law.com, for the Asia-Pacific region, Dubai and the U.K., the salary reviews postponed from May will be scheduled, and any payments will be retroactive. As for 2020 bonuses, they’ll be made in the “normal course of business, applying the normal standards.”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Not everyone is seeing the benefits of the firm’s performance gains right away. Equity partners are still going to have draws and bonus payments reduced through 2020. And the cuts for nonequity partners and senior counsel will be reviewed later this year.

Hogan Lovells CEO Miguel Zaldivar made the following statement on the salary reversal:

Having looked carefully at our work over the summer, we have seen a solid performance and now is the time to start a step-by-step approach to reverse some of the prudent measures we implemented earlier this year around compensation. This is a strong testament to the work which we have all been doing under very challenging conditions and we are looking towards a continued solid performance through to the end of the year.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries or restoring previous cuts, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# Biglaw Firm Knows How To Keep Associates Happy (It's Cash)

The wave of raise and bonus news continues to crash through Biglaw. Yesterday, Texas firm Vinson & Elkins announced their own set of compensation bumps — in line with the market standard set by Cravath.

Last year, the firm made $934,700,000 in gross revenue making it 57th in the country. And the firm is using that cash to keep associates happy. A tipster at the firm noted how pleased they are at the firm’s willingness to keep up with the very top of Biglaw, saying, “Continue to love that V&E doesn’t play games with comp. They also lowered the bonus hours requirement this year to 1900 hours (which can include 100 hours pro bono).”

The new compensation grid at this firm is as follows, effective January 1:

Class Year	2024 Base Salary
2023	$225,000
2022	$235,000
2021	$260,000
2020	$310,000
2019	$365,000
2018	$390,000
2017	$420,000
2016+	$435,000
The firm also took this opportunity to announce their year-end bonus scale.

Class Year	2023 Base Market Bonus
2023	$15,000 (prorated)
2022	$20,000
2021	$30,000
2020	$57,500
2019	$75,000
2018	$90,000
2017	$105,000
2016+	$115,000
There are also supplemental, above-market bonuses available for high performers. All bonuses will be processed with the firm’s January 31 payroll.

The full memo is available on the [next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/vinson-compensation-23/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Bankruptcy is a very diverse practice area so there is no typical day. Each bankruptcy case presents different challenges and tasks, which are heavily impacted by whether an attorney represents the debtor or a creditor, and among creditors, whether the attorney represents those holding secured, unsecured or priority claims. The age of a case also dictates an attorney’s activities. Newer cases may require more attention than cases that were filed months or even years earlier.

Generally, a junior bankruptcy associate will:

- Prepare and review court filings (petitions, statements of financial affairs, schedules of assets and liabilities, and all types of motions such as use of cash collateral and relief from the automatic stay).
- Draft responses to motions and other filings.
- With guidance from a senior associate or partner, participate in telephone conferences with the client and adversary to discuss pending motions and other requests for relief in an effort to amicably resolve disputes.
- Engage in discovery in a contested matter or adversary proceeding.
- Strategize with co-counsel or colleagues on seeking relief, opposing relief, coordinating discovery, or oral argument on a motion seeking relief.
- Be called upon to do other tasks as dictated by the case.
- Who do you work with?

Junior associates primarily work with senior associates. In some smaller firms, a junior associate may work directly with a partner. For large cases, the bankruptcy department may set up a team comprised of junior- and senior-level associates and partners. As associates grow more senior, their responsibilities increase and they have more direct contact with clients and adversaries. In bankruptcy, depending on the client, adversaries may include the debtor; creditors’ committee; secured, unsecured or priority creditors; the United States Trustee; and other parties in interest that may oppose the relief sought on behalf of the client or are seeking relief to which the client objected.

Bankruptcy attorneys generally confer with financial advisors and accountants representing clients and adversaries. Other non-lawyer professionals with whom a bankruptcy attorney may work include appraisers, auctioneers and trustees. In addition, bankruptcy attorneys may work with other attorneys in the firm specializing in different practice areas.

- What does a common career path look like?
The career path for a bankruptcy attorney is no different than that for any other law firm attorney. Typically large law firms have a two-track system for advancement: partner and non-partner tracks. For both tracks, attorneys start out as associates and, in some firms, progress to counsel. At that point (either associate or counsel), the attorney may or may not advance on the partnership track. At some firms, attorneys who are not on the partnership track may be asked to remain with the firm as a senior attorney or of counsel. Many attorneys will stay with a large firm for several years to gain experience and exposure and then move on to a smaller firm where advancement may be easier.

- If variety is the spice of life, how spicy is this practice area?

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Bankruptcy is truly an area where variety abounds. Bankruptcy attorneys may be called on to address corporate, tax, environmental, employment, real estate, finance, securities, class actions and litigation issues in the bankruptcy case. Most large firms have separate departments to address these issues, but a medium to small firm may have only a few limited practice groups. Therefore, bankruptcy attorneys will need to know these areas as well as general bankruptcy law. Regardless of whether a firm has separate specialty counsel, bankruptcy attorneys need to understand these issues in order to effectively represent their clients in the proceeding.

In addition to the different legal issues that arise, bankruptcy involves a large amount of motion practice. Most bankruptcy motions are fact sensitive and therefore tend to vary by the parties involved. Bankruptcy attorneys must craft the motion or objection by applying the law to the facts of each case. As a result, no two motions or responses are exactly the same.

- How much wear and tear?
Bankruptcy is extremely fast-paced. Cases generally move very swiftly through the courts. Motions are heard by order to show cause or on shortened notice (depending on local rules). Some reorganizations of major corporations have been accomplished in less than a matter of months. At the onset of a case, it is common for the debtor to file a large number of first-day motions seeking many different forms of relief. These motions may be heard initially on just a couple of days’ notice, with a final hearing being scheduled only two weeks later. The speed at which a case proceeds can be daunting at times and attorneys must make sacrifices in order to meet the demands of the practice.

Junior associates will be called upon to review motions and other pleadings, some on an emergent basis, and provide summaries and recommendations within very short periods of time.

- Of the people in this practice group who hate it, what exactly do they hate about it?
The largest pet peeve among bankruptcy lawyers is the failure of some lawyers to know and follow correct procedures. Most bankruptcy lawyers know the law, but are unfamiliar with procedures. Attorneys also dislike when adversaries seek emergent relief when it is not necessary or set unreasonable response or hearing dates.

- Of the people in this practice group who love it, what exactly do they love about it?
Not only is the variety of cases a positive factor, but both lawyers and judges in this area tend to be smart and competent. The intellectual stimulation from working with or against such attorneys or appearing before the bankruptcy bench is very rewarding. Bankruptcy lawyers’ skills must be sharp. Obtaining a positive result that will allow the client to emerge from reorganization can be gratifying.

- Are there common avenues out of this practice area?
Bankruptcy is not a practice that lends itself well to transition to an in-house corporate counsel position. That move is rare. Bankruptcy attorneys may pursue a judicial career after practicing for several years or seek a position with the United States Trustee’s office, charged with monitoring and overseeing bankruptcy cases. Non-practicing positions exist with companies that provide research materials and programs for bankruptcy attorneys.

- What are some market trends that impact this practice area?
Bankruptcy cases abound during a recession. However, even in a good economy, relief under the Bankruptcy Code is sought by many companies seeking to shed their debt for better or more favorable economic terms.

- If you had to recommend one candidate from a room crowded with recent bar exam graduates, what specific qualities would he or she have that would ensure success in this practice area?
A successful bankruptcy lawyer must be creative. Bankruptcy relief requires that counsel demonstrate an ability to develop resourceful and practical ways to achieve success for the client. He must understand the needs and goals of the client. As in other practices, a bankruptcy attorney must exercise good judgment, pay attention to detail, be a team player and be able to express himself clearly both orally and in writing.

# 'The Real Job' Of Working In A Small Law Firm

Gary J. Ross

I frequently counsel people who are considering starting their own practice, and a couple of years ago an old friend reached out to me and told me he had left his job and was thinking about hanging out a shingle. I told him about the SmallLaw highs and the lows, the process of opening an office and bringing in clients, focusing on certain practice areas, billing, etc. I might have gone on and on a bit, as I’m wont to do, but there is a lot of ground to cover when a person opens a practice. Then my friend interjected and said he had to end our call — a call I had taken on my own time, for free, while my then-girlfriend was not-so-patiently waiting for me to get off the phone — because he had to take another call that was about a “real” job.

I was dumbfounded. As far as I’m concerned, THIS is the real job! Putting yourself out there and convincing the world (or least enough people that collectively your bills will be paid) that you are worth hiring — that you will add value, that you will be a benefit — this is the real job. After a while, it’s difficult to imagine doing anything else.

In Biglaw, people can fill different roles. There can be people whose role it is to bring in clients. At one of my Biglaw jobs, the head of our group was very good at bringing in large clients, who would place a lot of work with the firm, even non-securities work. She left at 5 p.m. every day (she was my hero), because her role wasn’t to grind away hours.

Then there are people whose role is to grind away hours, who might occasionally land a client or two, but their primary duty is to do and oversee the work, since not everything can be left to associates. Then I guess there are folks who concern themselves with internal matters at the firm, like training and compensation and the overall direction of the firm.

In SmallLaw, we get to do it all. We get to bring in the clients, we get to do the work — because in SmallLaw, you won’t have enough people that you don’t have to bill hours –- and then we get to handle internal matters like hiring/firing and trying to figure out which vendors to use. It can be overwhelming.

But lots and lots of other people have done it, some very successfully, so there is no reason you nor anyone else can’t hang out a shingle and make it work. And you really don’t know what you’re going to be good at until you try. (As for me, I’ve found that I’m good at… well, I’ll have to get back to you.) The prospect of landing clients can be scary to some, but after a year or two, you get the hang of it and start to figure out which leads are worth pursuing and which aren’t worth your time. The hiring and firing aspect of running a practice is difficult and isn’t something we’re trained for in law school or Biglaw. It’s also hard to carve out the time to think about your practice on a macro level and where you would like it to go and how you can get there.

Again though, you can do it, and by “it” I mean everything. Because being in Biglaw is like being half a lawyer. In SmallLaw, you’re the whole lawyer.

# An Excellent Opportunity For New York Litigators
## There aren't a huge number of opportunities out there for senior associates in litigation, but here is an excellent one.

If you’re a litigation associate in Biglaw, I commend to you this excellent essay by [Joshua Libling](https://validity-finance.com/about/team/joshua-libling/) of Validity Finance, [Up or Out: Why Litigation Associates Need to Make a Decision by Their Fourth Year](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/06/29/up-or-out-why-litigation-associates-need-to-make-a-decision-by-their-fourth-year/).

You should read the whole piece, but here’s the core of Libling’s argument:

The litigation associate track at Big Law firms is badly structured to the detriment of associates…. The key structural problem is the combination of two facts: (1) You will find out if you are going to make partner somewhere in your seventh to 10th year out of law school; and (2) you are at your most marketable somewhere around your fourth or fifth year out of law school.

The problems those two facts create should leap off the page, but here are two big ones. First, you need to make the decision about whether you want to try to make partner before you have a good sense of what that even means or how likely you are to get it. Second, every year beyond the fourth or fifth that you are committing to try to make partner at your firm is a year you are decreasing the ease with which you can transition to another job if you do not make partner. Put differently, as your job security decreases because you get closer to an up-or-out decision, your flexibility in replacing that job also decreases.

This is why, when I recently wrote about what [elite litigation boutiques are looking for](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/new-opportunities-for-new-york-litigators/?rf=1), I mentioned “[b]etween two and four years of experience at a top Biglaw firm” — i.e., not less than two and not more than four years of experience.

Fifth-year litigation associates are still somewhat marketable, but for litigation associates at large firms, your best window of opportunity for a lateral move is as a third- or fourth-year associate. There are relatively few opportunities for litigators who are more senior than fifth-years (unless they happen to be litigation partners with seven-figure books of business).

But if you happen to be a senior litigation associate (or counsel) with superb credentials, here at Lateral Link we have an opportunity that might be of interest. It’s an unposted opportunity — not on the law firm’s website, not on LinkedIn or any other job site, not on [Leopard Solutions](https://www.leopardsolutions.com/default.aspx) — at a firm with whom we have an excellent and longstanding relationship.

This Am Law 200 and NLJ 500 firm seeks a litigator with at least seven years of experience, for a position in its New York office as a senior associate, counsel, or (non-equity) partner, with compensation and title to be determined based on the qualifications and experience of the candidate. It’s a superb firm where litigation is the largest practice group and core to the firm’s success and profitability, i.e., not playing second fiddle to the transactional practices. This means that litigators at the firm have a real chance at partnership — which is unfortunately not the case at many of the top Wall Street firms, where litigators often make up 20 percent or less of new partners.

There’s no shortage of senior litigation associates in New York who are looking for exit options. So a competitive candidate for this rare opportunity will have credentials like the ones [sought by elite litigation boutiques](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/new-opportunities-for-new-york-litigators/?rf=1):

- A very good academic record from a top 14 law school, or an excellent academic record from a non-T14 law school (e.g., Latin honors, Order of the Coif, Law Review).
- One or more clerkships with federal district or circuit judges — the more prominent the court or the judge, the better (e.g., S.D.N.Y. or E.D.N.Y. or D.D.C. for district judges, SCOTUS feeders for appellate judges).
- Seven or more years of experience at a top Biglaw firm (e.g., a [Vault 10 firm](https://www.vault.com/best-companies-to-work-for/law/top-100-law-firms-rankings)).

# Major Lateral Moves: It's 'Open Season On Cleary Partners'
## Freshfields is looking to make its mark in New York.

Wowser, the already busy partner lateral market has gotten a kick in the tushie. A group of four Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton partners have decamped from the New York mainstay for the Magic Circle firm of Freshfields. The partners come from a variety of practice groups: Mergers and acquisitions partner Ethan Klingsberg, corporate lawyers Pamela Marcogliese and Paul Tiger, and litigator Meredith Kotler.

What makes this lateral move particularly notable is the move from a firm noted for its lockstep partner compensation, to one that has[ abandoned their lockstep model](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/06/28/a-magic-circle-firm-goes-on-the-attack-in-the-war-for-talent-405-38134/) for one that lets them pay top dollar to recruit talent. According to [reporting by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/10/25/freshfields-signals-new-york-ambitions-with-four-strong-cleary-hire-405-47214/) Law.com, Klingsberg (and his $30 million book of business) was fielding offers from multiple suitor firms, and had offers of a guaranteed multimillion-dollar payday that would last for several years. All of which may signal that Cleary partners are ripe for the picking:

“It will be open season on Cleary partners,” as other firms will try to lure more partners from the firm, [Alisa Levin of Greene Levin Snyder, who places partners at elite firms and is a former Cleary associate] said. “Cleary lawyers are known to be among the best and most creative in the field and previously regarded as virtually untouchable by other firms. If someone like [Klingsberg] can be poached, I think others are going to stop and think.”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
This lateral move is also of note because there are clues that there’s some bad blood between the parties. Sources have reported — and Cleary confirmed, without any further comment — the quartet of partners were actually fired by the firm before they had an opportunity to give their notice. Which… is not how these things usually go down.

But in Klingsberg’s statement on the move, he kept things exceedingly polite and focused on the “awesome” services at their new firm:

“We are excited to be joining Freshfields’ blue-chip platform. The service that we and our new colleagues at Freshfields will bring to clients promises to be awesome,” He added, “We have all enjoyed our time at Cleary. The momentum and strategic focus at Freshfields will enable us to help our clients with unparalleled service for many years to come.”

Cleary hasn’t made an official comment, but that won’t stop people from speculating about the impact this move will have on the larger firm:

Levin, the recruiter, noted that that the partners’ move from Cleary could be a “one-off thing or it could start a domino effect. We don’t know yet.”

“The firm will do fine, it’s an institution. It’s highly respected,” she said, but “there’s more and more pressure to be able to retain your talent.” She recommended that Cleary take steps to make sure “their partners are committed to the culture and to the [lockstep] system.”

Only time will tell.

# Am Law 100 Firm Matches $115K Bonus Scale, Offers Even More Cash For High Billers
## This firm is dumping bonus bucks on its attorneys.

Cravath announced its year-end bonus scale on Monday, and ever since, matches have slowly but surely started rolling in. The latest firm to spread the wealth is doing so under much less turbulent circumstances than it did when it announced its 2020 year-end bonuses.

Cadwalader — a firm that brought in $452,572,000 gross revenue in 2020 — had particularly unfortunate timing last time around, announcing its bonuses [during the insurrection](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/cadwalader-bonus-2020/) at the U.S. Capitol. With Thanksgiving just a day away and lots of money on the table for associates and special counsel, things are looking much more cheerful for the firm in 2021.

Not only has Cadwalader matched the Cravath bonus scale, but it’s also offering extra cash for big billers. In case you’ve forgotten, this is the current market scale:

On top of that, the firm is offering bonuses “equal to 120% of the amounts listed above” for those who billed 2200 hours or more (which can’t have been too difficult during the wild year that was 2021). At the bottom of the totem pole, attorneys can earn up to $18,000 (pro-rated), and at the very top, attorneys can earn up to $138,000. That said, we imagine Cadwalader will be dumping a lot of extra bonus money on its associates and special counsel this year.

The firm will may its bonus payouts sometime in February 2022. Congratulations!

# Biglaw Firm That Nixed COVID Appreciation Bonuses For Associates Gives Them To Staff
## Here's hoping staff special bonuses spreads through Biglaw.

Listen, I’ve been [pretty up front on my position](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/biglaw-bonuses-belong-in-associate-pockets-not-partner-coffers/) on the special bonuses that, briefly, swept through Biglaw — if a firm has the money ([and a lot of them do](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/whats-the-real-reason-biglaw-firms-are-begging-off-fall-bonuses/)) they should share the wealth with their employees, sooner rather than later. It’s a tough time out there and, by their nature, the top of the Biglaw pyramid is better situated to weather that than the lower rungs. That’s true of the comparison of partners to associates and doubly true when it comes to staff.

So, I truly do laud the recent move by Goodwin to make an “additional payment” in “recognition of your hard work during these challenging times” made to “all secretaries” ([full email available on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/goodwin-staff-bonuses/2/)). Sure, it’s $1,000 and won’t be made until January, but it ain’t nothing.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
We can only hope that COVID appreciation bonuses for staff become [even more](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-firm-spreads-the-love-with-covid-bonuses/) common [in Biglaw](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/biglaw-firm-rewards-staff-for-hard-work-during-the-pandemic/).

But still, [only last week the same firm came out](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/goodwin-refuses-to-pay-special-fall-bonuses-promises-competitive-cash-come-january-2021/?rf=1) and refused associate fall COVID appreciation bonuses. As a matter of messaging, that’s… less than ideal. At least associates should be comforted with the firm’s stated commitment to “providing compensation that is competitive with the market.”

But until then, associates are left wondering exactly how much their “significant efforts” will be worth to the firm.

As always, we depend on you when it comes to bonus news at other firms.

# Hate Your Desktop? Too Damn Bad, Because That's What Your Firm's Giving You.
## Why are law firms obsessed with desktops?

While the business world becomes more mobile — demanding employees to work from home, from the train, from the client’s office, from opposing counsel’s conference room, from the airport, and from vacation — many firms remain hopelessly tied to keeping their lawyers hopelessly tied to their desks. When some Biglaw firms started handing out laptops to their attorneys back at the turn of the century, there was a sense that we were witnessing the first cautious trickles that would become a deluge of laptop adoption. Seventeen years later, the desktop computer proved more resilient than we imagined.

And it’s even gaining steam (to invoke yet another archaic technology).

The [latest LegalTech News survey](http://www.dailyreportonline.com/id=1202799964052/Desktops-Not-Dead-Law-Firms-Continue-to-Use-Desktops-for-Security-Upkeep-Concerns/) reveals how desktop is on the upswing.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The 2017 LTN Law Firm Tech Survey found that 45 percent of law firms plan to equip lawyers with desktop computers in their next hardware refresh, a 16 point jump from last year. The bump in desktop purchasing also seems to show a pivot from the 20 percent that planned to equip attorneys with desktop computers exclusively. In 2016, 41 percent of firms intended to equip attorneys with laptop computers only in their next hardware refresh, and an additional 30 percent of firms planned to offer attorneys laptops and tablet devices.

ILTA says there’s no real jump in desktop purchasing… it’s been here all along. Their backward-looking data reveals that roughly 60 percent of law firms went with desktops over the last couple of years.

Either way, it’s all about the desktop.

But why? What can possibly keep these dinosaurs roaming the halls — or sitting quietly on desks as it may be — when we know the technology exists to hold all that computing power in a bag? Are Biglaw firms just cheap? Are crusty old lawyers just terrified of new-fangled “fold up” computers? Well, no. Desktops are just a hell of a lot easier to deal with because they don’t move.

There are upkeep advantages when every work computer is right there in the office for IT to update. They don’t get dropped or run through a wheat thresher. And they’re more secure because they don’t get lost in luggage or forgotten at a meth house. Upkeep, security, uniformity, connectivity — however you want to slice it, sitting still and plugging carries advantages.

So learn to enjoy that clunky desktop, because it’s not going anywhere. And if you’re lucky enough to have a laptop, this is your warning… your firm may be looking to handcuff you to your desk again.

# How To Tackle Career Burnout And Determine If You’re Ready For A Career Change
## Before you take the leap into a new role or make a career change, consider doing these things to overcome and tackle your career burnout.

As a coach and executive resume writer, I have executives come to me at varying stages of their job search — some realize they’ve hit the ceiling at their current firm or company and acknowledge it’s time for an upward shift in their career, whereas others desire a career change as the cure to their career fatigue.

[Career burnout](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/how-to-set-better-and-healthier-boundaries-in-your-career/) is often accompanied by chronic stress with a barrage of symptoms that include exhaustion, depleted energy, decreased motivation, and negativity surrounding your work. You may experience the infamous “Sunday Scaries,” which is often characterized by an impending sense of doom about the work week ahead. You may feel lost, deflated, or irritable around family and friends. You might even become withdrawn in social situations outside of work because your anxiety is zeroed in on your to-do lists and other pending work. You might have gained weight due to decreased time investments in your own self-care and personal health.

How do I know these are the typical symptoms of career burnout? It’s because I’ve personally experienced them, which resulted in a major health scare and a serious wake-up call.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
When you’re an overachiever and deeply dedicated to your craft, it’s easy to fall into a trap of being overworked. Most of the time, career burnout occurs because we’ve overfilled our own personal plates with extra tasks, assignments, and projects, leaving us personally deprived of much-needed sleep, exercise, and time to decompress. With career burnout, you lose the ability to differentiate the weekdays from the weekends, you feel overwhelmed and irritable due to the immense size of your workload, and you begrudgingly decline social invitations. More significantly, you begin to resent your career choice and current role, so you oscillate between looking up new positions, fiercely applying, and questioning if a new role will bring you the desired balance and career happiness you want and need.

Before you take the leap into a new role or make a career change, consider doing these things to overcome and tackle your career burnout:

Prioritize Your Workload

In the beginning years of your career and business, you operate from a “must respond ASAP” mode and treat everything like an emergency. You want to impress your clients, the managing partners, and everyone else in between. You put in the early mornings, late nights, and even weekends. At some point, you come up for air and realize that not everything requires an urgent response or immediate attention, and frankly, it’s impossible to treat it all as such.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Prioritizing your workload is key. Acknowledge (and accept) that not everything may or will get done in a single day (because as we all know, true emergencies do pop up and calls go for longer than planned). Make a list of three or four non-negotiables on your to-do list that day. Rank them based on order of importance.

Set And Communicate Clear Boundaries

One of the key repetitions in my legal career and business was that I failed to [set clear boundaries around my time](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/how-to-set-better-and-healthier-boundaries-in-your-career/) and communicate them effectively. I overextended and stretched myself to the point of utter exhaustion, yet to the outside world, I was “killing it.” Internally, I was falling apart. I was severely sleep-deprived, and my thyroid was out of whack. My physical health took a backseat. I can’t tell you how many times I felt “guilty” taking time off to go to the doctor or how I postponed doctor’s appointments because I was juggling too much work. But, if you’re not operating at your physical best, how can you be operating at your mental best?

Your physical health is a priority and setting work boundaries is key. Maybe that requires you to put a hard stop to scheduled calls at 4 p.m. so you can spend that last hour or two wrapping up your work and sending out the last few emails of the day. Or perhaps, it’s letting the client know that you’ll look at their contract tomorrow morning after you’re back from a doctor’s appointment (as opposed to feeling pressured to read it that evening on strained eyes).

Check Your Mental Health

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
A client recently expressed to me her level of [exhaustion and fatigue](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/ways-to-care-for-yourself-during-hard-times-in-your-life-and-career/) from her role. “But I’m making great money, more than I’ve ever made, shouldn’t I just suck it up for a few more years?” She hadn’t been to her favorite Pilates class in months, and she had been ordering takeout more than she cooked (cooking and baking were her favorite things to do on the weekends).

When you lose sight of those [hobbies and outside interests that keep you balanced and fulfilled](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/why-we-need-to-give-ourselves-permission-to-rest-and-relax/), your mental health is bound to suffer. Consider using some PTO just to give yourself a break, disconnect, and rejuvenate both your mind and body.

Most importantly, don’t be afraid to [work with a coach or a therapist](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/05/05/therapist-coach-difference-choose/) who can provide the needed support and outside perspective. Sometimes, people are so centralized on emotions that they cannot see themselves in an objective manner. An executive coach is there to see the 30,000-foot view of your career and provide support, counsel, and guidance to not only help you identify your career or leadership roadblocks and strategize on ways to create positive action for your future career benefit. A therapist will focus on getting to the root of the things holding you back, identify the source of your emotional or mental health concerns, and look into your past from your childhood up through the present.

Determine Your Presence And Focus

Sometimes you’ve come to the realization that your role is making you feel stagnant in your career ladder. Perhaps you’ve just become complacent, but you have other goals you want to achieve as time continues to move. Some of the first questions I ask a client include: What do you want to focus on next? What’s most important to you for your next role? What’s lacking in your current role that you want to change?

I often suggest the idea of pursuing [additional skills and training](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/how-certificate-programs-and-online-courses-can-boost-your-skills-and-career-value/) to create more engagement and interest in the current work, but also to create a future opportunity and enhanced value. Even once you’ve reached the C-suite, there’s always room to learn and grow. Make a list of those concrete goals and don’t be afraid to pursue them. With risk comes great reward, but you have to prepare adequately.

# Wake Up, Partners! Not Making Associate Life Worthwhile Is Costing You A Lot More Than You Think
## Maybe there are other ways to convince associates to remain loyal, aside from cash?

This should be a wake-up call to partners everywhere: the cost of not enhancing the value proposition for associates can now be quantified as the multiyear decline in PPP resulting from this latest transfer of monies from partner profits to fixed associate comp.

— Law firm strategist Hugh Simons, commenting on the fact that there are [other ways to attract and retain associates](https://www.law.com/2021/06/21/law-com-trendspotter-in-the-law-firm-associate-pay-war-the-only-thing-that-cant-be-bought-is-loyalty/), aside from huge salaries. Perhaps if associates had been offered other perks, they’d be more inclined to remain with their current firms than enter the lateral market.

# Associates Get Raises -- Unclear Whether That's Actually Good News
## Associates are happy, but wary.

Usually word of raises is met with jubilation from the rank and file of associates, but things at Boies Schiller Flexner are always difficult. See, they’ve got a rather complicated formula that determines associate bonuses, designed to have associates share in the revenue. As we’ve[ detailed in the past, ](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/boies-schiller-bonuses-appear-to-underperform-market-but-not-everyone-notices/?rf=1)sometimes that means an incredibly lucrative payday — with [bonuses as high as $350,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-boies-schiller-pays-up-to-350k-again/), — and sometimes it leads to disappointment unless you’re billing crazy hours.

So associates overall are happy that BSF announced they are matching the new base compensation scale:

Class of 2017: $190,000
Class of 2016: $200,000
Class of 2015: $220,000
Class of 2014: $255,000
Class of 2013: $280,000
Class of 2012: $305,000
Class of 2011: $325,000

But they’re left wondering if the extra money up front will trade off with the eye-popping bonuses come the end of the year. Further complicating the already complicated bonus structure at the firm are the announced “interim” bonuses, in line with the market special bonuses that have been sweeping the ranks of Biglaw firms.

As you can see, associates are skeptical:

No word on whether that means a change in the formula though which is the only way it will actually translate into a raise.

But still glad for the raise and summer bonus:

BSF is (finally) matching. Emails went out on an office-by-office basis. Summer “interim” bonuses, too. (Still not clear how this will affect overall annual compensation because of the BSF formula.)

# Associates In This City Just Got Their Raises
## Raises reach a new market.

After Cravath blew the lid off New York Biglaw salaries last year and then firms all over the country fell all over themselves to match, it may be hard to believe any market remained untouched by the spending frenzy. But some cities did indeed avoid the full force of Cravathageddon, and kept associate salaries generally in line with the cost of living in their neighborhoods.

But price pressure hits everywhere eventually. After all, student loans know no borders and wooing talent away from markets paying top dollar requires ponying up some scratch. It appears the salary increase bug has hit Minneapolis.

Dorsey & Whitney has bumped associate salaries up to $140K from $120K, effective January 1, 2018. According a tipster, other firms in the city have also moved to a $140K scale, but as yet those firms haven’t confirmed the move. UPDATE — 9/28/17: Winthrop Weinstine confirms that they’ve also moved their salary to $140K).

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

This doesn’t quite make these Minneapolis mainstays the top of the market. Barack Ferrazanno and Fish & Richardson moved their Minneapolis associates to $180K during the 2016 salary frenzy. But those big salaries probably didn’t drive the this rising tide as much as Jones Day’s entry to the market. When Jones Day opened its Minneapolis office last year and promptly jacked associate salaries to $160K, the gauntlet was decidedly thrown.

That said, for folks unfamiliar with the prospect of living in Minneapolis, these associates are going to be living the life. As one Minneapolis-based tipster put it, “If people think Chicago or DC are getting a huge amount of free money for not being in NY and getting the same salary, they should have an apoplexy at the idea that Minnesota is getting the same.” Fancy condos downtown are under half a million and luxury 2BR apartments run around $1500/month. What I’m saying is, if you are a law student and don’t mind bone-chilling cold, you should consider interviewing with a Minneapolis firm.

So congratulations associates! You’re gonna make it after all!

We’re retaining counsel in a case that we think might actually go to trial.  So I ask the question that you’d expect:  “How many cases have you tried?”

The litigator answers:  “Our firm has more than 1,000 lawyers located in ten offices around the world.  We’ve been ranked highest in client satisfaction for three consecutive years . . . .”

“Yes, yes.  But how many cases have you tried?”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“We’ve been doing complex litigation for most of our hundred-year history.  We know an awful lot about the industry involved here, as demonstrated by our multi-practice industry group. . . . “

“Yes, yes.  But how many cases have you tried?”

“I’ve been listed in Best Lawyers in America for the last three years, and I was listed last year in Chambers.  Those accolades go only to a tiny percentage of the finest lawyers in the country. . . . .”

“But how many cases have you tried?”

“We have great success on dispositive motions.  We’ve recently won summary judgment in two cases quite similar to yours. . . .”

“How many cases have you tried?”

“As you know, most cases settle.  I’ve handled hundreds of cases in my life, but we’ve either won the cases on dispositive motion or settled them. . . . “

“Have you tried any cases?”

“Two, actually.”

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
“Of those two, how many did you try to juries?”

“One.”

“Were you the lead lawyer at trial?”

“We co-chaired the trial.”

“I’ve never heard of that before.  Who did the opening and closing?”

“The other guy.”

“Did the case go to verdict?”

“No.”

“What happened?”

“We settled after opening statements.”

I understand how difficult it is to gain trial experience these days.  And I understand that — apart from people who worked as federal prosecutors — you’re unlikely to find lawyers who’ve actually tried relatively complex cases.  Most litigators don’t try cases.  Most people who boast about their trial experience have tried many cases that lasted for a half-day each and presented no tricky issues.

But in-house folks are correct to look for trial experience in their trial lawyers.  First, trial experience matters.  We ask questions about trial experience because the person who’s trying a case every year or two is probably more comfortable in front of a jury than the 50-year-old who’s never done it before.

Second, we ask questions about trial experience as a matter of self-defense.  What’s an in-house lawyer to say when our colleagues in the business ask about the experience of our trial counsel?  Business folks might ask before trial:  “How many cases has our trial lawyer tried?”  We can either try to explain why trials don’t matter, or we can confidently say, “Dozens.”

Worse yet, after we’ve dropped a few tens of millions of dollars at trial, business folks might ask:  “By the way, how many cases had our counsel tried before you let him lose our case?”

You can’t blame me for asking.

And I suppose I can’t blame you for evading the question.

The July 2016 administration of the bar exam is next week, and many would-be attorneys are really, really [worried about failing the test](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/the-reasons-why-law-school-graduates-are-really-really-worried-about-failing-the-bar-exam/). After all, bar exam pass rates have plummeted nationwide for the past several administrations of the exam, so they have every reason to be fearful.

But what about those with job offers in hand from prestigious Biglaw firms? Surely those test-takers — typically graduates of elite law schools — can’t be failing the bar exam at as high a rate as those from lower-ranked law schools. But what if they did fail? Would they still have jobs with starting salaries of $180K?

According to a deep dive on this topic conducted by [Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/big-law-associates-who-fail-the-bar-what-happens-to-them/), incoming associates may not have very much to worry about. This may come as somewhat of a surprise, but at most Biglaw firms, there’s leeway as far as bar passage is concerned.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Big Law Business spoke to firm leaders or spokespersons from nine firms — including Littler Mendelson, McGuireWoods, Baker & McKenzie, Nixon Peabody, Sidley Austin, Choate Hall, Willkie Farr, and Reed Smith — but this statement from Larren Nashelsky, chair of Morrison & Foerster, seems to largely represent what happens at most firms:

It is the Firm’s policy to be supportive of attorneys who do not pass the bar exam on the first try by permitting them to take the bar exam a second time in accordance with the Firm’s time off and reimbursement policies for first-time bar takers, subject, however, to the attorney otherwise satisfactorily progressing and the needs of the Department or Practice Group. In the event an attorney does not pass the bar exam on the second try, special approval by the Department and Practice Group will be needed for the attorney to take the exam for the third time.

Biglaw is apparently the land of second chances for bar exam failures. Who knew?

If you failed the bar exam as an incoming first-year Biglaw associate, we’d like to know what your experience was like. Did your firm treat you well and support you as you studied for the next test, or did you feel like an outcast? Please let us know via [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com).

# Biglaw Firm Gets Busy Shedding Finance Partners
## Big shake-ups at the Magic Circle firm.

The Magic Circle firm of [Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/freshfields-bruckhaus-deringer/) has placed a premium on profitability, which sounds great, unless you are a finance partner at the firm. After an internal review, the firm has decided that group just isn’t cutting it, and is focusing its efforts on a narrower range of products.

Last month, we brought you news of departures from the firm’s aviation finance group — along with some anonymous comments from current and former Freshfields partners who indicated more shake-ups were on the way. Now we know that six partners will be out the door by the end of the month, and two have been downgraded to non-equity partners. As Law.com [reports](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/04/14/six-partners-to-leave-freshfields-this-month-as-part-of-finance-restructuring/):

Six finance partners will leave Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer at the end of this month, while two others will be deequitised from the partnership, as the firm completes a restructuring of its global finance practice.

Five of the partners leaving the firm are based in London, while one is based in New York.

In London, they include City aviation finance partner Rob Murphy who is to join CDB Aviation Lease Finance – the aircraft leasing unit of China Development Bank – as general counsel and chief operating officer.

Meanwhile, one New York and one London partner will lose equity partner status in April but remain with the firm.

All of this is after a swath of London-based partners were already bumped down to the lower tier of partnership last year:

Legal Week reported last year that Freshfields [had moved a number of partners in London to its second tier lockstep](http://www.legalweek.com/sites/annaward/2016/01/05/freshfields-partners-face-profit-share-cut-and-drop-to-lower-lockstep-ladder/), with a small number in the finance practice understood to have been affected.

One wonders what other changes the Freshfields partnership will have to endure before the ship is righted.

# The Alternative Fee Arrangement That Will Force Big Firms To Innovate Or Die

People insist that law firms are incapable of change. The big firms have prospered in the past; leaders care only about the next five or ten years (which will see them into retirement); firms therefore won’t implement new models for law firm pricing.

Here’s the contrarian view: Firms will have no choice. We’ve seen the future of pricing, and firms will adapt or die.

I struggle with alternative fee deals as much as the next guy. We’ll align the law firm’s interest with ours! We’ll get a discount for failure, but pay a premium for success!

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
It doesn’t work: From the defense perspective, we don’t know what “success” looks like until well into discovery. Should we win? Settle for $10? Settle for $1 million? By the time we know the answer, the case has advanced too far to enter an alternative fee deal.

“Phased” alternative fee deals aren’t worth much, either: “We’ll pay you $X through summary judgment.” What’s that? An estimate of the hourly fees that are anticipated. Maybe it imposes a cap, but it doesn’t prompt innovation. And once we’ve used the firm through summary judgment, we’re pretty unlikely to swap them out because of price and use someone else for trial. This is an alternative, but not a very good one.

The thing that will force change, however, is the thing that’s already happening: A defined collection of cases are — or should be — bundled together and sold off to the lowest-cost bidder that the client trusts.

Thus: We’ve spent $1 million per year defending all of our single-plaintiff employment cases (combined) for each of the past five years. Those cases were filed against us in the following cities: [wherever]. We’d like six firms (all of whom we’ve worked with in the past and trust to do good work) to bid to do all of that work for the next three years.

The bids come in at prices ranging between $600,000 per year and $1.3 million per year. (Okay, okay: One clever firms starts at $700,000 and then goes up by five percent each year.) We trust all the firms, so $600K does it.

And here’s the beauty of it: The firm that bid $600K doesn’t lose money on this work! That firm does precisely what big firms are seemingly incapable of doing — it innovates — to find a way to make money at the lower price.

As for the losing bidders, they go the way of the Dodo bird.

Good riddance: [Creative destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction), and all that rot.

Perhaps employment cases are a bad example, because so much of that work is already commoditized. But there’s no reason why you can’t do this for all of your work of a specific type: Bankruptcy preference actions; product liability cases; malpractice cases; whatever plagues your industry.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Figure out where the cases are located and how much you’ve been spending. Share that information with a few firms that you trust. Ask them to bid for the work. ([Be careful of how you start the deal and how you end it](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/01/fixed-fee-deals-3-traps-for-the-unwary/), because fixed-fee deals pose issues there. Think, too, about how you’ll spread the defense costs across cases, because your insurance carrier will want to know how much you’ve paid to defend individual cases, not how much you’ll spend in the aggregate. And spot your own issues, too! I’m not on your payroll, you know.)

Is this unfair?

Yes.

If you’re roping together multiple cases, firms must be of a sufficient size to handle the number of cases and their geographic reach.

The small, minority-owned firm in Denver can’t realistically bid to handle your 2000 cases per year that will be distributed throughout the United States.

Perhaps you can figure out a way to include that firm in some larger firm’s proposal. (You could include a diversity element in your request for a bid, if you like.) Perhaps several smaller firms can figure out a way to make a collective bid. (This is hard: I might well trust Firm A to handle my cases in Denver. But when Firm A says it will use Firm B in Houston and Firm C in L.A., I start to twitch. I’ve never used Firms B and C before, and I know nothing about their quality. [I’m a suspicious guy](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/07/overcoming-the-presumption-of-incompetence/), so I’m pretty unlikely to accept this deal.)

But these fixed-fee packages will force big firms to change.

They must bid for this work or lose it.

Although big firms insist that they don’t do commodity work, most of them are lying. Most big firms can’t survive without doing some fairly routine work, so they’ll have to get in the game.

Moreover, some of the work that I’m talking about selling off isn’t commodity: This can be fairly sophisticated work that’s simply being sold off wholesale. The work is being auctioned off because of its volume, not its complexity. Firms can’t afford to lose that work, or they’ve lost an awful lot of business.

For the rest of the work — high-stakes stuff that is truly unique and requires specialized counsel — we may be stuck for a while with the billable hour.

But for everything else, the billable hour is doomed.

And now you know both how and why.

(You’re welcome.)

# More Biglaw Layoffs As Firm Moves To Outsource Admin Work
## COVID-19's continued impact on the legal industry.

Things are changing in Biglaw. The latest revamp from an Am Law 200 firm is from Thompson & Knight. The firm announced a partnership with Williams Lea to handle business services. And the list of tasks the TK Administrative Resource Center is taking over is large: finance services, marketing and business development, including graphic design and digital marketing, document processing, and other administrative resources.

Managing partner Mark Sloan[ tells Law.com](https://www.law.com/texaslawyer/2020/09/28/thompson-knight-outsources-document-processing-marketing-work/) that the outsourcing discussions pre-date the COVID-19 outbreak, but that expedited the need for change:

Sloan said remote work stemming from the pandemic “brought it into sharp focus,” but the firm has been looking since last year at making some changes in support services such as document processing. He said it is efficient to do that work on a 24/7 basis, instead of just during the 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. workday.

“For us, it’s really about flexibility,” he said.

But that “flexibility” comes at a price, specifically 18 positions the firm said it “unfortunately” had to eliminate as the pandemic rages on. Best of luck to those who find themselves out of work during this difficult time.

# Biglaw Partners Accused Of Blowing Off Intellectual Property Laws
## The complaint says the attorneys removed plaintiffs copyright notices and pasted on their own before using it in a client presentation.

A new lawsuit filed last week accuses two attorneys at Littler of knowingly infringing upon the intellectual property of others. The Center for Workplace Compliance (CWC), a members-only organization, says in their [complaint](https://pdfserver.amlaw.com/legalradar/37096587_complaint.pdf) that Littler shareholder Lance Gibbons and principal Chris Gokturk improperly accessed CWC materials and used them as the base of their own client presentations.

As the filing notes, both Gibbons and Gokturk previously worked for CWC — as CWC’s assistant general counsel and senior adviser for compliance solutions, respectively — and were aware law firms are specifically barred from CWC membership (to allow members to have an open and frank conversation about workplace compliance issues and to prevent firms from accessing CWC’s proprietary information). Despite this, CWC alleges the Littler attorneys repeatedly accessed members-only materials:

“The scale and scope of this unlawful conduct from the Littler IP address was extraordinary. Over the course of approximately seventeen (17) months beginning at least in November 2018, Defendant Littler’s servers were used to unlawfully obtain CWC Members-Only Site materials approximately four hundred forty-two (442) times.”

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/11/16/littler-attorneys-accused-of-misappropriating-former-employers-ip/) Law.com, this allegedly didn’t stop the attorneys from getting access to CWC materials and then using them for their own purposes:

Nonetheless, Gibbons allegedly told a Littler client and CWC member that he needed access to the client’s CWC password to access one particular CWC memorandum. Instead, Gibbons gained access to a significant number of materials over months and requested the client’s updated password multiple times after it was changed, according to the suit.

Gibbons and Gokturk then allegedly used these materials to prepare their own presentations for clients, removing CWC copyright notices and substituting Littler’s own copyright notice.

Littler has made a statement about the allegations disavowing any knowledge of the allegations (additionally, based on a look of the firm’s website, it seems Gibbons is no longer at the firm):

“Littler values and respects intellectual property rights, and we expect our attorneys to do the same,” a firm spokeswoman said Monday. “The firm had no knowledge at the time of the alleged actions. As soon as we were made aware of the situation, we initiated an investigation and took immediate action based on our findings. As this is an ongoing litigation matter, we cannot provide any further comment.”

But that may not be enough to get them out of legal ramifications however. The complaint is alleging the firm didn’t do enough to stop the breaches:

“Defendant Littler failed to implement appropriate controls and reasonable safeguards including best practices for employers to avoid the recurring and voluminous misappropriation of intellectual property of CWC by defendant Gibbons and defendant Gokturk, along with possibly other employees, over a substantial period of time,” the complaint said.

The complaint alleges two counts of copyright infringement, two counts of violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, one count of fraud, and one count of alternation of copyright management information.

# If A Tree Falls in Biglaw, And No One Hears It, Does It Make A Sound? Meet Firoz Dattu!

Firoz Dattu

Consider a legal equivalent of the classic Zen koan, “If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?”

Imagine, if you will, the “Super-Firm” . . . confidently leveraging all the advantages of this alt.legal age of wonder for their star litigation client.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
This firm has done their alt.legal homework (on their own dime) and is doing everything right by their client: they use predictive coding to reduce data; they train lawyers to be better business advisers (not just legal); they offshore document review; they found a better way to capture and incorporate client feedback; and they use historical data to price flat fees.

Each implemented innovation dramatically improves work quality, client service, and responsiveness, while simultaneously reducing the hours billed to the client and the total cost of representation.  But then what . . . ?

Because we are still dreaming, wouldn’t it be amazing if that lucky client commissioned a Times Square billboard proclaiming: “MY LAW FIRM IS FAR BETTER AT CLIENT SERVICE THAN YOURS,” or if an authoritative source like Consumer Reports wrote an article proclaiming the Super-Firm the “best and most efficient at litigation.” Then, like magic, the Super-Firm would see new clients pouring in the doors, revenues and profits up, and their mere-mortal competitors rushing to mimic their efficient ways.

Unfortunately, it’s time to awake from our collective dream, and come back to our bleak reality. While this Super-Firm did all it could to make the client experience exceptional, the total benefit is, most likely, a fleeting dopamine rush experienced as client’s general counsel says “nice work!”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Now maybe, just maybe, that client will offer to serve as a reference for one prospective client — marginally increasing the odds of picking up a single new engagement. DEFINITELY worth the reduction in revenue, to our Super-firm friends, . . . right?!

So what does all of this mean? It means the transmission mechanism of market information in legal — which should send clients in droves to the best (most innovative) law firms — is fundamentally broken. Tree falls, no one hears. Innovation moves at the speed of the information flow (slowly). So is anyone working to change that?

Meet, [Firoz Dattu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/firozdattuadvancelaw/), who works hard every day to fix the legal industry’s transmission problem — to make sure the most innovative law firms get the respect (and business) they deserve for their efforts.

Like many of our subjects in alt.legal (yes, I refer to them as subjects), Firoz is a [Harvard Law grad](http://hls.harvard.edu/).  He’s also a [Paul, Weiss](https://www.paulweiss.com/) alum and the founder of [AdvanceLaw](http://www.advancelaw.com/).

Firoz is a true alt.legal maven, who entered the alternative business of law as a young lawyer, and before it was cool.  Now he can boast true expertise in all things alt.legal, having clocked more than double Gladwell’s 10,000 hours of deliberate practice (though hopefully not at Biglaw’s classic 2,400 hours a year).

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
We’ve all been following AdvanceLaw’s [GC Experiment](https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/almID/1202792671453/) and [Open Letter From 25 GCs](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/almID/1202792672000/), and we look forward to the exciting results to be revealed in 2018, but that is a side project for them.  I wanted to learn what they actually do, and I was impressed.

Through AdvanceLaw, Firoz has advanced the one innovation that will strengthen innovation in the whole legal system: clear, unbiased, non-anecdotal information flow. And he’s done that through attracting a panel of some of the most high-powered general counsel in the world (a feat in and of itself).

Enjoy the great interview below! 

Joe Borstein: Firoz, despite your Harvard law and Paul, Weiss pedigree, you were an early mover in what we call alt.legal business.  Tell our audience why you decided to leave the traditional legal track and focus on the business of law.

Firoz Dattu: I suppose there were early signs I would try to tinker with the legal market rather than practice law.  While in law school, I was a teaching fellow in the economics department, and spent quite a lot of time thinking about what makes markets work, including the legal services market.  More time than I spent studying law, though perhaps that wasn’t a really high bar.

After a couple years at Paul, Weiss, I left to help launch an organization called the General Counsel Roundtable.  That was 1998; it was cutting edge at the time.  We were learning from and advising hundreds of general counsel on how to manage their departments and to work more productively with their law firms.  The whole point was to challenge conventional wisdom — to show people a better way.  We talked a lot about the legal market.

Malcom Gladwell writes about a 10,000-hour rule to become an expert.  Most of my peers spent their 10,000 hours practicing law, but I spent my 10,000 hours — I guess closer to 25,000 — talking and working with GCs and their teams to figure out how to improve inside-outside counsel relationships.   And that was the springboard for AdvanceLaw.

JB: In a nutshell, what is AdvanceLaw, and why did you decide to build it?

FD: In all those hours talking to GCs about law firm relationships it became clear that the problem wasn’t the firms, and it wasn’t the clients.  The problem is that we have an awful market because performance information doesn’t flow.  I was struck one day at a meeting we were holding with about 30 large company GCs.  During breaks, the GCs would be huddled over the cheese and crackers asking each other, “Hey, do you know a good ERISA lawyer?  Do you know a great consumer class action lawyer in Michigan?”  And I’m listening to this, still pondering how markets work — and thinking, this is so broken.  Can you imagine a bunch of CIOs huddling over the Swiss cheese saying, “Hey, do you know anyone who does a good job of cloud-based hosting?  Do you know someone who can do an IT security audit?”  No way — they have better market information.

AdvanceLaw is a group of nearly 200 GCs who have said this market doesn’t really work — might we have a different one please?  Working with the GCs, we find innovative firms that can deliver on quality and efficiency, and then use controls to ensure top performance.  The most important control is that the law firms know performance assessments are being collected, and the firms and lawyers who earn strong feedback get more work.  Do well for McDonald’s and Honeywell, and you’re positioned to get more work not just from them, but also from Panasonic, Nike, Mastercard, and others.  This market incentive to over-perform gives GCs assurance when retaining counsel through AdvanceLaw.  Without that assurance, GCs are sometimes forced to stick with incumbents even when they make a mistake or aren’t efficient — the devil you know versus the devil you don’t.  We need a much better market.

JB: That seems like part of something we have discussed this with many alt.legal CEOs and leaders — we call it the [“Legal Innovation Paradox.”](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__abovethelaw.com_legal-2Dinnovation-2Dcenter_2017_09_27_competition-2Dis-2Dfor-2Dlosers-2Dthe-2Drise-2Dof-2Datrium-2Dpart-2Di_&d=DwMGaQ&c=4ZIZThykDLcoWk-GVjSLmy8-1Cr1I4FWIvbLFebwKgY&r=VZeX4Yhw8aQkbke7I8w3r4UqdR8x29QMSdskhe7OgE4&m=Lg5b78pm5RFNdrAL1PPQfHKIyHqWSgbXwDQRUl9XAFA&s=3O2Z9QVkEpmOs6v7b27XD-SOtZbAz3Lo0UupineAxiE&e=)  Efficiency gains at law firms net lower profit.  We at alt.legal believe strongly that the holy grail of legal tech and innovation is a solution to this paradox.  What are your thoughts on this problem?

FD: It’s a huge problem.  Imagine if Volvo made 100 of the world’s best new electric vehicles.  Beautiful, 1,000-mile range, affordable.  But the only people who ever knew about them were the first 100 buyers.  For everyone else it’s just a rumor that maybe Volvo made some sort of new thing.  That sounds crazy — but that’s the legal market.  Performance information doesn’t circulate, and it hurts the most deserving firms.  Think about the disincentive to innovation: if a law firm does something new and great, they really kill it for the client — who knows about it?  That one client.  Usually that’s it.  There’s no good mechanism for clients to share this kind of information.  So a loss leader for a client becomes just a loss.

This is a key reason for what we’re doing.  By sharing performance information, firms are more likely to be paid for their innovations.  If a law firm or another provider creates an innovation that works, it shows up in the form of consistently strong feedback and translates into new business from hundreds of clients.  Conversely, innovations that sound good on paper but don’t deliver, aren’t rewarded.  So you won’t be surprised to hear me say that you can’t fix the Legal Innovation Paradox without fixing the legal market.

I think it’s important for all of us to stop, and think about what truly holds back innovation.  I suspect it’s not a lack of good ideas or enterprising people, it’s a market that won’t support innovation.  By way of analogy, think for a moment about all the product improvements that it’s probably not worth making but for a market channel like Amazon.  By creating a well-functioning market — one that provides extra revenue to superior products — Bezos created something where innovation pays.  We’re helping the legal market get there.

JB: You wrote that law firm pedigree may be a thing of the past, can you explain that to our audience?

FD: Even sophisticated consumers rely on proxies for quality.  It’s unavoidable.  The most obvious in the legal industry is law firm reputation.  This has clear limitations.  For instance law firms have inconsistent quality — some lawyers are better than others.  Also, legal advice is now more bite sized, real-time, less academic, more grounded in business.  In other words, pedigree was earned under a different system, engineered to deliver a different type of service to what’s expected now.  Clients know that firm pedigree is a poor proxy for service quality, but they often lack a better indicator.  But what if clients have actual performance information about a lawyer or service provider — that’s much more valuable than reputation, which is basically hearsay on glossy paper.  Reputation won’t be pre-eminent for much longer, in part because we rate everything now.  Hotels, schools, doctors.  It makes sense.  This is what Sue Miller, the GC of a $6 billion multinational was getting at in the quote on our website: “The standard should change from you don’t get fired for hiring a white shoe firm, to you don’t get fired for using AdvanceLaw.”  It’s a way of saying, we as GCs shouldn’t rely on pedigree, we should rely on something more powerful, which is actual performance.

JB: AdvanceLaw is “led by 180 general counsel,” including GCs from monster companies like Google, Sony, and Unilever.  How did you pull off getting these industry giants involved (our aspiring alt.legal entrepreneurs should be taking notes!)?

FD: I was lucky.  From my prior role at the General Counsel Roundtable, I developed great relationships with hundreds of GCs, spending all day, every day, talking about their management challenges.  So I had a rolodex of thought partner GCs.  Twenty of them were early advisors and launched AdvanceLaw with me.  I think that’s the main lesson — we didn’t launch AdvanceLaw by ourselves and then sell it to GCs.  We launched it with the GCs.  Related, we didn’t simply create AdvanceLaw to give clients better or more efficient service.  That’s an ingredient, but the GCs who join AdvanceLaw also have a passion to influence the market and make it more fair — where law firms and lawyers who “get it” gain traction and market share.  So adding GCs has been comparatively easy because we’re doing something that feels good to them.

There are other drivers too.  GCs are leaders in the profession, and want to support it.  They care about diversity, pro bono, better development of associates, and other things.  I still remember a conversation I had with Laura Stein, Clorox’s GC, when we launched AdvanceLaw.  She talked about encouraging and rewarding firms with profession-friendly practices — firms with good cultures, where collaboration and inclusion were supported.  And this was nine years back, in the heart of the recession, when companies were laser-focused on efficiency.  Even then, she and so many of the GCs who launched AdvanceLaw were focused on the big picture.  To this day, when we bring a GC into the group, we have to see that there’s a philosophical fit.  GCs who want to make the market better, and make the profession more exciting and rewarding for lawyers and firms that get it.

My view, for what it’s worth, is that a lot of innovators and entrepreneurs focus on creating a better mouse trap, but they may not focus enough on enfranchising and motivating early adopters and clients. I think the innovations that thrive tend to focus on passion and loyalty.  Something folks can rally around.

JB: In an article you wrote for Harvard Business Review, you noted that one general counsel violated the legal version of the maxim “you never get fired for hiring IBM.”  He said, “I would absolutely fire anyone on my team who hired Cravath.”  Explain to our audience the significance of that bold statement for the future of legal. 

FD: It’s a sentiment many GCs feel.  I don’t want to dismiss Cravath and the like — they are where they are for a reason, and they should be proud about what they’ve achieved.  But overall, things change, and when you look at what clients want from a law firm over the past 20 or 30 years, it’s changed dramatically.  How well are the big incumbents in any industry doing 50 years after they made it big?  Usually their brands are gone even if their legacy lives on somehow.  Law has been so different — our brands are strong because they’re 50 years old.

That’s changing as we speak, and that change is going to be really hard on the industry.  To think law is immune is shortsighted.  In fact, a firm like Skadden is viewed as an incumbent, but as Malcom Gladwell also notes, they were once the challenger.  Change happens, and the theme is that it happens when something looks stronger than it is.  We think incumbent firms will be very strong until they aren’t — the end will come slowly, and then all at once.

By way of example, one of our GCs just sent a very large M&A transaction — of the size a firm like Cravath or Skadden would be really happy with — through AdvanceLaw, ultimately going with a strong but less well known firm.  He said, “I’m done with how we’ve always played this game.  We don’t have to anymore.”  This is the new normal.  Those are the kinds of people who have built AdvanceLaw, and we know there are more out there.

JB: Thanks so much Firoz, really interesting stuff!

# You Can't Play Tennis And Carry Chalk At The Same Time

This weekend, as with most weekends, I spent the time playing tennis with my son. My grandson comes along and he is our official “ball boy.” He watches for stray balls and chases them down for us.

As with most toddlers, he has a limited attention span. He is, after all, only 2 years old. His mom brings chalk to keep him occupied in between the times that we need him to chase balls.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Because we have given him the option of doing something other than chasing balls, he no longer performs as well when it comes to chasing our tennis balls. He still chases the balls, but he chases them with chalk clenched in his fists. Because he has the chalk clenched in his fists, he really struggles when it comes to picking up the balls and tossing them back to us.

His solution? He swings his leg back and tries kicking the tennis balls back to us instead of throwing them. Because the tennis balls are not as large as the balls he usually kicks around, he really struggles connecting with the ball.

The take away here? Multitasking is not all it is cracked up to be. Monotasking is really a better way to go. You may have multiple tasks to do, but it is not possible to do them all at once. In the end, you only end up performing each task half as well.

When you work as an in-house lawyer, your list of things to do will always be long. There will never be enough hours in the day to get everything done. Whatever you do, avoid the temptation to try to do more than one thing at once.

- Recognize that which distracts you and work to eliminate those distractions. Silence your phone. Turn off your e-mail notifications. Shut your door. Clear off your desk.
- Recognize the times when your focus is the sharpest and work during those times. When your focus wanes, move to another task that requires less focus.
- When you have competing priorities, seek assistance from a colleague or an internal partner. You don’t have to be the only one moving all tasks forward.
Business analyst Shelley-Rose Moghrabi Illig said it best in response to my recent [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lawyerlisalang_lawyerlisalang-law-leadership-activity-6959833153641353216-Wlhg?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web) on the subject:

Amid today’s hustle-and-bustle expectations, monotasking really is the way to go … Multitasking can not only lead to divided attention, but that divided attention can also lead to potential problems and risks, because each task is only getting some of your attention, and not all of it.

Focused, undivided attention provides a greater opportunity for better and more optimal results.

# The Digital Transformation Journey: Lessons For Lawyers Embracing AI
## The journey from the days of leather-bound law books to the digital age -- and now toward an AI-driven future -- offers valuable lessons for embracing change.

Once, I found myself lost in a maze of towering leather-bound law books, searching for a precedent that felt like finding a needle in a haystack. Those were the days of my legal education, where every new case felt like a treasure hunt in a library from an ancient time. Fast-forward to today, and my legal research involves sleek, powerful online databases accessible with just a few clicks. 

This transition from the tactile world of physical books to the swift efficiency of digital tools was my first encounter with the legal profession’s digital transformation. As lawyers stand on the cusp of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into our practices, I reflect on this journey, drawing lessons from the past to prepare us for the future. Here’s what that pivotal shift from leather-bound volumes to digital databases has taught us about embracing the next frontier in legal technology. 

Digital Transformation Takes Time; It Is A Process, Not An Event

The move from traditional law libraries to digital databases didn’t happen overnight. It was a gradual process that allowed us to adapt, learn, and eventually embrace the new tools that now define our daily routines. Similarly, the integration of AI into legal practice is unfolding step by step. This should reassure anyone worried about having to adapt overnight. Just as it took time to transition from books to bytes, the journey to AI integration is a path, not a plunge.

There Is Plenty Of Time For You Not To Miss The Boat

One of the most common anxieties I hear from lawyers is the fear of falling behind or “missing the boat” on AI. The digital transformation of the past teaches us that while technology evolves, it also waits for its users to catch up. Educational programs, seminars, and workshops will emerge to bridge the gap. Just as law schools and firms provided training on digital research tools, they will adapt curricula and professional development programs to include AI literacy. There’s a ramp, not just a cliff, to the future of law.

No One Will Miss The ‘Good Old Days’

I have yet to meet a lawyer nostalgic for the days of manually updating law reports or sifting through stacks of books for a single precedent. The convenience, speed, and breadth of digital research tools have made the practice of law more efficient and effective. As we move further into the AI era, the enhancements in predictive analytics, document automation, and legal research will make the “good old days” of even the early digital age seem quaint. The efficiencies and capabilities AI brings to the table are likely to become just as indispensable as online databases are today.

Learning New Tools And Tech Is A Must; You Can’t Avoid It

The legal profession has never been static, and its tools have always evolved — from quill and parchment to typewriters and from books to databases. Each shift required lawyers to learn and adapt, and those who did so thrived. Embracing AI is no different. The future of law will belong to those willing to invest time to understand and master new technologies. Continuing legal education will increasingly include tech components, reflecting the indispensable role of technology in modern legal practice.

The Way We ‘Law’ Will Change For The Better

The ultimate goal of integrating AI into legal practice isn’t just to replace old methods with new ones; it’s to enhance our ability to serve justice, increase access to legal services, and improve the quality of our work. AI promises to automate mundane tasks, predict legal outcomes with greater accuracy, and unearth insights from vast data. These advancements will free us to focus more on the nuanced, human aspects of law — strategy, empathy, and ethical judgment.

The journey from the days of leather-bound law books to the digital age — and now toward an AI-driven future — offers valuable lessons for embracing change. It reminds us that adaptation is a gradual process, that there’s time to learn and grow, and that the essence of our profession isn’t in the tools we use but in the service we provide. As we stand on the brink of this new era, let’s move forward with confidence, curiosity, and open minds, ready to harness the potential of AI to enrich the practice of law.

# The Value Of Highly Perfumed In-House Lawyers
## The credentials of opposing in-house counsel? I never gave it a thought (and I still don't).

My corporation’s legal department has had several highly perfumed lawyers over the past decade: former U.S. Supreme Court clerks, former federal appellate court clerks, and the like.

These are the kind of folks that even an AmLaw 50 firm loves to brag about — if the AmLaw 50 firm is lucky enough to have these people around. Big firms love to offer “state of the Supreme Court” CLE programs on which the panelists are exclusively former Supreme Court clerks. It adds panache.

Someone in my company’s finance department recently said something entirely reasonable about this situation — entirely reasonable and completely wrong: “I bet we get a big discount on litigation when the other side finds out the credentials (and reputation) of who we have in-house.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Isn’t that funny? It’s perfectly plausible and, to my eye, simply not true.

In the 25 years that I worked as outside counsel, I rarely knew the name of the inside counsel monitoring a case for my opponent. (I’m, of course, thinking of corporations that have outside counsel handle litigation for them. I’d care about the identity of in-house counsel if the in-house lawyer was actually taking depositions and handling a trial.) I wouldn’t have bothered Googling the in-house lawyer’s credentials even if I heard the name. (I’ll grant that a fair amount of my practice was the defense of either product liability mass torts or securities class actions, and there is no in-house counsel — some would say no relevant client at all — on the plaintiff’s side of those cases. But I also handled routine corporate litigation, and I just didn’t care who was overseeing the case for the other side.)

Outside counsel cares deeply about who the opposing outside lawyer is: Is the person any good? Should I be anticipating arguments that the other side might make, or is opposing counsel really bad, so I can assume he or she will miss important arguments? (If so, who’s the judge? Might the judge catch an argument that I didn’t raise and opposing counsel missed? If so, must I raise the issue, even though opposing counsel is a moron?) Is the person a jerk, so every deposition will be an ordeal? Has opposing counsel never tried a case, so his or her knees will begin to buckle as we approach trial, or has opposing counsel tried many cases successfully, in which case perhaps my knees should begin to buckle?

These things matter to you as outside counsel, and they affect how you handle, or value, a case.

But the credentials of opposing in-house counsel? I never gave it a thought (and I still don’t).

That doesn’t mean in-house counsel can’t affect the value of a case. If the in-house lawyer identifies an important argument that outside counsel missed, that argument can certainly affect the value of a case. And the in-house lawyer’s willingness to take a case to trial may make a difference. But the in-house lawyer’s credentials (and reputation)?

Irrelevant.

Isn’t that odd?

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)
Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# One More Bonus Match!
## Remember it's imperative that tipsters let us know when firms announce bonuses!

No sooner did we post our list of the [richest partners who haven’t matched bonuses yet](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/the-richest-firms-that-still-havent-announced-bonuses/), than we learn of another firm taking themselves off that list. And while we’d love to think our public shaming post spurred this move, it turns out Weil actually announced bonuses the day before Thanksgiving.

Yes, that’s right. Apparently Weil associates were so busy getting out the door to their turkey dinners, everyone just assumed someone else would report the news to Above the Law. Alas… no one did.

It’s the tragedy of the commons, my friends. Remember, we’re not clairvoyant over here and if you are worried about bombarding us with redundant announcements, don’t be. We’ll happily take 15 rapid fire bonus memo forwards than none at all.

Bonuses will be paid on January 31.

# Biglaw Firms Shrinking Their Equity Partnership Ranks Are 'Gaming' The System
## And it may not always be to their advantage.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

It is increasingly rare to see firms meaningfully grow their equity partnership. It signals that law firm management is confident about its future. It implies success in the lateral partner market. It can be a boost to associate and non-equity partner morale. It is usually an indicator that a firm is experiencing healthy revenue growth.

And, it is obvious when the figure has been “gamed,” which itself says a lot about a firm.

— Roy Strom of [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/big-law-mistakenly-shrinks-partner-ranks-to-look-more-profitable), in a column analyzing the Biglaw firms that are “gaming” their profits per equity partner by shrinking the size of their equity ranks. “The path to equity partnership—Big Law’s most lucrative position—has become a harrowing route, and things only got bleaker last year,” he says. “Firms have been pulling up the ladder, limiting the number of lawyers who receive the bulk of their compensation through owning shares in the operation.”

Compliance with SEC reporting requirements is critical in the practice of corporate law. However, most corporate associates learn these requirements on the job, and training in SEC reporting tends to be piecemeal at best.

To fill in these training gaps, PLI offers a number of programs to help lawyers deepen their understanding of securities reporting requirements. 

The two-day program [SEC Reporting and Practice Skills Workshop for Lawyers 2022](https://www.pli.edu/programs/sec-reporting-and-practice-skills-workshop-for-lawyers?t=live&p=334729&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2)  offers the foundation and practical know-how you need to understand, prepare, and review periodic and current reports and proxy statements in order to comply with the SEC’s detailed disclosure requirements, including: 

- Key disclosures in and issues regarding Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K and the proxy statement
- How to communicate with the public within the constraints of the SEC’s rules and guidance
- How to implement stock buyback programs 
- The various theories of insider trading and how to protect the company and executives from charges
- The process of registering securities for offer and sale under the Securities Act of 1933 and certain of the exemptions from registration
- The requirements for resales of securities under Rule 144
- How to ensure compliance with Section 16 reporting and disclosure requirements
- How to write an effective MD&A
- Latest developments in SEC reporting, including climate change, Nasdaq’s diversity requirements, and ESG disclosure
- How to deal with the SEC staff and understand their “hot buttons”
You can register for the workshop [here](https://www.pli.edu/programs/sec-reporting-and-practice-skills-workshop-for-lawyers?t=live&p=334729&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2).

In addition, PLI’s half-day program, [SEC 101 Reporting Essentials for Lawyers Workshop 2022](https://www.pli.edu/programs/sec-101-reporting-essentials-for-lawyers-workshop?t=live&p=334895&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2), is a shorter, virtual workshop designed to give legal professionals the core practical knowledge base, skills, and tools required to succeed in an SEC reporting role and apply these tools in practice.  

In this highly interactive workshop, participants will learn about, and discuss, topics including the legal foundations of SEC reporting in the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), when there is a “duty to disclose,” and the SEC’s Integrated Disclosure System. The workshop will also cover: 

- The major provisions of the Securities Act and Exchange Act
- How to navigate the Integrated Disclosure System, including Regulation S-K’s disclosure requirements
- How public companies communicate within the constraints of the SEC’s rules and guidance
- Other sources of SEC guidance
- The SEC’s organization and function

PLI’s SEC reporting programs are ideal for both practitioners new to this area of law and more seasoned lawyers who are looking for a refresher on their skills. Register today to make sure you’re on top of the SEC’s most recent reporting requirements.

Allen & Overy and Shearman & Sterling are poised to [create a Biglaw behemoth](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/shearman-sterling-allen-overy-merger/), A&O Shearman, if their proposed merger is approved by the partnership of both firms. Once combined, the firm will have nearly 4,000 lawyers with approximately 800 partners, spread across 49 offices. A&O Shearman’s combined revenue will total $3.4 billion.

The global fanfare over this planned merger began in May, and after several months of A&O and Shearman senior partners Wim Dejonghe and Adam Hakki glad-handing with partners across continents, a vote on the combination is now upon us.

As noted by the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/09/18/ao-shearman-partners-to-begin-merger-vote-later-this-month-405-128776/), a two-week partnership voting window started today, and will last through October 13.  Here’s some more:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Partners at both firms said they expected their respective partnerships to achieve the required 75% threshold to vote through the combination to create one of the world’s biggest law firms, to be called Allen Overy Shearman Sterling, or A&O Shearman for short….

One Shearman partner said “everyone” at their firm was in favour of the deal. Another, at Allen & Overy, said the deal “is going to happen.”

Best of luck to both firms as this merger vote moves forward. Next month, it’s highly likely that congratulations will be in order, as we’ll have a new top Am Law firm on our hands!

# Biglaw Firm Really Wants People To Know Their Alum Is Running For President
## Davis Polk shows its support for an alum.

Biglaw firms love supporting alumni. When they hire a class of associates, they know not all 100+ of them will be at the firm in 8 years when they’re forced to make partnership decisions. So it makes sense that firms want to keep tabs on alums, particularly as they go on to work in-house, at boutique or have otherwise influential post-Biglaw careers.

Speaking of Biglaw alumna, Davis Polk is leaning into their ties with Kirsten Gillibrand. The New York senator worked at Davis Polk in the 90s as an associate. Now that she’s officially declared her candidacy for president and [defining her position on campaign finance reform by rejecting support from individual super PACS](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/16/gillibrand-rejects-super-pac-support-1104551),  the 2020 election, she’s appearing at an event at the New York offices of Davis Polk for a discussion on the “current state of politics and her thoughts about 2020.”

It seems like a great event for Davis Polk attorneys, and it is explicitly not a fundraising event. The only downside for politically minded associates seems to be the 8:15 a.m. start time.

# Another Biglaw Firm Gets In On The Associate Raise Action, Though Details Are Sparse
## Firm is moving to market compensation. Probably.

It’s always nice to hear official word from your law firm that raises — in line with the market standard — are on the way. Extra points when the firm commits to market special bonuses. But when Haynes & Boone made their announcement, enough details were omitted that associates, especially those outside of the New York market, have been left scratching their heads.

Let’s dig into what the firm actually said:

Base Compensation: Effective July 1, 2018, an increase in the base compensation level of most of our U.S. associates. In making these adjustments, the Firm is adopting a new associate compensation schedule in line with the prevailing market. As has long been our practice in setting the base compensation for each of our associates outside of New York, we are continuing to take into account that associate’s overall contributions to the Firm, including his or her overall performance and productivity. As a result, an associate may have no or a smaller increase, which will leave his or her base compensation below the amount scheduled for his or her class, although that associates generally will be eligible for a “catch-up” bonus in an amount to make up this difference.

So, the firm’s at least aware of what the market standard is — that’s a start. But associates, again at least those outside of New York, are left to the murky waters of individualized compensation. The firm’s offer of “catch-up” bonuses to make up the difference in salary should an associate hit the productivity goals is an encouraging sign for those still worried about how things will shake out.

And on the bonus front, well, associates aren’t getting anything mid-year (sucks if you were hoping to lateral) but come December, there will be a special bonus:

Additional Special Bonuses: In December, we also will pay a special bonus, in line with the prevailing market, to those full-time associates who, for the trailing 12 months ended November 30, 2018, meet our performance and productivity standards.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”).

I believe this recession will be looked back upon and known as the bursting of the bullshit bubble. All the things that we say we needed, must do, and have no choices about turned out to be bullshit. And, there is no looking back.

— Legal industry advisor Darryl Cross, head of [Rainmaker Fitness](https://rainmakerfitness.com/) and [HighPer Teams](https://www.highpercoaching.com/), commenting on the fact that the way the pandemic [forced the legal industry to shift to successful remote work environments](https://www.law.com/2020/07/06/law-com-trendspotter-the-meaning-of-meeting-has-changed-for-good-and-arguably-for-the-better/) has enlightened the powers that be as to the wonders of virtual meetings and the “bullshit” that is facetime.

# When You Write A Brief So Bad It Gets The Client Fired
## That takes some real skill.

Seyfarth’s now infamous U.S. Soccer Federation brief explaining why [female soccer players deserve less money because they have nicer fans and the audacity to get pregnant](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/u-s-soccer-has-to-pay-men-more-because-playing-for-a-crowd-of-hooligans-is-a-big-responsibility/) managed to cross another threshold on the way to the litigation Hall of Fame: it got the client fired.

[U.S. Soccer president Carlos Cordeiro stepped down yesterday](https://sports.yahoo.com/us-soccer-president-carlos-cordeiro-resign-uswnt-legal-battle-011748970.html) after the organization’s brief started making the rounds. As a reminder, this is a brief that attempted to justify the wage gap between men and women by dissing the women’s game and hyping the “materially higher level of speed and strength required to perform the job of an [men’s] player.” It was a filing so monumentally flawed and stupid that it [takes a real deep dive to fully appreciate how bonkers it was](http://www.yanksarecoming.com/on-equal-pay-u-s-soccers-scorched-earth-sexist-legal-strategy-should-fail).

It was a legal misstep so intense that [all the money behind the organization went out of the way to back the players](https://sports.yahoo.com/mls-commissioner-ussf-vp-sponsors-003457297.html). It’s sad to think that if the sponsors didn’t revolt, this guy would probably still be calling the shots, but they did so let’s close our eyes and pretend this would have happened no matter what.

 Buckle up — today’s going be a busy day in Biglaw.

See, last night the good folks at[ Cravath finally announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/cravath-raises/) associate raises, after [Milbank announced associate raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/milbank-raises-21/) last Thursday and then[ Davis Polk came over the top](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/davis-polk-salary-21/) of those numbers. Meaning the market seems to have coalesced around the new $205,000 standard.

So, the latest firm to get on board is Morgan, Lewis & Bockius. The firm made $2,446,000,000 in gross revenue in 2020, making it 7th on the latest Am Law 100 ranking, and they’re flexing their financial muscles to show it. In a firmwide voicemail, it was announced associate compensation will move to the scale set by Davis Polk last week. New salaries, effective July 1, will range from $205,000 for the class of 2020 to $365,000 for the class of 2013.

# Another Am Law 200 Firm Is On Board With Cost-Cutting Measures

It seems the list of Biglaw firms that have taken an ax to costs due to the economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19 just keeps growing and growing. It probably seems that way because it is true. Since mid-March, every day has brought more news of the austerity measures Biglaw is taking to navigate these troubled waters.

The latest report of Biglaw austerity measures is from Thompson Hine. In 2018, the firm made $221,026,000 in gross revenue making it [137th on the Am Law 200](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=308&name=Thompson-Hine). Now,[ according to reports](https://www.law.com/2020/05/08/pay-cuts-layoffs-and-more-how-law-firms-are-managing-the-pandemic/), Thompson Hine is “aggressively” cutting its non-payroll expenses. The firm has also slashed quarterly partner draws by 15 percent. Staff compensation has also taken a hit of 1.7 percent, annualized.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs/Salary%20Cuts) or text us (646-820-8477).

Not content to let [the transactional and land use attorneys have all the fun](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/disneys-lawyers-are-better-than-ron-desantiss-lawyers/), Disney litigators have stepped up to take a turn at the Ron DeSantis piñata, [filing a lawsuit against the governor in the Northern District of Florida](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/disney-desantis-lawsuit-filed/2/). As they say in the Disney Parks, “[Have a Magical Day, Ron](https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/4471840/the-disney-world-greeting-that-you-never-want-to-hear/).”

The 77-page filing, signed by O’Melveny’s [Dan Petrocelli](https://www.omm.com/professionals/daniel-mario-petrocelli/) and Adam Losey of Losey PLLC as local counsel, with O’Melveny’s [Jonathan Hacker](https://www.omm.com/professionals/jonathan-d-hacker/) and WilmerHale’s [Alan Schoenfeld](https://www.wilmerhale.com/en/people/alan-schoenfeld) also joining the signature block, alleges multiple constitutional violations against the Florida governor and his cronies and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.

As with the land use depantsing DeSantis suffered a few weeks ago, this all comes back to the Reedy Creek Improvement District, the local government overseeing Disney’s land holdings around the Walt Disney World Resort.

After irritating DeSantis by announcing that it would try to [minimize murdering its guests](https://news.wjct.org/state-news/2021-08-24/disney-bucks-desantis-announcing-it-will-require-vaccinations-for-bahamas-cruises) rather than lend performative support for his anti-vaccine policy, Disney pushed the Republican presidential hopeful by expressing disappointment in the state’s “Don’t Say Gay” law.

In — for lack of a better term we’ll go with the one invited by the complaint — retaliation, DeSantis tried destroying Reedy Creek (before someone pointed out that this would [put Florida taxpayers on the hook for massive amounts in outstanding bond obligations](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/harvard-laws-ron-desantis-flunks-disneys-contract-issue-spotter/)), before settling on taking over the Reedy Creek board and populating it with new members like [this guy who thinks tap water makes people gay](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/desantis-disney-appointee-tap-water-turning-people-gay-1234690629/).

With a crackerjack crew like that, you’ll be not at all surprised to learn that they never bothered to perform their most basic legal duties. Failing to check the fully transparent public notices that the prior board was handing over all the entity’s authority to Disney [until the death of King Charles III’s last presently living descendent](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/disneys-lawyers-are-better-than-ron-desantiss-lawyers/), the new board showed up in charge of an entity with no authority at all.

Honestly, how could a guy like this fail so badly?



Unwilling to pull an Elsa and let it go, DeSantis came back with a law to allow the new board to rescind the duly executed deals made by the old board. As competent attorneys, we [warned DeSantis that this had the drawback of being comically illegal](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/ron-desantis-sticks-it-to-woke-disney-with-hilariously-unconstitutional-law-banning-contracts/). As incompetent attorneys, his folks went ahead with it anyway, and his new board voted to nullify the contracts this morning.

This brings us to the present suit!

The first cause of action addressing the Contracts Clause issue we flagged before. Article I, Sec. 10 of the Constitution says “[n]o State shall … pass any … Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts.” The Framers thought any future economy required explicitly assuring businesses that sign deals with state and local governments that they weren’t going to end up getting cheated when Rhode Island pulls a Sheriff of Nottingham and just refuses to honor their deal.

Which is totally what Rhode Island would do if left to its own devices and we all know it.

The complaint next raises a takings clause violation. The Fifth Amendment says “[N]or shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation”  and if the new board could abrogate Reedy Creek’s existing deals with Disney over its own land, making that land less valuable to Disney, it would amount to a taking. Disney obviously prefers it not come to this, but wants a declaratory judgment that Florida needs to fork over big bucks if it ever succeeds in mangling these deals.

Good luck building your competing sad roller coaster when you’re broke! What am I talking about? Well…

Describing what his administration would do with land taken from Disney’s control, he mused, “People are like: ‘What should we do with this land?’ People have said, maybe create a state park, maybe try to do more amusement parks, someone even said, like, maybe you need another state prison. Who knows? I just think that the possibilities are endless[.]” Governor DeSantis warned, “I look forward to the additional actions that the state control board will implement in the upcoming days.”

Yeah, no way anyone will be able to convince a court that this is simply retaliatory!

Unrelated to this suit, but can we just take a second to remember that this all started with DeSantis accusing Disney of not caring about child safety because it objected to a law banning the acknowledgment that some people are gay. Because openly toying with housing a bunch of prisoners (including, presumably, pedophiles) on the border of a children’s park seems like a much better child safety plan.

There’s also a due process claim, as the state passed a law narrowly tailored only to mess with Disney and not only failed to assert a legitimate state interest in this move, DeSantis does the opposite! A little more than a week ago, this utter dumbass was publicly building a record that the state didn’t even have a plan for what it might do with this land.

Here’s the thing: 2024 isn’t yet close enough that DeSantis had to run into this Disney buzzsaw this quickly. He could’ve just sat back, figured out some cockamamie plan for building some deeply needed state park because the state has never properly honored, I don’t know, some Confederate dirtbag that his constituents like. Then he could’ve built a fake case that the park just HAD to be there. And his people would maintain disciplined yet coy messaging that they are appalled that anyone would think this is retaliatory, “this is about honoring General C.G. Blisterbottom and his heroic fight to keep Florida enslaved!” or whatever. And it might be transparent enough to lose in court but it could be remotely plausible at least.

There are people out there who bill this guy as the “smart Trump” and I think I’m offended on Trump’s behalf.

Finally, the complaint rounds out with a couple of First Amendment claims alleging that the state of Florida is infringing on Disney’s free speech right to have an opinion on the anti-gay legislation. One count says the state is doing this by messing with the contracts and the other says the board constitution already did this. My prediction is that 90 percent of the mainstream media coverage will focus on these claims, because the First Amendment is sexy and something they cover in journalism school. These are strong and important claims. But, you know, there’s a reason Disney put those other claims first — those are the paths of least resistance to getting today’s “nullifcation” undone.

Will Disney win? Well, it’s early and we’ve not seen the DeSantis team’s response yet and it’s hard to judge a case just on the complaint.

And also yes.

Few industries have changed over the past several decades as much as the energy industry has. Old standbys like coal have given way to a whole host of renewable resources, while the landscape for oil, gas, and electricity continue to evolve in the face of the dual imperatives of rising energy demand and emissions reduction. New opportunities abound for both upstarts and traditional utilities.

Energy lawyers handle a wide range of transactional and litigation matters, ranging from contract and construction issues to high-stakes regulatory and dispute resolution matters, both domestically and internationally. Clients run the gamut of the industry, including producers, transporters, plant developers, exporters, financers, and funders.

As a primer on the complex ecosystem of law firms servicing the industry, our friends at [Lake Whillans Litigation Finance](http://bit.ly/2CKoc2J) present the Go-To Firms of the Energy Industry. Among them, these firms not only can handle every transactional and litigation need, but also niche areas such as climate change expertise and regulatory matters.

Lake Whillans is there to partner with the full spectrum of industry players, including energy companies and leading law firms. Engaging these Go-To Firms can help energy industry companies avoid or contain problems down the road. Should legal issues arise, Lake Whillans can step in and help resolve them.

1. The Best Global Powerhouse for Energy Law:[ Norton Rose Fulbright](http://bit.ly/2WjZJdG)

With more than 900 attorneys working on energy projects across the globe, it’s hard to rival Norton Rose Fulbright’s reach in the energy industry. The firm’s full-service energy practice is adept at handling a wide range of transactional and regulatory matters involving power, utilities, oil, gas, water, and renewable energies. Whatever your energy needs are, this firm can handle them.

2. Best Firm for Complex Energy Litigation:[ Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP](http://bit.ly/2Mxj0Uq)

When you’re dealing with transactions as large as energy mergers or the construction of power plants, conflicts and disputes are inevitable. If you’re going to survive in the industry, you need trusted litigators on your team. The experienced energy lawyers at Weil have you covered from all sides, from the first day a project comes to life, through the successful conclusion of your litigation. When the stakes are high, this is the firm you want at the counsel table.

3. Best Firm if Your Fortunes Lie in That Black Gold:[ Vinson & Elkins](http://bit.ly/2TdXzu3)

Many firms claim to have oil expertise, but Vinson & Elkins goes the extra mile. Simply having an oil law practice isn’t enough — the firm has separate practice groups dedicated to Downstream Oil and Gas, Midstream Oil and Gas, Upstream Oil and Gas, and Oilfield Services. If oil is your game, Vinson & Elkins is the name you need to know.

4. Best Firm for Companies Looking to Get Into Renewable Energy:[ Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP](http://bit.ly/2MxMO3l)

A longtime player in the industry, Akin Gump is widely recognized as a leader when it comes to financing and developing energy and infrastructure projects. The firm’s Renewable Energy practice is taking that expertise into the next century, offering insight for clients looking to get into the geothermal, biofuel, hydroelectric, solar, wind, and biomass sectors. If your new project involves alternative or renewable energies, this is the firm to call.

5. Best Firm for Energy Exporters:[ Baker Botts](http://bit.ly/2UilLvz)

Universally recognized as one of the top energy law firms in the world, it’s hard to pick just one area where Baker Botts excels. When the powers of their Energy and Natural Resources Practice Group and their International Trade Group combine, however, they become the dream team for energy exporters. Whether you’re dealing with export control laws or international import regulations, this team will make sure you’re compliant at all times.

6. Best Firm for Insider Insights Into the Industry:[ Haynes and Boone, LLP](http://bit.ly/2RR2mow)

Lots of firms can offer expertise and experience, but few can rival Haynes and Boone when it comes to having an inside track on the industry. The firm’s Energy Practice Group is made up of people who have worked their entire careers in the energy arena, and not just as lawyers — they count everything from petroleum engineers and geophysicists to energy bankers and oil and gas law professors among their ranks. If you’re new to the energy world, this is the firm to put you on the right track.

7. Best Firm for Energy Lobbying and Regulatory Matters:[ Bracewell](http://bit.ly/2WleE7f)

Like all major industry sectors, the construction industry always benefits from having an ear in Washington. Bracewell is a recognized leader among law firms when it comes to lobbying and government relations, and their Policy Resolution Group knows The Hill inside and out. The firm’s lawyers bring that expertise to their energy clients, which span all segments of the industry. If you want your concerns heard by the powers that be, Bracewell is the firm for you.

8. Best Firm to Consult on Environmental Matters:[ Baker McKenzie](http://bit.ly/2WleP2p)

Few industries have the potential to impact the environment as much as the energy industry does. Baker McKenzie’s Energy, Mining & Infrastructure group works hand-in-hand with its Environment & Climate Change group to make sure its energy clients are always in compliance with environment laws and regulations across the globe. In a sea of ever-changing global laws and regulations that govern energy companies and projects, you need a firm that can stay on top of the developments and advise you accordingly.

9. Best Firm for Energy Tax Matters:[ Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP](http://bit.ly/2Wlf0e5)

The name Skadden has long been synonymous with excellence, so it should come as no surprise that their diverse energy team is capable of counseling their clients in even the most niche areas of energy law. In addition to the transactional and litigation services offered by other energy firms, Skadden’s attorneys have developed an expertise in energy tax matters. When you need experienced advisors to guide you through the specific tax issues that are most relevant in the energy industry, give Skadden a call.

10. Best Firm to Help Finance Your Next Energy Project:[ Jackson Walker](http://bit.ly/2FYw2sU)

Jackson Walker has been at the forefront of energy law for over a century, and their expertise shines particularly brightly in the area of energy finance. Their depth of financing knowledge covers experience with all kinds of financing arrangements, including liens, credit facilities, loans, note and bond offerings, structured debt, equity investments, hedges, and joint ventures. The firm’s attorneys understand that no two energy projects are the same, so they’re the folks to call when you want financing advice tailored to your specific energy project.

11. Best Firm to Handle Your Security Concerns:[ Hunton Andrews Kurth](http://bit.ly/2Wk0Slu)

Physical security and cybersecurity threats are at an all-time high for companies across all industries, and energy companies are no exception. The Energy Sector Security Team at Hunton Andrews Kurth is well versed in devising the best possible security strategies for infrastructure facilities in the energy industry. If you want to be sure you’re protected during the next natural disaster or cyber attack, this is the firm you want in your corner.

12. Best Jack-of-All-Trades Energy Firm:[ Sidley Austin LLP](http://bit.ly/2CNMqJq)

While some firms specialize in certain aspects of energy law, other firms do it all. Of that latter group, Sidley is undeniably one of the best of the best. Touting a holistic approach to serving their clients in the energy sector, the firm’s energy group draws on the talents of the firm’s other practice groups, from project finance and taxation, to international regulation and dispute resolution. No matter what your energy issue is and no matter where in the world you are, the expert team at Sidley will be able to tackle it.

# Wachtell Partner Is Having None Of Your Bullsh*t During A Freaking Pandemic
## Nothing is normal right now. Not even litigation.

Wachtell partner [William Savitt](https://www.wlrk.com/attorney/wsavitt/) has had just about enough of your BS. After all, there’s a global health crisis going on that means we’re pretty far afield from business as usual.

The co-chair of the litigation department sent a memo to clients earlier this week lashing out against normal litigation practices in “nonessential” cases. Savitt said in the memo he was “dismay[ed]” at the “flood” of trivial cases and motion practice while the rest of the world was trying to deal with the fallout from the spread of coronavirus.

Savitt went on [to tell Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/1256693/wachtell-atty-rips-nonessential-legal-tussles-amid-virus) that life under COVID-19 “requires triage for everyone, including and in some ways especially for lawyers. Lawyers, like everyone else, need to avoid insisting on priority for matters that aren’t urgent, and should avoid filing or pressing fringe cases in this environment.”

Savitt’s incredibly practical advice is that shit is just going to take longer now that everyone is simultaneously also dealing with a pandemic. Instead of clinging to the pre-coronavirus rules, lawyers have to be flexible and understand nothing is going to be “normal” for a while:

“Insisting on rules and schedules that apply in normal times in nonexpedited cases isn’t sensible, because times aren’t normal,” Savitt told Law360. “Everything will take longer in this environment, both because of the massive disruption in the way we are working and the press of newly urgent human and legal business.”

Everyone is doing the best that they can, and it is super important to remember that. As Savitt said, “We all have to take care of each other and that includes in the way we litigate.” And how nice to hear that message from someone at the top of a profession as notoriously cutthroat as Biglaw.

# Jones Day's 'Black Box' Compensation One Step Closer To Being Blown Open
## Litigation against the firm will move forward.

For those of you watching with bated breath the twists and turns of the gender discrimination case against Biglaw firm Jones Day, you’ll be excited to learn that (some) of the claims have survived a motion to dismiss. And the firm’s compensation “black box” is that much closer to being cracked open.

And, for those who need the primer on the case, [the purported class-action](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/plaintiffs-in-jones-day-gender-discrimination-case-want-it-to-be-a-class-action/?rf=1) gender discrimination [case](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/amended-gender-discrimination-case-brings-the-real-scoop-on-jones-day-compensation/) alleges a “fraternity culture” at the firm and unequal pay behind the firm’s notorious “[black box](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/)” compensation system. There are currently six named plaintiffs in the case (there had been seven, but [one anonymous plaintiff dropped out](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/plaintiff-backs-out-of-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-against-jones-day-rather-than-reveal-her-name/?rf=1) rather than reveal her name). The plaintiffs are spread throughout the country — Nilab Rahyar Tolton, Andrea Mazingo, Meredith Williams, and Jaclyn Stahl worked in California offices of the firm, while Saira Draper was an associate in Atlanta, and Katrina Henderson was in the firm’s New York office — and a core allegation is that the same black box compensation systems kept their pay below that of men working at the firm.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2020/05/19/jones-day-must-face-black-box-compensation-and-gender-bias-claims-judge-rules/) Law.com, the hostile work environment allegations, the discrimination claims for pregnant women/mothers, and the Equal Pay Act violations of Tolton, Stahl, and Mazingo were dismissed. But the sex-based disparate impact claims survived, though U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss of the District of Columbia noted the higher burden at summary judgment:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“According to Jones Day, all of plaintiffs’ disparate impact claims fail as a matter of law. Although plaintiffs will, once again, face a far steeper hill at summary judgment, the court is persuaded that they have alleged enough to survive defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings with regard to their sex-based disparate impact claims, but not their pregnancy- or maternity-based disparate impact claims,” Moss wrote.

But that does mean the firm’s “black box” practices will see the light of discovery:

“They have alleged that Jones Day employs a highly centralized, subjective evaluation process in which a consensus statement is prepared by ‘cherry picking’ feedback from some, but not all, evaluations, and in which complaints about compensation decisions are not tolerated,” Moss wrote. “Drawing all reasonable inference in plaintiffs’ favor at this stage of the proceeding, the court cannot accept Jones Day’s conclusion that each of these elements is necessarily capable of separation for analysis. For example, it is the very alleged secrecy and the quashing of complaints that purportedly allowed the disparate impact caused by the centralized, subjective, consensus evaluation system to continue from year to year.”
And on the black box policy, Moss said the plaintiffs “have the better argument” at this stage in the proceedings in claiming that “‘discovery may show that defendant’s processes for associate compensation are “not capable of separation for analysis,” but they ‘need not so prove before discovery.’”

We look forward to seeing exactly how this case develops.

# Law Firms Want Their Money And They Want It Now
## Clients better get ready to be sued if they don't pay up.

The days of being able to say goodbye to $300,000 or more without blinking an eye are gone. You’ve got to have a good reason for writing off six- or seven-figure legal fees. Unless there has been an oversight, a problem with the representation or some other policy reason not to pursue it, you’re seeing more claims to be pursued.

— [Abraham Reich](https://www.foxrothschild.com/abraham-c-reich), chair emeritus of Fox Rothschild, speaking generally on the trend of [fee disputes within the legal industry](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/07/25/unwilling-to-leave-six-figure-legal-fees-on-table-firms-suing-ex-clients-more-frequently/). In recent years, not only has litigation to recoup legal fees increased, but so too has the amount of money contested in these suits. “There was a period of time when people would say, ‘I’m not pursuing a legal claim. Let’s just walk away from it,'” Reich, who advises law firms in malpractice suits, said. “But [law firms] are becoming more of a business. And if the fee is large enough, we do a pretty deep analysis of the nature of representation and the issues of whether there could be a potential claim for malpractice.”

I love the concept of innovation but hate the use of the word, as it stands for so many pointless exercises in futility. I won’t get into them here — if you want to read articles that are well-intentioned but completely useless, subscribe to The Harvard Business Review. There you will get 5,000-word articles with more about innovation and less about useful outcomes than you can stomach, no doubt. Sorry to beat on my alma mater, but they can take it.

Now for law firms …

Let’s start with “What is the purpose of the law firm?” The answer to this is surprisingly difficult to really think about. Peter Drucker says that the purpose of a business is to create a customer.

Note his use of the word create. He doesn’t say, go get a customer. He says you should create one.

I think that applies just fine to a law firm, but there is a tricky little wrinkle to think through: What is our customer?

You might say, “Duh, Bruce, it’s the client,” but if you said that, you would be blowing it. There are two customers for a law firm:

- The clients
2. The lawyers

Those are the customers, and any analysis has to think of both of them. Indeed, today, in New York City, isn’t there a plethora of clients and a shortage of lawyers? A year ago, it was the opposite.

Going back to Drucker now, law firms aren’t here to get clients and get money from them or to get lawyers and bill them out (even if, of course, we have a profit motive); instead, we are here to create clients and create lawyers at the law firm, just like Drucker says.

Innovation should be angled to this purpose, or it is more jejune. For example, technological innovations are hardly game changers. They are more like table stakes.  If you don’t have at least a reasonable ability to crank out documents, blackline them, and shoot them out super fast on email, then you can’t be in the game.  But if you take a step back, cooler or faster or more impressive ways to do the foregoing are not, in my view, going to really create clients.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
I have been around for eons now in the legal world, but I haven’t yet heard of a client coming to a law firm — or leaving a law firm — because its technology was superior or inferior. And although lawyers hate technologically backward law firms, they rarely, if ever, change jobs due to tech and things like that. The exception to the foregoing is for a law firm to be so inferior that the client or the lawyers think the law firm is trapped in the past and should be avoided for that reason.

As an aside, I know you aren’t creating lawyers; my intellectual leap here is to define it so that creating lawyers means attracting and retaining those who work at the law firm and thrive in their careers at the firm.

So how does one create a client or a lawyer?

Now that is a great question, isn’t it? I propose that future (successful) law firms will answer that question very well. And the ones that either never even considered this question or couldn’t answer it will struggle with either failure (or merger into a stronger player) or gradual movement to irrelevancy over time.

So what is the answer — how does one create a client or a lawyer — here are some quick thoughts:

For both lawyers and clients, focus on one industry and be a pure play in that industry. This allows the lawyers and clients to gain legal benefit, business ideas, contacts, and other benefits from interacting with useful counterparties. For example, we focus on real estate as our pure play. I have seen other firms as pure plays in:

- Litigation
- Corporate and securities with IPO’s
- Different specialties
- A full U.S. footprint with offices in almost every state
- A global player with offices in many countries
For lawyers, focus on the heart of why they would want to be at the law firm.  Usually, it is due to a chance to build a career, build a book of business, learn their craft, etc. Our concept is called ATR (standing for Attract, Train, and Retain talent).

For clients, focus on what they want more than anything, which is usually assistance in building their businesses. Clients often think of all the lawyers as a commoditized group; however, we have found that a distinguishing factor is focusing (not on our business goals) but on the client’s.

For (some) clients, focus on relentless cost reduction. For other clients, focus on incredibly high quality. Different clients value different attributes in their lawyers. Some clients value the talents of the lawyers much more than saving money.  However, for other clients, the cost is critical, and for them, being a low-cost producer could be a great advantage.

For lawyers, emphasize lifestyle, culture, and other humanistic elements.

For lawyers and clients, too, emphasize diversity, flexibility, and similar items.

Overall, the point is you don’t want to try to be all things to all people. It just doesn’t work, or at least it rarely works. Instead, there should be some niche — dare I say a power niche — that focuses everyone on what the law firm is all about.

These innovations distinguish the law firms that will have future success from those that I think will struggle.

Marketing in large law used to be more about art than science. Over the last decade, the definition of success for large-law marketing teams has markedly changed. Partners winning awards and being quoted in legal trades still qualifies as marketing success, but it’s no longer enough. As competition has increased and firms struggle to differentiate themselves in a world of actual or perceived commoditization, they have turned to content marketing, competitive intelligence, and data crunching in their marketing and business development efforts to find new clients and expand existing client relationships.

As firms have transformed their marketing and business development functions, they have begun to recognize that they already have within the firm the core competencies necessary to be successful with a more scientific approach to winning business. However, these competencies often don’t sit in the marketing or business development teams, but instead are housed in their libraries. As I spend time with our customers, some interesting trends and patterns are noticeable.

Recognizing that the library has limited bandwidth and is often busy analyzing trends, crunching data, and conducting research on client projects involving the practice of law, more firms are creating parallel groups in their libraries to help drive competitive intelligence, business development and marketing. These groups leverage many of the same competencies as the groups involved in collaborating with their attorney colleagues on client matters. More and more, these groups are taking the lead on leveraging technology to drive relevant data and intelligence to all areas of the firm.

Firms are also building competitive intelligence functions within their libraries. Output from these groups is, among other things, fueling marketing and business development efforts. However, competitive intelligence is only part of the picture. As more and more firms have access to similar data, the library function is taking the lead on helping colleagues stay ahead of their competitors on both practice of law and business of law issues. A critical element of this is figuring out the right questions to ask, a subject that legal blogger Jean O’Grady focused on in her [column](http://deweybstrategic.blogspot.com/2013/09/big-data-means-big-noise-without-right.html) regarding whether it is time for firms to have a chief query officer.

Historically, the library at firms has rolled up to the CIO, CKO, CFO or a managing or administrative partner. At some firms, the head librarian has evolved into a chief knowledge officer. Lately, I have noticed a new trend affecting law firm libraries. (“Trend” may be too strong a term for it—I am only aware of four of the 50 largest firms in the county who have undertaken it.) But I bring it up here because they are forward-thinking firms, and because this “trend” may reveal something about the changing perspective of law firms. The new development is this: some law firms have placed their libraries, organizationally speaking, under chief marketing officers.

This is a new kind of thinking. Law firm libraries have always been major assets for partners and associates in providing strong practice of law results to their clients. However, the library was not often perceived to be a key component in a firm’s marketing or business development machinery. But to those immersed in the profession today, and for those who believe marketing is most effective when it involves valuable, data-driven content, there is logic behind having the library and the marketing department working closely together.

To differentiate themselves, law firms have begun actively producing thought leadership, content marketing (including research), and academic-style studies on topics of interest to their clients. Such materials allow firms to show their mastery of a subject and differentiate themselves while teaching their clients and prospects something new. Of course, producing those materials often calls for analyzing and drawing insights out of raw data and information, which is the stock in trade of law firm librarians. And in that way, the library has become critical to some law firms’ marketing and business development efforts.

Of course, law firm libraries and librarians are still vital to the actual practice of law. That will never change. What has changed is this: getting business in the door deserves a greater emphasis than ever before, and data and research are more useful in that task than ever.

They know that if their associates are unhappy in even the slightest of ways, that they’ll be welcomed with open arms (and big, fat signing bonuses) at a new firm at exponential speed. That’s why Biglaw firms are throwing money at associates in every way imaginable, ranging from raises to special bonuses to retention bonuses and now referral bonuses.

That’s right, in their endless search for talent, referral bonuses are now trending once again at firms of all sizes across the country.

Know someone at another firm who you think would fit in at your current firm? Great! You get a referral bonus. Lateraling to another firm and think some of your colleagues would like to join you? Super! You get a referral bonus too.

The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/11/10/amid-unprecedented-talent-market-referral-bonuses-make-a-return-405-94399/) has some additional details on this trend:

[Montgomery McCracken Walker & Rhoads managing partner Steven] Pachman said midsize and large firms around the country are using such incentives to save money on headhunters and recruit lateral groups with preexisting rapport. As his firm’s trustee for the U.S. Law Firm Group, a consortium of 17 firms sharing best practices, Pachman said he learned at the group’s fourth-quarter meeting this year that the majority of member firms employ referral bonuses.

“This is one of the hottest lateral markets that I’ve seen in years, maybe the hottest lateral market since I’ve been an attorney,” Pachman said. “Montgomery McCracken is totally committed to investing in top talent across the board, at the partner and associate level.”

But just how much are firms willing to pay out as referral bonuses? While some firms are offering around $5,000 a pop for their referring lawyers, others are offering referral fees of up to $25,000. How much is your firm offering in referral cash during one of the hottest lateral markets of all time?

# Recruiting Firms Join Forces To Become Go-To Headhunters For Elite Biglaw Firms

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

With or without Johnson Downie and Lippman Jungers, the Am Law 50 will become the Am Law 15 over the next decade or two, with the world’s strongest firms getting stronger. Our hope is that we’re picking the winners in Big Law.

— Clint Johnson, founder of recruiting firm Johnson Downie, in comments noted by the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/03/08/big-law-recruiting-firms-merge-aiming-to-form-one-stop-shop-for-the-am-law-20/) on his firm’s recent combination with headhunting firm Lippman Jungers. The to-be-named firm hopes to become the go-to recruiter for the most elite law firms in the country. “Our goal is to become the one-stop shop for the Am Law 20 for all of their most important needs,” Lippman Jungers co-founder Sabina Lippman said.
