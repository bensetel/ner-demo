Back in December, we launched [Above the Law bonus alerts](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/where-are-the-biglaw-bonuses-associate-bonus-watch-day-2/). Thousands of readers signed up to receive real-time notifications of the latest Biglaw bonus news.

Given the heavy overlap between bonuses and salaries, we are now expanding the bonus alerts to include notifications of firms matching the [Cravath $180K scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/). Current subscribers to the bonus alerts will automatically get notified of base salary raises as well.

If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. If you didn’t sign up but would now like to receive alerts for bonus and salary news, please sign up by entering your email address below. (And if you currently get the alerts but want to stop getting them, simply click the “unsubscribe” link in an alert.)

# Associate Bonus Watch: Skadden Seems To Be Falling In Line
## It's not a party until Skadden shows up.

Skadden, as is its tradition, is sending around individualized bonuses memos today. Our tipsters from a number of class years are reporting numbers in line with [the Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2017-associate-bonuses/).

So, if you work at Skadden, Major League rules apply: [“You don’t want to celebrate in front of a guy who just died.”](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/cb9813a9-aaab-4ed2-8dc0-fc462d36c051) If you received more than the Cravath scale, you are special. Congratulations on all your success. If you received less, I don’t know what to tell you. It’s not business, it’s totally personal, the firm doesn’t like you and gave you a crappy bonus.

For me, the bonus scale doesn’t get set until Skadden comes out. That’s because I’m old and [I remember 2008](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/11/associate-bonus-watch-here-comes-skadden/?rf=1). As the Great Recession was wreaking havoc on clients and eventually their law firms, Skadden came out with a bonus payment twice as high as Cravath. All the other Biglaw firms, predictably, followed the lower Cravath scale. That was a long time ago, but I always remember that Skadden at least has the capability of marching to the beat of its own drum. It doesn’t have to slavishly follow Cravath. It can do what it thinks is right.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
This year, it thinks it’s right to just follow Cravath.

That makes sense. With this year’s bonus season playing out almost exactly like last year’s, despite the fact that the stock market is exploding upwards, everything feels like we’re in a giant holding pattern. Is the economy really doing this well? Are we living in a Mnuchin/Cohen fueled bubble that will burst into a thousand tears if Congress actually passes this tax plan? Will it burst if Congress doesn’t pass the tax plan?

The American government has been functionally destabilized. Who can really know what the 2018 economy is going to look like. For now, the safe move from firms with financial security is to hold the line, repeat what worked last year, and wait and see what happens.

In any event, congrats to Skadden attorneys. Except for that one guy who should take his below-market bonus as an indication to update his LinkedIn profile.

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. Remember: as soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. You can also text us at 646-820-8477. We look forward to hearing from you.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

# Another Top 50 Am Law Firm Cuts Its Global Work Force
## Better to have worked and lost in Biglaw than to have never worked at all.

While a little early to say that layoffs are trending, there is without question a new data point.

Reed Smith, a firm that brought in $1,417,599,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 29 on The American Lawyer’s 2023 Am Law 100 ranking — announced that it will be cutting about 2% of its global workforce.

According to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/06/14/reed-smith-cuts-global-workforce-by-50-to-address-demand-slump/), the cuts have impacted around 50 employees — about 20 staff members and 30 lawyers. As bad as it is to get cut from a firm, the good news is that those impacted will not be left cut and dry. From [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/06/14/reed-smith-cuts-global-workforce-by-50-to-address-demand-slump/):

Impacted individuals at Reed Smith are being offered individualized severance benefits as well as outplacement services, according to the firm’s statement on the cuts. Severance packages for affected individuals are based on seniority, ranging from two to four months of benefits.

The firm gave the expected explanation that the layoffs are a consequence of “a reduced level of demand for legal services across the industry”, but it is worth noting that [Reed Smith was doling out layoffs even back when many other competing firms in the tier were hiring](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-firm-eliminates-jobs-for-second-time-in-a-year/). Market instability aside, Reed remains one of the [best firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/the-first-biglaw-firm-to-offer-billable-diversity-hours-for-all-timekeepers/) to work at [when you aren’t stuck at a courthouse telling shareholders which door they’re supposed to go to](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/two-of-reed-smiths-finest-will-be-stuck-on-human-directional-duty/).

Best of luck to those who are being let go from Reed Smith.

About three years ago, Quinn Emanuel made big waves when the firm announced that it would be [culling its traditional summer associate program](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/biglaw-firm-decimates-summer-associate-program/) in favor of recruiting third-year law students and federal judicial clerks. Three years before that, Quinn Emanuel made even bigger waves when the firm [stopped conducting traditional on-campus interviews](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/03/quinn-emanuel-takes-a-new-approach-to-on-campus-recruiting/) in favor of “fun, freewheeling ‘get to know you’ part[ies].”

After six years of marching to the beat of its own drum, Quinn Emanuel is changing its tune once again, but this time, instead of doing something wildly different, the firm will be doing the same thing as almost every other Biglaw firm in the country. This fall, Quinn Emanuel will be coming to a top law school near you to recruit second-year law students for summer associate positions at the firm.

Why the change of heart? Meghan Tribe of [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/05/29/quinn-emanuel-rebuilds-summer-associate-program-with-on-campus-recruiting/) has the scoop:

“We found that somebody who’s a 3L in law school is probably a bit closer to [identifying litigation as their area of focus] than 2Ls, and certainly people who have already completed federal clerkships are there already,” said Jennifer Barrett, administrative partner of Quinn Emanuel’s New York office.

“But with that being said, we did re-evaluate, and we recognize that there are really fantastic second-year law students who do know that they want to focus on litigation, and we certainly don’t want to leave those people on the table,” Barrett said.

Last year, Quinn Emanuel had six summer associates, this year, the firm has 20 summer associates, and according to Barrett, next year, the firm hopes to hire two or three times as many summer associates as are in this year’s class. Quinn Emanuel will be heading to 19 law schools in an effort to recruit 40 to 60 summer associates.

Do you have what it takes to score a summer gig at Quinn Emanuel? You’ll find out this fall. Best of luck, and make sure you wear your finest [flip-flops](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/08/summer-is-ending-but-flip-flops-are-still-hot-at-quinn-emanuel/).

Yesterday, thanks to the recently released [National Law Journal 500 ranking](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/the-500-largest-law-firms-in-america-2023/), we found out which U.S.-centric Biglaw firms were the biggest of them all in terms of headcount. As a companion piece to the NLJ 500, we’ll now delve into the NLJ Women’s Scorecard, a ranking of the percentage of female attorneys and percentage of female partners at the largest 350 firms in the country.

For the purposes of this ranking, equity and nonequity partners were counted as partners, with staffing counts based on a firm’s average number of full-time equivalent attorneys in 2022. Temporary and contract attorneys aren’t included in the count. For a tie, the higher rank is awarded to the firm with more female equity partners.

As noted by the [National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2023/06/20/women-attorneys-defining-purpose-balance-and-flexibility/), women did well in law firms in 2022:

Looking at the responding firms as a group, women comprised nearly 40% of all the 151,000 attorneys included in the report. Women made up almost 24% of 34,300 equity partners, about 27% of 61,718 total partners, and nearly 50% of 72,444 associates.

Compared to the previous year’s report, the group increased female attorney representation about 1%, while female equity partner representation increased 1.1%, female partner representation rose 0.8%, and female associate representation ticked up 0.7%.

“There is a ton of momentum given the number of women graduating from law school, yet a lot of firms still have room to grow and create an environment that is conducive to women having a work-life balance that allows them to have robust careers and families,” [Nicole Dawson, chief people officer of Berry Appleman & Leiden,] said.

Without further ado, here is the NLJ Women’s Scorecard Top 10 for 2023:

- Berry Appleman & Leiden
- Fragomen
- Kubicki Draper
- Kaufman Borgeest & Ryan
- Cole Scott & Kissane
- Littler Mendelson
- Manning Gross + Massenburg
- Kelley Kronenberg
- Wood Smith Henning & Berman
- Constangy Brooks Smith & Prophete
You may be wondering where the largest, namebrand Biglaw firms appear on this list. While the majority of the top 30 firms on the scorecard have a headcount of about 300 or less, there were some exceptions, with Fragomen, Littler, Ogletree, Jackson Lewis, Cooley, Willkie Farr, Ropes & Gray, Lewis Brisbois, and Davis Wright Tremaine,  all making an appearance.

Congratulations to all of the firms that succeeded in boosting their ranks in this year’s Women’s Scorecard by placing women in leadership roles and fostering a pipeline of female and diverse attorneys.

# Yet Another Biglaw Firm Matches Cravath, And Associates Are Thrilled
## 'It's a miracle,' said one associate.

Associates at some firms are getting pretty anxious. Almost everyone else has heard about raises. What could the hold-up possibly be? Don’t worry,  your raise (of some sort) is probably on the way, so just keep waiting patiently… if you think you can, that is.

Speaking of raises, it looks like Baker Botts, a firm that came in at No. 64 in the most recent Am Law 100, has finally decided to weigh in during the latest round of salary wars. What’ll it be? It’s a Cravath match! “It’s a miracle,” said one source who apparently thought this day would never come.

This is what the new salary scale looks like at Baker Botts:



These salary hikes are retroactive not to January 1, but March 1, and associates are pretty ticked off about it. Nonetheless, congrats to everyone at the firm.

(Flip to the next page to see the memo from Baker Botts.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post.

# Will More Biglaw Firms Follow Dentons And Leave China?
## Dentons may be the first Western firm to fall.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Dentons is not the first professional services firm practicing law to pull out of China. It is not going to be the last. Given the conditions, which make it virtually impossible to practice there as a Western firm and comply with the laws and regulations, it wouldn’t be unsurprising if other firms follow suit.

— Kent Zimmermann, a U.S.-based principal at Zeughauser Group, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/international-edition/2023/08/08/will-dentons-china-breakup-trigger-a-domino-effect/), concerning Dentons’ withdrawal from its combination with Dacheng in China due to [government regulatory issues](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/dentons-dacheng-break-up/). “The solution may be exactly what Dentons is doing—to have an independent Chinese firm with which the Western firm has a close relationship, but they’re independent entities,” he said.

# Partners Forced Out As Biglaw Firm Considers Strategic Shift, It's Reportedly A 'Bloodbath Over There'

Four partners in the London office of Ropes & Gray are being forced out following a strategic shift in the firm’s direction.

This is according to a [report](https://www.legalweek.com/2018/09/11/four-partners-to-leave-ropes-in-london-as-firm-rethinks-city-focus/) from Legal Week — where they use the delightful euphemism “managed exit” to describe the move — which says the downsizing will come from the firm’s real estate and restructuring-related teams, and the partners will formally depart from the Biglaw firm over the next several months:

Multiple sources have told Legal Week that the quartet are set to leave following discussions with firmwide management, who travelled into London last week from the US.

All four partners, who Legal Week has decided not to name, work across the firm’s restructuring-related and real estate groups. It is understood they met with management on Friday (7 September) and are expected to leave over the coming months.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
This is in addition to the planned retirement of  international real estate investments and transactions group partner, Iain Morpeth, who will depart the firm at the end of the year.

This new focus for the firm has left some knowledgable about the situation concerned:

One former partner said of the exits: “It seems like a bit of a bloodbath over there at the moment. It has for a long time. The last two years have been shaky.”

Wondering exactly what has been going on at the firm? Well, the London office of Ropes has seen its fair share of notable departures over that time frame, including former office co-founder Maurice Allen, investment funds partners Monica Gogna and Anand Damodaran (they went to Dechert and Kirkland & Ellis, respectively), finance partners Mark Wesseldine and Fergus Wheeler (who joined King & Spalding), and a 100-person patent prosecution team (which became Haley Guiliano).

From Pilot and Above The Law  
As also noted by Legal Week, the partner compensation system at the firm is designed as a black box, which assists the firm in carefully discarding partners without formally asking them to leave:

Ropes has previously faced criticism from ex-partners about its black box remuneration system, which makes it relatively easy for management to encourage people towards the door by docking pay in their annual review without actively asking them to leave.

Last year, Ropes enjoyed a 7.5 percent increase in total firm revenue, and the London office enjoyed its most successful year to date.

# Piping Hot New Bonuses, Fresh From The Biglaw Oven

I was about to open this post with a butcher and candlemaker joke and then realized that’s how I kicked off [last year’s](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/baker-botts-raises-21/) Baker Botts announcement. There really are only so many cheesy jokes to make.

Anyway, nothing says lovin’ like bonuses from the oven (oh jeez, that’s the joke I made [for Pillsbury in 2016](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/nothin-says-lovin-like-180k-in-your-paycheck/)). Let’s just power through this… the firm ranks 65th in the Am Law 100 and grossed $723,228,000 in 2021.

Here are the numbers for associates and special counsel working in the US offices:



These will be payable on December 31. Those outside the US will hear individually about bonuses.

Congrats.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

# Trump May Be Gone, But His Trade War Isn’t
## Many businesses have already altered their supply chains, and slugging it out on trade for several years with China did not create fertile ground for cooperation.

Most economists do not believe that blunt protectionist trade policies stand to ultimately benefit American workers and American businesses.

But that certainly didn’t stop Donald Trump’s administration [from implementing an escalating series of tariffs against China](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2021/05/20/trumps-tariffs-were-much-more-damaging-than-thought/?sh=42303f0565bd).

In January of 2018, the Trump administration imposed tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines, and the next month it also announced new steel and aluminum tariffs.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

The trade war swiftly escalated in March of 2018, with China announcing its own set of tariffs on 128 U.S. exports. May of 2018 saw the Trump White House announcing additional tariffs, and China again retaliated in June of 2018 with more tariffs of its own.

This pattern of increasingly ratcheted up retaliatory tariffs continued for months.

Some of the tariffs indeed benefited workers in some sectors. But benefits for these few came at the expense of many others.

For instance, [the trade war cost U.S. consumers about $817,000 in higher prices for each job created in the washing machine industry](https://www.brookings.edu/policy2020/votervital/did-trumps-tariffs-benefit-american-workers-and-national-security/), according to one study; in the steel industry, each job created by the tariffs cost American consumers $900,000. Spending nearly seven figures to create a job with a five-figure salary is hardly good economics.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Another recent study [found that Trump’s U.S.-China trade policies ultimately cost the American economy close to a quarter of a million jobs](https://carnegieendowment.org/chinafinancialmarkets/83746). The Congressional Budget Office concluded that the trade barriers imposed by the Trump administration since January of 2018 [reduced average real household income by $580 in 2020](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55576), in addition to shrinking the U.S. GDP by nearly a third of a percent.

Of course, [despite his many claims to the contrary](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/06/27/barr-describes-rift-trump-rift-over-election-fraud-claim-interviews/5365066001/), Donald Trump lost the election in 2020. Joe Biden is now the president. Given the deleterious effect the Trump tariffs had on the U.S. economy, they would seem to be destined for Uncle Joe’s growing policy scrap pile as he cleans house.

But undoing years of trade conflict isn’t as simple as stopping construction on a wall that Mexico definitely did not pay for. Many businesses have already altered their supply chains, and slugging it out on trade for several years with China did not create fertile ground for cooperation. [Most of the higher tariffs implemented during Trump’s term remain in place](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/18/us-companies-bearing-the-brunt-of-trumps-china-tariffs-says-moodys.html).

Biden [has promised not to enter into any new international trade agreements](https://www.brookings.edu/policy2020/votervital/did-trumps-tariffs-benefit-american-workers-and-national-security/) until ushering in what he calls “major investments here at home, in our workers and our communities.” Meanwhile, though, [the Biden administration is rebuilding relationships with traditional U.S. allies](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/biden-tells-nyt-columnist-he-wont-immediately-remove-trumps-tariffs-on-china.html) in order to “develop a coherent strategy” when collectively confronting China on trade. Some nations are already paying a steep price for doubling down on their relationship with the U.S. Exports to China from Australia, for example, [dropped by $2.3 billion in 2020](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/australia-embraces-u-s-pays-price-china-trade-war-hits-n1270458). While Covid no doubt played a role in the 2020 decrease in Australian exports to one of its biggest trading partners, the drop was also due in part to Australia’s heightening public support of the U.S. in its trade dispute with China.

International trade is complex, and there were many legitimate underlying trade concerns which led to the Trump administration’s trade war against China. Even so, most experts agree that the escalating tariffs were the wrong way to deal with U.S.-China trade tensions. The Trump tariffs cost U.S. consumers and businesses far more than they were worth in the long run.

Now, however, Biden is more focused on domestic issues. The trade policies his administration has pursued thus far are subtle, [like building supply chains that do not depend so heavily on Chinese links](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/06/22/biden-semiconductors-south-korea-china-trade-war/). But given time, after rebuilding international support from traditional U.S. allies, hopefully the new administration can confront the U.S.-China trade relationship more directly. The steep tariffs implemented under the Trump administration are an economic hurdle that U.S. businesses and consumers should not have to keep contending with.

# Holy Moly! An 'Incestuous' Law Firm Merger For Foley?
## This Biglaw firm might as well be marrying its law firm cousin.

The Foley Friedman law firm family circle?

Almost two years ago, Foley & Lardner left Eversheds [standing at the altar](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/foley-lardner-to-leave-eversheds-standing-at-the-altar/). Since then, the U.K. firm has partnered with Sutherland Asbill & Brennan to become [Eversheds Sutherland](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/whirlwind-romance-leads-to-global-biglaw-merger/), but Foley still finds itself all alone.

Single and ready to mingle once more, it looks like Foley has found the perfect merger match in Friedman Kaplan Seiler & Adelman, a New York litigation boutique with strong ties to Foley. In fact, Friedman Kaplan has so many ties to Foley that the Biglaw firm might as well be marrying its law firm cousin. As we [mentioned](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/morning-docket-04-26-17/) earlier today, the whole affair seems to be a bit “incestuous.”

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Don’t believe us? Here’s more information from [Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202784349808/Foley--Lardner-Explores-Union-With-New-Yorks-Friedman-Kaplan):

Friedman Kaplan, a 46-lawyer boutique that handles mainly litigation, has strong ties to Foley & Lardner. The latter opened in New York back in 2004 after [absorbing New York litigation firm Friedman, Wang & Bleiberg](http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2004/06/28/daily19.html). Peter Wang, a name partner at that firm, currently serves as managing partner of Foley & Lardner’s New York office. [Wang’s son](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/14/style/weddings-celebrations-amy-lief-jeffrey-wang.html), Jeffrey Wang, is a litigator [who made partner](http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/id=1202483796196/NY-Lawyers-Making-Partner) at Friedman Kaplan in 2011. And the family connections don’t stop there.

Jonathan Friedman, [a son](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/12/fashion/weddings/12burgess.html) of Friedman Kaplan founding partner Edward Friedman, is currently senior counsel with Foley & Lardner’s litigation and dispute resolution group in New York. (Arthur Friedman, a former Friedman Wang name partner who [died at 79 in 2006](http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/id=900005452041), is unrelated to the other Friedmans.) Foley & Lardner and Friedman Kaplan, which have been adverse on some client matters, are [currently working together representing](http://www.law360.com/florida/articles/913116/timber-co-will-pay-73m-to-end-stock-drop-suit) forestry company Rayonier Inc. in securities litigation in a Florida federal court.

Mum is apparently the word on this potential merger, as no one from either firm was willing to or available to comment. Luckily, you can legally marry your cousin in New York, so Foley should be in the clear for this would-be merger. Best wishes!

UPDATE (12/21/2016, 10:55 a.m.): Thanks, Kirkland tipsters, for all the [additional data points on K&E bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/update-bunches-of-kirkland-and-ellis-above-market-bonus-news/).

Kirkland & Ellis has started spreading holiday cheer, making calls and scheduling meetings with associates to inform them of exactly where they sit on K&E’s naughty and nice list. The good news is that associates seem to be getting above-market bonuses. The bad news is that we don’t know if these reports are universal or not.

Because, of course, Kirkland is one of those firms that distributes its bonuses individually, making it harder to report on. But with your help we’ll bust this closed system wide open. If you’re at Kirkland, let us know what you’re getting or what you’re hearing from others. We keep everything anonymous and we’ll obscure identifying details.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
But until we get more intel, here’s what the first tipsters have reported:

Midlevel with above class rating, 2400-2500 hours. Got 1.3x market. Not thrilled. People with a lower rating and sub-2000 hours are still getting above market bonuses, which is great for them, but I feel like a sucker for working harder.

But work is its own reward! This is precisely why I never liked individualized bonuses. With a lockstep system, everyone feels like they’re treated fairly even if the fickle billable gods mean you work 2500 hours one year and merely 2100 the next.

Kirkland associates getting bonus calls and meetings. As always, individualized, but medians are over market. Class of 2011, average hours… just north of $100k.

# New York Biglaw Firms May Be Signaling Trouble Ahead By Not Beating Market Bonuses
## This conservative bonus season may be just the beginning....

A lot of firms are trying to be more conservative given the question of what 2023 will look like. There is a lot of partner talk about uncertainty and a feeling that a slowdown is coming. Some firms might be trying to flesh out their fiscal year and calm partner nerves.

But I have been surprised that we haven’t seen more New York firms jump into the bonus game. I suspect most of those firms will have strong financial results in terms of revenue per lawyer and profits per partner. Those high-performing, elite firms don’t want to be accused of experiencing significant growth in partner compensation and not passing that down to associates.

Well, well, well. It looks like it’s finally time for DLA to pay the Piper. See what I did there? Two can play at this game, Joe Patrice!

As we just heard from numerous sources, DLA Piper has decided to match the new prevailing market salary scale that was set by Davis Polk just last week.

Here’s what the new salary scale looks like at the firm, in each of its U.S. offices (DLA delineates salaries up to the Class of 2012+; it is only the third firm to do so):

- 2020: $205,000
- 2019: $215,000
- 2018: $240,000
- 2017: $275,000
- 2016: $305,000
- 2015: $330,000
- 2014: $350,000
- 2013: $365,000
- 2012+: $375,000
In all seriousness, perhaps associates owe a debt of gratitude to DLA. Back in March, the firm was the [first to increase salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/dla-piper-2021-salary-raise/) outside of major markets, putting all associates on the then-prevailing $190K pay scale. Several firms quickly followed in the firm’s footsteps, righting their payscales. Prior to DLA’s move on salaries, no one else was even thinking of doing such a thing, much less instituting a major raise such as the one offered by Milbank, that was later one-upped by Davis Polk. Thanks to America’s No. 3 firm for planting this idea in the minds of law firm leaders.

Congratulations to everyone working across the country at DLA Piper!

# We Need To Be More Open As A Profession

“Transparent” is applied in all kinds of settings, being thrown around like a Frisbee (yes, I am dating myself), and as the desired “new normal” in all kinds of settings, including maybe even ours.

So here’s to transparency within our profession. Addiction of whatever kind, depression, stress, all of them have long been kicked under the rug. It’s always been a badge of shame to be transparent and candid about whether you have an issue or a colleague has an issue. It’s always been something not even whispered about, let alone lent itself to any candor. It’s been a code of silence. But now, ever so slowly, I think those issues are starting to be discussed. It’s time to be open and forthright about those issues that affect more than one quarter of our colleagues. That number is probably low because I think stigma attaches to candor.

Brian Cuban, an ATL columnist, has been very upfront with his struggles against addiction and depression. Just type his name in the ATL search box and a bunch of his columns pop up. Last year, he shared the story of Arizona lawyer Chad Anderson who [refused to be anonymous](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/i-am-a-lawyer-in-recovery-and-i-refuse-to-be-anonymous/) about his battle with alcoholism.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Our mental health and substance abuse issues can no longer be ignored. If they exist in Biglaw, you can bet they’re in smaller size firms and solos. How many lawyers have prescriptions for anxiety meds, for sleeping aids, for anti-depressants, and [whatever else might be prescribed](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/biglaws-big-problem-with-mental-health-and-substance-abuse/)?

This is not a problem that just other people have; this is a problem that we have and the more transparent we are, the better off we will be, in serving our clients, our firms, and I think most importantly (heresy here) ourselves. 

We need more lawyers like Steven Wall, a Biglaw partner, who [talked about his struggle with alcoholism](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/biglaw-managing-partner-opens-up-about-alcoholism/). Wall nails it when he says that law firms of whatever size depends upon their human capital to grow and flourish and that the wellness of lawyers and support staff is critical to success. Firms are not books of business; they are the human capital that generates and services the business.

As a number of ATL columnists, including me, have pointed out, suicides among lawyers are not going down, but up. The stress and anxiety of the need to do everything perfectly, at least in that lawyer’s mind and others, creates a toxic environment for that lawyer. We practice law; we don’t perfect it, and I think that gets lost in the shuffle of billable hours, networking, pro bono and the myriad other tasks we do. And that doesn’t even take into account personal lives (gee, do we have them?), family matters, raising kids, perhaps taking care of elderly parents and/or adult kids, stressors of a different sort but equally valid and present.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Lawyers who are no longer practicing law, not retired but doing something else, identify themselves as “recovering lawyers.” Perhaps there’s something to that, and not just in the mental health/substance abuse sense.

So much of our identity is cloaked in our professional image and reputation.  What if we weren’t lawyers anymore? Then what would we be? We would be people, spouses, parents, children, friends, volunteers, whatever other labels we choose. It wouldn’t be just about being lawyers. It would be about being people who happen to make their livings as lawyers. But for so many of us, being a lawyer is what we are all about and there’s no room for anything else, or, in many cases, for anyone else. A pop quiz: how would you describe yourself if not as a lawyer?

One of the best benefits of writing this column is the emails from thoughtful readers who contribute to my thinking, change it, rearrange it. One reader correctly pointed out that it’s not just perfectionism that creates stress and anxiety for lawyers, it’s the ambiguity that by definition is baked into what we do. We don’t know how a judge is going to rule, we don’t know if a judgment will be overturned on appeal, we don’t know how a jury is going to look at the evidence, the witnesses, even the lawyers, we can’t predict what may happen, we don’t know how a client will react. All of these unpredictables create ambiguity, create anxiety, create stress.  

Being a lawyer requires a tolerance for ambiguity, which is something no one talks about while in law school. No one talks about the daily issues of practice. Yes, there are legal clinics in law school, but no one talks about how difficult practice is and how to cope with it. Billing, collecting, networking, doing the work, relationships (or lack thereof) with opposing counsel, managing staff, running the office and so on, a far from exhaustive list.

The reader also noted that while it may be Biglaw mental health/suicides that garner attention, it’s not just Biglaw. Solos kill themselves, ditto lawyers in small and/or medium-sized firms. No size firm has a lock on depression and despair.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Another point the reader made: we don’t know the true reasons why lawyers kill themselves, any more than we know why any person commits suicide, but we do know that lawyers kill themselves. We must acknowledge substance abuse and mental health issues and do what we can to help save the lives of our colleagues whose anguish can become too much to bear.  

My generation of lawyers may be dinosaurs, but none of us, at whatever stage we are in our practices, should be ostriches. 

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for more than 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

Well, it’s a wrap. [CES](https://www.ces.tech/), the massive, annual consumer electronics show, is now history. To say it’s an extravaganza of epic proportions when it comes to trade shows doesn’t do it justice. It completely subsumes Las Vegas for about a week, from the Convention Center on one end of the strip to the Mandalay Bay Resort on the other. And all points in between.

I have been attending for many years mainly to see what’s up in the consumer section that may impact legal, whether it be apps, products, or, frankly, ideas. This year did not disappoint. I’ve been covering the show for Above the Law the past week and have [offered several posts](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/stephen-embry/) on events and products relevant to legal. Now that the show is over and I have returned to reality, here are my top 10 overall impressions — both legal related and in general.

- Some Statistics
First, some statistics, courtesy of the [Consumer Technology Association](https://www.cta.tech/) (CTA), which owns and holds the show. There were over 4,300 exhibitors displaying their wares in various locations. 1,000 of these exhibitors were startups (CTA calls them the world’s “most promising tech pioneers”) housed in the basement of the Venetian Resort known as Eureka Park. Altogether, there were over 135,000 attendees at the show this year. I don’t know if that’s an attendance record. But it certainly felt like we were long past the pandemic pause. The lines were just as long as ever, and even though Las Vegas is a large city used to large conventions, CES was certainly crowded. Everywhere.

- The Exhibitors
Although the numbers suggest there were lots of startups in Eureka Park, it felt like the exhibit space was dominated more than ever by the big players. Samsung. LGE. Panasonic. The exhibit spaces occupied by these and other giants offered more of a performance than information. Let’s face it: It better be good when you have to stand in line for 30 minutes to get into the exhibit space of an industry behemoth. But while these big players had more space, it seemed like the smaller players that used to occupy the South Hall of the Convention Center were not as prevalent. That’s a shame because these are the people I loved talking to for their ideas and passion.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

- The Exhibit Spaces
CES is technically a consumer product show, but it’s much broader than that. You see this when you look at the layout of the exhibit halls. Perhaps the largest area of exhibit space, for example, is devoted to automotive products. Not only are electric and self-driving cars on display but also all sorts of component parts are exhibited. It’s been said that CES is the world’s largest automotive show. From the looks of things, it may be. Other large sections of exhibit space are devoted to health, the home, appliances, televisions (of course), and various and sundry other electronic products. While the exhibit spaces are organized by and large by type of product, it’s still hard to see it all. And it takes some searching to see those things that could be relevant to the legal marketplace.

- The Keynotes
The keynote speakers were the usual array of CEOs of industry leaders. These companies include Intel, Siemens, Qualcomm, Walmart, and others. The CEO of Microsoft even made a guest appearance in the Walmart keynote, which I discussed in a [previous post](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/01/navigating-gen-ai-in-legal-insights-from-ces-and-a-dash-of-tequila-thinking/). However, this year’s keynotes seemed a little longer on sales and shorter on ideas and inspiration. I always enjoy the keynotes to hear the leaders of industry talk about the way they approach leadership, innovation, and challenge. And, frankly, to be inspired. Indeed, there was some of that, as my post indicated. I just wish there had been more.

- Gen AI

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Ahhh, Gen AI, who could forget it. Preshow, it was predicted that CES2024 would be all about Gen AI and not much else. Indeed, there was a lot of Gen AI hype, but honestly, it was not as much as I expected. The discussions and marketing were more about what the products using Gen AI could do. It was refreshing to see the focus where it belonged.

- The Startups
In this vein, one of the most interesting events I attended was the opportunity for 10 startups to pitch to investors and the media. I wrote a[ post](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/01/ces-start-ups-shun-gen-ai-hype-for-real-world-solutions/) about that event, which was the kick-off to the show’s media days. As I there mentioned, of the 10 startups who pitched, only one offered a pure Gen AI product. The rest talked about products that they believed would solve practical everyday problems. Sometimes it pays to get back to basics.

- The Gadgets
Every time I return from the show, I see all sorts of articles about the products that were unveiled. I also get asked about all the weird and exotic products that were promoted. ([Wired](https://www.wired.com/) had a [nice article](https://www.wired.com/story/ces-2024-gadgets-you-can-buy-right-now/?bxid=5cc9e25a2ddf9c1a7adf4310&cndid=53488591&esrc=WIRED_CRMSeries&source=Email_0_EDT_WIR_NEWSLETTER_0_DAILY_ZZ&utm_brand=wired&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_content=WIR_Daily_011224&utm_mailing=WIR_Daily_011224&utm_medium=email&utm_source=nl&utm_term=P4) on the 25 most interesting products exhibited at the show.) And I wonder: How did I miss all these things? But I learned long ago that you can’t see everything at CES. You have to pick your spots and my spots were things that might impact legal. So I missed all the flying cars (they have been there in one form or another for several years), the automated bidets, the smart dog collars, and the automated cat litter box cleaner, etc. Sorry. If you want to know about gadgets, there is amble press available. For me, the show is not about trendy gadgets but about relevance to my field.

- The Educational Sessions
I didn’t get to attend many of the educational sessions. However, there seemed to be lots of discussions about the ethical use of Gen AI. There were lots of sessions devoted to the potential for government regulations. Both are clearly concerns of the consumer tech industry. I didn’t see as many sessions on things like privacy and cybersecurity, the blockchain, or IoT. I’m sure there were some, but it didn’t seem to be as many as in years past. Getting a handle on the industry’s top concerns is always interesting, and the sessions reflect that.

- The Relevance to Legal
So, what was relevant to legal? The notion that good problem-solving is looking for pain points and then devising solutions that meet those pain points head-on. The idea that decisions on how to use Gen AI should be based on an examination first of what we, as lawyers and legal professionals, are uniquely qualified to do. And then using Gen AI to do everything else. The reality that generational changes, increased connectivity, and expectations stemming from AI, as well as more gamers, will all require lawyers to change how we persuade and the tools we use. The possibility of using the metaverse to meet the challenge of a lack of trial and courtroom experience in younger (and sometimes older lawyers). The need for legal tech vendors to get a handle on what their true customers need before firing off products that don’t accomplish anything except to heighten lawyer skepticism about technology. I come to CES to get these kinds of insights and this year did not disappoint.

- The Bottom Line
Bottom line, what is the show really about? For me, it’s all about the ideas. There are lots of products displayed on the exhibit floor that, for many reasons, will never hit the consumer market. These are the silly gadgets that get attention. But I like the fact that you see people pushing the envelope. It’s inspiring to be around these people. And the show is truly an international one. There are people present from almost every country. You hear countless languages being spoken. You are exposed to multiple cultures. That, too, is inspiring, especially coming from legal tech, where the conversations and product offerings often seem just to repeat themselves. I attend CES for the exposure to the new and different. It’s worth it.

So, there you have it. My wrap up for this year’s CES. Was it worth the trip, the standing in line, walking the endless exhibit floors, and hearing countless sales pitches?

You bet. Always is.

They’re doing that with the one hand, while with the other hand more aggressively recruiting in higher performing groups of people.

— [Kent Zimmermann](https://www.consultzg.com/people/kent-zimmermann/), a law firm management consultant with the Zeughauser Group, in comments given to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/law-firms-mix-hiring-firing-to-protect-profits-amid-uncertainty) on how Biglaw firms are “cleaning up” their workforces by counseling out underperformers, while at the same time bringing on lateral associates, partners, and entire practice groups.

The following is a summary and highlights of Part 3 of our podcast series “From the Inside Out,” bringing non-obvious insights from in-house legal departments to law firms and other lawyers on the outside. “From the Inside Out” is hosted by Ian [Connett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-connett-326a591a/) of [Evolve the Law](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/) and sponsored by [Lake Whillans](http://bit.ly/2RwCSZG), a commercial litigation finance firm with offices in California and New York.

In our third installment, we sat down with [Nancy Saltzman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nancysaltzman), the former Executive Vice President, Chief Compliance Officer, General Counsel, and Corporate Secretary of [EXL Service](https://www.exlservice.com/), an operations management and analytics company based in New York. Nancy discussed with us the value of law firm experience and what she looks for when working with outside counsel.


Nancy has more than 20 years experience advising large global organizations in complex economic and regulatory environments. She has deep experience in healthcare, insurance, and technology, as well as subject matter expertise in data analytics, robotics process automation, data privacy, and cybersecurity.

Nancy was one of eight members of the executive committee at EXL, which has 27,000 employees globally. The committee’s role is to take stock of where the company is, what its market potential is, where they need to be, and what their investors and the analysts who follow their stock are expecting, and devise a strategy for the company looking at both short- and long-term objectives. EXL handles what they call “business as usual” or “nuts and bolts” legal work in-house, while turning to outside counsel for less-frequent or more high-stakes matters like large litigations, large M&A deals, or legal matters involving employees in states where they have no state law expert.

How did your significant law firm experience prepare you for your career?

Law firm experience is a fantastic training ground — the volume and complexity of transactions and the senior mentorship are second to none. It’s a demanding environment, but you get an enormous amount of education and exposure to the best and brightest minds and the most interesting transaction types in a very short amount of time. It’s a great starting point and there’s no substitute for that kind of training.

Do you look for law firm experience when you’re hiring?

Not all countries have the same path through law school and law firms for training, but in the U.S., we absolutely look for law firm experience and won’t hire anyone with less than three, or ideally five, years of experience. We don’t have the time and energy to train someone from day one on the most basic tenets of legal work.

What’s one thing that law firms just don’t understand about the in-house world?

For the most part, firms don’t understand the incredible demand on budget. It’s more obvious on large transactions, but less so on smaller matters that can meander with no clear end. Law firms tend to be too theoretical and don’t stop to realize that all of that is costing the client time and money. Winning isn’t always the most important thing — often it’s about finding the most cost- and time-effective way to extricate the company from the problem.

Should law departments be viewed as cost centers, and what can firms do to help change that perception?

A legal department should never attempt to be a revenue center, but it serves a purpose where you can create a very good return on investment, where the calculation for the cost of capital, staff, and overhead can not only justify itself but be a value-add. It’s about improving the time to revenue for what you’re producing. Law firms have tools and technologies available to help clients manage, keep up with, and track what’s going on in cases, but they’re not implementing it fast enough.

What do the best law firms do consistently well that keeps them on your roster?

Our go-to firms 1) have come up with a smart staffing approach that’s cost-efficient, 2) have invested the time in knowing our company and learning its culture, and 3) are proactive in how they service our business. It’s great when law firms proactively share specific information that might be of concern to the company and its future.

If you could change one thing about the traditional law firm model, what would it be and why?

There still aren’t enough women and there still isn’t enough diversity across the board. When I put out RFPs, I mandate that the team presented be a diverse team and mandate that the people being identified in the proposal are actually the people who are going to show up and do the work. You have to hold the firms accountable.

Listen to our entire discussion with Nancy Saltzman here to gain more insights from the in-house world.

# Cravath Cracks On Non-Equity Partnerships
## The firm that built the traditional law firm model adds an income partnership tier.

Here’s your salary, partner.

For a very long time, being partner at a law firm meant something. Equity partners were all in it together,  sharing the firm’s risks and benefits. Over time the title has diluted — as non-equity “partnerships” became [fancy versions of what used to be Counsel positions](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/repeat-after-me-partnership-without-equity-is-not-a-partnership/). Worse, they’re often career dead-ends for women and minorities that the firm [can present as “partners” without actually sharing the wealth](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/yup-nonequity-partnership-is-used-disproportionately-for-minorities/).

After holding out for years, Cravath has decided to join in on the two-tier partner wave.

From [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/cravath-adds-salaried-partner-tier-in-latest-wall-street-shift?source=breaking-news&item=headline&region=featured-story):

Cravath, Swaine & Moore has quietly created a salaried partner tier, making it the latest in a series of Wall Street law firms to revamp pay schemes in response to new competitive forces.

The firm “recently established the salary partner role,” Faiza Saeed, Cravath’s presiding partner, said Tuesday in an internal memo viewed by Bloomberg Law.

The firm says the move enables them to promote and retain senior talent. Sounds like lawyer speak for Cravath has a lot of attorneys that it doesn’t see as potential equal terms partners. Is this generation really just not up to the standards of yesteryear or are the folks at the top just holding on too tightly these days?

Cravath is unlikely to be the last firm to do this, rumblings have been underway that [Paul Weiss](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/10/25/paul-weiss-could-adopt-nonequity-partner-tier-in-2024/) is also considering the change. At least one thing is for sure — [this bit of trivia](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/theres-only-one-type-of-partner-at-these-biglaw-firms-the-equity-kind/2/) is no longer accurate.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

We want to be thoughtful and disciplined and not over-react to short-term demand cycles.

— [Brad Karp](https://www.paulweiss.com/professionals/partners-and-counsel/brad-s-karp), chair of Paul Weiss, in comments given to Jenna Greene of [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/column-amid-lagging-associate-hires-why-these-law-firms-bucked-trend-2024-04-03/), on the firm’s strategic growth over the past three years, during a time when other firms significantly reduced their associate hiring. As noted by Greene, Paul Weiss has added lateral associates at a steady clip, gradually increasing each year: 62 in 2021, 73 in 2022, and 113 in 2023.

# Former Skadden Associate Who Pleaded Guilty In Mueller Probe Begs For No Jail Time
## He's already lost his Biglaw career, isn't that punishment enough?

Late last month, Alex van der Zwaan, a former associate at the London office of Skadden Arps, was indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller for lying to investigators in the Russia probe about his communications with former Trump campaign aide Rick Gates, and pleaded guilty shortly thereafter. Earlier this week, he again entered a plea before the court — this time, for leniency in sentencing.

In a sentencing memo submitted to Judge Amy Berman Jackson by his lawyer, Cooley partner William Schwartz, Van der Zwaan, who faces up to six months in prison, says that jail time isn’t necessary in his case, since he’s already “been serving a sentence while stuck in limbo” here in the United States. As noted in the memo, Van der Zwaan “has been alone, separated from his wife; he has lost his job and his career; and he has to live with the knowledge that his suffering and that of his family is due to his own actions.” Isn’t that punishment enough?

Van der Zwaan claims that he initially lied to investigators to protect his career; after all, he was represented by Skadden lawyers during his first interview with the Office of the Special Counsel, and he assumed that “anything he shared with the OSC would simultaneously be heard by Skadden.” Two weeks later, unaccompanied by Skadden attorneys, Van der Zwaan returned to the U.S. to correct the record, presenting evidence against himself to Mueller’s team.

Though his conduct was “inexcusable,” Van der Zwaan says his cooperation and remorse are “compelling mitigating factors in considering just punishment.” Mueller’s team politely disagrees. The [National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2018/03/28/ex-skadden-associate-charged-in-muellers-russia-probe-seeks-non-jail-sentence/) has the details:

In their own memo, lawyers for Mueller told the judge she should not rule out prison time, due to a “scarcity of mitigating factors, and several aggravating circumstances.” They said van der Zwaan “is a person to whom every advantage in life has been given,” and that the government rightly expected “candor and uprightness” from him.

“While there might eventually be additional professional consequences that befall a foreign lawyer who commits a United States felony, those consequences do not themselves obviate the need for his current sentence to reflect the seriousness of his crime, to promote respect for the law, or to provide adequate specific and general deterrence,” prosecutors wrote.

Best of luck to Alex van der Zwaan — whose career has “turned to dust” — as he attempts to stay out of jail. According to his sentencing memo, “[h]is days are empty and lonely,” and we imagine they’ll only get worse if he actually has to serve time in jail instead of “serving a sentence” in a hotel.

# Arson Trial Ends With Lawyer's Pants On Fire -- Not A Metaphor, His Pants Caught Fire
## The dumbest closing argument ever?

Attorney Stephen Gutierrez faced a trial by fire yesterday afternoon when his pants actually caught flame during his closing arguments. In an arson case.

And they say irony is dead.

Gutierrez, a 28-year-old Miami lawyer, was in the midst of his closing argument — that his client’s car was beset by “spontaneous combustion” — when smoke began to emerge from his pants and he rushed out of the courtroom. Spontaneous combustion? Hey, if it’s good enough for the Ancient Aliens set, it’s good enough for a Florida courtroom.

But the fact that Gutierrez unexpectedly burst into flames during an impassioned plea to believe in spontaneous combustion has more than a few questioning if this wasn’t a stunt gone wrong. Where there’s smoke, there’s fire, critics say. From the [Miami Herald](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article137317553.html):

Stephen Gutierrez, who was arguing that his client’s car spontaneously combusted and was not intentionally set on fire, had been fiddling in his pocket as he was about to address jurors when smoke began billowing out his right pocket, witnesses told the Miami Herald.

He rushed out of the Miami courtroom, leaving spectators stunned. After jurors were ushered out, Gutierrez returned unharmed, with a singed pocket, and insisted it wasn’t a staged defense demonstration gone wrong, observers said.

First of all, if this were staged, this guy just upped the bar for “zealous representation.” Lighting yourself aflame? Top that with your overnight contempt detainment. Second, what exactly would he have expected a stunt, in an ideal world, to look like? “Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you may not believe in spontaneous combustion, but behold! Flame on!” Then, after a round of gasps, the case is promptly thrown out and Gutierrez confidently exits the building.

There’s no way anyone storyboards this out that ends well. Wouldn’t you make a trial run at home to see what it looks like? At least to see how badly you’d roast your chestnuts over that open fire. The timing is suspicious, but it’s hard to imagine anyone thinking this would be a good idea.

On the other hand, Gutierrez blames an exploding e-cigarette, which [absolutely happens](https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2016/nov/04/no-smoke-without-fire-e-cigarette-explodes-in-mans-pocket-video) because vapes are the Galaxy Notes of nicotine delivery methods. I recognize that a lot is being made of Gutierrez fiddling in his pocket before the incident, but he’s a vaper. Have you ever met someone who vapes? Above the Law’s own Elie Mystal vapes and he clutches that thing like it’s the frigging One Ring. Of course, Gutierrez was fiddling with it during his closing.

For the record, the jury found Gutierrez’s client guilty of second-degree arson.

So, who do you believe?

Do you believe this lawyer's pants caught fire accidentally?

- Liar, liar, and his pants are on fire!
- We now live in the darkest of all timelines and literally any coincidence is possible.

# Which Firms Offer Women The Most Power And Highest Pay? (2016)
## In a profession ruled by men, these Biglaw firms have taken steps to level the playing field for women.

Each and every year, no matter how much lip service is given to gender equality within the prestigious enclave of Biglaw firms, women continue to be left behind. We’ve [said it once](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/06/which-firms-offer-women-the-most-power-and-highest-pay-2014/), and we’ll say it again: “Biglaw lives to serve men, and in most cases, they are the ones claiming all of the power, the prestige, and most importantly, the money, while women are left in the dust.” At some large law firms, however, it’s a different story. Some firms offer women the chance to rise through the ranks to become major power players and to receive startlingly booming compensation — and rank among the most family-friendly.

Thanks to the [Women in Law Empowerment Forum (WILEF)](http://www.wilef.com/cert2.html), we have a way to find out exactly which firms are on top when it comes to offering women attorneys the chance to perform on par with their male colleagues in terms of prestige and pay.

WILEF offers Biglaw firms with 300 or more lawyers practicing in the United States the chance to become Gold Standard-certified, meaning that they must comply with four of six benchmarks meant to drive women lawyers to succeed in business development and leadership roles. Here are the criteria, which were a bit tougher to achieve this year:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
• Women account for at least 20% of equity partners or alternatively, 33% or more of the attorneys becoming equity partners during the past twelve months. [not a mandatory requirement as previously announced]

• Women represent at least 15% of firm chairs and office managing partners. [Up from 10%]

• Women make up at least 20% of the firm’s primary governance committee.

• Woman represent 20% or more of the firm’s compensation committee.

• Women make up at least 25% of practice group leaders or department heads.

• Women represent at least 15% of the top half of the most highly compensated partners. [Up from 10%]

In addition to the above changes to the second and sixth criteria, the definition of equity partner for purposes of completing the application has changed. The new definition is: “equity partner” is one who receives no more than half of his or her income on a fixed-income basis. Because WILEF had not previously announced this new definition, criteria one will not be a mandatory requirement.

This year, with WILEF’s more stringent requirements, 31 firms made the cut, compared to last year’s showing of 44 firms. Biglaw firms continue to tout their commitment to women’s initiatives, yet once again, not even half of the Am Law 100 appears on this list. For the second year in a row, although WILEF allowed for even bigger law firms to compete for inclusion in its rankings, fewer firms raised the bar for their female attorneys. It’s more than a bit disheartening when you think of it that way.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Although WILEF doesn’t tell us how the firms stack up against one another in terms of the criteria needed for certification, we do know that only six firms met all six benchmarks. Those firms are: Davis Wright (recertified for the sixth year in a row); Hogan Lovells (recertified for the fourth year in a row); Holland & Hart (recertified for the fourth year in a row in all six criteria); Quarles & Brady (recertified for the sixth year in a row); Reed Smith (recertified for the sixth year in a row in all six criteria); and Shook, Hardy & Bacon (recertified for the sixth year in a row in all six criteria).

It’s once again worth noting that none of these firms are New York-based, and none of them come close to landing at the top of the firms with the highest profits per partner. Are women only receiving treatment as equals at smaller firms outside big cities?

Under WILEF’s tougher standards, there were some notable dropouts from last year’s certification list. For example, big-name firms like Davis Polk, DLA Piper, K&L Gates, Latham, and Paul Hastings, among many others, have disappeared. We can’t help but to wonder how women are being treated at these firms. If you have any information, please reach out to us [via email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Women's%20Issues). We keep all of our tipsters anonymous.

Congratulations to all of the firms that met WILEF’s criteria for Gold Standard certification. You have our thanks for rising to the top of the Biglaw pack when it comes to women’s empowerment. We still have a long way to go but these firms are making big strides in the right direction. Thank you for helping women shine in legal practice.

# After Over A Year, Allen & Overy and O'Melveny Call Off Merger
## Allen & Overy still wants a major U.S. expansion... but it needs a new partner.

A single tear for “Allen O’Melvery”

We’ve branded them a “Will-They-Or-Won’t-They romantic comedy,” but now we know that the answer is definitively “won’t” with [the two firms calling off merger talks](https://www.legalcheek.com/2019/09/allen-overy-and-omelveny-myers-abandon-merger-talks/).

As [recently as July](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/morning-docket-07-03-19/), we were hearing that this deal was right around the corner. It made all the sense in the world with Allen & Overy broadcasting a commitment to major expansion in the United States with O’Melveny sitting right there with almost no gap in firm PPP. Why wouldn’t these kids get together and launch [a 3,000-lawyer firm with around $2.8 billion in revenue](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/allen-overy-and-omelveny-are-considering-merger-please-name-it-allen-omelvery/)?

But there were problems lingering from the beginning of this saga. Immediately after the story came out, O’Melveny fiercely denied it, declaring, “[We have no plans to merge and never have](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/omelveny-tells-atl-we-have-no-plans-to-merge-and-never-have/).” It was news to Allen & Overy, who didn’t try to lie to the press and [confirmed they were in negotiations with an American firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/checking-in-on-allen-omelvery-biglaws-most-hilarious-will-they-or-wont-they-romcom/). To say the firms weren’t on the same page at the time is an understatement — they weren’t on the same document set.

But somehow they got beyond the opening gate stumbles and enjoyed a long courtship complete with reported leadership trips to London and Frankfurt to hash out details. O’Melveny made [concrete changes to its U.K. recruitment efforts](https://www.legalcheek.com/2019/03/email-reveals-decision-on-allen-overy-and-omelveny-myers-mega-merger-due-in-coming-weeks/) in a seeming nod to an impending merger.

Still, rumors swirled that a [small enclave of powerful A&O London partners were opposed to the deal](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/10/the-allen-omelvery-merger-seems-to-be-gaining-steam/). As the U.K. stares down the barrel of a business cataclysm entirely driven by old Englishmen refusing to embrace economic globalism… this all tracks.

Whether the deal died because of those partners, or the stated reason of troublesome foreign exchange rates, it’s back to the drawing board for Allen & Overy leadership reiterating that expanding in the U.S. “remains the highest priority.”

[Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/morning-docket/)
# Morning Docket: 11.05.18
## * On Friday, Judge Eleanor L. Ross (N.D. Ga.) decided that Georgia's ""exact match"" voting law was too restrictive, issuing a preliminary injunction against the law just days before the midterm election and ruling that the state must allow those who were flagged by the law -- ""individuals who are predominantly minorities"" -- to prove their citizenship and identity more easily. Strike one against Republican gubernatorial candidate and Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp. [[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/11/03/judge-rules-against-brian-kemp-over-georgia-voting-restrictions-days-before-gubernatorial-election/?utm_term=.b474984d33cf)] * Unwilling to accept his potential fate in the election after having been dealt a blow by Judge Ross, Kemp announced on Saturday that he was investigating the Georgia Democratic Party for allegedly trying to hack the state's voter registration system. Of course, he had little to no evidence to prove these allegations. [[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/04/us/politics/georgia-elections-kemp-voters-hack.html)] * Speaking of the midterm election, you NEED TO VOTE tomorrow. No idea where your polling place is? Not an excuse. Find out right here. Click the link. [[HeadCount](https://www.headcount.org/find-your-polling-place/?polling-location)] * ""[O]ut of an abundance of caution due to security concerns,"" Justice Brett Kavanaugh will skip the walking down the Supreme Court's front steps with the chief justice following his formal investiture ceremony. Every other new justice has done so since 1975 when John Paul Stevens started the tradition. [[Big Law Business](https://biglawbusiness.com/kavanaugh-will-forgo-traditional-walk-down-supreme-court-steps)] * James Polsinelli, name partner and founder of Am Law 100 firm Polsinelli, will be retiring from the firm on January 31, 2019. What will he do after he steps away from Biglaw? ""I've got a golf game I’ve neglected for a long time, so I’ll see how much of it I can resurrect,"" he said. Congratulations on wonderful career!

# New York To $190K -- No, Cravath Didn't Make The First Move

Honestly, we did not expect to see an associate salary bump this year. But OMG, here comes the next wave of Biglaw salary wars.

And this time, Cravath isn’t moving first.

No, that honor belongs to Milbank, which shocked everyone at the firm today with a salary increase to put them over the Biglaw masses. The full memo is on the next page.

New York to 190K, folks! (UPDATE: For some newer Above the Law readers, “NY to [insert dollar amount here]” is just the way law firm salary increases were described for years… but to clarify, Milbank is raising salaries globally [A second tipster suggests that at least the German offices aren’t matching. We can say London and Singapore are though].)

- Classes 18/17 $190,000 (+10,000)
- Class 2016 $200,000 (+10,000)
- Class 2015 $220,000 (+10,000)
- Class 2014 $250,000 (+15,000)
- Class 2013 $275,000 (+15,000)
- Class 2012 $295,000 (+15,000)
- Class 2011 $315,000 (+15,000)
- Class 2010 $330,000 (+15,000)
Said one Milbank tipster of the news:

“!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”

Yeah, that sums it up.

We’ve got a few more reactions from Milbank tipsters:

- “Put some respeck on my name”
- “summer of 190”
- “WE ARE THE NEW FUCKIN CRAVATH BITCH”
- “I am as shocked as you are.”
But our favorite so far:

HOLY FUCKING SHIT BALLS OF FIRE HOW WERE WE FIRST

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It’s safe to say that associates were surprised.

In fairness, Milbank was an early mover in the last salary war, [matching Cravath within hours](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/ny-to-180k-the-first-major-match/), so they’re not shrinking from a good salary bump. But sticking their neck out first hasn’t been their style lately. Looks like the firm’s decided to take on the mantle of industry trailblazer.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Milbank) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Milbank”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Ropes & Gray Elects First Female Chair
## Another woman joins the upper echelon of Biglaw leadership.

While women are [better represented](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/the-biglaw-firms-with-the-most-female-equity-partners/) among Biglaw equity partnerships than ever before, those numbers remain woefully low considering we’re sufficiently removed from [the 1950s](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/you-wont-believe-this-infuriatingly-sexist-law-firm-memo-from-the-1950s/) to expect more parity. The bulk of a firm’s partnership went to law school after 1980 at this point — it’s become increasingly difficult to blame gender imbalance on the Paper Chase-era.

And the only thing more rare than a female equity partner in Biglaw, is a female equity partner at the highest levels of firm leadership. The exceptions, like [Jami McKeon](https://www.morganlewis.com/bios/jmckeon) of Morgan Lewis, [Faiza Saeed](https://www.cravath.com/fsaeed/) of Cravath, or [Therese Pritchard](https://www.bryancave.com/en/people/therese-d-pritchard.html) of Bryan Cave (who we’re sure is [excited about her job](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/10/biglaw-chairperson-entirely-unexcited-about-new-job/)) are few and far between. We learned just last month that Crowell & Moring [booted its female leader after one term](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/10/biglaw-chairperson-entirely-unexcited-about-new-job/), rendering the landscape just a little more sparse.

Ropes & Gray has added another woman to this elite list, announcing that [Julie Jones](https://www.ropesgray.com/biographies/j/julie-h-jones.aspx) will assume the role of firm chair in 2019, marking the first woman to hold the top post in the firm’s 150-year history. She’ll assume the job from [R. Bradford Malt](https://www.ropesgray.com/biographies/m/r-bradford-malt.aspx?AK=malt). Per [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2017/11/20/ropes-grays-next-chair-will-be-a-woman/):

The leadership transition coincides with Malt’s reaching the firm’s mandatory retirement age of 65 at the end of 2019. The firm’s policy committee, which acts as its governing board, selected Jones as the firm’s next chair after conducting one-on-one consultations with all of the firm’s partners, according to Malt and Ropes & Gray managing partner David Chapin. Chapin is also due to retire at the end of 2019, and he said a similar process would take place next year to determine his successor as managing partner.

Malt, who has been Ropes & Gray’s chairman since 2004, said in an interview that there was “stunning unanimity” among partners that Jones was the right fit as the firm’s next chair.

The decision to announce the change now affords Ropes & Gray the opportunity to convey a smooth leadership transition, assuring clients and the legal community writ large that Ropes & Gray has a consistent, long-term vision.

On the subject of her election, Jones praised Ropes & Gray for its approach to female lawyers:

“I was always judged on merit. We value intelligence, hard work and commitment—and those things are gender-blind,” she said. “I feel lucky because of the values Ropes & Gray has as a firm, and because we’ve always had strong women leaders and I benefited from that. I feel a sense of duty in that regard. I need to continue to demonstrate our commitment to those core values.”

Normally, words like “merit” and “gender-blind” must be taken with enormous grains of salt. Not because they don’t represent laudable goals, but because they’re usually disingenuous cudgels used to justify discrimination: “we only have 5 percent female partners? I can assure you we judge only on merit… we neutrally tallied up everyone’s hours and hers were just low that year she took maternity leave!” But Ropes & Gray may be the exception that employs those words honestly. Jones will step in as chair, and another partner, [Jane Rogers](https://www.ropesgray.com/janerogers), will join the firm’s policy committee.

Congratulations to Jones and Rogers on their new roles.

Per a new survey, 44 percent of in-house counsel say their compensation is “below or significantly below that of their peers,"" and 40 percent said they were likely to search for a new job because of comp issues.

# Salary Match, But Bonuses Delayed... Mwahaha, Now You Can NEVER Leave
## When firms delay the summer bonus until the end of the year, you get what they're doing, right?

Jenner & Block is on the Cravath salary corner. They’re out with a match of the salary scale.

Jenner & Block is one of the elite firms in Chicago, but they’re probably best known for their top-notch D.C. appellate practice.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The firm is matching salaries, but not the summer bonuses started off by Simpson Thacher. Instead, the firm said that they will consider that other firms have given out summer bonuses when it comes time to make end of the year payments.

[As Kathryn Rubino has mentioned](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-firm-raises-salaries-but-stiffs-associates-on-summer-bonuses-promises-to-make-it-up-at-the-end-of-the-year/), delaying the midyear bonuses — sorry, delaying the possibility of midyear bonuses — until the end of the year has the effect of tying associates to the firm for the rest of the year, and realistically on into the next. Sure, comparatively few people leave their firms during the summer and fall, and the end of year bonuses is always there as an incentive to stay through another year.

But some associates do and now, if they do, they’re looking at missing out on an even bigger bonus, one that many of their colleagues have already earned.

At the very least, the time value of money here benefits the partners.

It’s just another link of the golden handcuffs: Go up a class year and get a big raise at the start of the year, work for a few months, start thinking of leaving, start thinking about how much more money is waiting for you in December, hang on, go up a class year, rinse, repeat. It’s not bad or nefarious. It’s just the cycle of Biglaw.

Here’s the memo.



Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or email us (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

# Biglaw Partner Benchslapped: 'If You Can't Focus... Sit Down, And I Will Ask The Questions'

Justice Saliann Scarpulla (via Chambers Diversity)

As John H. Wigmore famously [stated](http://wwwcrossx.blogspot.com/2012/01/cross-examination-and-truth.html), “Cross-examination is the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.” But what happens when that engine… blows up in your face?

Just last week, litigation columnist John Balestriere discussed the importance of [not giving up in cross-examination](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/never-give-up-on-cross-examination/). But what do you do when the judge presiding over your case thinks you’ve gone too far?

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

This actually happened to a Quinn Emanuel partner in a recent proceeding, as reported by [Law360](https://www.law360.com/legalethics/articles/801794/judge-offers-to-do-quinn-emanuel-atty-s-job-in-cozen-row):

A New York judge reprimanded a Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP attorney for his circuitous questions at a hearing on Tuesday over whether Cozen O’Connor used confidential documents in Fair Isaac Corp.’s $45 million contract suit against a former eBay unit, offering to take over questioning herself.

New York Supreme Court Justice Saliann Scarpulla repeatedly scolded Quinn Emanuel’s [David Grable](http://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/grable-david-m) for delving into what she called “irrelevant” details while he questioned Cozen lawyers and contractors about confidential eBay Enterprise Inc. documents that accidentally fell into the firm’s hands. The judge told Grable to stick to the main issue and threatened to take over questioning if he didn’t.

“This is really the last time I am going to tell you… If you can’t focus that way, sit down and I will ask the questions,” Judge Scarpulla said.

And that wasn’t the only expression of exasperation from Her Honor:

Over the course of the proceeding, Judge Scarpulla grew increasingly impatient and began to interject questions herself.

“I’m getting very frustrated with the amount of irrelevant questions. Either you pick this up or we’re done,” she told Grable.

Ouch. Justice Scarpulla, a Brooklyn Law grad, just showed the L.A.-based Grable how they roll in Kings County.

Whenever we hear of a lawyer getting benchslapped, we instinctively side with the judge. But just because you wear a black robe doesn’t mean you’re always right. If you surf over to [Robing Room](http://www.therobingroom.com/newyork/Judge.aspx?id=1108), you’ll see mixed reviews of Justice Scarpulla. Some praise her as “a rising star” with “a wonderful temperament,” but others claim she’s “very rude and caustic” and “yells for no reason.”

The lawyers from Quinn Emanuel and Cozen O’Connor both declined to comment to Law360 yesterday.

Check out the update to the story at the end of the article.

Lateral moves are a regular part of Biglaw life. Perhaps not surprisingly, the firm you selected before you’d even started 2L year is unlikely to be the job you one day retire from. So lots of lawyers move jobs — that’s just something the partnership and management of a firm must accept. And, as with anything built into the culture of a firm, there are certain traditions built around the process — the notice period, handing off cases, the goodbye drinks, and of course, the farewell email.

Now, some associates take the departure memo as [an opportunity to burn all the bridges or show some personality at long last](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/departure-memos/). That isn’t what is happening here. No, just a simple lateral move from Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati to Cooley. And the associate in question sent a perfectly appropriate email to the offices and practice group she’s worked with.

Everything almost seems too normal to comment on. That is, until WSGR’s chief financial officer, Jonathan Fayman, decided to insert himself into the conversation. Fayman joined the firm last year, and [according to his WSGR bio](https://www.wsgr.com/WSGR/DBIndex.aspx?SectionName=attorneys/BIOS/15739.htm), does not seem to have any other Biglaw experience.

Mr. Fayman, let me introduce you to Above the Law.

See, when you do dumb things, like send a mean-spirited mass email ripping an associate for having the common courtesy to send a goodbye email to colleagues, we’re going to have something to say. Our network of tipsters is large and we’ve gotten many tips complaining about the email you sent in response to this farewell email, calling it “horrific,” “awful,” and “rude.” One source went so far as to say:

If he doesn’t get fired for this kind of a behavior, I am leaving.

It seems Fayman fancies himself the email police, and sent an absolutely douche-tastic reply-all response to the farewell email because he doesn’t like emails that don’t directly relate to his position. Rather than deal with the mass emails that are an inevitable part of life in a large organization like an adult, he responds in the nastiest possible way that you absolutely have to read to believe:



What a dick.

Seriously, he only joined the firm in 2017. Did it even occur to him that the accepted standard of behavior is a little different than whatever asset management hell he came from? Also complaining about too many mass emails by sending a mass email is a classic dumbass move that is almost guaranteed to generate even more mass emails in response.

Fayman must’ve KNOWN that email was a jerk move filled with biting commentary, so what the hell possessed him to hit send… oh wait…



Never fear — Katharine (Katie) Martin, chair of WSGR’s board of directors and an actual attorney at the firm familiar with the traditions of the firm and basic human dignity, shut down Fayman’s nonsense in the most pitch-perfect and delightfully passive aggressive way possible (even though tipsters report the response took 30 minutes while associates were “freaking out about how awful it was”):


I only wish I could have read the backchannel email you know she sent him.

UPDATE 5/29/18 3:21 p.m.: Since we published the story we’ve received additional information. On Friday evening managing partner Douglas Clark also responded with his own mass email letting the firm know — in no uncertain terms — rude emails like the one Fayman sent will not be tolerated by WSGR:

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors.

We [asked](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/half-yearly-survey-bet-the-company/). You voted. The results are in. Unlike lists that are determined by think tanks, editors, and independent researchers, this is who YOU think deserves top billing. Read on for the results!

Who is the top litigator?

[Dan Webb](http://www.winston.com/en/who-we-are/attorneys/webb-dan-k.html), Partner, Winston & Strawn LLP

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

There basically aren’t limits on what an associate can be asked to do, as long as it’s legal. It seems like a situation ripe for unionizing, but I don’t see it happening.

— [Kate Reder Sheikh](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/kate-reder-sheikh), a legal recruiter in the associate practice group at Major, Lindsey & Africa, in comments given to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/unionizing-big-law-associates-is-tough-sell-in-competitive-world) on the likelihood that Biglaw associates will decide to unionize. Last month, associates at Outten & Golden [formed a union](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/associates-at-this-law-firm-just-unionized-will-associates-at-other-firms-follow-along/) and the firm formally recognized it.

[V]irtually the entire Paul, Weiss community would strongly prefer working alongside colleagues who are vaccinated.

[To] promote the safest possible working environment, [we] will be requiring everyone who enters our offices to be fully vaccinated.

— An excerpt from a memo sent by Brad Karp, managing partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, concerning the firm’s [new vaccination mandate for all employees](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/07/27/delta-variant-vaccines-become-central-talking-points-in-law-firm-office-return-plans/). Attorneys and staff are expected to return to the office on September 13, and the firm will lift its in-office mask requirement at that time, as all personnel will be vaccinated.

The West Coast is the best coast… when it comes to bunches of Biglaw firms piling on to match the new salary scale, all at more or less the same exact time.

Yesterday afternoon, Gibson Dunn — a firm that placed 12th in the most recent Am Law ranking, with $2,160,542,000 gross revenue in 2020 — unleashed the good news for associates, who seemed quite pleased with their new salaries.

Here’s what the new salary scale looks like at the firm:

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

The merger of which two Biglaw firms, completed March 1, 2022, reportedly tripled the volume of work firm leaders predicted would come from the merger?

Hint: Firm leaders also confirmed revenue growth at the combined firm outstripped the growth the firms would have reported separately.

See the answer on the next page.

# Are You A Woman Fed Up With Biglaw? You Aren't Alone
## Plus the 3 biggest frustrations for breadwinner woman lawyers.

In the latest episode of The Jabot podcast, I talk with Jen Dawson, co-author of [What Do Breadwinner Women Lawyers (BWLs) Want?](https://www.hemingtonwm.com/breadwinner-women-lawyers/) and Managing Director of [Hemington WealthManagement](https://www.hemingtonwm.com/lawyers/). Jen and I discuss the biggest frustrations that women in the legal profession have, tips to improve your financial health, and why women lawyers are so unhappy.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wears when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

# The Future Ready Lawyer Survey 2022: Addressing The Growing Pressure On Law Firms

This is the second in a series of articles covering the Wolters Kluwer [Future Ready Lawyer Survey 2022](https://images.go.wolterskluwer.com/Web/WoltersKluwer/%7Bf38293b3-9969-4fd4-8fc6-daea89537ff1%7D_LR_white_paper_2022_09-01_FINAL_single.pdf), a global survey that examines the factors that are affecting the future of the legal profession, and how well law firms and law departments are prepared to address them.

[Last month](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/the-future-ready-lawyer-survey-2022-the-impacts-of-volatility-on-the-practice-of-law/), I covered several key findings, including the volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA) that has become part of the new normal for legal professionals and is the backdrop to the significant pressure that is driving change in the profession. Law departments are feeling the pressure and, as a result, are putting extra pressure on their law firms (recall that 32% of lawyers in-house indicated they are very likely to switch firms in the upcoming year).

There are multiple factors identified as drivers of change within law firms, and there is now rough consensus that technology is one of those factors for firms. This includes law firm leadership who, though prior surveys pointed to them as roadblocks to innovation, are no longer seen as such.

A few weeks ago, I had the distinct honor of facilitating a great panel at the [ARK KM Legal 2022 Conference](https://www.kmlegalconference.com/) based upon the Future Ready Lawyer Survey 2022. During the session we had the opportunity to elaborate on the challenges that firms face and address some potential solutions. In this article, I’ll dive deeper into some of those observations on how law firms can work to address forces of change within the industry, technology gaps they need to overcome, and practices to prepare for the future.

Managing Change Versus Deploying Technology

With a rough consensus on the need for technology, and as law firm leadership begins to support technology projects, why aren’t we seeing better results? A likely reason is that technology in and of itself does not solve any problem; technology has to be part of a larger initiative to address the people and the processes involved to work toward a solution. Focusing on managing change before, during, and after new technology is deployed is critical to success. Soliciting leadership to support change in addition to technology can be a great next step in the maturity of law firms as they embrace technology initiatives. Doing so can help with technology adoption and positive outcomes for firms.

Technology Adoption

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Successful adoption of technology is a good metric for the success of projects. One way to encourage technology adoption is to publish usage statistics — who is using it, what are users doing, who has yet to log in, etc. Transparency in usage to leadership can also help drive adoption. One great point that [Leanna Simon](https://www.honigman.com/professionals-leanna-r-simon), director of research and knowledge management at[ Honigman](https://www.honigman.com/) made during our ARK panel was that firms do not have a way of crediting time spent on figuring out new technology, so they should look at creating a billable hour for innovation because of the time required.

The Age-Old Question Of The Billable Hour

One perpetual challenge that law firms face is the dependence on billing by the hour. On the surface, technology productivity can reduce billable hours and hence reduce revenues — which doesn’t sound like a great argument to make the case for tech adoption.

But focusing on lost billable hours misses the competitive benchmark. Let’s consider the current landscape: more work is going in-house to law departments, there is increasing competition from Alternative Legal Service Providers (ALSPs), and competing law firms that deploy technology to be more efficient are going to set the standard for the number of hours it takes to complete a matter. [Dave Majors,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-majors-a554351/) director, knowledge management strategy and operations at [Sidley Austin](https://www.sidley.com/en/us/), had a great observation on this during our panel discussion when he pointed out the difference between billable hours and realization (hours actually paid for by the client). “A great way to advance technology solutions is to focus on increasing the realization of work and eliminating time that can’t be billed,” he said.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
When it comes to prioritizing new projects, one area to consider is the “Killer App.” A killer app allows you to do something that isn’t currently possible.  Years ago, discovery required sorting through bank boxes; but once e-discovery came along, it changed that workflow entirely. [Andrew Brinkman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-brinkman-a0691a12/), global director of knowledge management at [Fried Frank](https://www.friedfrank.com/), said, “Look for problems where there is a ‘force multiplier.’ In other words, apply technology to empower attorneys to do something that they never could do before.” If you can solve these problems, change and adoption solve themselves.

But how do you find the problem that can be solved with a killer app? [Scott Kaiser](https://www.paulhastings.com/professionals/scottkaiser), practice innovation and knowledge attorney at [Paul Hastings](https://www.paulhastings.com/), said, “It’s about relationships and understanding the attorneys you support.  Start with talking with attorneys regularly, doing analysis and collecting facts.” By doing this, you’ll understand the problems and how to get buy-in for projects, including the proverbial killer app.

The pressures on law firms to perform is greater than ever given the volatility and uncertainty in the world today. As the regulatory and compliance landscape continues to become more complex and saturated with information, clients need guidance from their law firms more than ever before. Law firms can be more innovative and apply technology to be more client-responsive. In turn, they will be able to focus, remain competitive, and thrive in the years to come.

Next month, I’ll examine how law departments can address change and prepare themselves for the future.

# Biglaw Attorney Learns Hard Lesson About When *Not* To Recruit New Lawyers
## The judge was tough but fair about this 'inappropriate' behavior.

Maybe Perkins Coie attorneys think they *always* need to be recruiting potential lateral lawyer talent, but they’re learning there is a time and a place for everything. An unnamed Perkins Coie attorney was benchslapped by Northern District of California Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers for trying to recruit one of her clerks mid-trial. Yeah, even if you’re uniquely impressed by the legal acumen of a law clerk, it seems like discretion would warrant at least waiting until the end of trial to try to recruit them to your firm.

But, as[ reported by ](https://www.law360.com/articles/1697183)Law360, that’s not what happened in the middle of a patent lawsuit between Impinj Inc. and NXP USA Inc. And Judge Gonzalez Rogers made it abundantly clear that nonsense would not fly in her courtroom or in her district:

“No lawyer should ever reach out to a law clerk of a judge during trial and suggest that at some point [the clerk] should contact him if he wants a job,” Judge Gonzalez Rogers said. “It is so inappropriate that it’s shocking to me that I have to say anything about this.”

Judge Gonzalez Rogers noted that during her sidebar discussions with the trial attorneys it “was suggested that this kind of thing happens in other jurisdictions.” The judge said she emailed other judges in the Northern District of California, as well as a friend who is a federal judge in Texas, and so far, the judges have unanimously replied to her that they have never heard of trial attorneys recruiting law clerks “in any case whatsoever.”

“In the Northern District of California, it is inappropriate, and it should never happen,” she said. “So I don’t know what people think is okay, but it is not.”

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Opposing counsel, Michael C. Hendershot of Jones Day, requested a mistrial in light of the inappropriate behavior. However, the judge denied that request.

Judge Gonzalez Rogers told defense counsel that although the lawyer’s conduct “was entirely inappropriate,” she pointed out that her clerk “has no impact” on what the jury will decide or how she instructs the jury, and “if anybody should be worried, it should be [Perkins Coie].”

“I’m not going to hold it against the company,” she added. “I’m not going to hold it against the client.”

Perkins Coie partner Ramsey M. Al-Salam was quick to fall on the sword over his colleague’s behavior.

“We apologize,” he said. “We regret it.”

He added, “If it helps, we could commit to not employ [the clerk],” and the promise would presumably eliminate any perception of favoritism.

Judge Gonzalez Rogers replied that the law clerk will not have any communication with the law firm, and she noted that the clerk doesn’t have any kind of job interview lined up with Perkins Coie.

“The answer right now is there is going to be zero communication with him,” she said.

Additionally the attorney at the center of the debacle will have to eat crow in front of their fellow attorneys at the firm:

The judge ordered the Perkins Coie lawyer to email all litigators at his firm by noon Sunday to explain what happened, and to tell his colleagues that the judge “said it was inappropriate, and it should not happen.” The judge also required the attorney to include her and opposing counsel as recipients on the email.

Let this be a lesson to all attorneys: knowing when *not* to recruit is as important as knowing when to recruit new attorneys.

Orientation for first-year students at law schools across the country begins next week, and most incoming students are dreaming about the $180K salaries they believe they’re sure to receive upon snagging a Biglaw job. Little do they know that only a select few of their classmates will be able to slip that brass ring upon their finger. For those of you who wish to keep the Biglaw fantasy alive, we’ve compiled a list of all of the law firms that have extended offers to 100 percent of their most recent summer associate classes.

How many first-year associates in large law firms across America will soon be cashing in on those extravagant $180K paychecks? If you’re an incoming law student, we’ve got some information that’ll help you answer that question.

Following up on last week’s post on [Biglaw offer rates](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/summer-associate-offer-rates-2016-tons-of-future-lawyers-will-be-making-180k/), here are more firms that have given offers to all of their summer associates (grouped by city and in alphabetical order):

Congrats to everyone on their offers. Isn’t is awesome to have a job before graduation?

For those of you who are waiting to begin your third year of law school, if you have corrections to the list — i.e., an office listed above that does NOT belong on the 100 percent list — email us at [tips@abovethelaw.com](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Summer%20Associate%20Offer%20Rate%20Correction), or text us at 646-820-8477.

If you have additions to this list, please note them in an [email to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Summer%20Associate%20Offer%20Rates). Right now, it’s more newsworthy if a firm does NOT have a 100 percent offer rate than if it does.

On that note, please let us hear about firms that are NOT issuing offers to all their summer associates. If you know of a firm or an office with an unusually low offer rate — which we will arbitrarily define here as something under 66 percent, or two-thirds — please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Offer%20Rate) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Offer Rate”). For example, we’ve heard some rumblings about a low offer rate at a certain firm’s Chicago office (a firm with a 100 percent offer rate in another city), as well as a low offer rate paired with cold offers at another firm’s Washington, D.C., office. If we hear more on this firm, or any others with low offer rates, we will investigate and perhaps write a story.

Ty Cobb

[Ty Cobb](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/ty-cobb/), the former Hogan Lovells partner [who left Biglaw](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/the-incredible-growing-presidential-legal-team/) to work ([briefly](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/ty-cobb-out-emmet-flood-in-constitutional-crisis-looms/)) in Trump’s White House, [continues](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/former-biglaw-partner-ty-cobb-shows-utter-contempt-for-trumps-proposed-defense/) to opine about his former boss’s legal troubles. As we all know, the[ fourth indictment](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/trump-lawyers-luck-finally-runs-out/) against Donald Trump came down this week, this one in Georgia over election fraud. (There’s also the New York case against him over [financial crimes](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/trump-indicted-for-34-felonies-its-not-the-payout-to-stormy-its-the-pay-up-to-cohen/) related to the Stormy Daniels hush money, the federal indictment over his[ handling of classified documents](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/judge-cannon-sets-trump-docs-case-for-may-trial-date/), and there’s the [federal case](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/third-donald-trump-indictement/) over that whole January 6th insurrection thing.)

As [is](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/donald-trumps-rant-against-judge-and-his-family-costs-his-support-on-fox-news/) [his](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/doj-says-trumps-rants-about-e-jean-carroll-were-not-part-of-his-job-trump-responds-with-further-ranting/) [wont](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/trump-baits-court-with-social-media-rants-about-jan-6-case/), Trump took to social media to complain about his latest legal headache. [This time](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/110893712805150244), he boasted of a “major news conference” on Monday to present a “large, complex, detailed but irrefutable REPORT” on the 2020 election that will offer “a complete EXONERATION…Based on the results of this CONCLUSIVE Report, all charges should be dropped against me & others,” Trump wrote.

Of course, we don’t know what may be in the report (Trump says it’ll be released on Monday). But color Ty Cobb unimpressed, as he told CNN.

“This is all Trump PR. This is, you know, generating chaos. I mean, frankly, there’s a good chance that whatever document he produces ends up as evidence against him.”

That’s because the document could become “the basis for an obstruction count against the author because it’s likely to be fiction, and solely for the purpose of contaminating the jury pool.”

As legal leaders grapple with contracting budgets, ambitious company-wide goals and initiatives, and seek to balance their in-house teams’ size and scope with the outside spend, effectively managing and optimizing their legal budgets is more important than ever.

On February 25th at 12 p.m. ET / 9 a.m. PT, join COO, Office of the General Counsel at AIG, Darren Guy, and former DGC & COO of Wells Fargo, Thomas Trujillo, as they explore how to:

- Collect the right data on the work of the in-house team to maximize cost savings;
- Drive efficiency through a balance of outside counsel spend, technology adoption, and alternative fee arrangement; and
- Manage new company and legal department initiatives with limited resources.

# Footnotes Can Be Deadly
## Perhaps the biggest power of footnotes is that people often do not read them.

In law school, I had a constitutional law professor who mentioned on a few different occasions how footnotes can be deadly within the legal profession. The professor noted how footnote 4 of the Carolene Products case established an entire sphere of constitutional law, so even Supreme Court Justices could understand and harness the power of footnotes. From my own experience, there are a few ways how footnotes can be deadly in legal practice, and attorneys can use footnotes when attempting to accomplish certain tasks for their clients.

Perhaps the biggest power of footnotes is that people often do not read them. I was definitely guilty of this earlier in my career. Attorneys are busy people like all other kinds of professionals, and sometimes we take shortcuts when reviewing documents that we need to read in the course of our jobs. When skimming a document, an attorney might naturally not read the footnotes since footnotes presumably contain less important content than the body of a document. Moreover, I usually hate reading the papers of an adversary in the first place, and focusing on the body of a document is a solid way to save time.

One time, I filed a summary judgment motion against two parties. One of the parties only had a derivative claim, and this legally prevented her from bringing her claims in that case. In any event, my adversary never addressed the derivative claims of one of the parties in his papers. I had absolutely no idea why this lawyer did not address the derivative claims of one of the parties in his opposition papers. I thought this was all part of his strategy, and it was really distressing not to know why my adversary did not talk about some claims and focused on others.

As it turned out, my adversary had dropped a footnote on the first page of his brief saying that he was fine with dismissing the case involving one of his clients and this was the reason why he was only focusing on the other party in his papers. Of course, normally a lawyer would sign a stipulation of discontinuance if he were fine dismissing the claims of a party, but agreeing to have summary judgment entered against a party also happened regularly. Had I just read this footnote, I would have saved myself a lot of heartache when preparing my reply papers. After this situation, I resolved that I would read each and every footnote contained in legal papers that I came across.

In many instances, footnotes can be a great way to include points in a brief without alerting your adversary to a weakness in your argument. Usually, parties need to mention arguments in front of a trial court if they wish to preserve arguments for appeal. As a result, lawyers may want to include points in their papers just in case they come up in future. In any event, it is possible that litigants can preserve arguments for appeal even if they only mention them in footnotes.

One time, I was drafting opposition papers in response to a nasty motion filed by an adversary. I discovered a damaging argument that my adversary could make against my position, but my adversary did not mention this argument in his moving papers. However, since I was unsure if my adversary would address this issue in his reply papers or if the court would decide to argue this point sua sponte, I wanted to touch upon this argument in my papers. However, I did not want to spend too much time on this argument since I did not want to alert my adversary to the fact that this argument existed.

As a result, I decided to touch upon this argument in the footnotes. The footnote was several sentences long, so I was worried that it would not stay under the radar and that my adversary would be tipped off that this damaging argument against my position existed. I was dreading my adversary filing reply papers, but when I finally reviewed the reply papers, I was relieved to discover that my adversary did not discuss the argument I feared. I think there was a good chance that my adversary never read my footnote or at least did not understand the potential argument that could have been made against me.

In any event, footnotes can be extremely useful to attorneys, and they can be deadly if lawyers do not take the time to read footnotes. Accordingly, lawyers should gloss over footnotes at their own peril.

The Am Law 100 are now live and you can check out the [annual industry scoreboard in full](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/04/24/the-2018-am-law-100/) over at American Lawyer. But for those of you who just can’t wait to get a sneak peek at the top performers across the major categories in the Am Law rankings, we’ve got your back. We’ll have more detailed discussion over the next few days as we dig in and pick apart these numbers.

But we already know for sure that the [elite firms pulled even farther away](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/am-law-100-news-elite-new-york-dominate-in-profits-and-revenue/) from the rest of the industry.

Let’s check out some stats.

Profits Per Equity Partner

The long-accepted gold standard of Biglaw success has [taken some hits as a valuable metric](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/will-ppp-be-dethroned/) in recent years, but we’re still going to salivate like dogs over this list, so why not revel in it. Here are the top 5 firms in PPP (or PPEP as the case may be). The whole list is [available here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/04/24/the-2018-am-law-100-ranked-by-profits-per-equity-partner/):

Which law firms are raking in the most cash overall? As one might expect, the biggest of the big firms. The globalist of the global firms. The vereinist of the verein firms. All right, that didn’t quite work, but here are the top dogs in revenue. A whopping 31 firms crested $1 billion in revenue this year. The [full list is here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/04/24/the-2018-am-law-100-ranked-by-gross-revenue/):

1. Kirkland
2. Latham
3. Baker McKenzie (verein)
4. DLA (verein)
5. Skadden

Revenue Per Lawyer

While profits per partner falls out of vogue as the prime indicator of firm health, people have turned to revenue per lawyer, preferring to judge the strength of a firm based on how much cash they’ve managed to squeeze out of every attorney on the payroll. [Full list here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/04/24/the-2018-am-law-100-ranked-by-revenue-per-lawyer/):

[Mergermarket ](http://www.mergermarket.com/info/)has released its Global M&A roundup for last year, including its league tables for legal advisors, and there has been a significant reshuffling at the top. Despite a geopolitically tumultuous 2016, the U.S. M&A market had a robust year, with about $1.5 trillion in deals, the second-highest value since Mergermarket starting keeping track in 2001.

[White & Case](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/white-case-llp/?utm_source=law_firm_directory&utm_medium=search_result&utm_campaign=cc_redesign) vaulted to the No. 1 position in the 2016 league tables in deal value, moving up from ninth place in 2015. [Sullivan & Cromwell](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/sullivan-cromwell-llp/?utm_source=law_firm_directory&utm_medium=search_result&utm_campaign=cc_redesign) moved from fifth place to second place, and [Davis Polk & Wardwell](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/davis-polk/?utm_source=law_firm_directory&utm_medium=search_result&utm_campaign=cc_redesign) made a big jump from tenth to third place.

# Yes, Even Biglaw Partners Stare Into The Abyss Sometimes
## Who ever said work/life balance was going to be easy?

No one ever said balancing a high-powered legal career at a Biglaw firm with an actual personal life was going to be easy. The challenges are only magnified if you are responsible for the health and well-being of three tiny humans.

Capturing the universality of this struggle is the beauty of the CorporetteMoms series “Week in the Life of a Working Mom.” [This week’s offering](http://corporettemoms.com/biglaw-partner-work-life-balance/) is the experience of a Biglaw litigation partner (“R”) in the Midwest who has three kids — twin 9 year olds and a 3 year old. And to be honest, for most of the week R seems to be cruising. Sure, it’s stressful and there are a lot of things to be done, but R’s hours seem… dare I say it, reasonable — she is even able to make time to attend her kids’ extracurriculars.

Things are going along just swimmingly until Thursday. That’s when a stomach bug hits the toddler and you just know mom’s day is going to be a wreck. It’s oddly comforting knowing the work of a partner suffers when their home life is in upheaval. Just check out how productive R was that day:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
6:30 a.m. Alarm goes off. Was I asleep? Who knows. Even my dreams are of vomit and exhaustion. I was supposed to get up at 5:00 and go to the gym for strength training, but that ship sailed around the fourth vomiting episode at 4:00 a.m. (Really, it sailed with the first, but who’s counting?) Husband and I engage in brief negotiation about whether we can take shifts. He has a proposal to get out and wants me to stay home in the morning. I have a 9:30 call and a 2:00 meeting, so I offer late afternoon. As usual, my job wins. I always try to stay home when I can, because it’s rare that I can. But I’m 4/5 of our household income, so this is a choice we both agree with.
7:45 a.m. I leave for work. Husband will get the older kids on the bus as usual and stay home with the youngest. I stop for the biggest coffee Dunkin’ Donuts sells, and two donuts, because I’ve given up hope for the day.
8:30 a.m. Arrive at work. Drink coffee and stare into the abyss like a zombie. Try to prepare for 9:30 call.
9:30 a.m.–10:30 a.m. Call.
10:30 a.m.–11:30 a.m. Stare into the abyss.
11:30 a.m. Go with coworker to grab Subway, which I eat at my desk while staring into the abyss.
2:00 p.m.–3:00 p.m. Attend a webinar.
3:00 p.m. Leave office. My husband has figured out his proposal, but the youngest is still sick and can’t leave the house, so I’m on evening extracurricular duty.
3:45 p.m. Arrive home and assess pitiful situation on the sick child front.
4:15 p.m. Pick up son from bus, take him home to get ready for soccer.
5:00 p.m. Pick up older daughter from after-school STEM program.
5:30 p.m.–6:30 p.m. Soccer practice; sit in chair and watch practice while daughter reads book.
6:30 p.m.–7:00 p.m Drive home; talk to kids about school.
7:00 p.m. Eat dinner while husband puts pitiful youngest to bed.
7:30 p.m. Head to family room where husband and kids play video games. My brain is mush, so I just watch them and play games on my phone.

See, Biglaw partners — they’re just like us.

# Holdout Firm Flip-Flops On Salary
## After all that, they offer raises anyway.

Seyfarth Shaw got a lot of flak when it boldly tried to put a stop to the salary frenzy. The firm [blew off the idea of raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/one-firm-decides-to-pump-the-brakes-on-this-whole-raise-thing/), and its chairman emeritus penned an article proclaiming woe to firms that raise their salaries in the vain hope that this could halt the gathering “compensamentum.” Even at the time, this felt like a Biglaw Wile E. Coyote lofting a miniature umbrella to shield it from the anvil.

And so today, Seyfarth Shaw joins the [Covington Memorial Salary Flip-Flop Club](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-firm-changes-course-on-associate-compensation/) with a salary increase announcement.

First of all, raises are effective on October 1, fully three months after most associates got their raises. Is the third quarter that tight?

Second, different Seyfarth offices are on different scales, which [actually makes sense](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/). But how much each office gets may cause some grumbling.

We don’t have the precise New York office scale at this time, but we’ve been told that it runs from $180K to $300K — whether that matches the Cravath scale through the seventh year or is the result of some crunching at the senior end remains to be seen.

We’ve heard that the bulk of Seyfarth’s other domestic offices (with the possible exception of outliers like Atlanta or Sacramento) will be on a $160K to $280K scale. [This memo from San Francisco](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/holdout-firm-flip-flops-on-salary/2/) details that scale. Seyfarth employs one of those funky 3×3 compensation grids, but for the sake of simplicity this is what it looks like converted into traditional classes:

First-year	$165K
Second-year	$175K
Third-year	$185K
Fourth-year	$205K
Fifth-year	$225K
Sixth-year	$240K
Seventh-year	$260K
Eighth-year	$270K
Ninth-year	$280K

The bad news: it’s not matching Cravath. The good news: most years are getting as big or bigger raises from their current salary. Seyfarth was already below the $160K market in San Francisco, and this raise may not match Cravath but draws closer. No Cravath raise exceeded $35K per year, while a couple of the more senior Seyfarth classes on this scale are receiving $40K bumps over their current salary. That’s not nothing.

One tipster notes:

They also hinted at changes to bonuses and leave policies. Honestly, better than I thought it would be. No change in hours requirements. I think they’re treating Boston as a regional office, which makes no sense to me because we’re one of the most profitable offices….
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Double points for the emoticon.

Then there’s the really bad news — if you’re an income partner, that is. According to at least one source, some of these raises place senior associates above income partners! Needless to say, those lawyers aren’t pleased.

So a muted congratulations to Seyfarth Shaw associates. This may not be all you could have hoped for, but it’s certainly much more than it looked like you’d get a couple weeks ago.

(The San Francisco memo is available [on the next page…](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/holdout-firm-flip-flops-on-salary/2/))

Remember, when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”).

# The 'Allen & O'Melvery' Merger Seems To Be Gaining Steam
## There may be some internal opposition... but it doesn't look like it's going to stop this.

Nothing like a good global law firm merger to get the blood flowing on a Monday morning. The [ongoing saga of the Allen & Overy and O’Melveny & Myers](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/checking-in-on-allen-omelvery-biglaws-most-hilarious-will-they-or-wont-they-romcom/) popped up again amid reports of more interfirm partner meetups to curry global interest in the deal.

It looks like it’s only a matter of time before this one gets done. The PPP gap between the two firms — a common cause of scuttled deals — is virtually non-existent and both sides see practice complements across the world. Deals this good don’t usually die on the vine.

ALM’s International reports the pro-merger forces have been on a whistlestop tour, meeting in Germany, London, Singapore, and, naturally, at the firm’s annual meeting in Miami. And it appears all this work is starting to pay off, with the mood “inching towards a merger” a former A&O partner told International.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“The A&O litigators, especially in the U.S., desperately want to have it. They’ve never had a strong brand in the U.S. and this gives them a way.”

However, one current A&O partner argued it might not be a “slam dunk.”

“It is a numbers vote—but even if you have 500 partners in favor and 50 corporate partners in London against it, you’d be a brave person to put it to a vote,” they said.

Maybe. But if those 50 partners really cared enough to bolt from a newly merged firm, one might expect them to be doing more right now than bitching behind the scenes. That same former partner cited above describes the London scene as a bunch of complainers who lack any drive to mount a formal challenge against the mounting merger talk.

This is the “speak now or forever hold your peace” point in the wedding ceremony and these London corporate types seem satisfied to comfortably kvetch about it at the reception.

If they can effectively do their jobs remotely for the past several years, and now for the month of August, what is the argument for being in the office long term? That’s the question on people’s minds when firms take this approach or have strict in-office expectations generally.

More than two years into the pandemic, associates are wondering why the flexibility needs to end.

# Picking Up The Tab For Donald Trump's Ballooning Legal Bills
## What's $40 million between friends?

This is what happens when there are two indictments against you, and everyone [basically expects a third](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/biglaw-partner-neal-katyal-sounds-off-on-when-we-can-expect-that-third-donald-trump-indictment/) (and maybe a [fourth](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/07/11/trump-grand-jury-fulton-county-georgia/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5)). You have to hire lawyers and they have to get paid.

According to [reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/07/29/trump-lawyers-pac-deoliveira-loyal/), the Donald Trump-founded political action committee (PAC), Save America, spent $40.2 million on legal bills in the first half of 2023. That means the PAC has spent $56 million since Trump left office. In fact, legal bills are the number one expense for the PAC in Trump’s 2024 presidential run. It’s basically turned into a bizarro litigation financier with no chance of any upside.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But it isn’t only the former president’s bills getting picked up. Others in his orbit being drawn into the legal fray are also getting their bills paid.

In an indictment unsealed Thursday charging Trump, his longtime valet Waltine “Walt” Nauta, and his property manager Carlos De Oliveira in the classified documents case, authorities allege that Trump called De Oliveira last August to say he would pay for De Oliveira’s attorney. That same day, authorities said, Nauta had a conversation with a different Trump employee who assured Nauta that De Oliveira was loyal to Trump.

Lawyers for De Oliveira and Nauta declined to comment, as did a spokesman for special counsel Jack Smith, who is leading the federal investigations of Trump.

Not that the spending is necessarily a problem (legally) according to campaign finance expert Paul Seamus Ryan. “It’s an extraordinary sum of money,” he said. “At the end of the day it’s up to the donors to decide if that’s the way they want their money spent. My sense is if you’re giving money to Trump in 2023, you’re fine with it.”

And like the Earth’s average temperature, these numbers are expected to disturbingly rise.

# Elite Biglaw Firm Joins Top Dollar Scale For Associate Salaries (And Opens A New Office To Boot)
## The momentum continues with raises for associates across the country.

As the market seems to be coalescing around a modest salary increase to cover cost of living increases since the Great Associate Cash Fest of 2016 and a tidy summer bonus, the clock’s been ticking on the Am Law Elite to fall into line. It took a whole week for Cravath to embrace the raise Milbank launched upon the world, and another three days after that for Kirkland to concede that the market had truly shifted.

But now that we’re seeing some clarity out there, it’s time for the rest of the top firms to join the festivities, and White & Case has stepped up to the plate. The firm will be matching the prevailing market salaries all the way up the scale (and down the scale… to provide summers a corresponding bump) and providing the summer bonuses that have become standard.

While the memo is addressed to “US Associates & Counsel” there may be some domestic associates left out. After announcing that the firm is “increasing salaries and awarding summer bonuses to US associates in good standing,” it notes that US offices “not on the New York base salary scale” will have raises determined by their offices and passed along on an individual basis. Back in 2016, this language meant that White & Case’s Miami office got left out. But those associates will be seeing a raise of their own, even if it doesn’t match the NY scale.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
(UPDATE: FYI, the Miami Scale is included on the next page as well)

Speaking of offices — [and aren’t we always talking about offices](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/white-case-has-built-the-new-modern-law-firm-office-and-its-awesome/) — White & Case’s announcement should generate some interest in the Chicago market as well, where the firm announced earlier today that it would be opening a new outpost. The office will be headed up by White & Case partner Jason Zakia, who will relocate from Miami to take on the role, joined by private equity lawyer Gary Silverman, joining White & Case from Greenberg Traurig, and white-collar attorney Carolyn Gurland, who previously ran her own shop. This is the second new office for White & Case this year, having opened in Houston in February.

Congratulations to White & Case associates.

As always, this is the point where we remind all of you that we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Trump's Transgender Ban Is Bait, It's Not A Reality... Yet
## Trump can make the military bigoted, but he has to actually make them.

Donald Trump did not ban transgender individuals from serving in “any capacity in the U.S. military.” [I know he just said so on Twitter](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/us/politics/trump-transgender-military.html). But a tweet is not an executive order. A tweet is not a law and, goddamnit, we are still a nation of laws.

As laws go, the president’s clear intention to deny equal protection to transgender individuals should make it even more difficult for him to implement his tweet as official U.S. policy. Trump just told us where he intends to attack next, without being ready to actually attack. WHICH IS DUMB. We now have what Sun-Tzu would call “foreknowledge” of our enemy’s plans. We can mount a defense and defeat him.

Trump can, absolutely, do this. But he hasn’t done it yet. The response from the Pentagon is instructive here. [From USAToday](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-07-26/the-latest-pentagon-not-aware-of-trump-transgender-decision):

A Pentagon spokesman, Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, said in a brief written statement that the Pentagon is working with the White House to “address” what he calls “the new guidance” from the president on transgender individuals serving in the military.

Davis said the Pentagon will provide revised guidance to Defense Department officials “in the near future.”

That’s military-speak for “I have no idea what the old man is talking about, but I’m not ready to lead a junta, so we’ll get back to you.”

The devil’s in the “revised guidance.” The military has been proceeding along the lines that transgender people are allowed to serve openly. Last month the House [defeated a proposal](http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/13/politics/house-defeats-bid-block-pentagon-transgender-surgeries/index.html), with the help of 24 Republicans even, to deny Pentagon resources for gender reassignment surgery. This issue has been fought and decided. Trump cannot just roll all of that back ON TWITTER. The Pentagon is going to have to translate the president’s bigoted ravings into workable guidance that the ginormous U.S. Armed Services can implement as policy. And then that policy will be looked at in Congress and, likely, litigated in the courts.

“Smear the Queer” is a command the “Commander-in-Chief” can utter, but he can’t do it like he’s telling his orc-humpers to defend a position in a Warhammer video game. How will the military determine transgender status? Who gets to ask? Who has to tell? What about all the transgender people who came out because Obama and Ash Carter said it was okay? Do they get honorable discharges? What about pensions? WHO KNEW DISCRIMINATING AGAINST TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS COULD BE SO COMPLICATED?

Trump’s tweets would not stop f**king MULAN from serving.

These tweets are for idiots. Trump’s supporters are literally too stupid to think through the first contact this ban would have with reality. But they know they hate “women” who still have “a penis” and so anything that sounds like it might make their lives more difficult gives them comfort while they feast on mayonnaise sandwiches and piss beer.

An oft-cited RAND Corporation study suggests that there are 2,450 active transgender service members, in our 1.3 million-member military. I struggle to conceive of how pathetic you have to be to CARE about the genital disposition of less than 1% of the men and women who are fighting for your oil. Trump people are literally the worst.

But “progressives” are easily distracted. Republicans are flying back from taxpayer-provided brain surgery to take health care away from taxpayers. Trump is trying to fire an independent investigator for investigating independently. The “beleaguered” Attorney General is trying to make cities more vulnerable to terrorist attacks if they aren’t racist enough. This entire administration is a disaster.

Smacking around transgender individuals on Twitter without bothering to issue new actionable policy is like throwing some Christians to the lions to keep the mob on your side and the nobles suitably cowed. It’s an old trick.

Transgender people are being used as bait. That’s probably the most disgusting part of Trump’s tweetstorm. Trump isn’t even giving the transgender community the dignity of their destruction being his ultimate objective. He’s just using their lives as a means to his ends.

# This Firm Shows Associates The Best Way To Kick Off A Holiday Weekend — With Raises!
## Now that’s a creative way to help associates celebrate.

It’s been about a month since the last time a law firm announced anything other than an office reopening plan or a vaccine mandate, but it looks like some firms are still interested in announcing big money moves. And what better time to let associates know that they’re about to get a huge cash influx than before a long holiday weekend?

On Friday, Morris Nichols Arsht & Tunnell, a Delaware firm rated as one of the [best in the Mid-Atlantic region](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/morris-nichols-arsht-tunnell) by Vault, announced that it would be increasing salaries for first-year attorneys, effective immediately. Entry-level associates at the firm will now be making $190,000, up $15,000 from the $175,000 they’d been making previously.

According to a [press release](https://www.morrisnichols.com/news-morris-nichols-increases-associate-salaries-to-190), Morris Nichols is a firm that prides itself on its “deep pool of talented attorneys and holds great appreciation for their dedication,” so while nothing is specifically mentioned about salary increases for all other associates, we imagine they must be seeing commensurate raises as well.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

So, why did the firm finally decide to raise salaries? Because like all other firms, Morris Nichols wants to take advantage of the hot lateral market. From the firm’s press release:

Hiring top associate candidates is a key component of the firm’s ongoing vitality and future success as a Delaware market leader. To continue to attract top attorneys, Morris Nichols will increase starting associate salaries….

Better late than never!

This first-year salary bump may not be match the Davis Polk money that’s become the prevailing rate in more major markets ($202.5K for the Class of 2021 and $205K for the Class of 2020, to be specific), but more money is more money, so congratulations to all associates at the firm.

Ever since Biglaw bonus season started, we’ve received a slew of emails from law firm support staff wondering what their fate may be as money continues to rain down upon associates. 2020 was an incredibly difficult year for everyone, and it remains important to remember that Biglaw is not made of attorneys alone. After all, it takes an army for law firms this large to run, and the behind-the-scenes battalions of staff members deserve their due, too. That said, many firms have gone out of their way to show their support staff that they truly matter.

The latest firm to dip into their pockets to say thank you to staff is Sheppard Mullin. Last week, on the same day the firm offered [special bonuses to associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/am-law-100-firm-finally-decides-to-offer-special-bonuses-to-associates/), staff members were notified that they, too, would be receiving special bonuses. Here’s an excerpt from a memo sent by Ted Tinson, the firm’s chief operating officer:

At the end of the day, while a challenging year in so many ways, 2020 turned out to be a successful financial year for the firm. The Executive Committee, Partners, and I would like to thank you for all of your efforts. One way we do this each year is through our profit sharing bonus. In each of our last two years – also successful years – we have paid at 150% of our target bonus level. For 2020, the Executive Committee has approved a payment of 200% of our target profit sharing level. Each of you who are eligible will be receiving a bonus of two weeks’ salary. We will make that payment in the paycheck of February 5th.

Cryptocurrency is in [complete free fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/14/technology/crypto-industry-prices-fall.html). That’s not particularly surprising since the whole endeavor is precariously balanced upon the toxic combination of a “gold bug” mentality and a boiler room atmosphere. Even with the Dollar beset by [Russian-oil driven inflation](https://fortune.com/2022/06/13/mark-zandi-moodys-chief-economist-inflation-russia-invasion-ukraine/), people are still figuring out that crypto is a joke.

So why are lawyers still flocking to the blockchain banner?

To be clear, there’s nothing wrong with blockchain technology. It’s actually [pretty useful for its intended purposes](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/finally-a-clear-explanation-of-how-blockchain-works-in-the-legal-space/). Those purposes just don’t include Galt’s Gulch Bucks or Ennui Caterpillars or whatever they’re hawking to gullible investors now.

But the folks driving the rapidly bursting crypto bubble are stockpiling lawyers in a desperate bid for credibility.

Like Munger Tolles & Olson’s [Don Verrilli](https://www.mto.com/lawyers/donald-b-verrilli-jr). Digital asset manager Grayscale just tapped the former solicitor general to join its legal team — along with Davis Polk — as it tries to convince the SEC to let it convert its Bitcoin Trust into an Exchange Traded Fund.

Speaking of Davis Polk, DPW-trained Senator Kirsten Gillibrand just [announced a new bill](https://prospect.org/power/senate-feminist-spends-last-days-of-roe-shilling-for-crypto-bros/) laying out a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency driven by industry lobbyists hoping for government-approved legitimacy.

While these may be the highest-profile crypto shilling announcements in recent days, they’re hardly alone. As Benjamin Pimentel details in this in-depth Protocol piece, there’s [a full-on revolving door at work](https://www.protocol.com/fintech/crypto-washington-lobby-revolving-door) as crypto stockpiles insider D.C. lawyers.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The [Tech Transparency Project](https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/sites/default/files/Crypto-Revolving-Door-Report.pdf) identified more than 200 former government officials who occupied “key positions in the White House, Congress, federal regulatory agencies, and national political campaigns” and have moved on to roles in the crypto industry.

These former officials range from the former acting head of the Office of Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks becoming CEO of a crypto outfit to former DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen becoming a “strategic advisor” to a “decentralized compliance solution for the crypto space.” Ah, it seems like only yesterday Nielsen was [overseeing government-sanctioned child kidnapping](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/homeland-security-secretary-gets-called-out-by-former-law-school-classmates/).

Government officials and staff leaving to take private-sector roles — called the “revolving door” — is common in major industries such as energy and finance. But the trend has become even more pronounced in crypto, said Jeff Hauser, director of the Revolving Door Project.

“I’ve never seen an industry go from no revolvers on payroll to this quantity of revolvers as quickly as crypto,” he told Protocol. “Crypto has invested in hiring swamp creatures more rapidly than any other industry in history.”

Now some people might say that a situation where a small number of investors with massive holdings aggressively market an entirely made up asset to new investors in order to offload their portfolios at a profit before the market collapses under the weight of its own hype is just a souped-up Ponzi scheme, but….

I must have lost my train of thought there. Anyway, moving on, if Senator Gillibrand really wanted to do something to keep cryptocurrency honest and add an air of authenticity to these insiders turned crypto-reps, maybe propose mandating that all alternative currencies must pay their employees and vendors in crypto.

Because while I’m sure a lot of these people have crypto holdings kicking around as part of their compensation packages, I don’t think many of these lawyers are planning to start billing out in Dogecoin anytime soon.

Which is kind of telling.

Biglaw firms continue to assert their financial prowess by announcing salary increases, and numerous firms have had to raise compensation several times thanks to dueling salary scales emerging on the market. It seems that things have finally settled and Cravath’s generous offerings remain the prevailing salary rate.

Which firm is the latest to adopt Cravath’s $215,000 to $415,000 as its compensation scale?

That would be Fried Frank, a firm that’s currently ranked at No. 60 on the Am Law 100. This is the firm’s third round of raises. If you recall, the firm previously [matched Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/fried-frank-raises-21/), and then [matched Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/fried-frank-re-raise-22/). Here’s the new salary scale:



The firm’s salary increases are retroactive to January 1, and U.S. associates will see more money in their March 31 paychecks. U.K. associates will see their Cravath cash on March 25. Congratulations to everyone!

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Fried Frank.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Milbank) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Milbank”).

Martha McGarry

“Concrete jungle where dreams are made of / There’s nothing you can’t do / Now you’re in New York / These streets will make you feel brand new / Big lights will inspire you / Let’s hear it for New York…” — [Alicia Keys & Jay-Z](https://www.gq.com/story/how-empire-state-of-mind-became-new-yorks-greatest-anthem)

This week, I had the opportunity to chat with Martha McGarry, a renowned M&A lawyer who [recently joined](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/news/2021/07/mayer-brown-adds-leading-corporate-and-securities-lawyer-martha-mcgarry-in-new-york) Mayer Brown LLP’s New York office from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Over the past [four decades](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/people/m/martha-mcgarry?tab=overview), Martha has advised on numerous high-profile and transformational transactions, including General Motors in its acquisition of EDS; American Express in the sale of American Express Bank to Standard Chartered; and Coca-Cola in its purchase of Coca-Cola Enterprises, transactions involving Vitamin Water, Honest Tea, Keurig Green Mountain and Monster Beverage; as well as the 2009 [CIT historic prepackaged bankruptcy restructuring](https://amlawdaily.typepad.com/amlawdaily/2009/11/dealmaker-1.html), among many other notable deals.

McGarry is a past recipient of the [New York Law Journal Lifetime Achievement Award](https://www.skadden.com/about/news-and-rankings/news/2019/10/martha-mcgarry-honored-with-lifetime-achievement) — honoring attorneys who “have made an impact on the legal community and the practice of law over an entire career.” To be sure, she’s been an [impressive attorney](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/skaddens-first-female-m-a-partner-says-no-to-forced-retirement) and an [incredible dealmaker ](https://www.globallegalpost.com/news/mayer-brown-signs-up-trailblazing-new-york-dealmaker-from-skadden-1614416974)throughout her career. But she’s not done yet, not even close. McGarry plans to embark on the next phase of her legal journey with the same zest and zeal she’s displayed over the past 40 years. We covered her upcoming chapter and a bit more during our discussion this week.

Without further ado, here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation.

Renwei Chung: Congratulations on joining Mayer Brown LLP. What prompted this partnership and how did you choose the firm?

Martha McGarry: After a very happy 43-year career at Skadden, I was facing age-based mandatory retirement at the end of the year. Mayer Brown had a number of impressive attributes, many that reminded me of Skadden, including the same global footprint; the excellent, broad, and deep regulatory bench, which is critical for supporting public company transactions; the high caliber of lawyers per capita; and the highly collaborative culture. I was struck by the collegiality of the partners.

RC: What are you most looking forward to in the next phase of your career journey?

MC: As the co-leader of the M&A practice at Mayer Brown I’m energized by the prospect of bringing my knowledge and deep experience in the field to help build the public company M&A practice and open up a whole new dimension for the firm.

RC: It sounds like that even from an early age you knew you wanted to be an attorney, and the Vietnam War made quite an impression on you and your career aspirations as well. Can you expound on this?

MC: Experiencing my formative years during the Vietnam era undoubtedly had an impact on my desire to become a lawyer. I think half my college class applied to law school! We saw how lawyers could make a difference. I knew then that I wanted to be a lawyer.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
RC: My father worked for Ross Perot’s Electronic Data Systems Corp. when they were [acquired by General Motors](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1984/06/29/gm-perot-computer-firm-agree-on-25-billion-merger/88790acf-6b14-4504-af8f-6c874ed27e97/) in 1984, which brought our family to Michigan from California. I would love to hear your thoughts on that acquisition and the dealmaking environment of the 1980s in general.

MC: The 1980s was one of the greatest decades for deals ever. There were so many innovations in the way deals were done. For example, in the course of representing GM in acquiring EDS, the concept of a “lettered stock” — a stock the financial characteristics of which were based exclusively on the division being acquired — was invented and used for the first time. It required us to secure accounting changes at the SEC and NYSE. Shareholder rights plans were also introduced during that decade and had a huge impact on hostile tender offers.

RC: In terms of dealmaking, you had mentioned the 1980s was the Wild West, the 1990s and 2000s were a roller coaster, and this decade will be defined by the pandemic. What will you remember most about the COVID-19 era?

MC: I will remember having to be adaptive and handle international deals virtually across many countries and time zones and having that work out fine as a substitute for being in the same conference room. I will also remember the personal impact of the virus on so many lives, and on supply chains and manufacturing for so many sectors of our economy.

RC: What advice do you have for law students and young attorneys?

MC: It’s important to realize that careers are made over many years, during which there are ups and downs. Try to be philosophical and realize you are obtaining something valuable from each phase of your career.

RC: Why do you believe it is critical to nurture a diversified network and retain a wide variety of contacts?

MC: Value your family, work, and client relationships. Embrace the opportunity to meet the widest network of people you can, whether through work or your outside interests and stay in touch with them. They will enrich your life.

RC: You are currently on the board of the Morgan Library and Museum. And you have served on the board of many other significant cultural institutions, including the National Symphony Orchestra at the Kennedy Center and the Metropolitan Opera Guild. Why is it important to you to give back and pursue such labors of love outside of the workplace?

MC: They reflect a genuine interest in areas outside my practice and have exposed me to enormously talented people with skills very different than the practice of law.

RC: You also co-founded and served on the board of [W.O.M.E.N. in America](https://womeninamerica.org/profile/mmcgarry), a professional development and mentoring organization for promising young female leaders in business. Can you tell us more about this organization?

MC: The organization emerged from a group of CEOs meeting each other at the Fortune Most Powerful Women in Business Conference. We decided we wanted to stay in touch and “give back” in some way. So we founded the organization to help mentor other professional women in their fields.

RC: What did it mean for you to be the first woman to make partner in the M&A practice at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP in 2004?

MC: I was thrilled but I was just the beginning. Many other women have been made M&A partners at Skadden in the subsequent years.

RC: On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, I would like to thank Martha McGarry for sharing her story with our audience. We wish her continued success throughout her career.

Aaron Parnas

Classes will begin at law schools across the country in just a few days, and at many institutions, there will be a slew of nontraditional students, many of them a bit older than your typical law student. One law school, however, is welcoming a different kind of nontraditional law student this fall. He’s younger than all of his classmates — probably smarter, too — and he’s coming to destroy your precious curve.

Meet Aaron Parnas. He’ll be attending George Washington University Law School, and he’s not your average 1L. Why’s that? He’s only 18 years old, and he graduated from college before he graduated from high school. You can go ahead and call him Doogie Howser, but he doesn’t even really know who that is.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Parnas has dreamed of going to law school since the tender age of 10, and he took the LSAT when he was about 16 years old. What does this wunderkind want to do when he grows up graduates from law school? Here’s an excerpt from his interview with Karen Sloan of [Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/08/15/a-mere-teen-this-young-man-is-heading-to-law-school/):

I definitely want to go into a corporate positon, maybe something to do with mergers and acquisitions. I also like alternative dispute resolution. Either one of those two I’d like to go into for a while and get started. After that, I’d like to branch out into politics.

Parnas has some pretty big aspirations for his future political career — like most kids, he wants to be president, but given how intelligent he is, this kid could actually stand a chance. He thinks law school is the “perfect stepping stone” to achieve his goal, and he’ll probably gun his way through three years of legal education to get there.

By the time Parnas graduates and takes the bar exam, he’ll be 21, the minimum age requirement for bar admission. He’ll be able to celebrate passing the bar with a drink at the bar, because he’ll finally be old enough.

# Biglaw Firm To Pay $20 Million In Settlement To A Former Client
## With a $20 million payout on the horizon, the firm must be very glad to be done with this lawsuit.

According to court filings r[eported on by Richmond BizSense](http://richmondbizsense.com/2016/09/06/leclairryan-to-pay-20m-to-settle-hdl-inquiry/), the Biglaw firm of LeClairRyan is paying over $20 million dollars — $20.37 million, to be exact — to settle claims with the trustee of the now bankrupt Health Diagnostic Laboratory (HDL) surrounding the firm’s representation of HDL.

While there is a good deal of confidentiality surrounding the settlement, BizSense has done the digging to suggest the HDL trustee was pursuing malpractice claims against the firm:

The settlement agreement, filed in Richmond federal court on Sept. 1, does not provide exact detail of the claims the trustee had made against LeClairRyan. But BizSense reported last month that passages in the thousands of pages of previous court documents show the trustee’s camp was pursuing malpractice claims related to the law firm’s representation of HDL from its inception in 2008 and into 2015.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The blood testing company declared bankruptcy in 2015, after the federal government began investigating whether various “fees” HDL paid out to doctors were actually kickbacks.

According to a firm statement, post-settlement LeClairRyan is moving forward, and it is not admitting any wrongdoing:

Bruce Matson, LeClairRyan’s chief legal officer, said in a prepared statement that the firm looks forward to putting the case behind it.

“As stated in the settlement, we do not believe LeClairRyan is responsible for the actions that led to the government investigation or bankruptcy of HDL,” Matson said. “We believe we provided sound legal counsel to the company at all times during our engagements based upon the issues and information shared with our legal team by HDL.” ….

Maintaining that LeClairRyan believes it did nothing wrong related to HDL, Matson said in his prepared statement that settling was in the firm and HDL’s best interest.

“Unfortunately, in bankruptcy cases of this nature, it’s quite common for professional firms providing advice from time to time to such companies to be pulled into the bankruptcy case,” Matson said. “Unfortunately, the pursuit of litigation claims against law firms has become quite commonplace as one of the ways trustees try to raise funds to pay off claimants in bankruptcy cases.”

While the claims against the firm are a thing of the past, the same cannot be said for possible claims against former name partner Dennis Ryan, who may still be embroiled in litigation surrounding HDL’s bankruptcy:

LeClairRyan namesake and cofounder Dennis Ryan isn’t off the hook. The settlement document specifically preserves the trustee’s right to pursue claims against Ryan, who represented HDL in its early years while still at the law firm, ultimately leaving the firm in March of 2012 to join the then-booming downtown lab company.

With a $20 million payout on the horizon, the firm must be very glad to be done with this lawsuit.

# Biglaw Caves: Morrison Foerster Changes Diversity Fellowship Criteria Following Lawsuit
## Get ready for the deluge of white conservative dude bros with a hard on for 'viewpoint diversity.'

[Back in August](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/two-biglaw-firms-sued-over-diversity-initiatives/), Edward Blum, the conservative legal strategist behind the recent Supreme Court case that [dismantled college affirmative action](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/first-they-came-for-affirmative-action-then-they-came-for-legacy-admissions-good-riddance/), launched an attack on Biglaw efforts to diversify the profession. Fresh off his Supreme Court victory, Blum founded The American Alliance for Equal Rights, a group which then sued both Perkins Coie and Morrison Foerster for their diversity fellowships.

Now it looks like MoFo blinked. As [reported](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/us-law-firm-alters-diversity-fellowship-criteria-after-lawsuit-2023-09-06/) by Reuters, the criteria for the firm’s Keith Wetmore 1L Fellowship for Excellence, Diversity, and Inclusion — the program at the heart of the lawsuit — has changed.

Before Blum’s group sued on Aug. 22 in federal court in Miami, Morrison & Foerster’s website said the fellowship was intended for law students “who are members of historically underrepresented groups in the legal industry.”

But that language is gone now, and the flyer now instead says applicants just need to be able to “bring a diverse perspective to the firm as a result of your adaptability, cultural fluency, resilience, and life experiences.”

Oof, this change  was made a week after Blum filed the lawsuit against the firm. Other institutions are [experimenting](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/emorys-response-to-the-supreme-court-killing-affirmative-action-tell-us-about-your-community/) with [how to care](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/law-schools-prepare-for-their-first-salvo-of-post-affirmative-action-applications/) about diversity [without](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/is-columbia-law-trying-to-do-affirmative-action-in-the-most-obvious-way-possible-probably-not/) talking about diversity in the wake of the Court’s decision, but this approach just feels like it opens the door for “[viewpoint diversity](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/conservative-profs-want-viewpoint-diversity-which-is-kinda-racist/)” applicants. It’s a trope [already trotted out](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/supreme-court-reminded-that-harvards-real-diversity-problem-is-the-lack-of-smart-conservatives/) as part of the effort to kill affirmative action.

MoFo has not yet commented on the change to its fellowship criteria or the lawsuit.

A state of emergency has been declared in New York due to the rapid outbreak of coronavirus. The legal community has already been touched by the mysterious virus, with one [lawyer from a boutique firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/this-lawyer-has-new-yorks-second-confirmed-case-of-coronavirus/) having been marked as the second person in the state to be officially diagnosed. That diagnosis led to a [student at Cardozo Law going into self-quarantine](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/new-york-law-student-in-self-quarantine-after-contact-with-infected-lawyers-firm/) and [New York Law School closing its doors](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/amid-coronavirus-fears-law-school-cancels-classes/) for extensive cleaning due to student contact with that lawyer’s firm.

All the while, Biglaw firms were postponing and canceling events and limiting both foreign and domestic travel due to the illness, but we hadn’t heard of a U.S. case of COVID-19 within the large law firm world — until now.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
It’s finally happened. An unnamed partner at one of the most successful Biglaw firms in the world has tested positive for coronavirus.

Which firm could it be? It’s Quinn Emanuel.

Firm leader John Quinn spoke to the [New York Law Journal](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2020/03/08/quinn-emanuel-partner-in-ny-tests-positive-with-coronavirus-firm-to-keep-workers-home/) on Sunday, and said that the partner in question listed the names of all attorneys and staff with whom he’d recently interacted. Everyone who has come in contact with the partner thus far has been notified of his illness.

“His symptoms are reportedly very minor, and he actually feels better than he did. We’re hoping and expecting that he’s going to be perfectly fine and that nobody else is going to get infected, and that nobody’s else family is going to be affected,” Quinn said.

“We do know that as soon as he had any issue, he has stayed home, he’s been home since this past week,” Quinn added, though he cautioned, “you can’t rule out the possibility he had the virus before he started to stay home.”

The firm has decided to close its New York offices this week, and sources say they will be thoroughly sanitized before attorneys return to work. Quinn Emanuel is the first Biglaw firm to take such radical action in response to the coronavirus.

In the firm’s statement on Sunday, Quinn Emanuel said New York employees will work from home through the end of the week.

“Our No. 1 concern is for the health and well-being of all staff,” the firm said. “With that in mind, we are taking several steps, including implementing a work-from-home period for the New York office that will run from March 9 through March 13. We will continue to monitor the situation and keep the staff updated.”

“So far we don’t have any indication that anybody else has any symptoms,” Quinn said. “We’re just going to bend over backwards to protect everybody in our firm and anybody who interacted with our firm. We’re trying to act responsibly and take very precaution we can.”

What is your firm doing to protect lawyers and staff from coronavirus? Please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Coronavirus%20Response) (subject line: “Coronavirus Response”). Stay safe.

Hint: Compare that high percentage with the average for the top grossing 200 which is at 41 percent of U.S. partners getting their law degree in the 2000s, and you can see this firm does things a bit differently.

# Am Law 100 Firm Rolls Back Its COVID-19 Salary Cuts
## Finally, some good news for associates and staff on salaries.

August is almost over, and thanks to the coronavirus crisis, Biglaw firms have had their fair share of summertime sadness over the austerity measures put in place to combat the economic downturn caused by COVID-19. After enduring salary cuts, furloughs, and layoffs, associates and staff at many Biglaw firms have been waiting for the day when their lives would return to normal. Months have passed, and some firms are now walking back their cuts.

About four months ago, Sheppard Mullin — a firm that placed 54th on the latest Am Law 100 ranking — conducted two rounds of austerity measures, first [furloughing staff](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-furloughs-staff-no-other-cost-cutting-measures-for-now/) and later putting [all of its employees’ salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/sheppard-mullin-cuts/) on the chopping block. If you recall, those cuts were 12 percent for associates, special counsel, and staff attorneys, while staff members making more than $90,000 had cuts of 10 percent and staff members making between $70,000 and $90,000 saw their salaries cut by 5 percent. The firm said the partner cuts would be at a “meaningfully greater percentage.”

Now, employees at Sheppard Mullin are finally receiving some good news on the salary front. Here’s an excerpt from a memo that was sent out earlier this week (available in full on the next page):

Because of our strong performance the Executive Committee is reducing by half the COVID-related compensation adjustments for Associates, Special Counsel, Staff Attorneys, and Staff that began in May.  The 5% and 10% reductions absorbed by some of our staff will become 2½% and 5%, and the 12% reductions incurred by our Associates and most of our Staff Attorneys and Special Counsel will be reduced to 6%.  The changes will all be effective the payroll period starting August 31, 2020, paid on September 18, 2020.

The new percentage reductions are scheduled to stay in effect through the end of 2020.  The Executive Committee will continue to monitor our performance each month, and depending on results and our view of the pandemic’s impact on the future, sooner adjustments may be possible. As stated at the time of the reductions, our Partners have pledged to take the greatest burden on compensation during this COVID-affected business cycle.

We’re sure those impacted by the salary news at the firm must be thrilled –and wondering when their salaries will be fully restored. (On the flip side, all of the firm’s secretaries, except in Chicago and Washington, DC, will remain on its workshare program until the end of the year, and only two of the 51 employees who were furloughed have returned to work.)

Let’s hope more firms are able to roll back COVID-19 austerity measures.

# Jones Day Took Home Over $100 Million Thanks To A Controversial Bankruptcy Tactic
## The move has been very profitable for the Biglaw firm.

Great attorneys are supposed to think outside the box — netting their clients advantages others may not have seen. But that doesn’t mean the innovations will be without controversy. Take the “Texas Two-Step.” The brain child of Jones Day partner [Gregory Gordon](https://www.jonesday.com/en/lawyers/g/gregory-gordon?tab=overview), the legal maneuver has been hailed as the “greatest innovation in the history of bankruptcy” — that is, if you’re a massive conglomerate looking to eschew potential billions in mass tort liabilities.

Of course, attorneys on the plaintiff side of things think the move is an abuse of the bankruptcy system, as it bestows Chapter 11 protections on solvent companies that spin their tort liabilities off into bankrupt affiliate companies. This turns the plaintiffs into creditors, something Jones Day has previously defended as expediting the payment process.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/02/10/controversial-texas-two-step-netted-jones-day-107-million-before-3rd-circuit-rebuke/) Law.com, the practice has netted the Biglaw firm quite a bit of money:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In each of the four bankruptcies, the Jones Day bankruptcy team created new companies for defendants under a Texas law (hence the Texas Two-Step) and filed for Chapter 11 in North Carolina, where the party seeking to dismiss a bankruptcy case bears the burden of proving a bad faith filing.

Since filing an initial Texas Two-Step case on behalf of Koch Industries’ Georgia Pacific in 2017, Jones Day has proffered its services to French manufacturing firm Saint-Gobain, Trane Technologies, and Johnson & Johnson. The firm has collected more than $20 million in fees for each case, totaling more than $107 million in Texas Two-Step fees by February 2023.

But now the practice is under fire — and not just from opposing counsel. The Third Circuit [halted the practice](https://www.law.com/njlawjournal/2023/02/10/third-circuit-to-jj-chapter-11-is-appropriate-only-for-entities-facing-financial-distress/) in the Johnson & Johnson talc litigation — and the bankruptcy of affiliate LTL Management — because there was no finding the parent company was in financial distress when it filed for bankruptcy:

“Good intentions—such as to protect the J&J brand or comprehensively resolve litigation—do not suffice alone. What counts to access the Bankruptcy Code’s safe harbor is to meet its intended purposes. Only a putative debtor in financial distress can do so. LTL was not,” federal appellate Judge Thomas Ambro said in last month’s opinion.

For the talc case at least, this moves the litigation from North Carolina to New Jersey. Meaning the burden of proof flips to the debtors to prove they filed bankruptcy in good faith. It remains to be seen if other jurisdictions adopt the Third Circuit’s take on the practice. But it does add a new risk factor to consider for other companies interested in the controversial practice.

# Bluffing Your Way Out Of Ignorance
## Curing ignorance happens more often in-house, and it has to happen more quickly.  How do you do it?

Once upon a time, I knew someone who had worked as an aide for a U.S. senator.  The senator had a meeting with a bunch of constituents in about five minutes.  The aide filled those five minutes with the briefing:  She told the senator four key things about the constituents’ cause.

And the senator pulled it off!  The aide was startled:  “It was amazing!  The constituents really thought he knew about their problem, and they were convinced they mattered to him!”

This is a recurring theme in the law.

Partners often know very little about the client’s issue.

I didn’t say this was good.  I just said it was true.

I also didn’t say this was universally true among partners.  When I slaved away at a law firm, I was often deeply involved in the client’s case.  And I had many, many partners who also understood what they were working on.

But that wasn’t true of everyone.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
There were irresponsible partners.  Those partners had plenty of time, but no inclination to learn anything.  If those partners had to meet with a client, they had to be brought up to speed.

There were also partners who were too busy for their own good.  Those partners had attracted so much business that it was essentially impossible for them to know anything about any individual client’s case.  If those partners had to meet with a client, they had to be brought up to speed.

In a law firm, the bringing-an-ignorant-partner-up-to-speed drill is a pain in the neck.  You, and the others who are actually informed about a case, might waste a full eight-hour day telling the ignorant one about the case, answering the ignorant one’s questions, and then performing follow-up tasks when the ignorant one asks questions that no one could possibly care about, but the ignorant one’s in charge, so someone has to provide an answer.

Corporations actually operate at a faster pace than law firms. 

You feel rushed at a law firm, but you’re rushed because there isn’t sufficient time to perform a task:  “How is anyone supposed to draft a motion for summary judgment in a complex case in just three days?”

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
You also feel rushed at a corporation, but the rush is different:  Pre-scheduled phone call with a business person from 8 to 9.  Pre-scheduled one-on-one meeting with one of your direct reports from 9 to 10.  Pre-scheduled meeting with finance from 10 to 11.  A half hour free!  That’s where you’ll sneak in commenting on the draft motion for summary judgment in the complex case, answering a couple of emails, and responding to the internal survey.  And then it picks up again:  Pre-scheduled meeting from 11:30 to noon.  It’s unimaginable to have three days to think about what a motion for summary judgment should look like.

These truths mean that you bring ignorant people up to speed differently in-house than you do at law firms.  Curing ignorance happens more often in-house, and it has to happen more quickly.  How do you do it?

Here’s how you bring an ignorant person up to speed in-house:  Draft a short email.  The email has two sections.  The first section consists entirely of what the ignorant recipient has to know for the upcoming meeting, or what the ignorant person must say.  This section contains perhaps four to six short bullet points.  “During tomorrow’s meeting with BigCo, you must make the following points: . . . .”  You should also identify in this section who at the other side actually knows what’s going on.  (Suppose your company’s Ms. Big is talking to the other company’s Mr. Big.  Neither of those people really knows what they’re talking about.  So you should tell Ms. Big:  “The person who has been leading the charge for this at BigCo is [Jarndyce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarndyce_and_Jarndyce).”  That enables Ms. Big to say to the other side, “You may not be fully up to speed on this issue.  If you’re not, talk to Jarndyce.”  This tells the other side who to speak to within the other side’s organization.)

But that’s all the first chunk of your email should contain; you tell the ignorant one what to say.

The email then has a second section:  “To the extent you’d like to know more, here’s some background information about the problem. . . . ”  Now you’re entitled to spend perhaps four short paragraphs, using short sentences, explaining more about what’s really happening.

Finally, the closing sentence: “If you’d like to know more, or if you’d like to discuss this, please call.”  That covers you in case the ignorant person is curious.

It’s funny:  Although you encounter ignorant folks in politics, at law firms, and at corporations, you adjust for the ignorance in different ways in different environments.

We knew it would only be a matter of time before the first high-roller firm woud emerge to match [Davis Polk’s over-the-top new salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/davis-polk-salary-21/) for associates, but we thought it would take days for this to happen, not mere hours.

Baker McKenzie wants to make it known that it’s a leader in compensation, and now it’s got the chance to do just that. After [leading the pack on year-end bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/) in 2020, the firm is now the first to match the DPW $205,000 salary scale.

“Our associates make important contributions to our clients every day, and we believe it’s important to recognize those contributions, especially in light of the many challenges brought on by the pandemic, said Colin Murray, North America Chief Executive Officer. The salary increase for U.S. associates at the firm will take effect on July 1. Here’s what the salary scale looks like at Baker McKenzie:



Congratulations to everyone at the firm! Get ready, because this summer is going to be full of cold, hard cash for Biglaw associates.

We depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

# Georgia Prosecutor Is Coming For Donald Trump
## Trump shouldn't have come for Georgia's votes.

Meet Fulton County, Georgia District Attorney Fani Willis. The newly elected prosecutor announced her office was opening up a criminal investigation into Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of Georgia 2020 presidential election.

Playing a large role in the investigation is the [leaked phone call](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/the-donald-trump-call-shouldnt-have-been-leaked-if-counsel-were-even-remotely-doing-their-jobs/) between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. You’ll recall [two now-former Biglaw attorneys](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/and-now-both-biglaw-lawyers-have-resigned-over-the-trump-call/) were also on the call,[ Cleta Mitchell](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/donald-trump-drags-biglaw-firm-into-middle-of-election-interference-effort/) and[ Alex Kaufman](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/there-was-another-biglaw-firm-partner-on-the-donald-trump-call-with-georgia-election-officials/). Appearing on the Rachel Maddow show last night, Willis noted that Trump’s request on the call for a very specific number of additional ballots to be found could go a long way to establishing mens rea.

D.A. Willis: Detailed facts become important, like asking for a specific number and then going back to investigate and understand that that number is just one more than the number that is needed. It lets you know that someone had a clear mind.They understood what they were doing. [pic.twitter.com/vH46bBaAyD](https://t.co/vH46bBaAyD)

But Willis [has cautioned](https://www.newsweek.com/fani-willis-georgia-trump-investigation-maddow-1568832) that despite the infamy of that particular call, she’s keeping an open mind as she begins the investigation:

“I have no idea what I’ll find. I think a good law enforcement officer, a good prosecutor, you walk in with an open mind, you get the facts for what they are, there will be some statutes that we’ll look at.

“If those facts meet the elements of those statutes then we’ll bring charges.”

Of course… she has a hypothesis as to what she’ll find (hint: moar!):

Willis: “What I know about investigations is they're kind of like peeling back an onion. And as you go through each layer, you learn different things. To be a responsible prosecutor, you must look at all those things in an investigation, to be fair to everyone involved.” [#gapol](https://twitter.com/hashtag/gapol?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/HBAJN3RNfV](https://t.co/HBAJN3RNfV)

— Greg Bluestein (@bluestein) [February 12, 2021](https://twitter.com/bluestein/status/1360057334601551876?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

You might be wondering exactly how this investigation got started, and you can thank a law school professor. George Washington University law professor John Banzhaf III [reportedly](https://www.ajc.com/politics/fultons-da-opens-criminal-investigation-into-trump-demand-to-overturn-election/YWJPS4B4BREHDLHQCZYDDWBVIA/) filed the initial complaint.

Willis has stressed that criminals charges are far from a certainty. But we do know that Donald Trump’s legal problems are going to get a lot stickier.

# Lawsuit Alleges Jones Day Doctored Firm Picture To Make Attorney Look More Caucasian
## Plus allegations the firm's parental leave policy is discriminatory.

Wow, the hits just keep on coming for Jones Day. In addition to the [class-action gender discrimination lawsuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/amended-gender-discrimination-case-brings-the-real-scoop-on-jones-day-compensation/) that’s been filed against the firm (and which we’ve been following closely), they’re now facing a new discrimination lawsuit that goes after the firm’s non-gender neutral parental leave policy and their alleged practice of altering firm photos to make their attorneys more attractive/white. There are a bunch of allegations in the lawsuit which make for a not-so-good look for the firm, so hold tight as I go through them all.

Julia Sheketoff and Mark Savignac are a married couple that both used to work in the appellate practice in Jones Day’s D.C. office. Both former Supreme Court clerks, they say the firm’s parental leave creates an improper distinction between mothers and fathers who seek to take leave, and when Savignac complained about the policy, he was promptly fired. According to the firm’s parental leave policy, biological mothers who are primary caregivers receive 10 weeks of paid family leave as well as eight weeks of disability leave, compared with biological fathers who are also primary caregivers but only get 10 weeks of leave, while new adoptive parents (any gender) who are primary caregivers get the full 18 weeks of paid leave. The EEOC says that an employer may give a biological mother eight additional weeks of disability if it is linked to their physical recovery, but as [reported by ](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/14/business/economy/jones-day-lawsuit.html)the New York Times, plaintiffs allege the difference in leave time is based on antiquated assumptions about gender roles:

But in their legal complaint, Mr. Savignac and Ms. Sheketoff argue that Jones Day awards mothers eight additional weeks of paid leave without regard to whether their physical condition warrants it. The plaintiffs write that the policy gives “female associates more time to enable their husbands to prioritize their careers over child care” and “reflects and reinforces archaic gender roles and sex-based stereotypes.”

And the filing points to more than just the policy as evidence of the way the firm reifies traditional gender roles; the complaint alleges a partner repeatedly made fun of the notion of men using parental leave:

The complaint, filed Tuesday, maintains that the firm and some of its partners promoted crude stereotypes about gender roles, with a prominent male partner asking rhetorically, “What would a man do on parental leave — watch his wife unload the dishwasher?” The same partner, the suit claims, teased a male associate for taking parental leave to care for a child.

The complaint also alleges that after Savignac complained about the firm’s leave policy — three days after, to be precise — he was fired, despite having a history of positive reviews:

“I was shocked; we truly never considered that they would fire me,” Mr. Savignac said. “We thought the law was so obvious.”

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

The firm has denied that its leave policy is discriminatory and said they fired Savignac over his attitude towards the firm:

Jones Day defended its policy, saying it grants birth mothers eight weeks of paid disability leave to avoid having to ask for medical evidence that they are still recovering from childbirth. The firm said the firing of Mr. Savignac had not been in retaliation for criticizing the leave policy, which it said he and Ms. Sheketoff had done in 2018 without repercussions. Rather, it said, it fired him because he had shown a “lack of courtesy” to colleagues and an “open hostility to the firm,” citing his email.

In an additional allegation that echoes other lawsuits against the firm, the complaint also takes aim at the firm’s infamous black box compensation system ([yes, I’m going to continue calling it that despite what the firm says about it](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/jones-day-to-gender-discrimination-plaintiffs-you-dont-deserve-to-be-paid-on-the-cravath-scale/?rf=1)) saying that Sheketoff’s (who left the firm to work at a public defender’s office last year) compensation was lower than it should have been because she’s a woman:

Separately, the couple contends that the firm paid Ms. Sheketoff less than it would have paid a man because of her gender. “Julia’s salary was cut in relative terms based on a negative review from a partner who, in hindsight, clearly treated her worse because she is a woman,” said the couple’s email to the human resources director included in the complaint.

The firm denies Sheketoff’s salary was impacted by her gender, saying it was lower because of mixed reviews from partners.

And now for the most shocking allegation in the complaint, at least in my humble opinion: the complaint alleges that when Sheketoff had her picture taken for the firm’s website, the final image was edited to lighten her skin and narrow her nose. As the complaint notes, “[t]he apparent purpose of the alterations was to make was to make Julia appear more Caucasian and (in the opinion of the editor) more attractive.” The complaint says they edit the pictures of women at the firm on the reg (pointing to two of Sheketoff’s female friends at the firm) to make them prettier, while men are spared the photoshop treatment. In a perfect illustration on the way intersectionality works, in the case of this bi-racial woman, “prettier” = more white.

You can take a look at the original and edited versions of the picture for yourself:

Plaintiff in new discrimination lawsuit against Jones Day, the law firm that represents the Trump campaign, says the firm lightened her skin and narrowed her nose in a photo for its website, to make her look more Caucasian. Firm denies the allegation. [https://t.co/K2SKpLMCgy](https://t.co/K2SKpLMCgy) [pic.twitter.com/hx0BgEqiyc](https://t.co/hx0BgEqiyc)

As former SCOTUS clerks, the couple was once used to bolster the firm’s recruitment of other clerks. Now Savignac says he regrets trying to convince others to work at Jones Day, “I feel bad about having worked to persuade other people who may have been misled.” Well, maybe if they [read Above the Law…](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/jones-day/)

# Annoying Parts Of The Law Firm Hiring Process
## Law firms should take a hard look about certain norms of the hiring process that may be eliminated in order to streamline the process of looking for jobs.

Last week, I wrote an article about how law firms sometimes treat job candidates poorly throughout the hiring process. The article generated some positive feedback, and I received a number of emails from readers about how parts of the hiring process are tough and even annoying for job candidates. Fortunately for me, it has been a while since I sought a law firm job, [and now I run my own law firm](http://www.rothmanlawyer.com). However, I definitely remember some annoying parts of the law firm hiring process that are somewhat unnecessary and can be eliminated in order to relieve the stress experienced by job candidates.

Thank-You Emails

Probably one of the most annoying parts of the hiring process is thank-you emails. As many people within the legal industry already know, job candidates are usually expected to write thank-you emails to the people with whom they interviewed. These emails are not only supposed to convey gratitude to the interviewer but also relate continued interest in the firm to which the candidate has interviewed.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
When I was a job candidate, I experienced a lot of stress around thank-you emails. I read each of my thank-you emails probably ten times before sending them in order to make sure that I did not make mistakes and that everything sounded okay. In addition, some of the recruiters with whom I worked even asked to review my thank-you emails before I sent them out to ensure that they were satisfactory. This demonstrates how important thank-you emails can be, and the substantial impact they may have on the hiring process. During my interviews, I made sure to jot down notes about the people with whom I was interviewing to make sure that I had plenty of material to write about in my thank-you emails.

However, what benefits can really be derived from thank-you emails? Of course, it makes sense that people should covey continued interest in a position in order to stay on top of the heap of job candidates looking for a role. However, thank-you emails do not really convey too much information about job candidates and are usually treated as an annoying task that needs to be checked off when applying for a job.

When I interviewed candidates for jobs, I usually never even read the thank-you emails I received. I would usually just see the email flash up on my Outlook, and kind of feel bad that the job candidate had to comport with the convention that she or he had to send a thank-you email. If individuals involved in the hiring process want to make things easier for job candidates, they should tell people during interviews that no thank-you emails are necessary. This would eliminate one source of stress for many job candidates and ensure that reviewers focus on the attributes of a job candidate that have a bigger impact on whether that person is a good fit for an open position.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Cover letters are another annoying part of the law firm hiring process. Don’t get me wrong, cover letters can sometimes be helpful for law firms and job candidates. In certain instances, job candidates might need to explain why they are interested in a given position because of a nontraditional background. However, when a job candidate is applying to an ordinary job for ordinary reasons (i.e. to do legal work at an average firm and earn a paycheck) it is oftentimes annoying and time-consuming to draft a cover letter.

Usually, the function of a cover letter is supplanted by an email, and writing an email is generally easier than drafting a document in Word that is separate from other application materials. However, when I was searching for jobs earlier in my career, some firms explicitly required a separate cover letter and noted that applications would not be considered if a cover letter wasn’t included. Perhaps such a requirement was established merely to weed out candidates who were applying to jobs en masse or at random. However, firms should not make cover letters mandatory, because the vast majority of positions do not require the additional explanation that is typically conveyed in a cover letter.

Asking Questions During Interviews

The first time I was interviewed for a firm job, the interviewer asked me if I had any questions for her, and I said I didn’t. The interviewer seemed surprised by my response, and I was not hired for the job. I later found out that you are supposed to ask questions at job interviews, purportedly to show that you’ve done your research and are interested about a job. Also, people generally like talking about themselves and their firms. As a result, in every subsequent interview, I did cursory research about firms with which I was interviewing and had questions in the can to ask.

However, when people apply to ordinary jobs for ordinary reasons, there may be situations when a job candidate does not have questions. And there shouldn’t be an artificial expectation that job candidates should ask questions, since this just imposes more burdens on people searching for jobs.

All told, job candidates need to deal with a number of annoying practices while searching for jobs, and this adds to the stress these folks already experience. Law firms should take a hard look about certain norms of the hiring process that may be eliminated in order to streamline the process of looking for jobs.

# Some Lawyers Need To Change Archaic Language In Legal Papers
## Telegrams, wax cylinders, Linear A inscriptions. It's all part of the rich pageant of what you can -- but probably shouldn't -- request during discovery.

‘Grandma? Opposing counsel wants me to turn over ‘mimeographs.’ Is that really a thing?’

Lawyers are known for using archaic verbiage (often known as “legalese” in legal papers). Sometimes, this verbiage is used for theatrics, and it is true that some folks may respond to legal notices sooner if there is verbiage in the document that includes a little pomp and circumstance. Other times, lawyers just copy and paste the same words into countless legal documents without thinking twice about what they are including in the papers. However, more lawyers should actually read the archaic verbiage in some of their legal writing and update this language to better suit the modern times in which we all practice law.

Recently, I was reading a document demand that I was served with in a legal matter my firm is handling. The document demands came with a dense list of definitions, that included a long-winded explanation of what words in the document demands meant. In the definition of the word “documents” the demands stated that “documents” includes all manner of correspondence, letters, emails, and the like, but the demand also said that “ documents” also meant telegrams and content stored on ZIP drives, cassette tapes, or floppy disks.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
I have not seen a floppy disk in a few decades, and it is doubtful that anyone in legal practice or the business world has used floppy disks for years. It is also a stretch to think that any lawyers or the clients they serve have used cassette tapes for a really long time, although I admit that a firm I worked at six or seven years ago did use cassette tapes to record items for dictation. However, when was the last time that anyone sent or received a telegram? Why would this adversary of mine think that it was necessary to put the example of a telegram as the kind of document that I needed to produce in response to this document demand? Perhaps my adversary should have also included Pony Express dispatches, smoke signal logs, and other communications in the definition!

Clearly, this legal verbiage had been copied and pasted for years, and perhaps even decades, without anyone thinking twice about the definitions that were included with the document demands. However, including the example of telegrams in the definitions section of the document demands made my adversary look sloppy and a little out of touch. More lawyers should review their legal verbiage to make sure that they are not blindly copying and pasting words without thinking about the implications of the content they are writing.

Lawyers also often use antiquated verbiage on notices that they send to other attorneys and courts. Earlier in my career, it was common to see “Dear Sirs” on legal papers, and even though this has seemingly become rarer in recent years, I see this salutation every so often. This greeting is usually improper since it harkens back to a time when the legal profession was an old boys’ club and practitioners were predominately male. Sometimes, people use the greeting “Dear Sirs” when everyone involved in a matter is male, but this might not be appropriate. Files change hands all the time, and it is possible that a female attorney will look at the papers at some point in the life of a case.

Some people write “Dear Sirs/Madams” in notices that they circulate to counsel and courts, but this salutation might not be appropriate either. The term “Madam” has various different meanings that always made the salutation seem kind of funny when it is included in legal notices. Moreover, there are more general and welcoming salutations that get the point across just as easily. For instance, when sending notices to attorneys, the salutation can just read “Dear Counselors” which applies to everyone equally. Of course, people do not pay too much attention to salutations, but they can impact other people involved in a case.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.

There is other, mostly theatrical language that lawyers include in legal papers, which does not always serve a purpose. It is common in some legal documents to begin the papers with “Now Here Comes” so and so, which seems so rigid and ancient. In bills of sales and similar documents, the words “know all men by these presents” or something similar that might be more gender neutral can often be found. It is unclear what practical impact this statement has on legal documents. Moreover, the words “Please take notice” or something similar can get the point across without forcing the reader to unpack some byzantine language.

In any event, pretty much every lawyer copies and pastes form documents that includes language they have not reviewed for a very long time. However, attorneys should update some of the archaic language in their legal documents. Not only are some words not applicable to the modern world but certain phrases can cause confusion and friction that can be avoided with different word choices.

Bryan Cave partner Daniel Waxman is on “indefinite leave” after being arrested last week [allegedly attempting to meet a 14-year-old girl](https://westchester.news12.com/partner-in-nyc-law-firm-arrested-in-rockland-sexual-predator-sting) he’d carried on a text conversation with for the past month. In reality, he’d been chatting with an undercover cop.
He’s charged with attempted dissemination of indecent material to minors.

That title might sound like a relatively light charge, but the relevant NY penal code provision [includes](https://nycourts.gov/judges/cji/2-PenalLaw/235/235.22.pdf) “intentionally us[ing] any computer communication system… to initiate or engage in such communication with a person who is a minor, and by means of such communication… intentionally importunes, invites or induces a minor to engage in sexual intercourse, oral sexual conduct or anal sexual conduct, or sexual contact….”

Business has changed. The bar is getting higher. Regulators, investors, and clients demand that corporations provide transparent environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosures. ESG missteps can result in loss of business, loss of investment dollars, greenwashing allegations, and brand damage. And the stakes are getting higher as new regulations come into effect.

In-house legal teams are increasingly finding themselves in the crosshairs of ESG challenges, opportunities, and risks. Often they are told something like “Put an ESG plan in place.”

If you are on the receiving end of this vague direction, it will be hard to get started. What does that even mean?

I take a practical approach to ESG. I like to break things down into clear and actionable steps. It’s a big part of why I was able to roll out an ESG program at my last company from scratch.

Here is the secret to getting started. You must assess your ESG gap. This assessment will be the cornerstone of your business case and your action plan.

You can complete an ESG gap assessment in three steps.

Step 1: Create A Master List Of ESG Actions

Your company is probably being asked to do a lot of things on ESG. You need to identify and organize those asks. Create a master list starting with these sources:

- Requests for ESG data that you have received from clients
- Requests for ESG data that you have received from investors
- Commitments you have made in contracts
- Items that you need for third-party ESG assessments (like Ecovadis)
- Requirements from any new or upcoming regulations
Check your list against the items in this article on [8 Elements Every ESG Program Must Have](https://www.christineuri.com/newsletter/the-esg-advisor/key-elements-esg-program).

As you create this list, keep track of where the requests came from and note overlaps. Use this information to prioritize later.

Step 2: Inventory Your Current Practices Using The Master List

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Once you have your master list, reach out to the relevant departments across your organization to collect information related to each item. For example, you may need to:

- Ask your human resources department for information related to labor and employment and health and safety
- Check legal and compliance records to determine if your governance policies are complete
- Look at how your operations team manages suppliers
- Review (and verify) what is on your website
You will probably discover that you have more pieces of an ESG program than you thought. Often ESG efforts are siloed and not well known across the company. You can use this as an opportunity to assemble the relevant information to respond to future questionnaires.

Step 3: Prioritize Potential ESG Actions

At this stage, you will know your gaps. You will probably have a lot of them. Great. So what do you do with that information?

Organize ESG actions into four categories:

- Completed (Well done!!!)
- Quick wins
- Strategic considerations
- Items for the future
Quick wins are easy items you can complete to make your stakeholders happy and items that you must complete to be a responsible business. These could include things like filling gaps in your ethics and labor policies and documenting existing responsibilities for ESG.

Strategic considerations are items that depend on the strategy developed by your executive team. For example, you will likely need an executive decision on your approach to climate and DEI.

Items for the future are things you are being asked for that aren’t relevant to your business today.  If your current business does not touch on an ESG item, put it on a watch list and focus on what you can impact now.

Completing an ESG gap assessment will enable you to shift from a high-level goal (put an ESG plan in place) to a specific list of actions that you need to take and decisions that need to be made. It will also help you say “No” to external requests that don’t fit in with the broader picture.

Curious what to do next? Check out my [12-Month ESG Roadmap For In-House Counsel](https://www.christineuri.com/esg-roadmap-fo-in-house-counsel). The roadmap provides a guide you can use to go from ESG assessment to reporting in a year.

# Biglaw Partner Takes To Begging Associates To Come To The Office
## He'd really like you to come by the office.

Every Biglaw firm — hell, most employers, regardless of industry — is trying to figure out exactly what post-COVID work looks like. Because, while remote work got us through, it’s unclear exactly how much of that will be in our future. One Biglaw partner has taken to sending pleas to attorneys asking them to come back to the physical office.

Charles “Chuck” Palmer is the managing partner of Troutman Pepper’s Atlanta office. And he’d really, REALLY like folks to be back in the office. He links it to building the firm’s culture, and assures everyone that associates are MORE than just billing machines:

We talk a lot about our firm’s culture – about how we like each other and care about one another.  Of course that is a bit extreme.  There are a few in our Atlanta office who are annoying to be around.  They know who they are.  But with those exceptions, I believe most of us enjoy seeing one another and working together.  Furthermore, while perhaps some of our more experienced lawyers may be perfectly fine working remotely, I can’t imagine what it would have been like as an associate learning to be a lawyer from home.  I don’t believe I could have done it.  It’s not simply a function of being able to bill hours.  There is more to being a lawyer than simply the capacity to bill 2,000 hours a year.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And then Palmer leans heavily into the guilt to convince people the office is where it’s at:

The future of our law firm is not the remote practice of law. I believe law firms that become too heavily remote will ultimately disappear or will lose clients to firms who are able to present a collegial and coordinated representation to those clients. Simply because technology allowed us to work remotely during a pandemic doesn’t mean human nature that evolved over thousands of years changed in a matter of months. Personal and in-person relationships matter. Unlike “You’ve Got Mail” and “Sleepless in Seattle” none of us are able to develop truly close relationships remotely. Those are movies. They aren’t real life. Tom Hanks doesn’t work here.

The email, described by a tipster as rambling ([but you can see it for yourself here](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/troutman-pepper-email-back/2/)), ended with a stark plea: “Please come to the office.  Our future depends on it.”

And insiders at the firm say it isn’t the first time Palmer has downright begged attorneys to come back to the office. He apparently used the combination of Memorial Day and the passing of a colleague to pen a [previous long missive](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/troutman-pepper-email-back/3/), which relied more on incentives to convince folks to come back to the office:

I hope that many of you are returning or considering returning to the office.  We have 550 people in Atlanta, and we are now seeing perhaps 150 of you on any given day of late.  We are having lawyer lunches on Tuesdays, summer associate breakfasts on Wednesdays, and happy hours on Thursdays.  We are giving away prizes such as Braves tickets, gift cards, etc.  But you have to be present to win!  Everyone has now had the opportunity to be vaccinated if desired, and we hope you will start coming in if you have not done so already.  We do not want to be a “virtual” law firm.  Collegiality and training are important for both our younger and older lawyers and for our staff.   Please don’t be a stranger.  More and more of your colleagues are coming in, and I hope to see all of you soon.

Striking the right balance between the office and virtual work will be an on going conversation. Folks at Troutman definitely know where Palmer stands.

I hope my firm survives…

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

For the Stroock people, this is extremely good news because it gets them a pathway forward and a landing spot as a firm. It sounds like they wouldn’t face any of the mess that comes from bankruptcy or dissolution.

— An anonymous former Stroock & Stroock & Lavan employee, in optimistic comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/09/25/pillsbury-winthrop-shaw-pittman-stroock-market-observers-are-bullish-on-merger-talks/) on the non-exclusive [letter of intent to merge](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/stroock-is-talking-to-another-am-law-100-firm-about-merging-but-its-not-exclusive/) signed between Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman and Stroock.

# Proof That Law Firms Don't Really Care About Associate Development
## A federal judge told the parties they had to let their associates speak or neither side would get oral argument. The firms said they'd rather take option B.

UPDATE: Judge Grewal has responded to the firms’ decision [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/judge-delivers-stinging-rebuke-to-partners-for-freezing-out-associates/).

Some firms do a better job of pushing their associates out of the nest, but by and large firms talk a much better game about lawyer development than they really practice. That reality was on full display last week when a pair of firms waived oral argument rather than comply with a judge’s order that the firms allow their associates to flex some courtroom muscles.

The double-edged sword of Biglaw (or high-stakes Small Law) litigation experience is that for all the wealth of high-profile disputes and complex legal issues young lawyers get to delve into, associates tend to be overlooked when it comes to actual courtroom work. If one is really lucky, maybe a senior associate will get tossed the direct examination of a meaningless witness as a bone, but generally the mantra of complex litigation is that associates are better seen in front of a word processor than heard.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Magistrate Judge Paul Grewal considered this decline in tangible courtroom experience granted to the next generation of lawyers in an order entered last week in GSI Technology v. United Memories:

In a technology community like ours that prizes youth—at times unfairly—there is one place where youth and inexperience seemingly comes with a cost: the courtroom. In intellectual property case after intellectual property case in this courthouse, legions of senior lawyers with decades of trial experience regularly appear. Nothing surprises about this. When trade secret or patent claims call for millions in damages and substantial injunctive relief, who else should a company call but a seasoned trial hand? But in even the brief tenure of the undersigned, a curious trend has emerged: the seasoned trial hand appears for far more than trial itself. What once might have been left to a less experienced associate is now also claimed by senior counsel. Motion to compel discovery? Can’t risk losing that. Motion to exclude expert testimony? Can’t risk losing that, either. Motion to exclude Exhibit 20356 as prejudicial under Fed. R. Evid. 403? Same thing.

Faced with this conundrum, Judge Grewal proposed a novel solution:

But with no fewer than six post-trial motions set for argument next week, surely an opportunity can be made to give those associates that contributed mightily to this difficult case a chance to step out of the shadows and into the light. To that end, the court expects that each party will allow associates to present its arguments on at least two of the six motions to be heard. If any party elects not to do this, the court will take its positions on all six motions on the papers and without oral argument.

That seems entirely reasonable. Therefore, it should surprise no one that the senior lawyers in the case responded two days later by jointly agreeing that all the motions should be decided based on the filings.

United Memories is represented by Ruyak Cherian, so they probably get a pass here because the tech-focused litigation boutique might not have an army of associates on this matter to unleash. But GSI is represented by Biglaw behemoth DLA Piper, so we know they aren’t hurting for associates itching to get some time in front of a judge.

There’s no good way to spin this from the partners’ perspective. If the briefs researched and drafted by associates are so strong, then what possible harm could that associate do in arguing them? And why was oral argument so important when a seasoned *cough* higher billing *cough* lawyer was going to do it, and so unnecessary now? Plus, when Judge Grewal specifically asked to hear from less-experienced attorneys, he signaled himself as a sympathetic ear — he didn’t make this unusual request without planning to grade on a curve.

Think of this episode the next time a firm tells you how much they value their young lawyers: one of the biggest firms in the world would rather stay silent than let one of its legion of associates talk to a judge for 10 minutes… and still [publicly crows](http://www.dlapiperlegalcareers.us/working/professional-development.html) about its commitment to “help our lawyers reach their highest potential as professionals.”

(If you’d like to decide the matter purely on the filings, both the order and response are available on the next page…)

# Take The Sick Day
## Far too many people in corporate America, especially lawyers, work even when they’re sick.

I hope I don’t cause an uprising in corporate America, but allow me provide you background on why I highly encourage in-house counsel to take the sick day, if they or their kids are really sick.

Part of it could be that it is my current lived experience. It is barely 2023, but starting on January 1, almost every member of my family has gotten sick – the-can’t-keep-liquids-in kind of sick. It was my 11-month-old (we went to the ER!), then my husband, then my 5-year-old. And yesterday, I got a fever, chills, and body aches but luckily can hold my liquid. The only one standing so far is my 7-year-old (fingers crossed!).

Amidst this chaos, I was very relieved that I could let my team know and use one of my 10 available sick days. That way I didn’t have to spend extra mental energy worrying about making calls and responding to emails. It helped with the “guilt” of not showing up as my best self. While my generous colleagues offered to back me up, I didn’t think I needed it — and instead relied on my trusty away message to let clients know that I was sick and that if it couldn’t wait a day, to call my cell. For what it’s worth, I had two calls.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Note, I am not a proponent of using sick days for anything other than a sick day, and I really only use them when I feel so bad that I can’t think or type. Last year, I only used one or two.

At the same time, I know too many people in corporate America, especially lawyers, who work even when they’re sick. And while it can be seen as admirable — to be so committed and engaged with work that you make it work even when you’re sick — that view can be short-sighted, especially if you make it a habit.

One reason is that physically and mentally, you need rest to get better. Working, even though you’re sick, can delay your recovery.

Another reason is that it can lead to burnout — and resentment, even if you initially choose to work while sick. Candidly, there may be seasons in our careers that we may feel undervalued, and “they didn’t appreciate me working while I was sick” is one we do to ourselves.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The big proponent for me is culture — and how each of us at our workplace has an active role in creating it. If we, as professionals and leaders, take sick days when we need it, it tells others that it is OK for them to do so too.

It is not a sign of weakness. It is not a sign of disengagement. It is not a sign of lack of commitment. It is a sign that we are human — and that we need rest.

So if you’re sick, take the sick day.

One by one, Biglaw’s heavy hitters are signing off on the latest Davis Polk compensation grid, which ranges from $215,000 to $396,500. Now, one of the biggest Biglaw firms of all has rubber-stamped the generous new salary scale.

Baker McKenzie, a firm that brought in $2,899,834,000 gross revenue in 2020, making it the No. 4 firm in the latest Am Law 100 ranking, recently announced that it would be matching Davis Polk. If you recall, the firm was an [early adopter](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/baker-raise-2022/) of the [Milbank salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/) that was released last month.

Here’s Baker McKenzie’s new salary scale:



The firm’s salary increases are retroactive to January 1, and associates will see more money in their March 11 paychecks. Congratulations to everyone!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Baker McKenzie.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff.

# IP Boutique Gives Raises, Because Some Money Is Better Than None
## It may not meet the Cravath scale, but it is still a nice payday.

It [has been argued](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/kanyes-law-firm-issues-raises-for-associates/) that not all firms should be MoneyLaw firms and give all associates raises that match the Cravath scale. Firms should, instead, understand where they stand in the law firm food chain, and balance what their clients expect from them, both in terms of cost and service.

Along these lines, we have another firm, Sterne Kessler, seeking to reward its associates, but not match the full Cravath grid. Sterne Kessler will be giving all associates, regardless of class year, a $20,000 raise, effective July 1. Compare that with the MoneyLaw scale, which gives associates a raise of between $20,000 and $35,000, depending on class year.

Managing Director of the firm, Michael B. Ray, made the following statement regarding the raises:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
We are proud to be among the best-of-the-best in IP law, and the strength of Sterne Kessler is our talent. In particular, our associates, many of whom have advanced technical degrees, make tremendous contributions to the excellent service and value we provide to our clients. The talent pools in both the IP and Washington, D.C. legal markets are incredibly competitive, and we recognize it is essential to provide fair compensation to our associates based on their skillsets and performance. This is an important investment in the firm and our future.

Congratulations to Sterne Kessler associates, enjoy your well-earned raises.

# 5th Circuit Lashes Out Over Attorney's 'Gifts' To Witnesses
## If this shows up on your Professional Responsibility issue-spotter then you're in pretty good shape.

The brazenness of this scheme to covertly compensate “non-retained” expert witnesses would make a Southern college football booster blush. Even those boosters know to make their handouts in cash — usually slipped through handshakes — or otherwise untraceable “favors” for the extended family. They appreciate the subtlety of the thing, you know?

Except, of course, your rival school. Those pricks are just cheaters.

In any event, here’s a passage from a Fifth Circuit opinion covered by the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2018/04/26/5th-circuit-blasts-lawyer-over-witness-gifts-and-tosses-502m-jj-verdict/), that should be obvious, but apparently bears repeating:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“Lawyers cannot engage with a favorable expert, pay him ‘for his time,’ then invite him to testify as a purportedly ‘non-retained’ neutral party,” U.S. Circuit Judge Jerry Smith wrote for the three-member appellate panel. “That is deception, plain and simple. And to follow that up with [a] post-trial ‘thank you’ check merely compounds the professional indiscretion.”

Well, yes. W. Mark Lanier — the famed plaintiffs’ attorney who periodically [crops up to kill tort reform](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2017/04/27/meet-the-conservative-republican-whos-trying-to-torpedo-tort-reform/#7f8f807b636d) as that rare breed of conservative Republican class action attorney megadonor — earned a severe tongue-lashing as his over half-billion dollar judgment got tossed by the Fifth Circuit.

The account is so stunning in its simplicity, that it’s almost comical to think anyone thought this could be acceptable. Remember, Lanier is trumpeting these experts to the jury as neutral observers with no pecuniary interest in either side:

Despite that designation, as well as repeated references during the trial to the doctors’ “pro bono” testimony, the Fifth Circuit found that Lanier had made a $10,000 donation before the bellwether trial to a charity of Morrey Sr.’s choosing. The court also found that, prior to the trial, Morrey Jr. had expected to receive payments from the plaintiffs lawyers. After the trial, the court added, Lanier sent the two doctors thank you notes that also included a $35,000 check to Morrey Sr. and a $30,000 check to Morrey Jr.

Astounding.

In ordering a new trial, the panel didn’t mince words in lambasting Lanier’s conduct. They even pulled out the word “pellucidly” for the occasion:

“The facts speak pellucidly: The pretrial donation check, Morrey Jr.’s expectation of compensation, and the post-trial payments to both doctors are individually troubling, collectively devastating,” the Fifth Circuit wrote. “Lanier’s failure to disclose the donation, and his repeated insistence that Morrey Sr. had absolutely no pecuniary interest in testifying, were unequivocally deceptive.”

For his part, Lanier described the ruling as “interesting” and said that “the court misunderstood the issues of monetary representations about the doctors” but generally accepted the smackdown and promised to press on in a new trial. Lanier, it seems, has good reason to feel confident that the next go-around will end more or less like the first.

Likely one with new, fully disclosed experts.

People may jokingly refer to Biglaw bills as highway robbery, but less common is the case of actual Biglaw robbery (or fraud, as the case may be). But that’s the story here.

Last week, former Baker Donelson partner Jon Seawright pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud investors for [his role in a timber Ponzi scheme](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/biglaw-partner-linked-to-100-million-ponzi-scheme/). He’s set to be sentenced on November 16, and faces up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of $250,000.

According to a Department of Justice[ press release](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdms/pr/jackson-attorney-pleads-guilty-conspiracy-defraud-investors) announcing the deal, over the course of seven years, Seawright and a partner secured millions of dollars of investments in timber intended for resale to a lumber mill. However, the lumber mill wasn’t real and the timber deeds were invalid:

Seawright admitted that between 2011 and 2018, he and a co-conspirator participated in a scheme to defraud investors by soliciting millions of dollars under false pretenses and failing to use investor funds as promised. Seawright and his co-conspirator represented to investors that they were in the business of loaning funds to a “timber broker” to buy timber rights from landowners and then to sell the timber rights to lumber mills at a higher price. Seawright and his co-conspirator promised investors a return of 10% or more over twelve or thirteen months on each unit of invested capital. Seawright and his co-conspirator represented to their investors, and led their investors to believe, that Seawright and his co-conspirator were inspecting each tract of land and were vetting each document, deed, and contract in support of their investments. These promises and representations were material in that they were intended to cause investors to believe that their investments were secured by valid assets and to believe that the financial incentives and interests of Seawright and his co-conspirator aligned with those of the investors. In fact, Seawright and his co-conspirator failed to inspect each property related to the timber rights underlying each investment, and they failed to verify each executed lumber mill agreement related to each investment. Seawright and his co-conspirator made few or no such inquiries, and if Seawright and his co-conspirator had made such inquiries, they would have discovered that the timber deeds, lumber mill agreements, and related documents were not valid.

Seawright and Brent Alexander, a former senior public policy advisor and a nonlawyer lobbyist at Baker Donelson, operated an investment company, Alexander Seawright LLC — which the firm stresses was separate from their work at the law firm. That company’s ties to Arthur Lamar Adams and his company Madison Timber Properties LLC formed the basis of the government’s investigation.

Alexander [faces charges](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdms/pr/two-jackson-men-charged-multi-million-dollar-fraud-scheme-conspiracy) of one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud; one count of securities fraud; and four counts of wire fraud involving a scheme to defraud investors. His trial is scheduled for August 15.

In 2018, Adams was [sentenced ](https://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/oct/30/lamar-adams-sentenced-20-years-probable-largest-po/)to 19 1/2 years in prison for spearheading the Ponzi scheme.

# Morning Docket: 07.18.16
## * Some Biglaw firms, like Orrick, are now going to help young associates by making monthly contributions to their student loan payments. At $100 a month for 18 months, it's not a very large contribution, but it's something. We'll have more on this debt repayment plan later.

Berwin Leighton Palmer -- a firm that [almost merged](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/law-firm-merger-mania-greenberg-traurig-flirts-with-a-british-suitor/) with Greenberg Traurig -- has frozen raises and bonuses until November, citing ""political and financial uncertainty in the UK."" [[Reuters](http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-lawyers-idUKKCN0ZV10A)] * As part of Thomas Jefferson School of Law's study-abroad program, Justice Clarence Thomas (who was filling in for the late Justice Antonin Scalia) was in Nice, France, last week teaching students about constitutional law. He left the city before the deadly terror attack during the Bastille Day parade. No law students were hurt. [[WSJ Law Blog](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/07/15/justice-thomas-left-nice-hours-before-terrorist-attack/?ref=/blogs/law)] * Prior to accepting his position as Donald Trump's running mate on the Republican ticket, and even prior to becoming the governor of Indiana, Mike Pence had a very short-lived career as a lawyer at a small firm.

* As part of Thomas Jefferson School of Law’s study-abroad program, Justice Clarence Thomas (who was filling in for the late Justice Antonin Scalia) was in Nice, France, last week teaching students about constitutional law.

As we approach the Memorial Day holiday, more and more of the most prestigious and profitable Biglaw firms have announced their plans for a return to the office. In fact, it was just yesterday that Latham — the No. 2 firm in the country, having taken home $4,333,763,000 gross revenue in 2020 — informed all personnel that with the end of the pandemic in sight, the firm will make a transition back to the office by mid-September. Sources we’ve heard from at the firm aren’t too happy about it, and that’s because Latham’s higher-level messaging seems to indicate that it will be back to business as usual, all from the office.

LeeAnn Black, Latham’s COO, described a “gradual transition” back to the office this summer (emphasis added; memo available in full on the next page):

All colleagues who are able to do so are encouraged to start spending time in the office this summer. Our in-office presence in many locations has been steadily increasing as more colleagues take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect in person, and we look forward to building on this momentum throughout the summer.

It is our general expectation that by mid-September, all Latham colleagues will live within commuting distance of their assigned office and will have re-established their regular routine of working from the office.

That sure sounds like lawyers and staff members will be expected to be back at their desks full-time, with little to no remote work flexibility (despite the fact that Latham claims flexibility will be preserved at the local level and that flexibility will underpin the firm’s approach to its reopening).

Here’s what one of our sources had to say about the firm’s plans:

I have to say, my heart sank when I saw the email. There is no mention of flexible schedules or partial work from home. This last year has been one of my most productive since joining the firm, but it has been bearable because I’ve been able to spend more time with my family and avoid having to commute. It’s as though the firm has learned nothing about the benefits of working from home and is pretending as though the last 15 months didn’t happen. I’d sooner find a new place to work than have to return to the office full-time, and I suspect some of my colleagues feel the same way.

A follow-up email (available in full on the next page) was later sent by partner Kathleen Walsh, on behalf of the Associates Committee, with a bit of softening language and an acknowledgement of the benefits of remote working — but it still reads like it’ll be a return to the pre-pandemic status quo at Latham & Watkins:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As we said last Summer, we would give you at least 45-days’ notice before asking you to return to the jurisdiction of your office; today’s message provides more than 90 days’ notice to return to your office jurisdiction by mid-September. …

We know that some may be wondering what office life will be like when we are back. Quite simply, it will be similar to the flexible nature of our work that we enjoyed before the pandemic. We have always sought to treat one another as professionals, and when we are back we expect that you will work with your practice groups, client teams, local departments, and individual supervisors to establish a work schedule that makes sense given the specific nature of your matters, client expectations, and career training and development. There are many opportunities to connect and collaborate that are more readily available in the office, in addition to the spontaneous occasions to interact and socialize with colleagues and clients. There is no one size fits all, but we have all learned a great deal about our ability to connect, work, and develop away from the office, and recognize that you can be extraordinarily productive while also enjoying a flexible approach to our in-office work culture. We intend to embrace the good things that have come from this extended period of remote working, including the ease with which remote working is now possible, but also look forward to a thriving office environment.

At least Latham employees have the entire summer to figure out how they’ll be able to adjust to the next normal that is in-office Biglaw life in the wake of a pandemic.

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Latham & Watkins.)

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

How much money does a firm, or, perhaps more accurately, its partners, have to make before it is considered “Biglaw”? That’s certainly an open question, and one the editors here at Above the Law argue about all the time, but it’s generally a pretty easy call that the firms on the Am Law 200 belong in Biglaw.

That’s why it is particularly shocking to note that with the most recently announced bonuses, senior associates at the elite firms (read: Cravath or matching that scale) make more than the average partner makes at 12 Am Law 200 firms. As [Law.com reports](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/11/21/partners-at-these-am-law-200-firms-make-less-than-cravath-associates/), senior associates at Cravath are pulling down $465,000. That’s more than the profits per partner at the following firms:

- Bond, Schoeneck & King;
- Dinsmore & Shohl;
- Eckert Seamans;
- GrayRobinson;
- Holland & Hart;
- Kutak Rock;
- Lane Powell;
- LeClairRyan;
- Littler Mendelson;
- Marshall, Dennehey, Warner, Coleman & Goggin;
- Shumaker, Loop & Kendrick;
- Wilson Elser Moskowitz Edelman & Dicker.

And as Brad Hildebrandt, CEO of Hildebrandt Consulting, notes, keeping the associate ranks — particularly at the senior level — happy is essential for top firms:

“For the top firms, they are all trying to recruit the same group of people,” Hildebrandt said, noting that 2018 is turning out to be a very good year for law firms in terms of revenue. But attrition rates are also high, with millennial lawyers tending to leave after three to four years in Big Law, he said.

“Many firms have a shortage of associates in the five- to eight-year range,” Hildebrandt said. “You add all of that together, it always translates into higher salaries, and now it’s translating into a bonus.”

Little keeps associates as happy as cold, hard cash.

As 2021 rolls to a close, it is nice to do some reflection on how the year — the second of the COVID pandemic — treated you. For Biglaw firms, the answer to how was 2021 seems to be an enthusiastic “awesome,” at least as it pertains to finances. Biglaw had a banger 2021 as far as money goes, and firms are sharing that good fortune with the associates who got them there.

West Coast mainstay Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati have announced their annual bonuses. The firm, which had $1,130,000,000 in gross revenue last year, making it 36th on the Am Law 100, will be matching the market rate for year-end and special bonuses popularized a few weeks ago. That is, if the associates bill enough.

Associates who hit the firm’s 1,950-hour billing requirement will be eligible for bonuses according to the following scale:

# Texas Litigation Boutique Lassos Big Raises For Associates
## Everything's bigger in Texas, including associate salaries!

Everything’s bigger in Texas, including associate salaries! It’s not just Biglaw firms that are saddling up and getting ready for the raise rodeo — boutique law firms are doing it too. This time around, Dallas-based civil litigation boutique Lynn Pinker Cox & Hurst has decided to ante up for its associates now that a new market salary has been set in the Lone Star State.

Those who work at Lynn Pinker are known for always playing to win, and there’s perhaps no better win than being a boutique firm that’s willing to pay associates a full Cravath match up and down the line, in the face of other Biglaw firms that are compressing salaries at the top of the scale. The small firm may only have 33 lawyers — 15 of whom are associates — but it’s clear that partners truly care about them.

For example, take this excerpt from the Lynn Pinker compensation memorandum:
