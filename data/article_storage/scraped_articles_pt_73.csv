# Another Biglaw Firm Gets In The Improved Parental Leave Game
## Good job, Kelley Drye!

If it [wasn’t clear already](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/parental-leave/), Biglaw firms should now know they need to offer some pretty good parental policies in order to stay competitive with their peer firms. We are seeing more and more firms offering their attorneys generous paid leave, and the programs are increasingly gender neutral and offered without a primary caregiver stipulation.

The latest firm increasing their parental leave is Kelley Drye & Warren. The firm has made their new policy, which was effective July 1, gender neutral and it features the ability for new parents to ease back into their work schedule for a two month “ramp up” period with no reduction in salary.

The details of the new policy from Kelley Drye’s announcement:

The policy, now gender neutral, allows for child care leave of up to 8 weeks; childbirth and recovery leave of up to 20 weeks; and a “ramp up” period of two months for any lawyer returning from parental leave, with no salary reduction. There is no requirement that a parent be the primary caregiver to take parental leave.

As the firm’s managing partner, [Lew Rose](https://www.kelleydrye.com/Our-People/Lewis-Rose), noted the new policy is designed to support the firm’s attorneys as they attempt to balance their career with parenthood:

“These changes to our parental leave policy were designed to show our commitment to our attorneys, in response to the commitment they show to this firm,” said Lew Rose, firm managing partner. “It is hard work to be a lawyer, but being a new parent is harder. Working parents should have the flexibility to balance both their families and their careers, and our hope is that this updated leave policy achieves that goal.”

Kudos to Kelley Drye on their new policy. Firms stepping up their family friend policies is something we’ll continue to pay attention to — particularly as we head into recruiting season.

# There Is No Such Thing As Work-Life Balance

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts on motherhood in the legal profession, in partnership with our friends at [MothersEsquire](https://www.mothersesquire.com/). Welcome Stephanie R. Holan to our pages. Click [here](https://www.mothersesquire.com/donate-1) if you’d like to donate to MothersEsquire.

I was sitting at the bar in the newly opened Restaurant Beatrice in Dallas. I am close friends with the manager and owner, and I had come to the restaurant to assist her in helping one of her staff-members with a small “situation.” As my friend got up to leave, she said, “I am so sorry I have to go. My wife is sick, and I need to be there. I’m trying to balance life and work, ya know?”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
I turned and said, “You do NOT owe me a sorry for leaving to care for your wife. That’s where you need to be. Go. Be There. Tell M I hope she feels better.  Oh…and there’s no such thing as work-life balance.” My friend stopped and looked at me as I continued, “It’s work-life management. This idea that there’s ‘balance’…it’s something that gets marketed to women to make us feel like there is supposed to be balance, we are supposed to be balanced, and we are a failure if we aren’t ‘balanced’ between work life and home life. But that’s the thing … balance means that you literally are not moving. That everything is static. That’s not good for anyone.”

She responded, “You know, that is so true. It really is management.” I told her that it’s this idea that we are all supposed to be Pinterest-perfect women, in all situations, at all times, that makes us crazy. Because when we don’t live up to this idea of balance, we feel like we failed. Especially as female attorneys.

I have been identified as “Type A+” by those who shall remain nameless and who (I promise) were not harmed during the writing of this article. And most of the female attorneys I know are as well. And when we feel like we are failing, we wilt.  We constantly feel like we are not doing enough with our family, that we spend so much time at work, we need to be more “present” and “enjoy this age” constantly.

When we do actually indulge ourselves by hiding in the pantry, eating mini-Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups for two minutes while some member of the family wants us to find something, we feel guilty. For needing some breathing space. For needing a moment where we are just caring for ourselves. And when we step out of the pantry? We feel guilty about the peanut butter cups and the fact that we were hiding. What kind of woman hides? From her spouse? From her kids?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

I think that somewhere along the way, someone who was probably the inventor of “mansplanations” figured out that if we marketed this idea that women are supposed to be perfect at home and work, always pleasant, always giving 110% at everything, without needing more than a Diet Coke, that women would self-regulate and try to do everything. All the time. How grand!

It starts even earlier for women than adulthood. In an intriguing [essay](https://www.123helpme.com/essay/Peer-Pressure-In-Queen-Bee-And-Her-757809) discussing Rosalind Wiseman’s book “Queen Bees and Wannabees,” it’s stated that, “The stereotype commonly associated with bullying is indefinitely the ‘Queen Bee.’ In playing this role, ‘Queen Bees’ gain a sense of power over the other girls within the clique. They enjoy the fact that the others feel as though they must pay homage to them. However, ‘Queen Bees’ lose a real sense of self, and become cynical of their position. Often, they wonder if people only speak to them as a result of their popularity or looks. The simple fact that they feel as though they must routinely exert their power over the others, proves that their actions are spurred from a place of loneliness. When they are able to control others, it proves to them that they are still better than everyone else. This pattern repeats, as they are constantly in need of reassurance, and surround themselves with people who will do so.”

Basically, we have been all conditioned to be “Queen Bees.” We chase “balance” and “perfection.” The biggest problem is that balance and perfection are ideals, and our entire existence becomes a pursuit of a concept that is not actually attainable. First, perfection is not the same for everyone, and balance means equilibrium. Balance is defined as, “the state of having your weight spread equally so that you do not fall.” Literally, balance means no movement. If we are balanced, then we are doing everything halfway. Deep down we sense it, too.

We are so terrified because we can never feel like we are balanced, we become stressed. We compare ourselves to what the other bees are doing.  They had a more-put-together birthday party for their kids, they managed to get their motion for summary judgment written AND were Snack Mom for the soccer team that week … the feeling “less than” is constant. We know we are not perfect.  Therefore, we are not balanced. We are not “good enough.”

I heard a former CEO of the Coca-Cola Corporation speak years ago, and he said that he told his employees, “In your life, there are glass balls, and there are rubber balls, and you are constantly juggling them. Rubber balls are things like work, money, friends, status … if we drop one, they will bounce back. But glass balls?  These are things like health, family, and time. If you drop a glass ball, all the juggling stops. Pay attention to what is rubber and what is glass.”

And this is what I want for us as attorneys, and really for everyone.  I want you to give yourself permission to manage your life. There are going to be times that your family member is suffering a Stage 3 cancer, and emails to people whose problems will still exist tomorrow are not a glass ball. There are other moments where a motion for summary judgement that is due by 10 a.m. the next day is going to override your child’s desire to have you watch them attempt a magic trick. But right then, that is a glass ball. Work is how you provide for your family. Please. Let’s all give ourselves enough grace to realize that we have to “manage” work and life. When we get past the idea that having work-life balance means all parts of our lives should be equal and realize that we get to manage the balance of our lives, we are going to get better at it.

We deserve more than balance. We deserve to be honest and respectful of ourselves. We deserve work-life management.

# I’m A Lawyer, You’re A Non-Lawyer. What’s Wrong With Saying That?

Two months ago, a relatively innocuous headline — [Husch Blackwell’s Next Leader Is a Newly Employed Non-Lawyer ](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202795834281)— lit a fire around the blogosphere. Seems that several legal professionals [took umbrage](http://www.legalwatercoolerblog.com/2017/08/23/husch-blackwells-incoming-ceo-professional-not-non-lawyer/) at [American Lawyer ](http://www.americanlawyer.com/)‘s description of Paul Eberle, the newly appointed Husch Blackwell CEO, as a non-lawyer rather than as an “experienced business executive.” Legal marketing professional Heather Morse contends that [the term non-lawyer is offensive ](http://www.legalwatercoolerblog.com/2017/08/27/the-use-of-non-lawyer-is-destructive-to-the-business-of-law/)and a disservice to all of the firms that are being run as businesses, while Am Law Daily’s Gina Passerella argues that use of the term non-lawyer reflects all that is rotten about [the law firm caste system](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202796509373/What-the-Reaction-to-the-Term-Nonlawyer-Says-About-Law-Firm-Caste-Systems).

Frankly, I don’t understand what’s wrong with describing someone who doesn’t hold a law degree or practice law as a non-lawyer in the context of a story about law firms. There are headlines aplenty about [non-techies](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/blake-mccammon/top-50-nontechnical-found_b_7018678.html) who start and run technology companies — but you don’t see them whining about how the press coverage emphasized their non-technical background rather than their entrepreneurial prowess. Same for [non-healthcare professionals ](http://www.kpcb.com/blog/how-are-non-healthcare-professionals-creating-a-revolution-in-healthcare-through-) disrupting the healthcare industry. The reason that the articles about non-techie CEOs at tech startups or non-healthcare founders at medical companies are noteworthy is because they run against type — as does a law firm’s choice of a business executive who isn’t a lawyer as CEO. In fact, if Eberle were a lawyer, who would even care about his elevation to law firm leader? Stories about this firm’s or that firm’s new managing partner are so common that they’re not particularly newsworthy, even in the insular world that is the legal trade press.

Moreover, while I don’t doubt that lawyers often treat marketing and business personnel dismissively, that same conduct occurs anytime one group of professionals butt heads with others in the organization. Consider the way that most GCs are treated within corporations — they’re often viewed as overly cautious and risk adverse pinheads who would rather quash a deal than figure out a way to make it work. Yet no one seems particularly upset about characterizing lawyers this way — even post-Enron where honestly, a little more pushback from inhouse lawyers might have avoided the demise of the company and the financial losses suffered by thousands of Enron shareholders. The point is that non-lawyer professionals are “the other” within the law firm organization and they can’t expect to be revered.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

But here’s the real reason why there’s nothing wrong with splitting the universe into lawyers and non-lawyers: because it’s the truth. I don’t have an MBA or a Ph.D. in economics and I’ll openly acknowledge that I lack the skills that these other business professionals bring to the table. If someone were to describe me as a non-MBA or a non-Ph.D., it wouldn’t hurt my feelings because it is what it is.

The distinction between lawyers and non-lawyers is even more important to call out — because at the end of the day, we lawyers have both skills and obligations that other non-lawyers lack. I spent three years and thousands of dollars on my legal education and sat for a three-day bar exam. Non-lawyers didn’t. I pulled all-nighters to avoid missing statutory deadlines and meekly nodded as I faced the wrath of an angry judge because to do otherwise might make matters worse for my clients. Non-lawyers didn’t. I carry not only business insurance but malpractice insurance as well so that if I make a mistake, my client can be made at least partially whole. Most legal marketers (at least those working as outside consultants to firms) won’t even provide a  refund if the services they provide are ineffective.

Finally, because I am a lawyer, whenever someone working with me — whether it’s a paralegal or a marketer or a business executive with 20 years of business experience — screws up by creating an ad that violates ethics regulations or engages the firm in a matter where there’s a conflict of interest, my law license and career are on the line, not theirs.

The bottom line is that when it comes to the practice of law, we lawyers have a lot more at stake than someone who is… well, a non-lawyer. That’s not an insult, it’s a reality. If legal professionals view the label “non-lawyer” as a sign of disrespect or don’t understand why they’re treated differently from lawyers, maybe they should be working in a different industry.

# Biglaw Partner Threatened With Sanctions Over Paternity Leave Request Takes Home A Win For His Kid

Earlier this week, we noted the trials and tribulations of Biglaw partner whose request for a paternity leave continuance was [denied three times](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/judge-threatens-biglaw-partner-with-sanctions-over-paternity-leave-request/) by a Florida judge, despite the fact that a newly adopted judicial rule required such leave to be granted.

Alexander Fumagali — a partner at Lewis Brisbois who’s looking forward to the birth of his first child — was threatened with sanctions should be file a fourth motion for paternity leave. In a comment given to the [Daily Business Review](https://www.law.com/dailybusinessreview/2022/09/06/baby-or-client-lawyer-claims-hell-be-denied-paternity-leave-as-judge-threatens-sanctions/), he noted:

“If this ruling stands, then other lawyers will have to choose between being present for the birth of their child or giving up their client,” Fumagali, 36, said. “I’m the lead counsel and the client hired me specifically. I love being a lawyer, but more importantly, I want to be a good father and husband. And I don’t know how this is going to affect those duties, which are most important.”

As it turns out, with all the negative publicity surrounding the case, the judge has had a change of heart, and Fumagali will no longer need to decide between his client and the birth of his child. The [Daily Business Review](https://www.law.com/dailybusinessreview/2022/09/07/when-a-judge-reconsiders-good-news-for-lawyer-seeking-paternity-leave/) has the details:

“This case came up for reconsideration and given the circumstances relating to defense counsel’s need for parental leave; it is ordered and adjudged that the case is hereby continued,” Miami-Dade Circuit Judge David C. Miller ruled.

The case will now move ahead to non-binding arbitration, and the parties will have an extended time period in which to do so.

Congratulations to Alex Fumagali on winning his motion for paternity leave, and for standing up for all lawyers who may find themselves in a similar situation by shining a light on the issues surrounding parental leave within the court system. We’d also like to offer him an even bigger congratulations on the upcoming birth of his first child. If you thought motion practice was complicated, you ain’t seen nothing yet!

# More Nixon Peabody Cost-Cutting Measures. This Time Associate Salaries Are On The Chopping Block.
## More cuts on the horizon for this Am Law 100 firm.

There are a lot of different austerity measures a Biglaw firm can undertake to maximize their cash flow during this economically uncertain time. And it seems like in dribs and drabs, Nixon Peabody has hit just about all of them.

As we’ve previously reported, the firm [laid off/furloughed approximately](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-announces-attorney-layoffs-and-furloughs/) 10 percent of non-partner attorneys and [did massive staff layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/massive-furloughs-hit-this-biglaw-firm/). Then they left law school students in their summer associate program [“shit out of luck” when they canceled the SA program without guaranteeing those students future employment offers](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/law-school-students-pissed-at-nixon-peabodys-handling-of-summer-associate-program/). Now we understand that attorney salaries are on the chopping block.

Multiple tipsters at Nixon Peabody report that, effective May 20th, associate salaries will be cut by 10 percent. Counsel at the firm will also see similar cuts. And the new class of incoming associates, originally slated to begin work at the firm in the fall, will have their start date pushed back until February 2021 (those folks are eligible to receive a $10,000 advance on their salary).

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The firm provided the following comment on the latest cuts:

We have deferred our 2020 fall class until we can better anticipate future client needs. Our deferred fall associates will receive a $10,000 salary advance.

Our firm entered 2020 in a strong financial position. By making some difficult decisions and taking action, we plan to come out of this pandemic just as strong. Every day, our attorneys are supporting individuals, businesses and communities, helping them navigate the many issues they are facing in these challenging times.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# The Biglaw Raises Continue, And This Time, They're Going Global

Back in 1999, one daring law firm laid the groundwork for associate salaries to soar. This firm made huge waves when it offered new associates a starting salary of $125,000 — significantly higher than the $100,000 that was standard at the time. The pay raise soon spread to firms across the country, and nothing has ever been the same since.

The firm we’re speaking about is Silicon Valley powerhouse Gunderson Dettmer, and on Friday night, [David T. Young](https://www.gunder.com/david-t-young/), managing partner of the Silicon Valley-based firm, notified associates that the firm would be matching new Davis Polk salary scale for associates. Here’s Gunderson’s spirit-lifting note:

[W]e thank you for your extraordinary efforts to provide clients with outstanding service and to help us build the preeminent firm in the markets in which we operate.

With other offices in Ann Arbor, Austin, Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, and San Diego, Gunderson is spreading wealth across the country for its associates. The firm is also adjusting salaries for those located in its Singapore office, so the wealth is going global. (The only people who are being left out are associates in the Beijing office. Maybe that could change? The last time the firm raised salaries in 2018, only U.S. associates got the nod.)

This is what the new $205K salary scale looks like at Gunderson:

- 2021: $202,500
- 2020: $205,000
- 2019: $215,000
- 2018: $240,000
- 2017: $275,000
- 2016: $305,000
- 2015: $330,000
- 2014: $350,000
- 2013: $365,000
- 2012: $375,000
Congratulations to all associates at Gunderson Dettmer!

# Biglaw Firm Wows With New Parental Leave Policy For All Employees
## Nice job!

2019 was the year that expanded [parental leave](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/parental-leave/) became [a real trend in Biglaw](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/munger-tolles-expands-gender-neutral-parental-leave/?rf=1). But just because the year is closing doesn’t mean parental leave is done having its moment in the sun. Just last week, another Biglaw firm announced an expanded policy — effective in 2020 — that’s applicable to all of its employees.

Biglaw firms should now know they need to offer some pretty good parental policies in order to stay competitive with their peer firms. We are seeing more and more firms offering their attorneys generous paid leave, and the programs are increasingly gender neutral and offered without a primary caregiver stipulation.

The latest firm to offer improved parental leave is Sheppard Mullin. As their announcement notes, the new policy is designed to take the needs of all employees into account:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
We are pleased to announce the Firm will be enhancing our parental baby bonding leave policy to support our SMRH employees (qualified attorneys and professional staff) as their families grow.  We recognize that every family is different.  We want our parental baby bonding leave policy to reflect the needs of each employee.

The highlights of the new policy include:

-
All new parents can take up to 12 weeks of paid parental baby bonding leave for the birth, adoption or foster care placement of a child.

-
Birth mothers will receive an additional 6-8 weeks paid disability leave for childbirth recovery depending on the period of actual disability.

-
Paid bonding leave must be initiated within the first six months of the birth, adoption or foster care placement and completed within the first year.

-
Ramp Time:  Attorneys and paraprofessional timekeepers planning for a parental leave that is eight continuous weeks or longer, will have a reduced hours expectation of 60% of his or her full time equivalent (FTE) during a ramp down and ramp up period of 6 weeks before and post leave.  This ramp up/ramp down will have no negative impact on a potential hours-based bonus.

The firm also circulated a list of best practices for taking leave to ensure that employees that take leave are put in the best possible position:

-
Communication is key!  Partners and supervisors are encouraged to speak to the attorney or professional about their expected departure and return date.

-
Those planning to go on leave should provide a status report and project list to their supervisors.

-
TM/HR will send regular notice of pending and current leave dates, and expected return dates to Practice Group Leaders, Office Managing Partners, Office Administrators and/or Chiefs.

-
As this is a leave of absence, no work should be given to the attorney/employee.  If there are extenuating circumstances, the supervisor should first speak with the PGLs or Chief to see if there is additional coverage, then with the CHRO, and finally with the attorney/employee.

Folks at the firm seem very pleased with the change. From a tipster:

Sheppard Mullin continues to make itself a premier place to be an associate. It’s amazing how much effort they put into listening to associates and actually implementing feedback.

Kudos to the firm!

# Will Biglaw Silos Become A Thing Of The Past? 
## The case for collaboration.

While niches may lead to riches, a changing legal marketplace is also placing a premium on collaborative teams. 

That’s because legal and business problems are increasingly complex — and multidisciplinary groups can generate superior business outcomes, according to [Heidi Gardner](https://hls.harvard.edu/heidi-k-gardner/), a distinguished fellow at Harvard Law School and author of “[Smarter Collaboration](https://bookshop.org/a/81011/9781647822743)” (affiliate link).

In a recent panel at the Legal Marketing Association’s Northeast Regional Conference in New York, Gardner focused on how lawyer collaboration can supercharge firm profitability, solidify client relationships, and even ease technology adoption. 

“Smarter collaboration: It’s a business imperative,” she said. “It’s absolutely essential that we understand what this is and what it isn’t.” 

Here are some takeaways from the discussion, hosted by [Deborah Farone of Farone Advisers LLC](https://deborahfarone.com/).

An Apt Acronym

There’s at least one term from the business management world that equally applies to legal practice: VUCA, or “volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity.” 

The “C” for complexity is the foremost VUCA item for legal marketers to remember, according to Gardner.

With VUCA on the rise, today’s problems aren’t like a jigsaw puzzle that snaps together, she said, but more like the moving staircases in the “Harry Potter” movies, in which interconnected parts shift the direction entirely. 

This creates a necessity for collaboration across practice groups and underscores the benefits of diverse viewpoints. 

“Our problems are highly complex in ways that, if you only focus on whatever you can see through the lenses that you wear, there’s a good chance you’re going to be missing all of the sort of second- and third-order effects of those choices you’re making,” she said.

1+1 = … >2

While the quirks of the law firm structure can present big challenges to cross-practice collaboration, such efforts can also bring a major payoff.

Gardner presented data detailing a law firm’s revenue for clients served by one practice group versus clients served by multiple practice groups. (The data was “disguised” to fully anonymize the firm, but “the numbers are very representative of reality,” she said.) 

The data shows that when a firm has two practice groups serving a client, they generate on average three times more revenue than each practice group would’ve generated on its own.

“And it keeps growing that way,” Gardner said. “One plus one plus one equals five or more.” 

She described one firm that had a client served by five practice groups with a revenue multiple of 26.

“That’s massive upside,” she said.  

Multiplying Value

Of course, clients wouldn’t be paying these bigger bills if they didn’t perceive increased value from the services they’re receiving. 

For Gardner, cross-functional teams excel in this area as well. 

She gave the example of a client looking for a top labor and employment lawyer — which could be found in just about any large firm.

But if that lawyer were working with a team of antitrust, tax, and real estate practitioners who all know the client’s industry and the general counsel’s goals, the team can become integral to the client and difficult for competitors to dislodge. 

“So it’s not just that in any given year they generate more revenue and profitability,” she said. “It’s that over time there are significantly more valuable relationships.”

Talk to the Risk

Whether you’re fostering cross-practice collaboration, leading a project to upgrade your CRM, or answering a major RFP, you’ll inevitably face the challenge of persuading stakeholders to act.

Gardner suggests a focus on risk tolerance as a way to frame your message, sharing a personality spectrum ranging from “risk spotters” to “risk seekers.”

If you were persuading a “risk spotter” to adopt a new technology, Gardner said, you’d want to focus on how thoroughly all of the bases will be covered. For a “risk seeker,” by contrast, you’d want to focus on all of the features they could miss out on if they pass up the product. 

The same goes for clients — even if they haven’t answered a personality questionnaire, you can gauge their risk tolerance by, for example, the questions they’d typically ask. 

Gardner described one top rainmaker who will respond to an RFP by calling the general counsel and asking which aspects of it are most important to them. 

The GC will usually respond at length to such a request, excited to explain the thinking behind the RFP. This will allow the firm to tailor a pitch exactly to the potential client’s thinking. 

“We know that it is a rare instance when partners are taking that very client-specific, client-centric mindset to the smallest things like how they present the data,” she said. 

“But getting your partners to think along those lines and equipping them to have that tailored mindset can really help people stand apart.”

# Summer Associate Events Law Firms Should Host

Ah, to be young again. To be … a summer associate.

Last week, I posted an article about some kinds of summer associate events law firms should generally avoid to minimize pressure and awkwardness around summer associate season. I received a number of emails describing summer associate fails that readers experienced in their own careers and additional types of events that law firms should generally avoid during summer associate season. One person reached out and asked if I thought any types of summer associate events were positive and which should be hosted by law firms. Of course, shops can host numerous types of events to evaluate the group they hired to be summer associates and determine if they are a good fit at a firm.

Long Lunches

Perhaps the easiest and most common summer associate events are long lunches. At many firms, associates are permitted to take summer associates to lunch and expense the meal to the firm. This was a great part of my summer associate experience. All types of associates from around the office wanted to get to know me and suggested heading to lunch with a group so that everyone could bond and score free food on the firm’s dime. I believe there were limits to the amount of the reimbursement, but so long as this is not abused, this can be a great way to connect with summer associates.

At other points in my summer associate experience, the firm organized lunches more formally at various venues in my area such as the 21 Club, the Newark Club, and some other places I can’t remember off the top of my head. This was nice too since it ensured that everyone would have the long lunch experience even if they were too busy to organize informal lunches or had already gone to lunch with a number of associates. Long lunches take place during business hours, and do not impede on the personal time of summer associates and attorneys, so this should be on every firm’s list of events to host.

Scavenger Hunts

The law firm I worked at did not host a scavenger hunt, and I never really went on a proper scavenger hunt in my life (except maybe when I was initiated into the Brandeis Track Team, but I digress!). However, some colleagues of mine have related that they needed to complete scavenger hunts around the city in which their office was located as part of their summer associate experience. This generally involved taking pictures at local landmarks, ordering food from certain establishments, and the like. Of course, such an activity is completely unrelated to practicing law, and does not explicitly demonstrate skills that will be useful as a full-time associate.

However, such events are great team-building activities that can connect summer associates with common memories that they will share as they progress through their careers. Moreover, such scavenger hunts can give supervisors valuable feedback about who is a leader among a group of summer associates and who is able to think critically on their feet in certain situations. Of course, scavenger hunts can be hard to prepare, and they may require creativity on behalf of supervisors, but such events can be a good way to have fun and make memories as a summer associate.

Interoffice Mixers

Attorneys often do not have the time to attend social events with attorneys who work at different offices, even if the offices are located a relatively short distance from each other. This is likely because attorneys are busy and need to work on billing hours rather than meeting colleagues who work at different offices. However, summer associates often have ample free time to meet attorneys and staff who work at different offices, and summer associate events can be the perfect occasion for an interoffice mixer.

When I was a summer associate at a Biglaw law firm’s office in Newark, New Jersey, summers spent a week at the firm’s New York office. This was because the firm’s New York office did not at the time have an independent summer program, and the firm wanted us to meet and work for some of the attorneys who worked in the New York office. The New York office hosted a bunch of mixers so that we could get to know the attorneys who worked at that office, and this was a great way to meet attorneys and staff who did not work at our home office, but whom we might work with on projects someday. More law firms should seize the opportunity created by summer programs to have interoffice mixers since meeting people at different offices can help attorneys and staff work together on projects.

All told, the summer associate experience might be the best time someone has in the legal industry. Law firms can host a number of events in order to ensure that summer associates have a fun and enriching time while summering at law firms.

# The 2021 Outside Counsel Rankings: The Top Law Firms According To GCs

[](https://abovethelaw.com/top-outside-counsel-2021/)In the current market, GCs confront both a surging need for legal services and an ever-increasing pressure to control budgets. Against this challenging backdrop, earlier this year we asked nearly 1,000 in-house counsel which firms provide the best return on their legal spend investments.

The premise of our fourth annual outside counsel rankings is simple and direct. We asked in-house counsel two simple questions: 1) “Which law firms does your company engage for legal services?” and 2) “Please indicate the highest level legal work for which your company will engage the particular firm(s).” The “levels” of work were defined along a four-point scale:

1. Cost-efficient, bulk tasks
2. Routine matters
3. High-value, complex matters
4. “Bet-the-company” matters

In-house lawyers — from nearly 440 companies and over 40 cities — shared with us their evaluations of their companies’ outside law firms. Check out the results here.

# Was The Dewey Trial Fair?
## 'These long trials are just not fair.'

Steven Davis, Joel Sanders, and Stephen DiCarmine

Dewey & LeBoeuf was once a thriving, prestigious law firm with 26 offices, over a thousand lawyers, and a diverse set of clients. But that is very much in the past. When the firm filed for bankruptcy in 2012, all those lawyers, and the staff that supported them, had to find new jobs, and four members of the firm’s management were charged with crimes for their role in the firm’s downfall.

Of course, there were lots of legal wrangling to be done before a jury would convict anyone of anything related to Dewey & LeBoeuf. The client relations manager, Zachary Warren, who got caught up in this mess had the [charges against him dropped](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/dewey-know-whos-not-going-to-trial-defendant-no-4-zachary-warren/) in exchange for community service. He’s now an [associate at Williams & Connolly](https://www.wc.com/Profiles/Zachary-K-Warren) (though why he decided to return to the world of Biglaw is beyond me). And there was that [pesky hung jury](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/10/partial-verdict-announced-in-dewey-leboeuf-criminal-trial/?rf=1) — in 2015 a jury was unable to reach a verdict for the most serious changes against Joel Sanders, former CFO, Stephen DiCarmine, former Executive Director, and Steven Davis, former Chairman, and returned not guilty verdicts for the most serious charges against them while returning not guilty verdict on multiple counts of falsifying business records.

But Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance was [not deterred](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/yes-prosecutors-are-still-trying-to-hold-someone-accountable-for-dewey-leboeufs-failure/?rf=1).

For the second trial, the list of defendants and charges were winnowed down. Davis received a deferred prosecution agreement, and for Sanders and DiCarmine, there were only three charges a piece (the first trial featured ~50 charges for each of the three defendants). The retrial was (partially) successful for the DA’s office: [earlier this week](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/holy-crap-dewey-know-who-was-convicted-of-felony-charges/?rf=1), Sanders was found guilty of two felony fraud charges and a misdemeanor count of conspiracy, while DiCarmine was acquitted of all charges.

But nearly five full years since Dewey went into bankruptcy, and folks in the legal community are asking if the time and effort to get the guilty verdict against Sanders was really worth it. Law.com spoke with a while-collar Biglaw partner to get his take:

“I think Cy and his office had a good faith belief that something bad happened here and they needed to bring these criminal charges. They did, and they were dogged in pursuing them,” said Charles Stillman of Ballard Spahr.

But even if the prosecution wasn’t misguided, Stillman added, the procedural background—two lengthy trials, a hung jury and dropped charges—supports the view that the case was too broad. He also said a case of this magnitude puts a strain on everyone involved.

“What the history of the case reveals is that they should have narrowed it before it got started,” said Stillman. “These long trials are just not fair; they’re just not fair to the defendant; they’re not fair to the jury; they’re not fair to the system. You need to find a way to circumscribe the evidence.”

Of course reasonable people’s opinions can differ, and the DA is playing up the import of going after financial crimes, even though they can prove challenging to prosecute:

“Joel Sanders used his position as chief financial officer to mask the failing financial health of Dewey & LeBoeuf, leading insurers and lenders to believe the firm was still above water,” Vance said in a statement. “This office is committed to prosecuting financial criminals at all levels of an organization, whether it is a small business, a major corporation, or a prestigious law firm.”

While the defense side of the table sees the proliferation of charges as evidence something is really wrong:

Not surprisingly Rita Glavin, a partner at Seward & Kissel who led DiCarmine’s defense in the retrial, had a similar take.

“I just think this case from the beginning was flawed. I don’t think there should have been a case—not a criminal case—here,” she said. “They certainly bit off more than they could chew. It makes it much harder to defend, because it was almost schizophrenic.”

But no sentence can undo the professional, financial, and psychological harm that was done to all those who lost their livelihoods when Dewey went under.

# Which Am Law 200 Firms Promoted The Most Attorneys?
## Each firm has a unique partner track and promotions mean different things at different places.

Michael Allen

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://bit.ly/2KxFPa6) team of expert contributors. [Michael Allen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelallen/) is the CEO of Lateral Link. He is based in the Los Angeles office and focuses exclusively on Partner and General Counsel placements for top firms and companies. Prior to founding Lateral Link in 2006, he worked as an attorney at both Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and Irell & Manella LLP. Michael graduated summa cum laude from the University of California, San Diego before earning his JD, cum laude, from Harvard Law School.

Attorneys typically appreciate receiving promotions in title and pay.

For starters, an attorney who receives the “partner” title can more credibly pitch for business from her rolodex (and the firm is probably more likely to offer her credit, which means more compensation).  Next, usually promotions come with a bump in compensation.  Lastly, we all like recognition.  Most employees prefer the positive recognition perceived from the promotion over the increase in compensation received.

On the other hand, we sometimes hear from our candidates that they are underwhelmed with their promotion.  Maybe they don’t receive the compensation they think they deserve or it comes along with a nice “capital contribution” requirement.  Good news, you are now partner; bad news, you owe us $330,000 (but we will introduce you to our bankers to pay upfront).

All in all, most promotions are positive.

So, which Am Law 200 law firms promoted the most attorneys over the prior 12-month period?

Courtesy of Leopard Solutions, here are the Top 30 Am Law 200 Firms in terms of volume (not weighted by size) that promoted their associates/counsel to “C”ounsel or “P”artner:

Firm	PROMO-C	PROMO-P	Total	Leverage
Kirkland & Ellis LLP	0	80	80	1:1.43
Gordon Rees Scully Mansukhani LLP	36	30	66	1:1.53
Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, LLP	44	14	58	1:2.05
Greenberg Traurig LLP	14	38	52	1:0.94
WilmerHale	41	7	48	1:2.60
Perkins Coie	29	18	47	1:1.20
Reed Smith LLP	23	18	41	1:1.54
Latham & Watkins LLP	8	32	40	1:2.69
O Melveny & Myers LLP	34	6	40	1:2.53
Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith LLP	0	39	39	1:0.84
Jones Day	6	32	38	1:1.81
Littler Mendelson PC	9	28	37	1:1.20
Ropes & Gray LLP	26	9	35	1:3.62
Holland & Knight LLP	5	29	34	1:0.78
Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP	5	29	34	1:1.60
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP	23	11	34	1:4.21
Akerman LLP	3	30	33	1:0.68
Wilson, Elser, Moskowitz, Edelman & Dicker	12	18	30	1:1.79
Cooley LLP	10	18	28	1:2.17
Crowell & Moring LLP	21	7	28	1:1.69
McGuireWoods LLP	8	20	28	1:1.43
King & Spalding LLP	11	16	27	1:1.47
Venable LLP	8	18	26	1:1.30
Dentons	9	16	25	1:1.13
Mayer Brown LLP	9	16	25	1:1.67
Polsinelli PC	2	23	25	1:0.66
Seyfarth Shaw LLP	14	11	25	1:1.40
White & Case	7	18	25	1:2.30
Alston & Bird LLP	4	20	24	1:1.37
Locke Lord LLP	12	12	24	1:1.11
Like with all firms, promotions mean different things.  For example, K&E has NSP (“non-share partners”) and equity partners.  Out of the 80 “Partners” promoted, the majority of them graduated in the class of 2011.  The same can be said with O’Melveny, as the majority of their “Counsel” promotions also graduated in the class of 2011.  That said, each firm has a unique partner track and promotions mean different things at different places.

If you’d like to learn more about promotion trends and what they mean at your firm (or other firms), please don’t hesitate to call my colleagues at Lateral Link to fill you in on the details.

# Employers: Please Train Your Managers On Parental Leave-Related Behavior
## Why? Because your employees deserve to be treated with respect when they do the very human thing of having a child.

If January is any indication, 2023 is going to be an important year for turning up the volume on the struggles new parents face in the workplace. As a lawyer and working parent, I first tuned into the story that went viral in the legal press beginning around January 10, about a grossly inappropriate text message a law firm attorney sent to a former associate who left after her maternity leave. Then, on January 22, I spotted the Washington Post piece entitled “WNBA player Dearica Hamby says Aces ‘bullied’ her over pregnancy.” The legal and athletic professions may be worlds apart, but these stories share a common theme.

In the case involving legal professionals, an employment lawyer named Joe Dileno, who was then a senior attorney at Zashin & Rich, a Cleveland-based law firm, sent a text message to a former colleague who had left the firm after returning from maternity leave. In his message, Dileno called this associate “soul-less and morally bankrupt” for leaving the firm. “What you did – collecting salary from the firm while sitting on your a–, except to find time to interview for another job – says everything one needs to know about your character. Karma’s a b—h.”  Though the firm ultimately parted ways with Dileno, it first issued a defensive-sounding statement calling his text a “heat-of-the-moment” response and noting that the associate had taken a new job “within days of her return to work.”

Fast-forward not even two weeks, and we hear from former Las Vegas Aces WNBA star Dearica Hamby that she was bullied by the management of her former team when she became pregnant with her second child. Hamby says that she was both asked about whether her pregnancy was planned, and then chided for “not taking precautions to not get pregnant.” She has since been traded to the Los Angeles Sparks and wrote that “Being traded is part of the business. Being lied to, bullied, manipulated, and discriminated against is not.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The problem in both of these cases isn’t one of policies. Both the WNBA and Zashin & Rich had maternity leave policies in place. One key issue here is what the parental leave community refers to as “winning the manager lottery.” According to Benefit Bump’s Mom Survey, more than a third of new parents who leave their jobs do so because of “poor manager support.”

Employers, please pause and ask yourselves this question: do you build any training around managing parental leaves into your education for the managers, partners, counsel, etc. at your organization? If not, prioritize this issue now. Don’t do it because legal risk and employee retention are on the line. Do it because your employees deserve to be treated with respect when they do the very human thing of having a child.

When you formally educate your managers, teach them about your organization’s parental leave-related policies and benefits, the laws that apply, and who they can turn to for support in managing a parental leave on their team. Don’t stop there, though. Educate them about the well-documented maternal biases (see Brigid Schulte’s work) and fatherhood forfeits (see Jasmine Kelland’s research) that lead so many of us to make inaccurate assumptions about caregivers. Teach them about Yale neuroscientist Dr. Ruth Feldman’s findings, too, that show the remarkable neuroplasticity for adults in the year following the birth of a child, and Amy Henderson’s work on the career-critical skills that parenthood promotes.  Give them facts about the supply-and-demand nature of breastfeeding, and show them how to protect employee rights under the new PUMP Act.

Above all, emphasize that parental leave is a normal part of a career, and that inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated. Research shows that “in companies where the managers recognized parental leave as no more than a brief interlude in a person’s long-term career … [and where there was a] supportive company culture, [employees] reported a renewed energy and focus for their work, a feeling of being valued, and an enhancement of professional relationships.” (See research by David Collings, Yseult Freeney, and Lisa van der Werff.)

As an employer, you may hope this “old school thinking” dwindles as the “bad actors” retire. But simply crossing your fingers and hoping that nothing goes wrong in the meantime is not a successful strategy. When the same bullying and undermining of new parents exists in professions as different as law and professional sports, it’s a red flag that there are systemic biases at work, not just a few bad apples in your midst.

Biglaw firm Goodwin Procter has been through the wringer recently. After growing its revenue by about 30% amid a hiring frenzy in 2021, its profitability took a plunge in the tail end of 2022 thanks to the tech sector’s implosion. The work slowdown in M&A spelled trouble, and the firm conducted a round of layoffs at the start of the new year. Now, the man who oversaw it all plans to step down from his position.

[Robert Insolia](https://www.goodwinlaw.com/en/people/i/insolia-robert), who has served as chair of Goodwin Procter since 2019 (and as managing partner for seven years before that), is leaving his leadership role. The firm has selected [Anthony McCusker](https://www.goodwinlaw.com/en/people/m/mccusker-anthony), co-chair of Goodwin’s technology practice, to step into Insolia’s shoes.

“Goodwin’s success has been driven by relentlessly focusing on our strategy and our culture, and the partnership overwhelmingly feels Anthony is the right person to carry this torch forward,” Insolia said of his successor in a [statement](https://www.goodwinlaw.com/en/news-and-events/news/2023/04/04_05-goodwin-elects-anthony-mccusker-as-next-firm-chair),

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As noted by the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/04/05/goodwin-chair-robert-insolia-stepping-down/), McCusker spent more than 13 years at Gunderson before he joined Goodwin in 2010. He’s served as a leader throughout his time at the firm, having spent time as chairman of the firm’s Silicon Valley office, as well as serving on both the firm’s executive and allocations committees. McCusker offered praise for his predecessor, as well as some hopes for the future in a statement.

“Our client-centric strategy and our global platform are differentiated as much by the unique mix of market-moving industries they cover, as by our deep understanding of these industries, and the growing convergence among them. Rob has done an outstanding job building on the Goodwin promise to both our clients and our people, and I look forward to continuing with this build—along with all of us at the firm—in my role as chair.”

Best of luck to McCusker in his new role, and congratulations to Insolia on leading the firm through great successes over the years while offering a steady hand during rough times.

# Firm Raises First Year Salaries To Match Market But Midlevels And Seniors Aren't Feeling The Love
## Why do firms keep doing this?

A well-worn law firm compensation trick is to make a big announcement that the firm will be matching the prevailing market salary for first-year associates and then conveniently keep mum about what’s happening to all the other attorneys. The “$190K” sticker price is a boon for law school recruiting, and many don’t bother to ask if the firm keeps pace with its peers beyond that.

Kilpatrick Townsend’s new compensation memo appears to be following this route.

Effective January 1, 2019, our starting salary for first-year associates in California, Colorado, New York and Washington, D.C. will increase to $190,000. Our starting salary for first-year associates in Atlanta and North Carolina will increase to $165,000. Our starting salary for first-year associates on our IP teams in Seattle will increase to $190,000. Our starting salaries in our other offices and practice areas will increase $10,000. Associates throughout the firm will receive salary adjustments depending on the location, practice area, experience level and performance of the associate. Eligible associates will receive salary adjustments effective January 2019.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
It’s that vagueness about compensation for associates throughout the firm that has seniors worried. Long-time readers may remember that this is [exactly what they did in 2016](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/180000-for-first-years-for-everyone-else/), moving to $180K in key markets and leaving seniors in the dark. At least this time the Seattle IP associates got the full bump — last time they stayed $20K below market.

More senior associates aren’t pleased:

They’re basically using the mid level and senior associates to fund the first year associate raises. First years are almost never profitable at our firm, so this is just a big slap in the face. I have already spoken to three associates at the firm (and the memo only went out 90 minutes ago) who are immediately going to start looking for new jobs.

The tragedy of the midlevel. First-years are almost always useless, which is not a knock but a fact of an academic model that largely pushes off real practical instruction on the firms. But at least some firms recognize this by showing those senior attorneys some love.

And they’re upping their billable hour requirement, so there’s that.

In a sense, law firms are experiencing an “NBA Draft problem.” Several years ago, NBA teams found themselves breaking the bank on rookie contracts for unproven high school prospects that never panned out. So they all agreed to force kids into “gussied up servitude” by making them spend a year in college before they could be drafted. The point is, law firms are so smitten with building their ranks on potential that they feel they have to pay top dollar for raw talent. And that’s all well and good as long as you don’t skimp on the veterans who get the job done day in and day out.

Because when you build your firm entirely on potential, you can come to work one day and find that hotshot first-year is just a bust.

(Full memo, next page, you know the drill.)

# Biglaw's Summer Associate Recruitment Cycle Has Taken A Dip Amid Layoffs And Fears Of A Recession

‘Congratulations on your offer!’ (Image via Getty)

For the past few years, law student recruitment for summer associate programs has been incredibly successful, harkening back to a time when law students quickly accepted the offers that Biglaw firms handed out like candy. The 2022 recruitment cycle, however, was a little different. Yes, recruiting activity was as robust as it’s been, with “precruiting” (pre-OCI offers) becoming more prevalent than ever before, but the overall number of offers made dropped, hinting at the fact that Biglaw firm leaders had recessionary worries on their minds, long before the recent wave of layoffs even started.

As we mentioned previously, according to the latest recruiting figures from the National Association for Law Placement (NALP), offer rates for Biglaw summer programs [decreased by about 2%](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/biglaw-firms-made-fewer-summer-associate-offers-this-fall/) compared to the last summer’s hiring program. This could be bad news, given that the law school Class of 2024 is nearly 12% larger than the Class of 2023. Nikia L. Gray, NALP’s executive director, explained what this could mean for future employment trends:

“What is clear is that the entry-level job market in the private sector is currently not growing fast enough to absorb the additional students in the Class of 2024 and that unless there is a strong 3L hiring market this year—which seems unlikely given recent trends—a greater percentage of these students may need to look at other market segments for employment after graduation.”

There were many ups and downs when it came to this past fall’s law student recruitment. More than 81% of law firm offices visited the same number of schools as they did in 2021, with over 69% reporting that they conducted about the same number of interviews or more. As a result, a little more than half of callbacks (52%) resulted in offers for 2023’s summer associate program — which represented a decline of 6 percentage points from fall 2021. Per NALP’s latest figures, 44% of law offices made fewer offers (but at the same time, 46% of law offices made more offers).

Last year, James Leipold, NALP’s prior executive director, warned that the “hot talent market [would] inevitably cool, one way or another,” and it appears that that time has come. Gray, his successor, is now sounding cautionary notes about entry-level recruitment in light of market conditions, saying, “[A]s an increasing number of reports issued these past few weeks have announced falling partner profits, softening hours, and excess capacity at law firms mingled with projections of record rate increases and bullish growth for 2023, the only solid prediction one can make about the upcoming recruiting cycle is that it won’t be dull.”

Here are some interesting facts about summer recruitment in 2022:

- We may be “post”-pandemic, but the majority of interviews still took place virtually during the fall 2022 recruiting cycle: 93% of screening interviews and 77% of callback interviews were conducted virtually.
- Early offers (“precruiting”) accounted for 23% of all offers made by law firms, the highest number measured since NALP started to track pre-OCI offers. This is an increase of 11 percentage points from fall 2021, with slightly more than one-third (34%) of offices making early offers.
- The median number of offers extended by law offices to second-year students for summer 2023 programs was 9 offers, down from a median of 10 offers for last summer.
Enough of the doom and gloom, let’s talk about what happened with 2022’s summer associates. According to NALP, offer rates for Biglaw summer programs remained close to historic highs, with 97% of second-year law students receiving offers for full-time employment as associates after graduation. Acceptances of those offers matched last year’s all-time high of 89%. That’s all great news, but we can’t help but to wonder if these incoming associates aren’t a little bit worried about their futures with their firms given the cost-cutting measures (including layoffs) that many firms have made in recent weeks and months.

Nevertheless, congratulations to all law students who went through the entry-level recruitment cycle in 2022. We hope that things continue to work out as planned, without any recessionary interferences.

# 'Legal Tech Lists': 3 Things Your CRM Should Do For You
## How you can go beyond merely storing information.

Editor’s note: This is an installment in the “Reference Manual of Legal Tech Lists,” an eBook set for release this spring. [Read the prior installments here](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/wolters-kluwer-lists/), and feel free to pre-register for your copy of the complete eBook using the form below.

Customer relationship management — or CRM — can be the bane of lawyers’ (or legal marketers’) existence. 

Why? Because if you’re like most lawyers, your CRM is an underutilized database that’s not performing anywhere near its potential. 

Here are a few things you’ll want your CRM to do — besides simply holding information — if you want it to truly benefit your business.

1. Show the relationship with each person. 

Are they a client, referral source, or prospect? Are they a vendor, competitor, or family? Are they a vendor and a client, or a competitor who refers conflicted cases to you? Are they a family member and a client  — who you don’t charge because they wouldn’t pay the bill anyway? 

Why is this important? 

If you want to host a client event, send a gift to your referral sources, or share updated billing info with your vendors, sorting this info in your CRM should be a breeze.

2. Show the relationship between clients and referral sources. 

How many clients did Marty Byrde, the financial planner, send your way? When was the last referral made, and what is the value of those referrals? Does Marty have experience with casinos? 

This is key info for many reasons. 

If Marty is the only financial planner you know who has experience with casinos, then any clients in the gaming niche should meet Marty. 

If you decide to expand your business law practice to include casino property and operations, teaming up with Marty for a CLE or webinar may be a good idea.

3. Remind you of the info you need but don’t have the brain power to remember. 

Does Marty have two kids or three? Is he still with Wendy, or did they get divorced? What was the name of his former business partner?

There’s no way you can remember all of this information about each of your clients. 

Before you meet with him next week, or if you know you’re sitting with him at the Chamber of Commerce dinner, refer to your CRM, so it’s fresh in your mind. 

The good news is that most CRMs are mobile-friendly, so if you run into an important business contact, excuse yourself and take a minute to review your notes. 

Reminder: Update your notes when you learn new info, because Marty is a busy guy with a lot going on.

If your CRM is accomplishing the above for you — kudos! Go home, you’re done for the day! 

If it’s nowhere close to this, it’s no biggie. Start today. 

Fill out the form below to pre-register for your copy of the complete “Reference Manual of Legal Tech Lists,” which will be sent to all registrants later this year! And as a bonus, registrants will receive a copy of the “[Legal Tech-to-English Dictionary](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/introducing-the-complete-legal-tech-to-english-dictionary/)” from Above the Law and Wolters Kluwer — another piece of our growing legal tech reference library.

# Is Returning To The Office Inevitable?
## There is no one-size-fits-all solution since everyone is different. Some people actually don’t want to work from home.

As businesses are starting to reopen, they are making plans to return to the way things were, which includes getting their staff back into the office. The problem is that some of them don’t want to come back. So what can businesses do?

As this was the first time that people worked from home en masse, there was a lot of talk about the benefits. It meant less commuting time for everyone. Staff members can customize their home-office to maximize their productivity so they can spend more time with family or do other things. For businesses, it can result in lower overhead costs since a large office may no longer be needed.

And some people are genuinely concerned about getting sick, especially in light of the new delta variant of COVID-19 that is expected to be the next health concern.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
It seems like many of the large law firms are trying to slowly wean employees back into the office by setting certain attendance goals and deadlines. This seems fair as it gives staff time to make adjustments. But some see this as a dealbreaker and are considering going to another firm that has more generous remote-work policies.

Smaller firms are more likely to have more generous remote-work policies. This is because the members and staff are generally close-knit. They tend to trust each other more and are more willing to overlook or tolerate any disagreements or mishaps. And some firms may not be able to afford an office with enough space. This does not mean a new hire will automatically be able to work from home whenever they want. They will probably need to prove themselves and earn a level of trust first.

But a larger firm with more people will likely have issues. Some employees (including senior management) will not be as productive at home for various reasons. Businesses may find it more efficient to have everyone in a central area. Or they may think in-person interactions are more productive than virtual ones. Lastly, working in an office is mandatory in certain situations as very sensitive information and documents should not leave the office under any circumstances. Like a certain person’s tax returns.

Some firms might let some people work from home while others must stay at the office. But how will this be determined? By seniority? Will it only be available for people with children or sick dependents? Or will it be a reward for those who are deemed trustworthy by the firm? This might raise questions of fairness or inequity, and, if it gets bad enough, the firm might just cut the program altogether.

There is no one-size-fits-all solution since everyone is different. Some people actually don’t want to work from home. They acknowledge that they are more distracted there and prefer to keep their home- and work-life separate. Because everyone is different, one firm should not follow what a peer firm does, even if it works for them. For a remote-work policy to function with optimal productivity, each firm will have to create its own customized policy based on existing employees’ needs and wants.

One thing is for certain though: the firm leadership will have to set the example on how they want everyone to return to the office. They will have to come into the office and spend the time they want their employees to emulate. They are not allowed to get out of “face time” duty by scheduling speaking events or business development lunches at a country club. Otherwise, the leadership will look hypocritical and morale will take a hit.

In the final analysis, it’s possible for people to work remotely indefinitely. But it will take great managerial skill to implement a remote-work policy that will make everyone happy and maintain a law firm’s integrity and security. Otherwise, returning to the office will be inevitable.

# Everything You Need To Know About Fall Recruiting Season (Part I)
## The first step a student should take to increase their chances of landing a summer offer is to research the employers.

Well, the calendar has turned to July, which would be difficult to believe if it were not for the fact that every trip outside of a climate-controlled room feels like [a jaunt across the sun](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2018/07/03/hot-planet-all-time-heat-records-have-been-set-all-over-the-world-in-last-week/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.1a23331fde7c).  For the American readers of this column — which I assume is everyone (if this column has foreign readers, please let me know both because I am curious and because I could always use another couch when traveling abroad) — I hope everyone had a happy Fourth of July.  Enjoy the 242nd anniversary of independence, because the chances of getting to year 243 are looking a bit more dicey with each passing day.  For many, July means fireworks, barbecues, and that most classic of American sports, [NBA Summer League](http://www.nba.com/summerleague#/), or for those currently collecting Social Security, something called baseball.

But for those in the legal industry, July is of particular importance.

Those studying for the bar have long used July 4th as a line of demarcation, after which exam preparation takes, or at least should take, singular priority.  For current summer associates, July marks either the halfway point of their full summer program or the beginning of a second half program.  0Ls see July as when final law school deposits are due, requiring a choice to be made as to where the next three ([or at least one](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/while-the-grass-can-be-greener-on-the-other-side-it-can-also-be-brown/)) years of their life will be spent.  But most importantly for this column, July is when the Fall recruiting season truly gets underway, occupying not only rising 2Ls but the overwhelming majority of the legal recruiting world.

While there are numerous job fairs which take place throughout the summer, not to mention the almost wholly separate process for getting a public interest legal job, the bulk of Fall legal recruiting centers around on-campus interviews.  Today’s column is the first of a multi-part series that will go through each step of the OCI process with a particular focus on how students can successfully navigate OCI.  How many parts?  Well, I am not entirely sure. Think of this as one of those Twitter threads marked 1/?.



Regardless of how a particular school structures their OCI, how interviews are allocated, or even what they call it, from NYU’s Early Interview Week (EIW) to UVA’s On-Grounds Recruiting (OGR), the first step a student should take to increase their chances of landing a summer offer is to research the employers.  Why research, you might ask, if your goal for Fall recruiting is simply to end up with a summer opportunity that will pay and lead to post-graduation employment?  Aren’t all law firms pretty much the same anyway, a full-service shop named for a couple of older (and likely deceased at this point) partners?  While it can be tempting to think that when you are on your twentieth interview in five days, such a viewpoint could mean that despite a surplus of interviews, you will still find yourself unemployed at the end of the recruiting cycle.

Before a student can conduct any sort of meaningful firm research, they first have to figure out their own employment profile, i.e., what they want to do with their legal career, or at least at the beginning.  This is not to say that every rising 2L needs to have a precise handle on their legal interests to the point that they can say they want to practice real estate law in Kansas City, Kansas, but would blanche at the thought of practicing in Kansas City, Missouri.  Instead, you should have a general sense of what you want to do and where you want to do it.  Do you want to litigate or do transactional work?  Do you want to be in a particular part of the country, and if so, why?  Once you know the answers to these questions, you will know what to be looking for with a particular employer.

Much like the prior year when trying to decide on a law school, many rising 2Ls treat law firm rankings as the apotheosis of research.  And while there is a [litany](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/04/24/the-2018-am-law-100/) [of](http://www.vault.com/company-rankings/law/vault-law-100) [rankings](https://bestlawfirms.usnews.com/lfoty.aspx) one can find online, including [here](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firm-rankings/top-law-firms/?rf=1) at Above the Law, much like their law school counterpart, these rankings are of limited value.  If your reason for deciding to begin your legal career at Carlton Fields instead of Katten Muchin Rosenman is entirely based on the fact that the former is one spot higher in the ATL Power 100 rankings, then you are setting yourself up for a potentially disastrous start to your life as a lawyer.

This is not to say that there is no good law firm information available online.  Indeed, while outfits like [Chambers](https://www.chambersandpartners.com/guide/usa/5) have firm rankings, they also have comprehensive information about hundreds of law firms across the country which is exceedingly valuable — much of this information, including from Chambers, is available in book form, but this is the 21st century and the last thing I imagine most law students want is another volume to carry around.  Also, as [previously mentioned](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/legal-recruiting-and-you-how-the-sausage-is-made/) in this space, the [NALP Directory of Legal Employers](https://www.nalpdirectory.com/) is fantastic for getting a wide range of information about Biglaw firms, including granular data on firm demographics and summer associate program size.  And while third parties can provide a more unbiased look a law firms, do not neglect the firm websites themselves which though aggrandizing at times, can show you which practice areas get the most emphasis as well the geographic area where certain types of work is more likely to be available.  If you want to do appellate litigation in Los Angeles, but see that every appellate litigator at Firm X works out of the Washington, D.C., office, that should tell you the firm might not be a perfect fit.  The sheer number of law firms, coupled with the reams of insights available, may seem like a daunting task to review in full prior to OCI, but this gets back to the previous point about first understanding what you want to do with your career.  If you have determined that you have no interest in Maritime Law, then skip over those firms, or if you know that you want to practice commercial lending in Minnesota, then focus on precisely that.

However, information the public domain will only take a student so far.  To truly research your OCI options, you need to talk to people.  The best place to start is with rising 3Ls (or fellow 2Ls who summered as 1Ls) at your school who just came out of a particular firm’s summer program.  As I tell my Vanderbilt students, while I am happy to tell you my experience as a summer associate (spoiler alert: it was awesome), that information is 11 years out of date.  The most recent and accurate information about a summer program will come from those who were just there.  For information about the firm that goes beyond the confines of the summer program, find some attorneys currently at the firm and network with them.  As I mentioned in [my column on networking](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/you-gotta-network-to-get-work-baby/) way back in early April — you know, before the [United States started taking children from their parents and locking them in cages](https://www.vox.com/2018/6/11/17443198/children-immigrant-families-separated-parents) — your best bet other than friends and family at a particular firm is to talk to alumni of your law school or even undergraduate institution.  While they might provide a slightly rosy assessment, some pointed questions on your part can reveal a true picture of what is going on at that firm.

While this discussion of legal employer research has been focused on looking through the OCI/Biglaw lens, it is important to realize that these techniques can be utilized for any type of legal employer, be it Biglaw, smaller firms, public interest, non-profits, government, or even in-house positions.  Obtaining as much information as possible about a potential employer is rarely a bad idea.

I understand the temptation to skip this research step.  During the tail end of my own EIW experience, the extent of my research was whatever I could discern from a glossy brochure in the few minutes before I interviewed.  That was a mistake.  No matter what your grades or how many offers you might end up with, thoroughly researching OCI employers will make it far more likely you make an educated decision about which firms with whom to interview and ultimate work.

# Associates Will Love This Firm's New Salaries
## Global firm joins the party.

Forget about the Am Law 100, Hogan Lovells is a top 10 firm on the global ranking, so there was never much doubt that it would be joining the salary hike party. The firm brought in over $2 billion in revenue and it’s not going to let a few bucks keep it from maintaining its elite status.

U.S. associates received a memo communicating the change yesterday. There are some noteworthy details in here but the crux of it is this:

Summers will be bumped to the class of 2021 scale.

The memo notes that this raise applies to associates “on the national scale” and says that those who aren’t will be contacted independently. That sort of talk generally applies to counsel and senior attorneys who’ve outgrown the grid, but the phrasing in this memo makes it sound more like staff attorney positions.

Whether that’s what HoLove meant or not, it raises an important question about the future of the staff attorney market. After all, one Biglaw firm’s staff attorney is another smaller-profile firm’s full-timer. How the salary hikes trickle down through the legal landscape is going to impact the market for these lawyers going forward.

In any event, congrats. [Full memo is here](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-18-at-10.47.48-AM.png).

# Stat Of The Week: A Caffeinated Workforce
## The productivity benefits appear to transcend phylum.

While an [extensive report by the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2021/jul/14/food-monopoly-meals-profits-data-investigation) on the U.S. food industry has recently raised monopoly concerns, another new agriculture-related stat has largely flown under the radar. 

[As noted by VICE](https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kvmp4/a-caffeine-buzz-helps-bumble-bees-do-their-jobs-better-study-finds?utm_source=nextdraft&utm_medium=email), a study [published this week](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)00897-6) in Current Biology reveals that lawyers aren’t the only ones who see an improved work focus after ingesting caffeine. 

Researchers in the study observed bees that were trained to link a strawberry scent with a sugary reward, with some bees given a dose of caffeine in the training and some not given caffeine. 

When the bees were released into a flying area with strawberry-scented flowers and other “distractor flowers,” the bees receiving a dose of caffeine came out ahead — 70% of the caffeinated bees visited the strawberry flowers first, compared with 60% of the non-caffeinated bees. 

Sarah Arnold of the University of Greenwich, who led the study, told VICE that the findings open up “questions about what aspects of bee behavior caffeine (which occurs naturally in some plants’ nectar) and other nectar natural products might influence, and under what circumstances, and how this might be applied more widely in crop pollination.”

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs.

It’s bonus season in Biglaw, and associates are nervously waiting and watching to see if there firms will match not only the [Cravath year-end bonus scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/cravath-bonuses/), but the special bonus scale as well. If certain firms refuse to match the special bonuses, there will truly be a new compensation distinction between Biglaw firms this year.

Please note the UPDATE below.

Associates at Morgan Lewis can now let out a huge sigh of relief, because the powers that be at the firm just announced that associates’ holiday season will be extra festive this year, with up to $140K in cold, hard cash, depending on their class year. Here are the details:

Per usual firm practice, U.S. associates just received a voicemail from [chair] Jami McKeon to inform us that the firm will be matching both the year-end bonus scale of Am Law 20 firms and the special fall bonuses of Am Law 20 firms. Jami wanted to let us know on the eve of Thanksgiving as an appropriate expression of gratitude. Exact/further details will be coming next week.

“Expected and appreciated news,” said one source. If the firm is truly proceeding as usual, first-years will not be receiving a pro-rated bonus, since the Morgan Lewis fiscal year begins in October. Sorry about that, first-years!

UPDATE (November 30): Here’s a message we received from a source with additional details on the Morgan Lewis 2020 year-end bonuses:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As indicated last week, U.S. associates received a follow-on voicemail this afternoon confirming a match of both the year-end and special bonuses to the market scales. These will be paid January 29th. Associates must have billed 1900 hours for FY2020, which as always includes unlimited pro bono, but also specially for this year includes all time spent on COVID-19 projects not otherwise billable.

Associates not eligible for these bonuses due to productivity, may nonetheless receive only the special bonus if for the 4 months from September through December of 2020 they annualize 1900 hours, again including all pro bono and all time spent on COVID-19 projects not otherwise billable.

The message is that this allowance for the special bonuses only is aimed to compensate those with lower productivity in spring/summer of 2020 due to the pandemic, including, as named in particular, junior associates who may have seen a slowdown during such period, and any others who may have had to cope with personal situations during such period that reduced productivity.

Bonus money will likely be deposited into associates’ accounts in January 2021.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

Ed. note: Welcome to the first installment of Better Know A Practice Area, a new monthly series introducing readers to different practice areas. Each post is written by an editor at [Practical Law](http://us.practicallaw.com/) who previously practiced in that area and currently writes about it. We hope that this content will be interesting and useful to law students and young lawyers figuring out their career paths.

- What do you do in a typical day?
It’s hard to describe a typical day for a capital markets and corporate governance lawyer; even seemingly routine transactions always have unexpected problems to be solved. That can be stressful in the heat of the moment, but facing unique challenges regularly is what makes the job so interesting and, of course, makes for a better lawyer.

When in the middle of a transaction there will be a mix of organizing and guiding the client through the process. There will also be drafting, reviewing drafts from the other side, and a great deal of negotiating key contracts and disclosure documents among the client and the other side with their counsel. If the issuer is new, the lawyer will also want to spend time learning what they do and what their key metrics are, both from those at the issuer directly and from external sources.

Throughout the year lawyers in this practice area also help issuers draft their annual, quarterly, and periodic reports that are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This requires staying current on SEC rules and understanding the issuer’s competitive marketplace and the evolving risks to its business. These reports are extremely important to all public companies and comprise the foundation of how they officially communicate with their shareholders and the capital markets.

- Who do you work with?
Lawyers in this practice area work with internal partners and the deal team particular to each transaction, which may include specialists in particular areas (for example, tax, intellectual property, environmental, and executive compensation experts). They will also work with a variety of people working internally for the clients, including the in-house legal team, executives, and boards of directors.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
These lawyers will work with the client’s auditors and regulators (including the SEC), securities exchanges, and various other financial regulators. There will be regular contact with counsel and business people on the other side. With these various groups, capital markets and corporate governance lawyers have the opportunity to see plenty of different perspectives and angles, so there is much to be learned and many personalities to navigate.

- What does a common career path look like?
It is common to gain experience in large law firms for several years, gradually taking on more responsibility and learning to manage transactions and become the point person for a client to come to. From there, a lawyer may move into the partnership track or stay with the firm in a non-track role. It is common to move on to practice at a smaller law firm and very common to take a position as in-house counsel.

- If variety is the spice of life, how spicy is this practice area?
Representing public companies affords the opportunity to see many types of issues, from complicated financings and related M&A transactions, to deciding how or whether to disclose sensitive issues, to helping structure a company’s corporate governance regime. It is a great practice area if the “never a dull moment” thing is appealing to you. This is especially true if the lawyer has the opportunity to work at a firm or company where he or she is trusted to work on cutting-edge issues.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
It’s very important for capital markets and corporate governance lawyers to do their best to manage their own career and work with different clients in different industries on a variety of issues. This certainly gets easier with seniority. It is also beneficial for lawyers to have a few regular clients that come to them for everything. It provides opportunities to encounter many different questions while gaining intimate knowledge of their business and culture. This is great experience for a future in-house counsel.

- How much wear and tear?
A capital markets and corporate governance lawyer may be working on a securities financing transaction, helping a company communicate appropriately with the market and its customers, or guiding corporate governance best practices. These are all very important issues to a company with high stakes and, accordingly, the pace of work will be fast and expectations and pressure high.

However, working on these vital topics is what makes the job exciting. Wear and tear also comes from an inherent lack of predictability when working on important issues with high expectations. Striking a balance is certainly something lawyers have to work at.

- Of the people in this practice group who hate it, what exactly do they hate about it?
Lawyers in this practice area have to really enjoy the work, or the “wear and tear” as you call it can catch up with them. That’s likely the biggest complaint. Lawyers have to feel that it is worth the sacrifices they make. It’s an intense job. Lawyers have to give a lot to it and they get a lot in return. Of course that is not for everyone.

- Of the people in this practice group who love it, what exactly do they love about it?
The variety is certainly part of it, always being intellectually stimulated. Working on transactions and matters that are of utmost importance to clients is also very fulfilling professionally. There are times when a lawyer will be working with a company and its future is literally on the line. The challenges can be exhilarating and there are always learning opportunities.

- Are there common avenues out of this practice area?
Working in this area positions lawyers very well to go in-house to public companies where they would continue to counsel on corporate transactions as well as corporate governance. Broad experience with different industries and business units can also position lawyers for various non-legal business roles within a company. It takes very good judgment to be a successful capital markets and corporate governance lawyer and that translates well into many areas of general business judgment.

- What are some market trends that impact this practice area?
Of course, the financial markets themselves are primarily impactful. Business cycles and credit markets create booms and droughts.

Periods of increased activity can give junior lawyers the opportunity to run their own deals earlier than normal as resources are spread thin. Alternatively, downturns afford the opportunity to work on novel transactions as market participants must get more creative.

Finally, the business cycles lead to alternating periods of deregulation and then increased regulation. Good examples are the Dodd-Frank Act and the JOBS Act; both have kept capital markets and corporate governance lawyers extremely busy for some time now.

- If you had to recommend one candidate from a room crowded with recent bar exam graduates, what specific qualities would he or she have that would ensure success in this practice area?
Both the ability and the desire to counsel clients with as much or even more focus on business judgment and their business advancement as any of the purely legal topics or skills they learned in law school.

Whether a lawyer is in-house or part of a firm, it is essential to consider himself or herself as part of the business team, but bringing a unique and essential skill set to the table. This perspective can help lawyers move from saying “that’s too risky, we can’t do that” to “here’s how we can best accomplish our goals while minimizing our risk.”

# Biglaw Firm Matches Market Year-End Bonuses And Gives An Extra Special Bonus For High Billers
## The firm thoughtfully accounted for the challenges of 2020.

COVID-19 has changed a lot of things — whoever thought you’d spend so much time matching a face mask to your outfit? But some things even coronavirus cannot change, like Biglaw bonuses.

Today Ropes & Gray announced year-end bonuses, to be paid on December 24th. The bonus scale is as follows ([you can read the full memo on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/ropes-bonuses/2/)):

As is typical at Ropes & Gray, more senior associates will receive individualized bonuses that take into account the market standard, and will also account for the special bonuses.

There is something different about this year’s bonuses — more money! Back in the fall, Ropes was[ among the Biglaw firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/ropes-gray-leaves-associates-empty-handed-when-it-comes-to-fall-bonuses/) to delay [COVID appreciation bonuses.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-fall-special-bonus-tracker-which-biglaw-firms-are-handing-out-cash-for-associates-hard-work-during-the-pandemic/) But the memo indicated associates will received market rate special bonuses starting at $7,500 and increasing, depending on class year, which are in addition to the year-end bonus numbers. Nice to see these Biglaw associates get an extra special (cash) thank-you for their hard work during a pandemic. And who’s eligible for these special bonuses? Any “partnership track associates in the US and Asia who annualized at least 1300 hours.”

Year-end bonuses typically come with a 1900 hours requirement at the firm, and associates who have failed to enter their billable hours on a timely basis also get an [automatic deduction of their bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/biglaw-bonuses-come-with-complete-with-punitive-measures-for-naughty-associates/). But in recognition to the challenges of 2020, Ropes has made some welcome modifications to these policies:

For year-end bonuses, we continue to have an activity target of at least 1,900 billable and pro bono hours to be eligible for a bonus. However, we recognize that 2020 brought shifting market dynamics that affected work flow for some of you. We have decided that for this year, we will determine bonuses using whichever is higher for a given associate: hours from the full review period (November – October), or hours for that period excluding the months of April through July. If you annualized below 1900 hours during the full review period, but annualized at a higher amount for the review period excluding the months of April through July, we will pay the higher bonus up to the 1900 hour market level for your class. We believe this approach best recognizes the outsized impact the economic downturn had on some of you, while also recognizing that many of you were steadily busy throughout the year.

….

We also want to reiterate the importance of timely diaries. They enable us to bill clients promptly at the end of each month, and are essential to monitoring and managing alternative fee arrangements. Adhering to our diary standards is absolutely crucial. As previously announced, lawyers violating our diary standards will receive an automatic bonus reduction. However, for 2020, associates who are subject to a diary sanction reduction will be able to “earn back” the deducted portion by submitting timely entries consistently for the first half of 2021. We hope this encourages good diary habits while also recognizing the challenges 2020 posed for many.

Cleta Mitchell (image from the old Foley & Lardner site)

Cleta Mitchell used to be a partner at Foley & Lardner. She and the firm swiftly parted ways after [the Washington Post and Atlanta Journal-Constitution](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/d45acb92-4dc4-11eb-bda4-615aaefd0555_story.html) secured audio of the former Biglaw attorney participating in a call where Donald Trump seemed to [tick all the elements of Georgia’s election fraud statute](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/donald-trump-drags-biglaw-firm-into-middle-of-election-interference-effort/) without discouragement or chiding from the licensed attorneys in the room (including someone only known as Alex that Above the Law ultimately identified as [now-former Fox Rothschild attorney Alex Kaufman](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/and-now-both-biglaw-lawyers-have-resigned-over-the-trump-call/)).

The next day, [Foley & Lardner announced that she was out](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/cleta-mitchell-out-at-foley-lardner-after-troubling-donald-trump-call/), which marked a laudably quick resolution in an industry not known for quick turnarounds. The firm’s statement noted that it had decided not to touch the various “Big Lie” litigations with a 10-foot pole back in November and had no knowledge that Mitchell was running around doing the highest-of-stakes lawyering without their knowledge.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
This morning, Carrie Levine from the Center for Public Integrity tweeted this now-released December email:



This places Mitchell deep in the case at least by the end of December and, language like “we didn’t include… in our lawsuit” certainly suggests that Mitchell saw herself as involved as early as December 4.

Levine wondered if this revelation debunks the firm’s Mission: Impossible level disavowal of Mitchell’s shenanigans. It’s a good question. Ultimately, I’m inclined to take the firm at its word that it tried to steer clear of these cases and was blindsided to find itself dragged into a constitutional crisis.

But that in itself reflects a disturbing trend.

From the moment this broke, the firm was adamant that it had not been retained in this matter and that Mitchell participated as a private person. Unfortunately, it’s not that easy to flip the firm affiliation switch from an ethical or potential liability perspective — a fact that likely played a big role in her departure.

It would, however, explain why the firm was unable to police the matter. If she’s not submitting the matter for a conflict check and just showing up without clearing it through the proper channels, they really couldn’t know what’s going on. Unlike the Barnes & Thornburg attorney who got [immediately kicked to the curb](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/barnes-thornburg-partner-from-loony-mypillow-suit-no-longer-with-the-firm/) after signing his name to the most recent [MyPillow tinfoil RICO rant](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/mypillow-guy-sues-dominion-for-defamatory-rico/), Mitchell’s name wasn’t on anything. Had this call not surfaced, there’s no guarantee that Foley & Lardner would ever learn that one of their partners was cool advancing messy election arguments behind their back.

At that point, it’s all about trust. Can you really trust your partners not to jeopardize the platform with their own selfish behavior? Whether it’s an attempt to eke out another few bucks in billables by taking on a surprise local counsel gig or actively hiding a matter from the firm by playing it off as private participation doesn’t really matter — it’s about making sure everyone you work with is truly pulling the same direction.

That’s why quickly addressing this sort of behavior is important, but at some point firms need to have a reckoning about the risk of putting faith in people they don’t unreservedly trust as colleagues. Because if the last few months have taught us anything, it’s that folks who run in these circles aren’t afraid to take reckless actions. And that’s not good for any firm.

# Law Firm Announces Raises To $170K Scale
## A firm committed to being Cravath's cost-effective competitor is living up to that role.

Just when you thought the salary raises had finally settled down, one more firm makes an adjustment. This time it’s [Morrison Cohen](http://www.morrisoncohen.com/index.cfm), a law firm so committed to serving a middle market client base they actually brand themselves as “Law Firm To The Middle Market,” complete with a registered trademark on the phrase.

So it should come as no surprise that a firm oriented around keeping rates low to garner market share among clients seeking a cost-effective alternative to the Cravaths of the world would announce raises just a shade off the Cravath scale.

First-years will be making a $170K base salary as of September 1. Morrison associates will also be eligible for a performance bonus determined by a combination of hours (1900 target) and an evaluation of work quality and a 20 percent cut of any business they bring into the firm.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
This is the sort of sane — dare I say “middle” ground — approach that I think more than a few firms will wish they followed over the long-term. Morrison Cohen is now well-positioned to recruit quality talent (especially on the lateral market where burned out top-tier associates are eager to take modest pay cuts in exchange for working with a firm that tries to keep billable hours per associate under 2000) without having to compromise on their strategy of offering clients a lower price point than most of their Biglaw competitors.

A strategy that could pay real market share dividends as more top-tier alternatives have to make upward fee adjustments because they chose to fly too close to the Cravath sun and offer full $180K raises.

As law firms continue to become more and more progressive, the journey into parenthood no longer seems to be considered an inconvenience for attorneys. Case in point: yet another major law firm has updated and expanded its parental leave policy, ushering in a welcome change for a new generation of lawyers.

Which firm is the latest to modernize its maternity and paternity leave policies? That would be Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, which announced yesterday that it was changing the name of its policy to “Parental Leave Policy,” clarifying that its primary caregiver leave and general parental leave are both completely gender-neutral. Fried Frank currently offers 5 weeks of general parental leave, an additional 5 weeks of primary caregiver leave, and 8 weeks of disability for birth mothers. As part of the expansion of its parental leave policy, the firm will now allow new parents to take leave at any time during the first 12 months of a child’s arrival.

Leaders at Fried Frank have recognized that new parents transitioning back to work at the firm face many difficult and unique challenges after the birth or adoption of their children, so they recently decided to update their parental leave policy to make it easier for lawyers to return to the office. Under the new policy, primary caregivers will be automatically eligible to work a 75 percent schedule during the first six months of their return to the workplace. During that time, their compensation rate will remain unchanged, and hours used to determine bonus eligibility will be annualized (for both their parental leave time and their time in the return-to-work program). New parents must opt out of the program if they don’t want the leeway that the firm’s new 75 percent schedule provides.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“The happiness and success of our attorneys is a top priority at Fried Frank. We are committed to doing what we can to ensure a positive experience when returning to work,” said [David J. Greenwald](http://www.friedfrank.com/?pageID=42&itemID=1512), the firm’s chairman. “This policy update is consistent with our overall commitment to inclusion and retention efforts. We understand that the transition to parenthood is challenging and can be further compounded by returning to the workplace and trying to balance potentially competing commitments and priorities. This policy is an important tool to allow our attorneys to take the time they need in order to ensure a successful transition back to work in the context of what we hope will be a long career at the firm.”

That’s not the only way Fried Frank is making life easier for attorneys with children. The firm is also providing new parents with subsidized back-up child care, access to a wealth of programs and information via [CCA’s work-life assistance program](http://www.ccainc.com/services/eap-services/work-life-assistance), as well as the option to request an flexible schedule. According to [Annemarie Crouch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annemarie-crouch-63a75783/), global director of human capital management at Fried Frank, even more programs for new parents are being offered: “The firm also offers a Working Parents Resource Group where parents can come together and discuss topics of interest among their peers. … The firm is committed to working with our attorneys to provide them with benefits and assistance to help them achieve a work/life balance that is right for them.”

Given the expansion of Fried Frank’s parental leave benefits, Crouch “hope[s] [attorneys] will make use of the policy to receive the support they need from the firm in connection with the birth or adoption of a child.” To that end, here’s what some associates at Fried Frank had to say about the firm’s new policies:

[Neil Hood](http://www.friedfrank.com/index.cfm?pageID=42&itemID=1365): As the father of a son born with medical complications, the opportunity to come back to work on a reduced-hour basis at full compensation is unexpectedly generous. Also, the fact that the new policy is gender-neutral is remarkable. My wife and I both appreciate that Fried Frank recognizes that I could be the primary caregiver to my son, as his father, and therefore given a longer period of parental leave. I hope other firms (and companies at large) follow suit.

[Chelsea P. Azrak](http://www.friedfrank.com/index.cfm?pageID=42&itemID=1371): The policy is a welcome change for new parents who, for the first time, are learning to balance work life with home life and are figuring out what works with respect to child care options.  I am confident that the policy is a step towards helping the firm retain female associates and partners.

[Candice Pueschel](http://www.friedfrank.com/index.cfm?pageID=42&itemID=1776): I’m really excited for the change in our parental leave policy because it gives me the opportunity to continue to focus on my career while reducing some of the stress of trying to be a top performing lawyer and a top performing mom. I no longer have to make the choice of taking a pay cut in order to ease back into work after my maternity leave is over, which I imagine will make the challenges of being a new mom, along with a newborn’s sleep schedule, a bit more manageable.

This top firm isn’t pulling a rabbit out of a hat for associates today. Instead, the big reveal on this magic trick is more money. Top-rated Magic Circle firm Linklaters is wowing U.S. associates with a brand new Davis Polk match.

It’s a magical time to be a lawyer at Linklaters. This is what the Davis Polk salary scale looks like at the firm:

- Class of 2021: $215,000
- Class of 2020: $225,000
- Class of 2019: $250,000
- Class of 2018: $293,500
- Class of 2017: $335,000
- Class of 2016: $360,500
- Class of 2015: $381,000
- Class of 2014+: $396,500
These salaries will be paid on March 15th, retroactive to January 1.

Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

P.S. Now that one Magic Circle firm has entered the salary fray, when will others — like Allen & Overy, Clifford Chance, and Freshfields (which is trying to make its “Magic Circle” designation [magically disappear](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/freshfields-wants-to-make-its-magic-circle-designation-magically-disappear/)) — opt to join in all the fun? We imagine it will be quite soon, so get ready, associates.

# All I Want For Christmas Is... A Reduced Bill
## Clients know they're paying for Biglaw's opulent holiday parties, so maybe don't post so many pictures on social media as a reminder.

‘Tis that time of year again. The season of Biglaw holiday parties and client gifts are amongst us.

Long known as a night to celebrate the year’s accomplishments and as an opportunity for the managing partner to articulate a vision for the future, holiday parties also are an opportunity to earn a client’s scorn.

No, I’m not talking about sending an ill-advised drunken text to a client or futile attempts at mixing business and pleasure with a colleague. Those are always inappropriate, unprofessional, and should be avoided.

Rather, I’m talking about the sheer lavishness of some of the parties and the penchant for some within a firm’s employ to post about them on social media.

Lest you think me a Scrooge, I have no problem with law firms taking a night off to enjoy the holiday season. It builds kinship and provides a small ray of light into the otherwise gloomy world of billable hours.

I do, however, take issue with being subject to a barrage of photos on social media depicting ice sculptures of Biglaw logos or a near infinite amount of top shelf liquor all hosted at some marquee location.

And by no means am I a social media troll. During my years in practice, I have come to realize that no form of social media is immune from the holiday party post. I can even recall coming across a photo of a near black tie holiday affair that was posted on LinkedIn of all places.

Again, I must state I am no Grinch. In no way do I begrudge the law firms for hosting the parties, nor do I judge those attorneys who partake in the festivities. Rather, I would simply ask as someone who has signed off on what I sometimes think to be rather exorbitant bill, please be mindful as you partake in the annual holiday party.

Yes, I know deep down the checks I send each month may have helped contribute to a profitable year, but it is one thing to know it, and another thing to see it in photographs.

In addition to avoiding holiday party gloating, I would humbly suggest one be mindful of client gifts as well.

While it may seem counterintuitive to think that my team and I do not enjoy the three-foot-tall gift basket filled with rare chocolate from Belgium, you would be crazy not to think I didn’t calculate the value of the present in terms of the billed hours I have paid out in the past year.

Sending your client something around the holidays is a nice touch. A card, a thoughtful note of appreciation, even a donation in the client’s honor to charity are all thoughtful and well received. But please resist the urge to splurge. After all, I know who is really paying for that gift to begin with.

So this holiday season, enjoy yourself. You have worked hard and you deserve a night or two off. And take a moment to acknowledge your loyal clients through some of act, card, or note.

But be forewarned, continue with your displays of opulence, and just as the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come predicts, and you just may end up alone, and without clients.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

# Elite Firms Need To Increase Compensation -- Recruiters Smell Blood In The Water
## Raise your salaries, before recruiters snatch your most talented associates.

We know that not every law firm in the world — not even those we loosely term Biglaw — will be able to make the move to the newly announced pay scale. And that is certainly understandable; under the new compensation grid, every associate is getting a raise between $20,000 and $35,000 — especially for firms with a big headcount, that money adds up quickly. And certainly no one wants a repeat of the last Biglaw compensation cycle, where firms overextended themselves to keep up with the market and then had to lay off associates to keep the lights on.

But what is the real cost for law firms of not moving to the market salary? Well, they run the very real risk of losing some of their best talent to firms willing to play ball. One tipster noted:

[I’m a] senior associate who lateraled … from a … firm (now on the $180k scale)… I have already been called by my former firm … about returning and by recruiters about lateraling to a “market rate firm.” I know there are a few more senior and mid-level associates in the same boat. Unless [law firms] move[] up quickly, retaining quality and high-billing mid-level and senior associates will be rough.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
And that, in a nutshell, is why we have so many firms from across the country scrambling to match the MoneyLaw scale. They don’t want to see their best and brightest head out the door. And we’ve repeatedly heard from associates in different cities that they will have to seriously consider their options if their firms won’t match.

If you have to bill 2,400 hours, you at least want to know you’re making top dollar for your efforts.

We are covering this story as market conditions develop, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

Whether it’s 100% deserved or not, Biglaw has… an unfortunate reputation. Like, you go to law school to save the turtles, but the Biglaw money is so good and the student loans so bad that you wind up graduating and working for Wolfram & Hart defending Goliath Corporation over their latest oil spill.

The truth is there’s a lot of money on the table and it can be difficult to turn that down, so maybe you compromise a little of the kind of work you imagined doing when you applied to law school. But the good news is that some Biglaw firms are doing the work to do good — and now there’s a ranking to see how the firms’ efforts stack up.

[Law360 has introduced ](https://www.law360.com/trials/articles/1428872/social-impact-leaders-a-look-at-our-new-law-firm-ranking)their Social Impact Leaders ranking. The new ranking evaluates Biglaw firms across four pillars: racial and ethnic diversity, gender equality, employee engagement, and pro bono service. (A detailed methodology is[ available here](https://assets.law360news.com/1433000/1433867/social%20impact%20leaders%202021%20methodology.pdf).)

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
So, which Biglaw firms are hitting these key metrics? Law360 has ranked [the top 100 firms](https://www.law360.com/pulse/articles/1428803), but here’s a look at those at the top of the ranking:

1. Covington & Burling
2. Orrick
3. WilmerHale
4. Morrison & Foerster
5. Arnold & Porter
6. O’Melveny & Myers
7. Cooley
8. Wilson Sonsini
9. Patterson Belknap
10. Jenner & Block

They’ve also broken out the firms that excel at pro bono work, ranked by the percentage of attorneys who met or exceeded the 50 hours of pro bono work threshold in 2020. (That’s the ABA’s recommendation for yearly pro bono work for all lawyers. Unfortunately, most lawyers at the firms ranked by Law360 do not meet that recommendation.) The top 5 firms [by this standard](https://www.law360.com/pulse/articles/1433055) are:

1. Selendy & Gay
2. Orrick
3. Patterson Belknap
4. Jenner & Block
5. Arnold & Porter

# Elite Biglaw Firm Celebrates Its Most Successful Financial Year In History
## Now *that* is a TON of money! Congratulations!

After completing 2022 with disappointing financials, 2023 turned into a real banner year for one of the most largest Biglaw firms in the country.

Hogan Lovells — a firm that brought in $2,432,000,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 12 in the most recent Am Law 100 — is now celebrating a record financial performance. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/02/13/hogan-lovells-rebounds-in-2023-with-most-profitable-year-in-history-405-136205/) has the details:

The global firm netted $986 million from revenues of $2.68 billion, which translated into $2.74 million in profits per equity partner. Year-over-year increases to these metrics of 17%, 10.2% and 20.3%, respectively, came after falling in 2022 by 13%, 6.6% and 8.2%.

CEO [Miguel Zaldivar](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/miguel-zaldivar), who was reelected to another four-year term last year, attributed the firm’s reversal of fortune to elevation of Hogan Lovells’ brand awareness in highly commercial markets and “record” collections in the last two months of the year. (A representative of the firm declined to disclose its realization rate.)

“When you experience double-digit growth in revenue and you see a double-digit PEP increase, you know there’s something quite special going on at the firm because it’s not driven by contingency or alternative fee arrangements but by our proposition to the market,” Zaldivar told Am Law.

Congratulations to Hogan Lovells on all of its financial successes in 2023!

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

[Biglaw’s supplemental bonuses for high billers] are meant to be a really feel-good move for a very small number of people. The firms that are doing the premiums for really high hours are well aware that there aren’t that many people who are going to meet the bar, based on the fact that hours across the board have been so much lower this year.

— Kate Reder Sheikh, a recruiter and partner in Major, Lindsey & Africa’s associate practice group, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/12/06/for-exceptional-contributions-a-select-pool-of-associates-will-receive-extra-cash/?), on all of the Biglaw firms that have announced supplemental bonuses for those associates who have billed over their hours targets in 2022. Sheikh went on to say she’d be “shocked” if bonus premiums weren’t hours-related, since “hours are the currency of the law.” Click [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/biglaw-bonus-tracker-2022/) to see which firms are awarding extra bonuses to associates.

# Law Firm Marriages 101
## The basics of pulling off a successful law firm merger.

As law firms continue seeking growth and stability in these uncertain economic times, mergers have been a useful tool for many. Mergers can help deepen a firm’s bench of expertise, open opportunities for cross-selling, and reduce per lawyer overhead through economies of scale.

The firm where I work, Fennemore, has completed four combinations of various forms over the last two years — roughly doubling our headcount and revenue. Although there are plenty of things I think we did well, there have also been lessons we’ve learned along the way.

Merging law firms has often been compared to a marriage, and I think the comparison is an apt one. Done between the right partners and with the right approach, a merger can make both partners stronger, better, and happier. Done wrong, it can lead to fighting, stress, and unhappiness.

With that in mind, here are five tips to a long and happy merger.

1. Do Plenty Of Dating First

There are plenty of stories of couples meeting on the Vegas strip, running to a drive-thru chapel, getting hitched by Elvis, and toasting each other joyfully at their 50th wedding anniversary. But most people don’t find lasting love at first sight, and most firms aren’t ready to join up after the first time their management teams meet. The best candidates for a merger are firms that share the same values, culture, and economics. Those are things you can only really get to know over time.

Keep meeting, keep talking, and keep finding opportunities for your key leaders to interact. If you’ve got cases or deals that would benefit from co-counsel, consider referring the work to your potential merger partner so your teams can get a sense of how they’d work with one another. The longer you spend getting to know one another, the more confident you’ll be when it comes time to decide whether to take the next step.

2. Embrace The Whole Family

Like a wise person once said, [you’re gonna get some hop-ons](https://twitter.com/arresteddev/status/504776379745832961). Those of us who’ve tied the knot understand that you’re not just marrying your spouse. You’re also marrying their family and friends, and the social life that person built before they met you. Although you might get that charming and hilarious sister-in-law, you might also get that cranky uncle who always wants to talk politics over Thanksgiving dinner.

The same is true when merging firms. It’s not just the executive teams hashing the deal out that will be your new colleagues. You’re getting everybody: the rock star partners, the associates still figuring it out, the happy employees, the disgruntled, the people excited for change, and the ones who fear what’s ahead. If you’ve done your homework, you should feel good that the overall mix will be a positive one for your new combined firm — but you’re always going to have some folks that come along that might raise eyebrows or be skeptical of the deal.

Do your best to make everyone feel welcome and secure, and to let them know you’re there in good faith to make everyone’s lives better. It may be messy for a while, but soon all those new personalities will feel like part of your own family, too. Over time, that cranky uncle may even grow on you.

3. Accept That Someone’s Going To Be Against It

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
You know that childhood friend who barely makes the invite list who gets a bit too tipsy at the reception and lets it slip they think their one-time bestie is making a mistake? They’re going to be part of any law firm merger, too, and they’re not even going to feel embarrassed about it at brunch the next day.

Most lawyers are born with a contrarian streak, and the rest have one trained into them in law school. That’s why it’s almost guaranteed in any merger that there will be at least some people on both sides who are against the merger — often in very loud voices.

The best way to minimize any potential negativity is to get ahead of it. Before you’ve even found a potential merger candidate, identify the gaps you see in your firm and communicate to your partners where you’d like to see your firm grow, and what weaknesses need to be patched up. Helping your partners see the logic behind the move, or better yet finding ways to give them ownership of the process, can do a lot to soothe anxieties. Then once a favorable merger candidate is found, management’s No. 1 job becomes building consensus for the decision. Sometimes all people need is a bit of time and attention, to feel heard, and they’ll be more inclined to go with the flow. Give it to them.

That said, some people will understand everything about the deal and still be against it.

Hopefully those voices are few and far between; if not, you may not have had the requisite consensus for the deal, which could be a bigger problem. When this happens, there’s a firm culture concept called “disagree and commit.” The idea is that everyone gets their opportunity to speak and be heard, but once the decision is made everyone is expected to work to make the decision a successful one. If you can add that concept to your firm’s cultural tool kit ahead of time, it’s a useful one to pull out at times like this.

Ultimately, these problems tend to solve themselves. Either the partners against the merger learn to live with it, or they move somewhere that feels more aligned with their views. Losing some partners or team members after a combination can be disappointing. But, in some ways, it may be for the best in the long term. Having someone openly hostile to the firm’s new identity or unaligned with its vision isn’t good for anybody.

4. Brace Yourself For the Fact That Integration Is Going To Be Hard

Humans are creatures of habit, and adding another person to our daily routine is often tough. Figuring out how to live in the same space as your significant other can be hard. Figuring out how to share space between merging law firms is orders of magnitude harder.

One chronically underestimated piece of any merger is the technological integration. Firms never have identical tech suites. That necessarily means one group of lawyers is going to have to relearn how to access documents, enter time, open files, and edit prebills. I’ve seen people nearly having steam spouting from their ears trying to learn new systems.

There are a few ways to make tech integration easier. More training, planning, and support are always good, but any large technology changeover is going to involve headaches at some point. Prepare your team for the bumps in the road, and trust that things will settle down after a while.

5. Build Something That’s More Than The Sum Of Its Parts

In life and in law, good unions don’t happen without a reason. Law firm mergers usually involve efficiencies and practice synergies, but at their best they’re also mergers of ideas. Both partners should try to understand one another and take the best practices and concepts from each to create a stronger whole.

Ensure that key members of both firms are represented in the leadership of the new enterprise. If your merger partner is substantially smaller than your own firm, go out of your way to make the members of the smaller firm feel heard and represented. If there are traditions or cultural issues important to one firm, make sure they survive the merger. One of our merger partners had a long history of big St. Paddy’s Day blowouts and other office celebrations that were important for them to keep. This tradition has continued and has been expanded given its importance to clients, firm members, and the community.

Two can do more than one. That’s true for people, and it’s true for law firms. Choose your partners wisely and work hard, and your combination can be a successful one.

# 'Are We There Yet?' Navigating The Legal Profession's 'New Normal'
## Ten years have passed since the Great Recession, and our profession is forever changed.

It was 10 years ago (how time passes or doesn’t) that the financial institution dominos started to fall. JP Morgan Chase bought Bear Stearns for a song, or close to that. Then one after another purportedly “too big to fail” institutions did exactly that, or were forced into shotgun marriages, if they could partner with a stronger financial institutions that could take the risk, or at least they thought they could. Remember Wachovia? WaMu?  Lehman Brothers? To name just a couple.

I’m not going to rehash what happened when this country came close to the brink of financial collapse; that’s for others to dissect. On this 10-year anniversary, I am sure there will be a plethora of books/articles/podcasts/interviews/tweets to debate what happened, why, and did we learn anything to try to avoid the next one.

The “Great Recession,” as people call it, affected lives, marriages, careers, savings, homes, and a litany of other significant changes. And it affected the legal profession and still does, in ways great and small, although to anyone who got caught up in its effects on the profession, the effect has hardly been “small.” While the profound effects on our profession may have been “micro” in the overall scheme of the devastation, the effects within our profession have been “macro,” and 10 years later, our profession is forever changed.

Let me provide just a few examples:

1) Job losses, layoffs, reductions in force, whatever you choose to call them, suffered by experienced lawyers later in their careers with no hopes of replacing the jobs, let alone the incomes. Never had age discrimination been so evident, apparent, virulent, and rampant. Couple that with the double whammy to the 401(k)s and other retirement plans.

2) Diminishing or vanishing opportunities for new lawyers who passed the bar and sought their first jobs. Those opportunities evaporated. “Now you see it, now you don’t.” Remember summer associate classes, when law students were wined and dined and offered jobs after graduation? Those days are pretty much a relic of the past. Some Biglaw firms and others cut out summer associate programs entirely in the depths of the financial crisis.  Offers to first-year associates were withdrawn, new lawyers couldn’t find jobs, but [law school debt](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/yes-going-to-law-school-during-the-great-recession-turned-out-to-be-a-terrible-idea/) had to be serviced.

3) A sea change in client attitudes about legal spend, doing more with less, becoming more efficient, hiring in-house. The result? The implosion and collapse of some Biglaw firms, firms that lawyers (and others) thought would withstand hard economic times. Do I need to name just a few or can you do that on your own?

4) A reduction in the number of people [applying to law school](https://www.ft.com/content/4ddb437e-9ace-11e6-8f9b-70e3cabccfae), whether straight from college or later on. Fewer people applied to law school, so law schools admitted more students than perhaps they should have. Lower admission standards, perhaps, and lower bar passage rates. Who in his or her right mind would go into debt in six figures to graduate, hopefully pass the bar, not always a given, and then not be able to find a lawyer job after going through all that hassle, and looking at repaying debt the size of a mortgage on a first home (given California prices, perhaps a mortgage on a garage)? The Great Recession hangover still exists for some law schools unable to cope.

Debate rages over whether law schools have “dumbed down” by admitting people not really qualified to be lawyers, at least based on test scores and grades, and then not passing the bar in sufficient numbers to satisfy the law schools and to keep up the reputation of the various schools. (Witness the dependence upon rankings such as provided by U.S. News and World Report.) Rank has its [privileges](https://www.waywordradio.org/rhip_1/), so to speak, and if law schools don’t make sufficient numbers, then they’re forced to become, in a sense, bottom feeders to keep the schools afloat.

5) As far back as 2011, Bill Henderson and others predicted that the impact of the 2008 recession was not just a blip on the legal landscape, but foretold [massive structural changes](http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/paradigm_shift) in the legal world. Client expectations were changing, non-legal providers started to populate the legal field, and those lawyers who didn’t understand how the profession was changing were out, or if not out, working at substantially reduced levels and for substantially less money. I don’t think anyone believes that the “good old days” will return, at least not during dinosaur lifetimes, and probably not ever again.

Indeed, one legal recruiter, in its 2018 industry outlook, says that, just like many other industries, the [legal profession is in a “new normal,”](https://www.mlaglobal.com/publications/articles/2018-industry-outlook) one that challenges traditional, old line ways of thinking and doing.

We lawyers are supposed to be able to tolerate ambiguity (two of our favorite words are “it depends”), but the continual uncertainty keeps the profession from any kind of a stable footing. The “new normal” is living in earthquake land (I should know); the ground shakes under your feet, you struggle to maintain your balance, and you never know when the next shake is coming.

So, do you remember when, as kids, we had to sit in the backseat of the family car?  We weren’t allowed to ride shotgun, at least not in my family. (This may well be more of a dinosaur memory than a millennial memory, but whatever.) If the trip took any time longer than what we thought was bearable and before we started beating up on each other, we’d whine and ask, “Are we there yet?”

The same holds true for the profession today. Sorting through the still smoldering wreckage of 2008 and the years that followed, the question remains the same. First, we have to figure out what “there” means, and I’m not sure that anyone knows that. Then we have to figure out how to get there. I don’t think a GPS knows any more than we do.

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for 40+ years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

# The Biglaw Salary Wars Increased First-Year Associate Salaries Across The Legal Profession
## Just how high did salaries climb?
By [Staci Zaretsky](https://abovethelaw.com/author/staci-zaretsky/)

The pandemic gave rise to a year of uncertainty across the legal profession, but one thing COVID didn’t bring crashing down were first-year associate salaries. We all know about the Biglaw salary wars, but according to a new report from the National Association for Law Placement, first-year associate salaries are actually up at all firms.

NALP’s 2023 Associate Salary Survey report notes that as of January 1, 2023, the median base salary for first-year associates was $200,000, which is up $35,000 from 2021, the last time this survey came out. Of the 694 responses received, 81% of them came from law firms of more than 250 lawyers.

Nikia L. Grey, NALP’s Executive Director, had this to say about the report:

“The past two years saw a red-hot recruiting market where associates scored multiple pay raises and commanded unprecedented leverage as firms desperately tried to add and retain lawyers. Although the market has since turned 180 degrees, the added pressure of the so-called talent wars at the time appears to have caused these pay increases to cascade throughout the market at an accelerated pace. While normally it takes the highly publicized raises at the largest firms two or more years to move through the market, NALP’s latest Associate Salary Survey shows that salaries increased dramatically across the industry, regardless of firm size or location.”

$215K may now be the most common starting salary — after the salary wars of 2022, where firms of more than 700 lawyers doled out $10,000 raises from the prior $205,000 base — but not all firms were able to bump their first-years to such salary heights. As it turns out, the greatest percentage salary growth was seen at firms of 100 lawyers or fewer, where median first-year salaries increased by 29.2%, from $120,000 in 2021 to $155,000 in 2023. At firms of 501-700 lawyers, base salaries for first-years grew by $45,000, from $155,000 in 2021 to $200,000 in 2023.

NALP had some interesting location-based information on salaries:

- Geography continues to have a considerable impact on salary differences across regions, cities, and states. This year’s report contains analyses for 26 individual cities, as well as additional states and regions not encompassed by those cities. These analyses reveal a wide spectrum of law firm compensation, with median first-year salaries by city ranging from $145,000 to $215,000.
- Eleven cities now have a median starting salary of $215,000: Austin, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles/Orange County, New York City, San Diego, San Francisco, Silicon Valley, and the Washington, DC area.
- NALP’s analyses also include regional salary data for locations outside of the 26 individual cities included in the report. Starting salaries of $215,000 are found far less frequently in offices in these smaller U.S. cities and towns. For locations outside of the 26 major cities included in the report, the highest median first year associate base salary was in the Northeast ($170,000), followed by the Midwest and West, both at $165,000. The lowest salaries were in the South, with a median first-year salary of $135,000.
Now that the market is in a bit of rough territory, with layoffs happening all too frequently, should associates be expecting another raise any time soon? We saw salary increases in [2021](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/salary-wars-scorecard-tracker-2021/) and [2022](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-raise-tracker-2022/), so things may remain quiet for a while on the compensation front. Check back in sometime in 2024 or 2025, and we may have more exciting salary news to report.

# The Ideal Partnership: Combining AI And Lawyer Expertise
## AI is far from infallible. How you guide AI-driven workflows, monitor AI’s performance, evaluate its output, and make all final decisions in legal matters is critical.

When I wake up, Siri gives me the day’s weather forecast, and I plan my outfits and activities accordingly. One day, while browsing online, I saw a golf club I’d been eyeing for a while. Before I scrolling away, a notification told me its price had dropped significantly. Thanks to this, I saved money and felt more confident about my purchase.

AI-driven technologies seamlessly integrate into our lives, offering relevant information and recommendations that help us make wiser daily decisions. 

Legal departments can now harness the same power of AI. Lawyers fill a central role that evolves as a department’s use of AI matures. Because AI is far from infallible, how you guide AI-driven workflows, monitor AI’s performance, evaluate its output, and make all final decisions in legal matters is critical.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Foundational AI Tools Support Traditional Legal Processes

In-house lawyers are overwhelmed with legal requests, contracts, regulatory requirements, and more contracts. All these areas are where foundational AI tools can shine under your careful direction. This is how AI becomes your supportive ally at the initial adoption stage, with foundational tools complementing and enhancing traditional legal processes. 

For example, legal research tools like Westlaw Edge can quickly analyze vast amounts of case law and statutes. Pinpointing relevant precedents and tailoring legal insights to specific situations saves time and provides higher levels of accuracy and consistency in legal analysis than humanly possible.

Other examples include standardized, automated contract templates and intake forms that minimize human error and ensure every document adheres to established standards. As a result, contract uniformity streamlines workflows and enhances reliability across the organization. Other foundational AI tools can review contracts for potential risks, inconsistencies, and missing clauses, and also make recommendations based on company policies, best practices, and industry standards.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Risks Involve Over-Reliance On AI And Data Quality

However, blindly accepting AI outputs and recommendations without human analysis can lead to inaccurate legal advice and misinformed decisions. Stay mindful that a risk of errors or biases is always possible in the algorithms that power AI systems, making it vital to validate and verify their outputs.

Also, be vigilant about data quality and reliability. Know where AI derives data and ensure its sources are unbiased, accurate, and reputable. Potential biases in AI training data can negatively influence AI decision-making processes. Thoroughly vet data sources to mitigate the risk of relying on flawed or misleading information.

Test, Validate, Verify, And Focus On Accountability

AI can suggest, recommend, or advise, but the ultimate responsibility for legal decisions rests squarely on your human shoulders. AI is a tool to enhance your decision-making processes, not one that replaces your legal analysis and reasoning. From the foundational stage of AI adoption forward, you must exercise your professional judgment and legal expertise to critically evaluate AI outputs, keeping legal and ethical obligations in mind.

Regularly compare the accuracy of AI-generated insights with results from traditional methods to evaluate an AI system’s effectiveness and assess its strengths and limitations. Also, consider quantifying the time saved in routine legal tasks after integrating AI to tangibly measure AI’s benefits. A data-driven approach helps to inform future decisions on technology integration and resource allocation.

Just as Siri and other AI-driven technologies have transformed our personal lives by providing relevant information and recommendations, the same can be true for AI systems and in-house lawyers. Embracing foundational AI technologies helps enhance your department’s productivity, accuracy, and decision-making capabilities. The future of law lies in harnessing AI to drive innovation and efficiency, ultimately benefiting legal professionals and the organizations they serve. We can all work better together when everyone knows whether to stay inside out of the rain or make hay while the sun shines.

# The Biglaw Firms Doing Trump's Election Bidding

Hmmm, working to undermine the peaceful transition of power that has characterized the American democracy since Washington is not why *I* went to law school, but YMMV.

Listen, I know behind every modern election there’s a team of lawyers waiting to forward their interpretation of a hanging chad (and Lennon Parham was glorious in that role, FYI), but this year’s different. We have a president that won’t commit to accepting the election results and, hell, yesterday’s New York Times front page story was [Trump Escalates Push To Erode Trust In Election](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/01/nytfrontpage/scan.pdf). So… yeah, if American democracy somehow survives 2020, working on behalf of undermining the election process may not have the same glow as[ working on Bush v. Gore did](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/of-course-amy-coney-barrett-worked-on-bush-v-gore/?rf=1) for the previous generation of GOP lawyers. And even noted GOP election lawyer Benjamin Ginsberg[ has come out and said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/08/republicans-have-insufficient-evidence-call-elections-rigged-fraudulent/) this is a terrible look for Republicans:

“The president’s words make his and the Republican Party’s rhetoric look less like sincere concern — and more like transactional hypocrisy designed to provide an electoral advantage.”

But the lawyers for the Trump campaign have been hired. And the same way we call attention to the[ good work Biglaw does](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-firms-latest-racial-equality-work/), we have to call out the, erm, more embarrassing work too.

[Politico has the details](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/27/trump-legal-network-election-day-fight-422035) on the firms working on the election for Trump:

Most Republican attorneys are being tapped from a trio of law firms: Consovoy McCarthy, which defended Trump in his effort to stop Congress and New York prosecutors from receiving his financial records; Jones Day, which has raked in millions from the Trump campaign since before the 2016 election; and King and Spalding, which once employed FBI Director Christopher Wray.

[Consovoy McCarthy ](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/consovoy-mccarthy-pllc/)is a litigation boutique firm that was started in 2014 and made a name for itself in conservative circle by[ challenging Harvard’s affirmative action policies](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/asian-americans-v-harvard-a-closer-look/). And Jones Day, well, you know Jones Day. The firm was home to former White House Counsel Don McGahn. The Trump campaign [reportedly took new work away from the firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/trump-fires-jones-day-to-stick-it-to-don-mcgahn-for-being-vaguely-competent/) when the presidents relationship with McGahn soured, but currently finds themselves in the middle of election work. King & Spalding has picked up a number of lawyers who once worked for the Trump administration like Sally Yates, Rod Rosenstein, and Dan Coats. But they also have lawyers that’ve been critical of the Trump administration, like Sally Yates, Rod Rosenstein and Dan Coats.

But whatever the reason for getting involved in election legal work on behalf of the president, this kind of notoriety undoubtedly doesn’t sit well with lots of folks the firms may want to recruit.

# Boies Schiller Restructuring Continues With New Deputy Chair

Natasha Harrison

There were a pair of stories about Boies Schiller Flexner yesterday and one of them received considerably more media attention than the other. The Wall Street Journal reported that Nick Gravante Jr., one of BSF’s two co-managing partners through the firm’s recent restructuring, would join Cadwalader, adding his name to the ranks of BSF’s mounting partner departures. And while that’s understandably newsworthy, it sort of crowded out BSF’s announcement that [Natasha Harrison](https://www.bsfllp.com/lawyers/natasha-harrison.html), Gravante’s co-managing partner, would step up to become the firm’s deputy chair and heir apparent to David Boies as chair.

Unfortunately, Gravante’s departure was bound to get more attention when a partner who has publicly voiced a Keep Calm and Carry On message as media outlets fretted that BSF’s partner defections were a sign of impending doom. When one of the people behind the firm’s restructuring strategy opts out, isn’t that further proof that the strategy is in trouble?

A convenient narrative and certainly an easy one to tell, but maybe not the accurate one.

When I got a chance to ask Gravante about the move directly, he was quick to point out that his decision to move had nothing to do with a lack of faith in BSF or its future as much as a recognition that his book of business was better served with a full-service firm as opposed to a litigation-centric outfit. “David [Boies] and I have had discussions about the best platform for my business for quite a while…. in fact, David was the one who suggested Cadwalader to me.”

That answer actually tracks my general sense of the BSF changes. While a lot of people see trouble in the exits — and losing significant books of business is never great — I wrote back in April that my sense of the massive movement was that the firm had signaled internally that it would chart a path where attorneys with business litigation portfolios that fit within the confines of traditional Biglaw firms would [seize the opportunity to decamp for those platforms](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/everyone-seems-to-be-overreacting-to-these-boies-schiller-departures/), while those with business that benefits from a laser-focused litigation shop are staying.

Would BSF be better off if it had decided to embrace a full-service model? Maybe? Maybe not. These are questions above my pay grade. Boies acknowledges that there are arguments to be made either way. “There’s no doubt that there are advantages of that model. We think there are advantages to our litigation model too. There are advantages to having a broad set of practices that can hopefully be synergistic. There are advantages in a litigation-only model in not having conflicts and perhaps having more collegiality. It’s a choice. They’re different kinds of firms.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Natasha Harrison, who has [spent her 2020 pandemic pulling up stakes and moving from London to the United States to manage the BSF retooling](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/business/natasha-harrison-the-lawyer-from-croydon-shaking-up-manhattans-boies-schiller-2lbvhc3m3), embodies the philosophy the firm is adopting. “What attracted me was not being an accessory to a transactional department. That was incredibly attractive to me and other lateral hires as well.” She also noted that, with clients increasingly unpacking their legal spend and choosing different firms for different matters, the firm sees a strategic advantage to its litigation-centric approach.

That a woman’s elevation to what is, functionally, the top perch of a major law firm got overshadowed in the day’s news is unfortunate. Over at our columnist David Lat’s new Substack, [Original Jurisdiction](https://davidlat.substack.com/p/whats-going-on-at-boies-schiller), he talks to Boies about the “admittedly messy and drawn-out leadership transition” and the firm’s ultimate realization that it would coalesce around Harrison’s leadership:

Over the course of the last year, Natasha has really distinguished herself as a leader. We have had a number of very talented people in leadership roles in recent years. But you have to pick the best, and there was a real consensus in the Executive Committee that we should elevate Natasha to deputy chair, with the expectation that she would succeed me at some point.

With Harrison moving to deputy chair and Gravante moving to Cadwalader, the firm will now look to elevate three partners to the co-managing partner role recognizing that everyone is maintaining busy practices and that there’s more than enough management work to go around.

There are going to be voices who think the firm should have remained the big tent of talent it became over the course of its rapid growth. Others who will think it needed to excise some of its practices to become a corporate trial work firm. Others who wish it would build itself out to a full-service firm. And still others who embrace the current sorting that doubles down on fewer offices and an opportunistic litigation practice that’s equally at home defending a big corporation as it is [pursuing a class action against major insurers](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/blue-cross-blue-shield-plans-to-settle-for-2-7b-and-thats-not-the-most-important-relief/). It’s a testament to the firm that it might well have thrived going down any of those paths. But choices had to be made eventually, and this is the path the firm’s chosen and that’s going to mean a lot of people leave.

# No. 1 Biglaw Firm In The Country To Represent Apple In Government's Antitrust Suit
## The partners on this case are at the top of their game. Will they secure a win big for the top tech company?

Late last week, the Department of Justice filed a landmark suit against Apple, accusing the tech giant of creating a monopoly within the smartphone market. Word now comes that the top tech company has hired a top firm to defend itself against these antitrust claims — and it’s not just a top firm, but it’s the No. 1 firm in the Am Law 100 and the No. 1 firm the world: Kirkland & Ellis.

[Corporate Counsel](https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/2024/03/22/kirkland-ellis-to-represent-apple-in-landmark-antitrust-lawsuit/) has additional details on the partners who will be staffing the case:

Representing Apple in the case will be litigation partners Craig Primis, Devora Allon and Winn Allen, along with antitrust partner Matt Reilly.

Primis was among the recipients of The American Lawyer’s 2023 Litigator of the Year Award, in recognition of a range of achievements, including successfully defending UnitedHealth Group against a DOJ antitrust challenge to its $13 billion acquisition of Change Healthcare.

Among Allon’s recent successes was securing a favorable verdict for Gilead Sciences in a high-stakes antitrust trial over allegations it colluded with Teva Pharmaceuticals to unfairly inflate the price for two key HIV drugs.

Reilly brings deep regulatory experience. He spent 13 years at the Federal Trade Commission and is the former head of its Mergers IV division, where he led challenges and investigations in such industries as health care, retail and consumer products.

Apple claims that the government’s suit is both “wrong on the facts and the law.” Best of luck to the illustrious team at Kirkland as they attempt to get Apple out of this muddied antitrust morass.

# Outside Counsel Guidelines Continue To Be Productivity Drain
## Firms are wasting time on meaningless make work.

Aderant just released its [2021 Law Firm Leader Survey on Outside Counsel Guidelines](https://hubs.ly/H0VpXBF0) and while the whole report is worth checking out, the outside counsel guideline issue can be summed up in one short list:

The top five challenges respondent firms faced when managing outside counsel guidelines were:
#1 – Clients use them as a method to delay payment
#2 – They’re getting too complex
#3 – TLDR (Too long, too much info, didn’t read)
#4 – Clients change the rules and billing guidelines without telling you
#5 – We are losing revenue while we try to comply

These are features not bugs of the outside counsel guideline process. In-house lawyers will act like their [arcane guidelines](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/2019/12/10/in-house-counsel-make-increasingly-arcane-billing-demands-and-its-costing-firms-money/) — rules that require firms to deploy an entirely different vocabulary to perform the same task for two different clients — are key to effective bookkeeping, but no one honestly believes that. Back in 2019, [81 percent of clients reported using outside client guidelines as a tool for controlling costs](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/2019/12/10/in-house-counsel-make-increasingly-arcane-billing-demands-and-its-costing-firms-money/) so there’s no confusion over what’s going on — it’s make work for attorneys.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And maybe this is the price the legal industry must pay for years of billing process neglect. In a bygone era, law firms got away with billing to “further work” and clients kept uncritically footing the bill. The balance of power needed to be tipped back toward the client somehow. But this feels like a massive overcorrection.

While grappling with these challenges, it is not surprising that nearly two-thirds of clients have pushed back on guidelines. Additionally, 37% of firms said OGCs make it more difficult for the firm to communicate with clients.

Firms surveyed used a variety of methods to deliver OCGs to their lawyers, though the disappointing truth is that only 32% indicated
that more than half of their lawyers know the guidelines for their matters.

Guidelines aren’t effective if the firm can’t follow them. They’re also not producing reliable data for benchmarking when they’re so complex that outside counsel is just as willing to write off the work as fuss with logging it correctly. At the end of the day, these “billing bibles” are just ploys to make it harder for law firms to get paid.

When asked what they would like to see improve with OCG compliance, billing, and eBilling at their firm, the top two answers were:

#1 – Better technology for law firms in order to comply, and
#2 – More law firm visibility into what the corporate legal department really wants.

From a technology standpoint, there has been an expanding number of solutions developed in recent years to address guidelines and compliance challenges. Several survey respondents commented that they needed more than just one piece of software to assist them with the many faces of OCG compliance. Modern systems comprehensively integrate time entry, billing, and OCG compliance which will be an immense help to firms. More legal administrators are finding systems to help cure many of the OCG compliance afflictions mentioned in the survey.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
I’ve admittedly been impressed by some of the solutions out there to help law firms automatically comply with increasingly complex guidelines, but when firms need “more than just one piece of software” just to get their bills paid, there’s a problem.

I don’t know what the answer is, but something needs to happen. There must be a better way to control outside counsel spend besides “make the process more onerous for everyone involved” and the fact that we’ve gotten to this point is a great example of why lawyers can’t have nice things.

Oral argument can be one of the most stressful tasks a lawyer routinely performs in the course of their work as an attorney. It is hard to predict what judges might ask during oral argument, and lawyers might think they will mess up and not know an answer if they are asked something unpredictable by a court. In addition, oral argument is usually attended by other attorneys and sometimes clients, and lawyers naturally want to perform well in front of others. Some lawyers go to great lengths to prepare for oral argument, and many times, this effort is not needed.

I have worked for numerous lawyers throughout my career who overprepared for oral argument in intense ways. For instance, as an associate in Biglaw, I worked for an attorney who was arguing an appeal. The partner asked a bunch of associates to print each and every case and other authority cited in all of the appellate briefs and compile them in binders. Then, the associates had to bring the dozen or so binders of authorities to oral argument so that the partner could consult a case or other authority if needed during the proceeding.

This was a huge undertaking. It took a handful of associates the better part of a day to print out all of the authorities, three-hole punch the pages, and compile them in binders with tabs. We even had to draft a table of authorities so that you could tell which cases were in each of the binders. It was very difficult to bring the binders to oral argument. We all took public transit to the courthouse, but the courthouse was a little under a mile from the train. We needed to carry the binders to the court from the train, and we needed to make frequent stops along the way to rest our arms.

During oral argument, the partner did not consult any of the binders a single time. I am not sure how the partner would be able to consult the binders during oral argument, since the proceeding was extremely fast-paced, and I doubt the judges would have appreciated a lawyer taking the time to flip through and read any of the authorities. After oral arguments, I wanted to just throw the binders away, but the partner said we couldn’t leave attorney work product behind, so we had to schlep the binders back to the office to my great annoyance and that of my fellow associates. Perhaps the partner felt more secure knowing that he had all of these resources at his disposal during oral argument. However, associates should not need to spend so much time and effort lugging documents around that would have almost no practical use during oral argument.

In my own career, I have also overprepared for oral argument. Once, I had a big oral argument, and I asked a colleague what I should do to prepare since this colleague recently had a major victory after oral argument. This colleague told me that I should prepare a kind of script with my opening thoughts and perhaps script answers to a few questions I was pretty sure I would get. If I stumbled during the oral argument, I could just consult this script and get my footing back in no time.

I spent a considerable amount of time on my script so that I could recite everything offhand very easily. I practiced my script at all times of the day, including when I was in the car or in the shower, which might have scared people who thought I was talking to myself. I had the script right next to the camera on my iPad so that I could read from it if necessary during the virtual hearing without it looking too much like I was reading from prepared remarks.

However, I did not consult the script at any point during oral argument, and I never used any of my prepared remarks during oral argument. The court focused on issues I did not think would be too important to the oral arguments, and I had to make up remarks on the fly and answer questions for which I had not prepared during oral arguments. Of course, the oral argument went fine, and I was not limited by not preparing for the issues that were queried by the court. Sure, the preparations had made me more confident for the oral argument, but in hindsight, I wish I did not spend so much time preparing for oral argument when most of the preparations were not needed.

All told, it is important to prepare for oral arguments by reviewing relevant materials and refreshing yourself on the facts related to a case. However, there is usually no need to overprepare for oral argument in any extreme way.

Partner: “There’s no reason for me to waste time explaining the project if you don’t have time to do it.”

Associate: “I may be able to squeeze in something, but I just need a few details. What’s the project?”

Here’s the translation of that evasion:

Partner: “Do you have time?”

Associate: “It depends on whether the project is a good one. If you need me to argue a case in the Supreme Court, then I have time. If you need me to review documents, then I don’t have time. I’m not going to commit until I know what the project is.”

Here’s a conversation you’ll overhear in-house:

“Can you take a look at what I’ve drafted?”

“What is it? What are you planning to do with it?”

“Why does that matter? I’m just asking you to review something, if you have time.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Here’s the translation of that evasion:

“Can you take a look at what I’ve drafted?”

“Shoot! If this really matters, and I should help, then of course I can take a look. But it’s more likely this is some silly project that will never see the light of day, and I’d be wasting my time. Not only that, if I take a couple of minutes and look at the damn thing, then this person will later say, ‘But I had Jarndyce look at the draft; Jarndyce said this was perfect.’ Then I’ll get blamed for any mistakes in the thing, even though it’s meaningless, I didn’t spend much time on it, and I didn’t want to look at it in the first place.”

Here’s something you can infer:

Under ordinary circumstances, if you’ve been working at your law firm for a couple of years or more, and you routinely don’t have enough work to do, then you’re a bad lawyer.

That’s terribly unfair! Why infer that?

Under ordinary circumstances –- if we’re not in the midst of a Great Recession, and there’s no pandemic that keeps people from taking depositions — the firm has plenty of work. If you’ve been at your firm for a couple of years, then you have a reputation; people in the firm know whether you’re good or bad. If partners at the firm thought you were good, you’d be swamped with work. There are never enough good associates. If partners are not seeking you out to do work, it’s because everyone knows that you’re no good. Thus: If the times are ordinary, and if you’ve been at the firm for a while, and if you still have no work, then you’re a bad lawyer.

I know that you’re outraged; you think you’re good!

Don’t be deceived.

Everyone thinks they’re good. Most people are wrong. If you’re working at a reasonably good law firm, then the firm is forming a relatively accurate judgment: If you’re good, you’re terribly busy. If you’re always scrambling to find work, then you’re no good. (I’m sorry about that, but someone had to tell you.)

Here’s the corollary to my rule: As a partner, when you’re looking for associate help, never call the head of another office and ask for help. The head of the office will be looking for an associate who has time to spare, to occupy that time and improve the office’s numbers. From your perspective, that’s bureaucratic nonsense. You don’t care about whether some distant office has decent numbers; you want an associate who’s worth a damn. The associates with time to spare are terrible; the good associates are frantically busy. Thus: Call a partner you trust in the relevant office and ask for the names of good associates. Call one of those good associates directly and explain that you have a great project that the associate would love to help with. (The associate, after all, doesn’t have time to review documents for you, but the associate does have time to do a Supreme Court argument for you.) That’s how you get good lawyers — and not the bad lawyers who have extra time — to work on your matters.

(Yeah, yeah: This breaks all of the firm’s rules. The firm requires you to talk to the head of the office, who will then ensure that all associates in the office are equally busy. Follow those rules — if you want to spend your time rewriting briefs and don’t care about the quality of your client’s representation.)

I interview [Amanda Wolfman](https://www.nge.com/Our-Lawyers/Amanda-Wolfman), counsel at Neal Gerber & Eisenberg, who shares her career transition from social work to law and advocates for diversity, equity, and inclusion within the legal field. From her experiences at various law firms, she emphasizes the importance of problem-solving skills and having these values ingrained in all facets of a firm’s operations for it to be impactful. She also shares some career highs and lows and the satisfaction derived from solving clients’ problems.



The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

# The Biglaw Firm That's Raking In The Big Bucks Thanks To The Pandemic
## The firm has taken in almost $100 million from its bankruptcy work.

While other law firms have been conducting austerity measures thanks to the coronavirus, one Biglaw firm has been busying itself by making bank off the pandemic that’s been bringing its competitors nothing but pain.

Kirkland & Ellis, perhaps better known as the $4 billion firm, has already raked in almost $100 million thanks to its booming bankruptcy practice. How did they do it? Kirkland is outbilling its peers by representing 11 of the 24 large, public companies that have filed for bankruptcy thus far in 2020 — while no other firm has represented more than three. As reported by [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/kirklands-bankruptcy-business-out-billing-peers-during-pandemic), the firm’s investment in this practice area has proven to be prudent:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Early results show Big Law competitors have so far been unable to topple Kirkland for what are often the most lucrative bankruptcy assignments: representing large, indebted companies negotiating a reprieve from creditors. Kirkland’s clientele includes brand name retailers such as J.C. Penney, Neiman Marcus, Pier 1 Imports, and Stage Stores.

“There’s a widely held perception that Kirkland has one of the best restructuring practices in the world,” said Kent Zimmermann, a consultant for law firms at the Zeughauser Group. “It’s another example of how it can really pay off to pick your spots and be among the best in chosen areas of focus. That’s what you’re seeing at Kirkland.”

Thus far, Kirkland has taken in more than $94 million related to those cases (and this amount doesn’t even include the firm’s representation of J.C. Penney and Intelstat, for which K&E has yet to report its early earnings). Given the pace of this year’s filings, we’re sure there’s more revenue to be made for Kirkland:

The 12 filings in May doubled the number of filings from January through April. And the 24 filings through five months this year are just one shy of the 25 large public company bankruptcies filed during all of 2019, according to [UCLA Professor Lynn] LoPucki’s bankruptcy database.

“This could be larger than either of the two earlier booms,” LoPucki said.

Kirkland & Ellis had a great 2019, but its 2020 could be even better thanks to all the distressed retailers and public companies that have been forced to file for bankruptcy due to COVID-19. Thanks to their bad luck, the firm will have a banner year.

# Stroock Partners, Associates Making The Best Of A Bad Situation Ahead Of Firm's Dissolution

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Our people are landing well. That is gratifying.

— Alan Klinger, Stroock & Stroock & Lavan’s former co-managing partner, in comments given to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/demise-147-year-old-stroock-is-boon-law-firm-rivals-2023-11-13/) on where the [soon-to-dissolve](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/stroock-to-dissolve-close-its-doors-after-nearly-150-years-in-business/) Biglaw firm’s partners and associates are headed in these troubled times for the firm. Klinger will be moving to Steptoe & Johnson, where he’ll lead its labor practice. Stroock discussed a merger with Steptoe last year, but those talks weren’t fruitful. As we [discussed](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/these-firms-are-feasting-on-stroocks-partners/) previously, former Stroock attorneys are headed to Crowell & Moring, Hogan Lovells, Steptoe & Johnson, Squire Patton Boggs, and Thompson Coburn, among other firms.

# Biglaw Firm Late On Rent -- To The Tune Of $3.7 Million -- According To Landlord
## The firm insists it is in fine financial shape.

You don’t always think of Biglaw firms as “relatable,” but the coronavirus is weird like that. A Biglaw firm finds itself the defendant in a lawsuit over an issue a lot of folks feel right now — late rent.

According to the lawsuit, filed in Illinois, the Biglaw firm of Jenner & Block is behind on its rent for the firm’s Chicago office. Landlord Hart 353 North Clark LLC, affiliate of global real estate investment management firm Heitman LLC, said in a lawsuit filed May 20th in Cook County Circuit Court the firm owes $3,726,415.74, plus late fees and interest, for its 416,000+ square feet of office space.

But not so fast, the firm contends their lease provides an out. Randy Mehrberg, co-managing partner, [told Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/1276774/landlord-says-jenner-block-owes-3-7m-in-unpaid-rent) that the firm’s partners are availing themselves of a provision in their lease agreement that provides rent abatement if the space cannot be used as intended. And he assures everyone this rent dispute is not a harbinger of financial troubles for the firm:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“Our Chicago office lease includes a negotiated provision for rent abatement in the event of a situation, like the global pandemic, that renders the firm unable to use and occupy the space for its intended purpose. The firm has invoked that provision,” Randy Mehrberg, co-managing partner of Jenner & Block, said in a statement to Law360 on Tuesday.

“We have credited the landlord for the limited space we have been able to use for its intended purpose,” Mehrberg said. “Jenner & Block has a very strong financial position; this dispute is exclusively about the enforcement of that provision in the lease.”

In 2019, the firm made $448,005,000 in gross revenue, making it [87 on the Am Law 100 ranking](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=162&name=Jenner-%26-Block).

John M. Riccione of Taft Stettinius & Hollister LLP represents the landlord. He said the landlord is “committed to a proactive engagement with their partners and tenants to address any challenges constructively that have arisen from this crisis.”

# Elon Musk Disappointed To Learn His Own Legal Agreements Still Apply To Him

Somewhere within the bowels of Tesla, a lawyer still performs the unenviable task of reviewing Elon Musk’s tweets to make sure the mogul’s [openly antisemitic musings](https://newrepublic.com/post/172744/elon-musk-goes-full-antisemite-george-soros-dumps-tesla-shares) don’t veer into market manipulation. There are so many career paths for a juris doctor!

The screener is a condition of a consent decree that Musk voluntarily entered with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2018 after blasting to his sycophantic followers that he’d secured funding to take Tesla private at $420/share — because he’s so hilarious — creating a run on Tesla stock. As it happens, Musk did not have funding to take the company private and had just falsely told the market that he did while inflating the value of his stock holdings… which the SEC frowns upon. By agreeing to employ the screener and pay some fines, Musk escaped the full wrath of the market regulator.

Since then, Musk asked his followers if he should sell 10 percent of his Tesla shares, creating more market havoc. Last year, a federal court ruled that Musk had snuck this message past his Twitter nanny in violation of the agreement. Musk and his attorney Alex Spiro and the rest of the Quinn Emanuel team argued that the consent decree — that Musk entered voluntarily — amounts to prior restraint. Then, bizarrely, tossed in [an unconstitutional taking](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/elon-musk-settlement-agreement-as-unconstitutional-taking-is-a-theory/) claim wrapped up in the fact that Musk successfully beat back a shareholder case on the Animal House defense of “[you fucked up, you trusted [M]us[k]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCb3qrBpo&t=8s).”

It will shock you not at all to learn that the Second Circuit [did not embrace this theory](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/elon-musk-consent-decree-order-tweets/2/).

Musk’s argument that the consent decree is effectively a “prior restraint” on his speech does not change this conclusion. Parties entering into consent decrees may voluntarily waive their First Amendment and other rights. See SEC v. Romeril, 15 F.4th 166, 172 (2d Cir. 2021). Indeed, every consent decree by definition involves waiver of the right to trial, which saves the parties “the time, expense, and inevitable risk of litigation.” United States v. Armour & Co., 402 U.S. 673, 681 (1971). Had Musk wished to preserve his right to tweet without even limited internal oversight concerning certain Tesla-related topics, he had “the right to litigate and defend against the [SEC’s] charges” or to negotiate a different agreement—but he chose not to do so. Romeril, 15 F.4th at 172. Having made that choice, he may not use Rule 60 to collaterally re- open a final judgment merely because he has now changed his mind.3 We express no view as to the substance of his underlying First Amendment claims.

Because without honoring a party’s ability to waive a right, there would be no such thing as a settlement agreement. The whole endeavor rests on the idea that someone can give up something in exchange for the government’s leniency.

[Per AP](https://apnews.com/article/musk-sec-tesla-twitter-ruling-31bfb1c67e83645e87dd48b3df80fbd6):

Alex Spiro, an attorney for Musk, said in a statement: “We will seek further review and continue to bring attention to the important issue of the government constraint on speech.”

Musk can appeal to the full 2nd Circuit or to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The government constraint… that Musk voluntarily entered. How is this not getting through? Maybe an analogy is in order! See, there’s a Tesla attorney who’s forcibly subjected to the inane drivel and [racist rhetoric](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/elon-musk-racist-rhetoric-twitter-advertisers-1234710991/) Musk puts on Twitter that the rest of us mercifully get to skip over. But that doesn’t mean they have a case against the company for infliction of emotional distress… because they’re getting paid to be there. It’s like they’re agreeing to perform an unpleasant task in return for something that benefits them… much like avoiding a massive SEC enforcement action.

Still, it must suck when billionaires find out that those legally binding agreements you enter turn out to be legally binding. But then again, [Musk has to be getting used to this by now](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/twitter-complaint-demonstrates-that-every-lawyer-everywhere-always-is-smarter-than-elon-musk/).

# The Biglaw Firm Taking Disgraced Former Judge Kozinski To Dinner
## Did they forget about that whole sexual harassment thing?

Have you forgotten what retired federal judge Alex Kozinski was accused of? Because apparently Jenner & Block has.

Let’s back it up a minute, and walk through Kozinski’s fall from grace for those in the back. In 2017, [Kozinski retired](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/breaking-judge-kozinski-is-retiring/) (with [full benefits](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/senator-pissed-basically-nothing-bad-happens-to-retired-federal-judges-accused-of-sexual-harassment/)) amid a [sexual harassment scandal](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/judge-kozinski-accused-of-sexual-misconduct/) that rocked the legal world. While the jurist was [somewhat famous](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/more-women-acknowledge-judge-kozinskis-behavior-was-an-open-secret/) in legal circles for his bawdy sense of humor, the[ extent of the alleged harassment](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/more-yes-more-allegations-against-judge-kozinski-reading-them-will-make-you-feel-gross/) — asking women clerks to view pornography with him in his chambers, making inappropriate sexual comments, and verbal abuse heaped on females working in his chambers — was more hidden. However, the [Washington Post’s](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/prominent-appeals-court-judge-alex-kozinski-accused-of-sexual-misconduct/2017/12/08/1763e2b8-d913-11e7-a841-2066faf731ef_story.html) exposé on the judge sparked an avalanche of over a dozen women coming forward to share their problematic experiences with the judge.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
His retirement ended the official inquiry into his behavior, and [there were concerns](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/the-biglaw-partner-that-called-out-judge-kozinski/?rf=1) that those determining when and if Kozinski gets to come back into the fold of the legal world would be doing so without the benefit of a full investigation. And it looks like those concerns were well founded. Kozinski began his rehabilitation tour by [co-authoring an appellate brief](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/the-rehabilitation-of-disgraced-judge-kozinski-has-begun/?rf=1) in a prominent case. Now he’s getting taken out to dinner by a Biglaw firm.

As law school professor [and Kozinski accuser](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/more-yes-more-allegations-against-judge-kozinski-reading-them-will-make-you-feel-gross/) Leah Litman noted, the retired judge showed up at an Association of Business Trial Lawyers event, sitting at Jenner & Block’s table.

Apparently, at the Association of Business Trial Lawyers event last night in LA, [@JennerBlockLLP](https://twitter.com/JennerBlockLLP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) decided to have former Judge Kozinski at its table. (Kozinski resigned after he was accused of sexual misconduct by over ten women, including former clerks, a fellow judge, and me.)

— Leah Litman (@LeahLitman) [November 14, 2019](https://twitter.com/LeahLitman/status/1195081489626599424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

It’s an odd choice for the firm, whose Twitter account touts it as a “values-driven law firm” (as is repeatedly mentioned in the replies to Litman’s tweet). To be clear, this means the firm is comfortable having a man credibly and repeatedly accused of sexual misconduct as their guest. That has to feel shitty if you’re a woman at the firm (or a law student thinking about working at Jenner) or just a person who cares about sexual harassment to know that your firm values the residual glitter of a once-noteworthy legal career over taking a principled stance on gender inequality.

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)
Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# The Firms That Are Losing The Battle In Biglaw's Salary Wars

It’s officially been more than one month since [Cravath announced its new $180K salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/?rf=1). More than 100 firms began falling over themselves to match the now-prevailing market salary scale. Other firms, however, have lagged behind, refusing to get on board with the new realities of the market, effectively thrusting themselves and their associates into a second-class salary tier.

Associates at these firms are clearly very unhappy, but at this point, what’s to be done? Aside from waiting to see if their firms will ever offer market compensation, their only other option is to get in touch with a headhunter who they trust and make an effort to lateral to any one of the hundred-plus firms that have decided to raise associate salaries.

These firms stand not only to lose Biglaw’s salary wars, but potentially hundreds of their associates and new recruits. Law school on-campus recruiting is right around the corner, and these firms are doing themselves a major disservice. Who in their right mind would want to take a summer associate position at a firm that’s paying less-than market salary?

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
There are still hundreds of top-ranked firms that have refused to budge on associate salaries, but today, we’ll take a look at the few, the proud (for no reason, since they’re now offering subpar salaries to their employees), the firms with profits per partner of more than $900K to over $1 million that have failed to raise salaries.

It’s high time that partners at these firms spread the wealth. At this point, their refusal to step up their associate salaries is only solidifying their firms’ new home in the depths of shame and embarrassment. Pay your associates fairly now, or pay the price later.

The choice is up to you. Choose wisely, because your law firm’s fate depends on it.

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Don't Feel Guilty Taking Time Off Next Week
## Attorney burnout is a huge problem in the legal profession.

‘Come on, Judge, it’s nap time over here!’

The holiday season is by now completely upon us as everyone is preparing to attend celebrations and winding down their operations before the new year. For some lawyers, the holidays can be a busy time, as many law firms try to get invoices paid before the end of the year and finish other tasks that might need to be completed in 2022. In addition, associates who need to bill a certain number of hours in a calendar year may also be busy fulfilling expectations firms may have of them. However, attorneys should not feel obligated to complete tasks around the holidays if they can avoid it, and lawyers should not feel guilty if they take at least some time off next week to relax and recharge before the new year.

Perhaps one of the biggest reasons not to feel guilty about taking time off next week is that many courts are in recess during this time. Numerous courts realize that litigants and attorneys are not available during the last week of the year, and a number of courts are closed to give judicial officers a well-needed break. If the courts are closed, for many lawyers, it is easy to justify taking some time off. When courts are closed, there is less of a reason to be on the grid since there are not court appearances that require the physical or even virtual presence of an attorney.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In addition, some courts have not scheduled motion days during the last week of the year, and at least one court in which I practice is not permitting litigants to make motions returnable during the last week of 2022. If there are no motion days during the holidays, there are fewer papers that need to be prepared, and accordingly, less work that needs to be completed during this time. As a result, attorneys likely do not need to be close to computers, scanners, and printers in order to prepare papers during this time of year.

Another solid reason not to feel guilty about taking off during this time of year is that many bosses will also be off during this period. It is usually really difficult to take time off as a lawyer. Attorneys oftentimes cannot predict when they will be busy and when they will be slow, and this makes it difficult to take designated time off. Personally, I have taken time off on multiple occasions only to be bombarded with unpredictable work while I was away, and the fear that this might occur in the future definitely motivates me not to take time off if I can avoid it.

However, it is well-established in the legal industry that the best time to take time off is during the last week or so of the year. Basically, a holiday truce descends upon the legal profession, and everyone resolves to take time off during this time. Accordingly, many bosses take the last week or so off during the year, or at least this was the case at many of the law firms at which I worked. Indeed, I have ample memories of my time as an associate attorney walking the halls of my law firm’s office and seeing the vacant offices, wondering why I was in the office when all of the brass was gone. As the old saying goes, when the cat is away, the mice will play, and if bosses take time off, associates and staff should feel emboldened to take time off as well.

Perhaps the biggest reason why you shouldn’t feel guilty about taking some time off next week is that resting and recharging your batteries is often important to producing good work after taking time off. Attorney burnout is a huge problem in the legal profession. We all know that being a lawyer is a really tough job, and it involves a lot of conflict and stress. Legal matters are often a zero-sum game, and this can create a lot of tension.

Taking some time off allows lawyers to recover. This can help attorneys bring a new kind of energy when they return to their duties after a break. As a result, lawyers can justify taking some time off so that they can be more productive in the new year.

All told, it is difficult for lawyers to take time off from work since lawyers might have a difficult time predicting when they will have less work to perform and we all have projects to complete. But for a variety of reasons, lawyers should not feel guilty if they take some time off next week for the holidays.

# Skadden Mandates Vaccines For All, Sidley Remains Mum On Vaccination But Pushes Back Reopening Date

The Delta variant is quickly turning law firms’ reopening plans on their heads. Many are pushing back the date of their proposed returns to the office, and even more (almost 40) are introducing vaccination mandates for all employees.

For reference, the following firms are requiring all employees to be vaccinated before they return to the office: [Akin Gump](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-will-require-employees-to-be-vaccinated-some-push-back-reopening-dates/?rf=1), [Arent Fox](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Ballard Spahr](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-heavy-hitters-add-vaccine-mandates-to-their-reopening-policies/), [Boies Schiller Flexner](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-heavy-hitters-add-vaccine-mandates-to-their-reopening-policies/), [Cleary Gottlieb](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-heavy-hitters-add-vaccine-mandates-to-their-reopening-policies/), [Clifford Chance](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/elite-firm-will-require-vaccination-but-other-reopening-policies-are-very-flexible/), [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/top-20-biglaw-firm-wont-make-lawyers-return-to-office-in-2021-but-vaccines-will-be-required/), [Cozen O’Connor](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-firms-continue-to-roll-out-vaccine-mandates-delay-reopenings/), [Crowell & Moring](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-will-require-employees-to-be-vaccinated-some-push-back-reopening-dates/?rf=1), [Davis & Gilbert](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-heavy-hitters-add-vaccine-mandates-to-their-reopening-policies/), [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Davis Wright Tremaine](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/the-first-biglaw-firm-to-announce-a-covid-19-vaccination-plan/), [Debevoise & Plimpton](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-firms-continue-to-roll-out-vaccine-mandates-delay-reopenings/), [Dickinson Wright](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-firms-continue-to-roll-out-vaccine-mandates-delay-reopenings/), [Fenwick & West](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Fried Frank](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Goodwin](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-will-require-employees-to-be-vaccinated-some-push-back-reopening-dates/?rf=1), [Hanson Bridgett](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Hueston Hennigan](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Lowenstein Sandler](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/lowenstein-covid-vaccine/), [McDermott Will & Emery](https://abovethelaw.com/company/social-meteor/), [Mintz](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/unvaccinated-lawyers-will-not-be-allowed-to-enter-this-biglaw-firm/), [Norton Rose Fulbright](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/vaccine-mandates-are-trending-across-biglaw-firms/?rf=1), [Patterson Belknap](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/vaccine-mandates-are-trending-across-biglaw-firms/?rf=1), [Paul Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/paul-weiss-vaccine/), [Reed Smith](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Ropes & Gray](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/top-biglaw-firms-chair-beseeches-lawyers-staff-to-get-vaccinated/?rf=1), [Sanford Heisler](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/this-firm-will-require-lawyers-staff-to-be-vaccinated-before-returning-to-work-or-else/), [Schiff Hardin](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Seyfarth Shaw](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-firms-continue-to-roll-out-vaccine-mandates-delay-reopenings/), [Sheppard Mulllin](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-heavy-hitters-add-vaccine-mandates-to-their-reopening-policies/), [Simpson Thacher](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-delay-openings-lay-down-strong-vaccination-policies/?rf=1), [Stroock & Stroock & Lavan](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-firms-continue-to-roll-out-vaccine-mandates-delay-reopenings/), [Weil Gotshal](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/weil-reopening/), [Wilson Sonsini](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/wsgr-delays-opening-delta/), and [Winston & Strawn](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-delay-openings-lay-down-strong-vaccination-policies/?rf=1).

We can now add two more firms to that list. Skadden and Carlton Fields will now require employees to be vaccinated to return to the office. Sidley, on the other hand, has simply pushed off its full reopening date, and to our knowledge, hasn’t yet made a move on vaccinations. Clifford Chance, which had already required vaccines, will also be deferring its return-to-office plans.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

Yesterday, Sidley announced via email that the firm would be delaying its proposed return-to-office date to “no earlier than October 12.” The firm had originally planned to go back to the office right after Labor Day in September. While the firm has yet to embrace a vaccination mandate, 92% of U.S. employees report that they’ve already been fully vaccinated. Going forward, unvaccinated personnel who go to the office must wear masks. The firm continues on with its gradual and flexible return policy until mid-October.

Today, Clifford Chance announced to all U.S. employees via email that it would be pushing back its plans for a full reopening. The new target return-to-office date for the firm is sometime during the week of October 25, deferred from September 13.  If that date changes again, the firm will provide at least 30 days’ notice to all personnel. Clifford Chance previously announced a [vaccination mandate](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/elite-firm-will-require-vaccination-but-other-reopening-policies-are-very-flexible/) as part of its plans to return to the office.

When Skadden first announced its [reopening plans](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/skadden-reopening-plan/) — setting its sights on a September 13 return to its U.S. offices, with a hybrid work model that would include at least three days of in-office work — the firm did not require vaccinations. The firm announced earlier this week that it’s still planning to open its doors in mid-September, but will now require all employees (and clients, guests, and vendors) to be vaccinated to enter the office. About 90% of U.S. employees at the firm are fully vaccinated.

Last week, Carlton Fields notified all employees that they must be fully vaccinated to return to the office by October 4. More than 90% of attorneys at the firm have been fully vaccinated, but only 65% of staff have been vaccinated. “We are thrilled that so many have taken advantage of this opportunity, which is now readily available in our country. But we are very concerned that so many have not done so,” Gary Sasso, president and CEO of the firm, noted in his memo. Accordingly, effective August 9, the firm started its new policy of limiting office access only to those vaccinated.

Will your firm be changing its plans when it comes to vaccination for attorneys and staff thanks to the Delta variant? Please let us know.

(Flip the page to read the memos from Sidley, Clifford Chance, Skadden, and Carlton Fields.)

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to the office.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477.

# Trials And Tribulations
## To lose $1 billion may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose $2 billion looks like carelessness. The terms get progressively less sympathetic per each billion after that.

It’s always been tough trying to climb the partnership track or advance in an in-house legal department. And I think it’s about to get even tougher as employers take a harder look at whom to retain and whom to jettison. How to determine who makes the cut? A legal version of “The Squid Game,” perhaps, but [performance evaluations](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/biglaw-firms-are-trying-to-rightsize-their-ranks-through-tougher-performance-reviews/) are now going to be front and center and not for the first time. The firms say it’s a matter of “right-sizing,” that the rush to hire during the pandemic may have prompted the hiring of less-than-stellar candidates. Now, not wanting to use the term “layoff,” firms are turning the screws on associates by [ratcheting down on performance issues](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/senior-associates-in-high-demand-amid-staffing-scramble/). However, some associates are assets, rather than liabilities.

I have written about the [uselessness of performance evaluations](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/performance-evaluations-phooey/) before, especially when bad reviews come as a complete shock to the person being reviewed. No warning lights, no heads-up that something bad may be coming, the employee goes along thinking that she is performing to expectations or even exceeding them and then the evaluation grenade is thrown. Using performance evaluations as the way to “right-size” instead of saying what it truly is, a “layoff,” is disingenuous. Of course, firms don’t want to be known for laying off employees, so they facilely say that the decision to terminate an employee was “performance related,” thus skirting past the term “layoff.” You can put lipstick on a pig, but it’s still a pig.

Two trials are making headlines these days: one found defendant Samuel Bankman-Fried guilty as charged on all seven criminal fraud counts. If you had responsibility for billions and billions of dollars, wouldn’t you pay attention to that much money slipping from your fingers into the crypto netherworld? Wouldn’t you make sure that someone in your company knows how to track those cryptocurrencies so that they don’t just — Poof! — disappear?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Obviously, SBF didn’t think that was important, so he’s facing some serious time (as much as 115 years). It took the jury four hours to return its verdicts. Sometimes juries decide very quickly but want a defendant to sweat it out before returning to the courtroom. This [jury had a meal](https://dealbreaker.com/2023/11/that-didnt-take-long) first before getting to the business at hand that didn’t take very long.

Do you remember the [cryptocurrency ads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWMnbJJpeZc) that aired on the Super Bowl in 2022, especially the one with Larry David? In hindsight, it’s hilarious, except for those who invested in FTX. Ironically, in the commercial, David refuses to invest in FTX. Prescient?

The other trial is that of the Trump family and its businesses. After a certain point in Trump’s testimony, the court decided that it was better to let Trump’s speechifying roll on, without bowing to the normal courtroom procedures of questions asked (perhaps objected to) and answers provided in response to the questions asked. But then sometimes it’s better to let the defendant’s words hang him; give him enough rope to do so. It’s the old story of when you are standing in the hole you’re digging, to stop digging. Did the court [hand Trump a shovel](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/trump-shouts-at-judge-and-lawyers-in-wild-day-on-witness-stand?source=newsletter&item=read-text&region=digest) in this court trial?

Despite persistent bad news surrounding us, it’s time for an “I am not making this up” story. [Delaware taxpayers are on the hook for $50K](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/delaware-state-police-pay-50000-to-man-troopers-ticketed-for-flipping-them-off/) because some state troopers were pissed when a citizen argued his constitutional rights were violated. He held up a sign warning motorists about a speed trap and flipped off those troopers. Claiming that the troopers did their best to harass and inconvenience him, he had the last laugh to the tune of $50,000. But it’s the state’s taxpayers who are inconvenienced. What about them?

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Here’s just the first of many AI-related claims of ineffective assistance of counsel that are sure to come. California attorney David Kenner, who represents a number of hip hop clients, represented [Fugees rapper Pras Michel](https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/26/politics/pras-michel-trial-verdict/index.html), convicted in April on a number of federal charges. Michel’s new defense team, in its motion for new trial, contends that Kenner used AI to help craft his closing argument and that, according to the new defense team, [the AI used didn’t do a particularly good job](https://www.thedailybeast.com/david-kenner-star-hip-hop-lawyer-accused-of-using-ai-in-big-case-he-lost).   Does the AI used in this IAC (ineffective assistance of counsel) argument, have malpractice coverage? What’s the likelihood of that argument prevailing in the motion for new trial?

How can I resist another judicial faux pas arising, of course, from the use, or should I say, misuse of social media? The Ohio State Bar Association has initiated disciplinary proceedings against a probate judge for violation of state judicial conduct rules. He posted on Facebook in response to comments made by a family member in a case that the judge presided over. [The judge thought “whoops,” and deleted his comments](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/judges-facebook-posts-on-open-case-spur-disciplinary-complaint?source=newsletter&item=read-text&region=digest) shortly thereafter, (good that he recognized the error of his ways quickly) but it was TLTL. Isn’t it always?

And lastly, for all those who play Jeopardy, I have a final Jeopardy answer: [Nixon Peabody](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/nixon-peabody-donald-trump-managing-partner-step-down-demand/). What is the final Jeopardy question? And, no, the final Jeopardy question is not “WTF?”

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

# Idiot Biglaw Law Clerk Tries To Pick A Fight Over The Finer Points Of Contract Law Governing A Used West Elm Dresser

Every couple of years, there’s a lawyer who comes along and through sheer force of douchebaggery [makes all of us look bad](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/10/im-a-lawyer-threat-ends-in-internet-humiliation/). Now comes this anonymous law clerk — as in, not yet passed the bar — from a noted Biglaw firm. We’ll call him Legal Eaglet. The Eaglet was in the market for a used dresser and spotted the handsome number you see here — the West Elm Niche 4 Drawer Dresser in Chocolate — available on Craigslist. So he reached out to the seller — an investment banker who we’ll call Molly Merger — to make an offer.

We join the transaction, in true issue-spotter form, at the offer stage.

So his offer is:



One assumes that he really means “dollars” here, but in fairness, he’s not really all that precise with his lingo. Are we really going to have a meeting of the minds here?

Eaglet sent this email from his law firm address — complete with the boilerplate disclaimer footer — which is important because it comes up later. Why is he conducting personal business with his law firm address? The world collectively shrugs.

OK, can do

Molly seems game for the $300 price point.

On Mon, Jun 4, 2018 at 4:20 PM:

Great. Would you mind waiting for payment until Friday? I can either cut you a check (and you can wait to cash it until Friday) or I can Venmo you the money on Friday.

Now, wait just a goddamned minute. Where’s this “I’ll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today” routine coming from? That’s not part of the deal. Because, note, he’s not saying, “I’ll pick it up Friday and give you the money Friday,” he’s saying, “I’ll pick it up today and give you a post-dated check today.” Screw that.

Molly is more forgiving, though:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

Friday is fine. If someone comes along before Friday who’s willing to go above $300, I’ll let you know. Sound fair?

Yes, that does sound fair. Eaglet disagrees:

On Mon, Jun 4, 2018 at 4:38 PM:

Well, legally speaking, it’s too late for that because you already accepted my counteroffer, which formed a legally binding contract. If you had conditioned acceptance upon receiving payment, then you could accept a competing offer.

However, if you want to back out of the contract right now, I’ll do it out of the kindness of my heart. But, fair warning, I won’t agree to purchase it again.

You have 10 minutes to decide if you want to back out or not and respond to this email. If you do not, the contract remains in full force.

Very Best,
[Legal Eaglet]

Well, legally speaking, you’re a moron. Putting aside that there’s been no consideration or reliance at this point, buyers don’t have to preemptively protect themselves from you changing a deal after acceptance. The “meeting of the minds” was that you’d pay her $300 now and she’d give you the dresser now. Kicking the can down the road a week is what we’d consider a material change to the terms of the deal. Meaning your “offer” is now “I’ll pay you $300 on Friday” and her “acceptance” is “fine by me unless I get a better offer at which point I’ll throw in a right to match for the hell of it.”

Something that Molly probably understands because she’s probably been on a thousand more deals than you because she is, after all, a banker.

And “10 minutes to decide”? Did you learn that from Art of the Deal or something?

Sent: Monday, June 4, 2018 4:55 PM:

This is craigslist. Whoever gets there first, gets the item. I’m happy to sell it to you at $300, but I can’t accept a check, because there are a million scams on craigslist involving fraudulent checks – sorry.

If you want it, you’re welcome to come get it Friday and pay me cash or Venmo me.

THAT’S MORE THAN 10 MINUTES LATER! SORRY, LADY, YOU’RE OUT OF LUCK!

Seriously, this woman’s patience is unending. She went to the trouble of outlining exactly why “I’ll pay you a check you can cash it later” is a material adjustment to the deal. Obviously, at this point he saw the error of his ways.

Just kidding, he doubled down:

I hate to break it to you, but the law of contracts applies with equal force to transactions made on craigslist… as it does everywhere in the commercial world.

See generally Restatement (Third) of Craigslist.

Also, it’s interesting you would get into an argument about the law with someone who works for a law firm, as signified by the disclaimer at the bottom of my original email.

Oh ho ho! Here we go, people! Note he doesn’t say “with a lawyer,” but “with someone who works for a law firm” because this law clerk is as cognizant of his ethical obligations as he is ignorant of basic common sense. So… small miracles.

Of course, no hard feelings.

Of course not.

In any event, based on your comment “I’d be happy to sell it to you,” I’ll reasonably assume you accepted my offer to rescind the contract, meaning you are free to accept any offer from here on out. Best of luck.

Technically, she said, “I’m happy to sell it to you” but regardless, it’s not clear how this accepts an offer to rescind a contract. There was no contract! There wasn’t even a nascent contract once you changed the payment conditions to something the seller hadn’t anticipated.

The lesson, as always, is “never whip out the lawyer card when (a) you’re not a lawyer yet, (b) you’re just trying to be unnecessarily burdensome, or (c) you’re just wrong about the law.” When you’ve reached the unholy trifecta, then you really need to shut it down.

But Eaglet also committed the worst legal sin of all… you let the bankers be right. Never do that.

By the way, the West Elm dresser remains safely in the hands of Molly Merger. If you’re in the market for one, let her know.

And pay her on time.

# Climactic Changes In Law Mean New Opportunities For Librarians, Futurist Urges

Climactic changes in the business and practice of law mean new opportunities for law librarians to refine and distribute the knowledge that will be essential to law firms’ success.

That was the message legal analyst and futurist [Jordan Furlong](https://www.law21.ca/) delivered Saturday morning in Washington, D.C., in his keynote address at the 10th annual [PLLIP Summit](https://pllsummit.wordpress.com/), a meeting of private law librarians and information professionals that is the de facto kick-off of the [annual conference](https://www.aallnet.org/conference/) of the [American Association of Law Libraries](https://www.aallnet.org/).

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
In Furlong’s speech, “New Horizons, How Law Librarians and Legal Information Professionals Can Redefine Law Firms in the 21st Century,” he described a legal world that is undergoing climate change at a fundamental level.

This change is being driven, he said, by three key forces:

- Major shifts in legal spending by corporate clients, with them pushing firms harder on price and taking more work in-house.
- Massive increases in legal technology capacity and accessibility, changing from hours to minutes the time it takes to complete much of legal work.
- Regulatory changes that are accelerating the rise of alternative legal services providers, particularly with regard to private investment in legal services.
“It’s a brand new world,” Furlong said. “And it’s a world that law firms just weren’t built for.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As a result of these forces, legal work is being dispersed into two broad categories, Furlong said. There is complex legal work — that which is customized, intricate, and of high value — and there is commodity work — that which is straightforward, repeatable, and low-impact.

That commodity work “is sailing slowly but surely out of law firms,” Furlong said. It is migrating to new platforms and new providers, such as ALSPs, the Big Four accounting firms, and Biglaw spinoffs.

For law firms, that means they must adapt to what remains, which is the complex work. As they make that adaptation, they will increasingly need and rely on new resources, including a broader range of allied professionals and new business structures for delivering their services.

But the most critical resource, Furlong said, will be advisory knowledge.

“Law firms will still need great lawyers with leading-edge skills,” he said. “But they’ll also need embedded knowledge beyond any one lawyer’s individual capacity.”

As firms focus on this more complex work, three types of knowledge will be important to them:

- Deep client intelligence, to help firms develop competitive intelligence and also to help them better understand their own clients and where the firm should focus its efforts.
- Legal data and analytics. The emergence of data and analytics provides firms with tools they never had before. By 2030, he predicted, there will be categories of knowledge and information that we would not even imagine possible today.
- Embedded firm expertise. Not just knowledge management, but experience management. It’s not just the memo, find the person in the firm who wrote the memo. If you can leverage all that big brain and turn it into systems that can be deployed, you have a competitive advantage for the firm.
The Legal Knowledge Supply Chain

The need for this knowledge within firms will give rise to what Furlong described as the legal knowledge supply chain — the variety of personnel within a firm who help create that advisory knowledge. He divides these personnel into two functions:

- Data miners, including IT, operations, finance, practice groups, and business development.
- Data refiners, made up of law librarians and information professionals.
“Data doesn’t make decisions,” Furlong said. “It has to be pulled out and refined and turned into something that becomes actionable insight that lawyers can deploy for their clients.”

Herein is the law library’s opportunity, Furlong told the audience of roughly 250. It is to play a central role in building collaborative legal knowledge supply chains within their firms, and to position the law library as the refinery and distributor of advisory knowledge.

“With deep knowledge of clients and data, the law library can become a capital asset,” he said. “And law firms have very few capital assets.”

In this new legal market, knowledge really is power, Furlong said, and law librarians are uniquely situated to help their law firms tap into this power source. “This is your bailiwick, this is your world, where you live.”

Consider not just what should law librarians do, but what could they do, he urged the group.

“What should the knowledge function be in law firms as we move towards 2030?” he closed. “It’s an amazing opportunity.”

Bills?

We hate ’em.

We hate recording time. [We hate double-checking bills](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/01/inside-straight-entering-time/) before they go out the door. We hate reviewing bills after they come in the door. And we hate paying bills.

Nothing good about ’em.

Want something worse (or at least less reliable)?

Shadow bills.

Suppose we have an alternative fee agreement: The client pays a flat fee for the law firm to handle a specified set of cases.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Since there’s a flat fee, there’s no need to record time.

But both sides want time to be recorded anyway: The law firm wants to know its realization rate; how much is the firm actually being paid for each hour worked? The only way to calculate that is to record time.

And the corporation wants to know how it’s doing on the fixed-fee deal: Is the client doing better or worse paying the fixed fee instead of paying standard hourly rates? The only way to assess that is for the lawyers to record their time.

So the law firm maintains “shadow bills” — records that track time for accounting purposes, even though the resulting bills are never paid.

What could be wrong with that?

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Two things.

First: Everyone knows that shadow bills aren’t actually paid; they’re maintained only for internal accounting purposes. If there were ever a time to cheat (and, of course, there isn’t), this is it! The lawyer can “round up” — or worse — the hours that he or she worked, and thus achieve a billable-hour target, or just a higher number of hours billed, without doing any real harm. The client isn’t going to pay the bill, anyway, so no one is hurt. And if the internal accounting records — the firm’s calculation of its realization rate or the client’s assessment of the value of the fixed-fee deal — aren’t quite right, that’s a pretty small price to pay for you having met your target. If there were ever a place to press your foot a little heavy on the accelerator, shadow bills are it.

But that’s just the first problem with shadow bills.

There’s also a second: The partner who’s responsible for the shadow bills also knows that they’re never going to be paid.

Suppose the partner with the client relationship is a responsible person: The partner reviews every bill that she will actually ask the client to pay. For big bills, that’s a lot of effort. Many partners turn this over to “billing assistants” and figure that the partner personally will get involved only if there’s a dispute. But my hypothetical partner is more responsible than that: My partner actually reviews every bill (that will be paid) before it goes out the door.

What will that same partner do with shadow bills?

File ’em.

[Going through bills is a pain in the neck.](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/01/inside-straight-entering-time/) And cutting hours, because it took too long to perform a task, requires a little bit of thought. Why should the partner do that for bills that will never be paid, for heaven’s sake? This is just an accounting exercise; shadow bills can be filed away and later relied upon for whatever internal purpose the firm (or client) has in mind.

Think what that double-whammy does: These bills are already inflated, because they’re such a handy place to conceal hours that weren’t actually worked. And there’s no double-check — the billing partner’s sense of the time that should be spent on a task — because these bills don’t matter enough to be reviewed.

The end result is that shadow bills are inflated. The firm doesn’t have a true sense of its realization rate, and the client is never sure of how the alternative fee arrangement actually compares to a straight hourly rate.

Do I have a solution for this?

I do not. I can’t control deception or understandable lethargy.

But perhaps when firms or clients look at shadow bills, they should consider that those bills are probably a few percent too high; the actual time that would have been worked and charged if these were real bills is somewhat lower than the shadow bills suggest.

# Am Law 100 Firm Promised No Layoffs, So They're Offering Buyouts Instead

One by one, states are reopening and getting back to business, with law firms trying to figure out how to return to their offices amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Things are kind of getting back to “normal,” but if you thought that Biglaw firms were out of the woods when it comes to austerity measures, then you better think again.

[Back in April](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-biglaw-firms-rolling-out-good-news-for-now/), Fried Frank’s chairman, David Greenwald, said the firm had “no plans for layoffs or pay reductions in the immediate future.” It’s now mid-June, and Fried Frank, which came in at No. 56 in the most recent Am Law 100 rankings with $776,000,000 in gross revenue, is holding true to that promise — for the most part.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
As opposed to layoffs, furloughs, or pay cuts, Fried Frank is offering a voluntary buyout program to all eligible nonlawyers at the firm. Those who take a buyout will receive one week of salary for every year they have worked for the law firm, plus a lump sum. [Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/1282671/fried-frank-offers-to-buy-out-nonlawyers-amid-pandemic) (sub. req.) has the details:

The offer will be open to employees below the assistant director level that the firm characterizes as business services professionals, such as legal executive assistants and those working in information technology, marketing, recruiting and human resources units, according to Fried Frank. Eligibility for the program is based on years of service and the firm will have final approval of any requests.

The payouts will be capped at 24 weeks, to be paid as part of the regular payroll cycle, said firm spokesperson Alejandra Ramirez. Eligible employees will also receive a lump sum payment of $1,000 for every year they have worked with Fried Frank, along with a full year of medical benefits through the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, or COBRA, she said.

We wish all of the legal professionals at Fried Frank who accept and are approved for the buyout the best of luck should they seek new jobs in the legal industry.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# After 2 Down Years, This Biglaw Firm Is Turning It Around
## A definite improvement in the firm's financial health.

According to 2019 Biglaw [data collected by ALM](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/03/04/early-reports-the-2020-am-law-100200-firm-financials/), after two straight years of revenue declines, what Biglaw firm saw a 10.7 percent increase in revenue and a 6.8 percent growth in revenue per lawyer?

Hint: However, profitability (profits per equity partner) slipped again this year. But the firm’s managing partner characterized the firm’s financial performance as “very strong,” and a “validation” of the firm’s strategy.

See the answer on the next page.

# Biglaw Partner Accuses Firm Of 'Callous Gaslighting' In $20 Million Sexual Harassment Lawsuit
## The complaint alleges the firm protects harassers at the expense of victims.

Julia Rix, a former equity partner at the Polsinelli law firm, filed a blockbuster lawsuit against the firm and two senior partners, Gabriel Yomi Dabiri and Dov H. Scherzer, alleging she was the victim of pervasive sexual harassment over the course of her time at the firm. The complaint, available in full below, paints a picture of rampant harassment, indeed, Rix alleges she was “‘warned’ about the prevalence of sexual harassment of women at Polsinelli.” And details a “workplace rife with mistreatment and impropriety—and a culture indifferent to the ‘situation’ given this ‘tone at the top.'”

The complaint, filed September 15th in Washington, D.C., civil court, goes on to allege, “Polsinelli’s callous gaslighting of Rix in response to her claims of sexual harassment is shocking—but not surprising.” “Indeed, the firm’s leadership is well known among its employees for turning a blind eye to discriminatory treatment of protected personnel, condoning sexual harassment, and promoting individuals with few skills other than inappropriate workplace relationships to positions of power.”

Which is very different than the public image the firm cultivates:

In its sanctimonious marketing, the Firm describes itself as a paragon of professionalism and a model community. Indeed, the firm’s tagline is “[w]hat a law firm should be” and its homepage extolls the firm as an enterprise in “humanity, compassion, and true partnership.” In reality, when confronted, as it often is, with allegations of workplace abuse and discrimination, Polsinelli hides behind layers of confidentiality agreements and forced private dispute resolution provisions. The firm protects its leadership at the expense of victims and correcting the underlying issues.

Rix alleges that after she was hired by the firm, the defendant partners began making “unprofessional demands” of her. She says, “They employed bait-and-switch tactics, promising Rix the chance to discuss case strategy or client development—only to use the ensuing meeting as an opportunity to harass her.”

Over nearly two years at Polsinelli, Rix was repeatedly hounded by the older senior partners to join them for after-hours drinks, hotel “meetings,” and forced to endure salacious comments about her appearance. In fact, two older, married partners insisted on late-night rendezvous, communicated their sexual interest in her, and forced unwanted physical intimacy.

And in “one sordid episode during a work trip, a senior, married partner schemed his way into Rix’s hotel room and kissed her without her consent—all of which he admitted in a barrage of text messages.”

The filing alleges Rix’s practice wasn’t supported by the influential Dabiri and Scherzer when she wouldn’t go along with the harassment. As a result, her status at the firm was impacted.

Rix’s fears became a reality when, following her performance review, Polsinelli stripped Rix of her equity shareholder status and docked her income. While the Firm cited Rix’s alleged lackluster client originations and productivity, other senior leaders privately acknowledged its failure to adequately support Rix’s practice. Indeed, the lack of support and access thwarted Rix’s ability to meet these performance metrics. And, retaliatory criticism by the rebuffed senior shareholders fueled Polsinelli’s decisions.

The complaint further alleges that when she reported the harassment to human resources, she was fired from the firm, without an investigation.

Rix is seeking $20 million for her claims of breach of contract, violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, violations of Washington, D.C., human rights law, and infliction of emotional distress.

Polsinelli has issued the following statement:

We have been made aware of a lawsuit against the firm and two of our attorneys, filed by a former shareholder of the firm whose employment was terminated earlier this year. We take allegations of harassment and discrimination very seriously at the firm and have robust reporting procedures in place for such claims. We have and remain committed to providing a workplace free of harassment and discrimination and will respond to the lawsuit accordingly.

Rix’s attorney, William A. Brewer III, of Brewer, Attorneys & Counselors, [said,](https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/polsinelli-attorney-says-she-was-repeatedly-hounded-by-two-partners-who-sexually-harassed-her) “Like many other women in the legal industry, our client claims she was subjected to unwanted sexual harassment at the hands of senior leaders in the firm. Our client believes that Polsinelli not only failed to protect her but revictimized her by failing to properly investigate her allegations. When our client bravely stepped forward to report the abuse she endured, she claims the firm did the unimaginable: immediately terminated her employment. She filed this matter to lay bare a culture of harassment that has victimized many in the workplace and has been intentionally shielded from public view. That ends today.”

# Meet Your Deciders Where They Are
## What matters is not what you consider is important and relevant; what matters is what your deciders -- the jury, the judge, the arbitrator -- think is important and relevant.

It becomes very easy when living with a case for a while to think you understand everything. That especially can certainly happen in complex litigation where you and your colleagues maybe have spent hundreds and hundreds or hours thinking about and talking about your case. Indeed, [our firm](https://balestrierefariello.com/) has one set of business disputes that has been going on for more than a decade, and [we](https://balestrierefariello.com/people/) once had a class action take 12 years to get resolved.

But don’t fall into the trap. It becomes easy to create an echo chamber with your team and not realize what the people who matter — the deciders in your case — will really think about your case. For this reason, we use mock juries or moot arbitration proceedings in our case as early as we can to keep challenging our view of the case.

And that is the point: you need to advocate your case to those who will decide it. If you are going to try a case in a given county, make sure you pick a mock jury that looks like your actual jury. With all respect to those that run mock jury services, it’s amazing how this first step — choosing the right mock deciders — can be ignored. If you’re going to try the case to a judge, try to get a few mock judges who “look like” the judge who will preside over the case. And the same goes for an arbitration.

Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Another Associate Pay Raise -- From The Largest Firm Yet To Hike Salaries

Back in March, we shared with you a list of the [ten largest firms in the United States](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/whats-the-biggest-law-firm-in-the-country/), ranked by domestic attorney headcount. Here are the top five:

1. Jones Day
2. Greenberg Traurig
3. Morgan Lewis
4. Sidley Austin
5. Latham & Watkins

We’re pleased to announce that [Morgan Lewis & Bockius](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/morgan-lewis-bockius-llp/) is raising associate salaries. Because Jones Day and Greenberg Traurig [have not yet announced raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/by-region-which-top-10-vault-ranked-firms-have-not-raised-salaries-for-associates/2/), this makes Morgan Lewis the biggest firm yet to hike pay. (We’ve previously covered the raises announced by [Sidley](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biggest-firm-yet-matches-cravath-pay-scale/) and [Latham](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/latham-watkins/).)

We don’t have a memo to share because MLB made the announcement by voicemail, from firm chair [Jami Wintz McKeon](https://www.morganlewis.com/bios/jmckeon), shortly before 7 p.m. Eastern time. Here is what our sources report:

1. All U.S. offices currently on the New York market pay scale will match the [Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/?rf=1) up through and including seventh-year associates (i.e., the class of 2009). In other words, the MLB salary scale starts at $180,000 and stops at $300,000 (below the $315,000 or higher sums we’ve seen at other firms).

2. Any other offices not on the New York scale will see a commensurate bump; office managing partners will issue emails with details in the coming days.

3. Lawyers more senior than seventh-year associates — i.e., class of 2008 on up — will see their salaries determined on an individual basis.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
We don’t know the effective date or whether summer associates are included. Please drop us a line if you know (or find out later), and we’ll update.

Our sources seem pleased:

- “Thanks for putting the pressure on with the non-stop blog posts and charts of firms yet to match!”
- “MLB has never failed to compensate us at the top of the market. [But we] thought they’d announce next week because they made partnership announcements today and there’s a partner meeting tomorrow, allegedly.”
- “Folks are pleased, at least in New York. Glad that we matched quickly, and sounds like they want to stay competitive.”
“Quickly” is a relative term, we suppose; this feels late to us. But if you’re happy, Morgan Lewis associates, then we’re happy!

We are covering this story as market conditions develop, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

When you couple a city that already had kind of a flexible work environment with all the government attorneys and their experience now over the last three years, I think that it’s going to be very, very difficult for the Washington firms to get people in more than three days a week.

— [Jeffrey Lowe](https://www.linkedin.com/mwlite/profile/in/jeffrey-lowe-b64a886), global practice leader at recruiting firm Major, Lindsey & Africa, in comments given to the [National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2023/08/07/washington-law-firms-likely-to-face-resistance-to-in-office-mandates/), on the “strong resistance” that many D.C. law firms may face when it comes to in-office work mandates. “It [office attendance policies] has the potential to become a very significant differentiator over the next couple of years,” Lowe said, “depending upon which road the different firms go in terms of mandating office return.”

# Yet Another Top Biglaw Firm Is Using Bonus Threats To Get Associates Back To The Office
## Want your money? Get to the office, says Biglaw.

Biglaw would really like associates to [come back to the office](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/biglaw-leaders-still-worried-about-getting-associates-back-to-the-office/). Whether it’s because of lease obligations, training woes, trying to build a culture, or all of the above, by and large, firms would love to have attorneys back in the office. The question is how to do it.

We’ve seen some [carrot approaches](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/can-biglaw-associates-be-lured-back-to-the-office-with-new-food-options/), but increasingly [mandates](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/cravath-backtracks-on-the-flexible-part-of-its-flexible-office-policy/) are the default. And for associates who don’t get on board with the rules of the road? They can expect to have their [bonuses docked](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/want-your-full-biglaw-bonus-better-get-back-to-the-office/). Now another firm is joining the ranks of [Ropes & Gray](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/associates-hit-with-unannounced-bonus-reductions-for-not-being-in-the-office-enough/), [Sidley](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/sidley-associates-bonus-office-in-person-covid-policy/), [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/davis-polk-associates-bonus-office-attendance/), and [Cahill](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/another-biglaw-firm-resorts-to-bonus-threats-to-get-attorneys-back-to-the-office/) and explicitly tying office attendance to associate bonuses.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Simpson Thacher — a firm that brought in $2,150,365,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it in 15th place in the latest Am Law 100 — recently held a firmwide meeting saying its return-to-office plan would remain unchanged, and that lawyers would be expected to attend the office three days each week (with reportedly lax enforcement, thus far). Sources tell us that a few days later, an email was sent out, notifying associates that they must check for updates in the firm’s employee handbook.

Lo and behold, the updated handbook book contains a new policy linking office attendance to bonuses. Check out the first paragraph below, which states that in-office attendance requirements may affect eligibility to receive any discretionary bonuses, including year-end bonuses:



“Why couldn’t they mention this during the hour-long meeting? Very shady move,” said one source at the firm. “[T]hey basically insinuated in the meeting that remote August is not happening because our clients are back in office,” said another. Yikes. Remote Augusts have been the cornerstone of many Biglaw firms’ work/life balance protocol since hybrid workplace policies went into effect in the wake of the pandemic. We hope other firms aren’t following in STB’s footsteps here.

# Magic Circle Firm Offers Voluntary Buyouts To All Of Its London Secretaries
## This is the kinder, gentler way to part with employees.
By [Staci Zaretsky](https://abovethelaw.com/author/staci-zaretsky/)

For the past year, the coronavirus crisis has ravaged the legal profession, leading to salary cuts, furloughs, and in some cases, layoffs. But some firms seem to have remained completely unscathed by the global economic turmoil caused by COVID-19.

Take Linklaters, a firm that brought in $2,093,569,000 gross revenue in 2019, placing it 13th on the 2020 Global 200 ranking, for example. Thanks to what they learned from the pandemic, the firm announced a [permanent 50 percent remote work policy](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/biglaw-firm-announces-50-percent-remote-work-policy-for-associates/) (termed an “agile working policy”), acknowledging that remote working “worked remarkably well” and that employees were able to “deliver high-quality work whilst working remotely.” What are the firm’s next steps to become even more “agile”? Voluntary buyouts for its London secretaries (i.e., redundancies, in UK lingo). [CityAM](https://www.cityam.com/linklaters-offers-voluntary-redundancy-to-all-legal-secretaries-and-pas-in-london/) has additional details on what’s going on at the firm:

Linklaters has offered voluntary redundancy to all 225 legal secretaries and business team personal assistants in London.

It is understood there will be no compulsory redundancies, nor are there targets or plans to make redundancies at the firm compulsory.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Linklaters said in a statement: “This is a voluntary programme which we are offering as we continue to focus on innovative ways of working and shaping our secretarial teams to support a more agile working policy for the longer term.” Severance packages will be offered to all secretaries who accept the buyout.

We wish all of the legal professionals at Linklaters who accept the buyout offer the best of luck should they seek new jobs in the legal industry.

Congratulations to Dentons on its [pending merger](http://www.legalweek.com/sites/legalweek/2017/07/21/maclay-murray-spens-secures-long-awaited-merger-with-dentons-deal/?slreturn=20170822112653) with Maclay Murray & Spens, announced in July and expected to close in late October or early November. The Dentons acquisition of Maclay Murray, one of Scotland’s largest independent firms, gives the Biglaw behemoth an even stronger platform in the United Kingdom. It also represents continued growth for Dentons, which in the past year has expanded in countries ranging from Mexico to Myanmar and Barbados to Brazil.

Mergers often give rise to possible layoffs — or “redundancies,” in Brit speak — and this transaction is no exception. From [Legal Week](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202798583368/Dentons-Reviewing-32-Support-Roles-After-Scottish-Deal?kw=Dentons%20Reviewing%2032%20Support%20Roles%20After%20Scottish%20Deal&et=editorial&bu=The%20American%20Lawyer&cn=20170922&src=EMC-Email&pt=Am%20Law%20Daily):

Dentons has begun a redundancy consultation ahead of its proposed combination with Maclay Murray & Spens that could see up to 32 business services roles cut across three of the leading Scottish firm’s offices.

The 32 potentially impacted roles are in Maclays’ finance, facilities, human resources, information technology and marketing teams in Edinburgh, Glasgow and London. The firm’s other base in Aberdeen, Scotland, will be unaffected.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In a joint statement, Dentons and Maclays said that “all individuals who are potentially affected by the proposed redundancies have now been informed,” and the firms “will be providing support to impacted individuals throughout.” No lawyers appear to be affected.

Good luck to the firms as they complete their combination, and good luck to any individuals who might be affected by potential cuts.

If your firm or organization is reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know; this is a subject we cover quite closely. Please feel free to [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs) or text us (646-820-8477). Thanks.

# Associate Bonus Watch: Good News, Bad News Edition

One week into the 2017 Associate Bonus Season, and things have gotten… well, a little stale. Yes, yes, it sure is nice to know you’re about to receive the now-expected Cravath scale bonuses, but almost every firm seems to be playing follow the leader.

Ropes & Gray doesn’t play that game. Well, to be fair, they mostly do. Class years 2017-2015 will receive bonuses on the market scale, but for associates outside of the junior ranks things get a little less lockstep-y. Those bonuses, as per [firm tradition](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-a-biglaw-firm-that-may-sweeten-the-bonus-pot/?rf=1), are individualized and “reflect personal contributions, assessed on both qualitative and quantitative bases, as well as prevailing market compensation.”

Plus, for those that bill more than 1,900 hours (a fairly modest hours requirement, all things considered), they could see an even bigger payday:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
As you know, we have an activity target of at least 1,900 billable and pro bono hours to be eligible for a bonus. This year, we have again increased bonuses from the above scale for associates who worked substantially more than the targeted amount, maintained bonuses for some associates who worked less than the target, and decreased rather than eliminated bonuses for many other associates who worked less than the target.

There’s also some bad news hidden in the bonus announcement — at least if you’re the type to procrastinate your time entry:

Timely diaries are critical to our business. They enable us to bill clients promptly at the end of each month, and are essential to monitoring and managing alternative fee arrangements. For these reasons, adhering to our diary standards is absolutely crucial. As previously announced, lawyers violating our diary standards have received an automatic bonus reduction.

At least they were warned ahead of time, and hopefully most associates planned accordingly.

So Ropes & Gray associates, how do you feel about this year’s bonuses? Do the individualized bonuses for senior associates help you? Is the punishment for late time entry too harsh? Shoot us an [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) to let us know what you really think — all submissions will be kept strictly anonymous.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text (646-820-8477), or tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). We always keep our sources anonymous — and that includes our sources for bonus stories. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks for your help.

Do you like being in the know? Do you love gossiping with friends and co-workers over the latest bonus news? Then you simply must sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts. It’s easy, just scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything.

# The Upswing In Biglaw Partner Departures
## Which firms have had the most partners leave this year?

There’s lots of upheaval in the legal industry in 2020. Well, to be fair, there’s lots of upheaval in the world in 2020, so this is just par for the course. But even as we get information that, as an industry, [Biglaw seems to be weathering the troubled times just fine](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/whats-the-real-reason-biglaw-firms-are-begging-off-fall-bonuses/), some firms are seeing lateral partners leave at an abnormal rate.

As[ reported by](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2020/10/19/in-2020-these-big-firms-have-seen-the-most-partner-exits-405-69749/) Patrick Smith at Law.com, legal consulting firm Decipher did an analysis of lateral partner defection from January 1 to August 31 of this year. Included in the data are partner exits at Am Law 200 firms and some midsize firms; they only counted partner-to-partner laterals, and if they moved from government or in-house roles into partnership positions, they were excluded. With those technicalities out of the way, let’s see which firms had the most departures.

The top three in partner defection are Kirkland & Ellis (54), Boies Schiller (50), and Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith (31).

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
K&E usually has a high turnover rate — with over 1,000 partners, that’s bound to happen. But their net loss is higher than expected, as they only took on 18 new lateral partners after losing 54.

“I was surprised to see Kirkland had lost that number of people,” Sabina Lippman of legal recruiting firm Lippman Jungers Bala said. “But they can afford to do that. They can go after people more aggressively than anyone else. They have a lot to play with, and they can take risks that many others can’t.”

Boies, well, if you’ve [been paying attention to legal news](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/boies-schiller-flexner/) over the past year, it’s no surprise to see them on the list. [Overall headcount](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/the-incredible-shrinking-biglaw-firm-2/) has been declining at the firm, as the firm[ charts a new course](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/everyone-seems-to-be-overreacting-to-these-boies-schiller-departures/), one that includes adding [new bankruptcy partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/boies-schiller-adds-bankruptcy-talent-to-new-look-firm/).

Other firms that get mentioned as having notable departure numbers are Greenberg Traurig, Winston & Strawn, Holland & Knight, Akerman, and Polsinelli. While most of the firms didn’t comment on the Law.com story, Holland & Knight was open about how the pandemic is impacting their partnership:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“The pandemic has caused a number of partners to alter their career plans,” Holland & Knight managing partner Steven Sonberg said in a statement.

“These involve various circumstances including the opening of boutique practices or moving to in-house legal positions or nonprofits. We have also had partners retire, relocate to cities where the firm does not maintain offices, and move to other law firms,” he said. “The firm continues to perform well, and we are poised to have another successful year. As a result, we expect a significant number of lateral partners will join the firm over the next several months.”

And Polsinelli also looks to the pandemic as the explanation for their headcount dip:

“We were slow from a hiring perspective, intentionally, during the pandemic, for a lot of reasons,” Chase Simmons, CEO and chairman of Polsinelli, said in an interview. “Clients were not as interested in meeting new attorneys, it was hard to move around and meet people and we were more focused on transitioning our existing attorneys. [The departure count] doesn’t shock me, as we are not managing to a number, but rather to what the client needs.”

Which makes sense, not every firm [can actively try to expand](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/firm-bucking-the-covid-19-trend-and-expanding-during-a-pandemic/) during the COVID-19 turbulence. Of course it remains to be seen if these lateral trends will continue once the threat of COVID-19 has receded.

# Is Trump The End Of FCPA Enforcement?

A little less than a year ago, I was at a very nice party at the ABA White Collar Conference in San Diego with some friends talking about the election.

Maybe it was the margaritas, maybe it was my native pessimism, or maybe I’m merely a savant, but I predicted that Donald Trump would be elected.

Building on that, I then predicted that Trump would radically reshape white-collar prosecutions, and that the ABA White Collar Conference would dry up and blow away so that there would no longer be any margaritas at lavish parties for any of us.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
To be clear, this was not a reasoned position. Trump was still locked in a serious primary fight. Other than being from Iowa and having some understanding of the kind of person who hates East Coast elites so much that he’ll set fire to a car he’s in if an elite is in there too, I didn’t believe what I was saying. It was the kind of thing one says at a certain point in the night to keep the conversation rolling.

I recall, too, specifically saying that Trump’s brand of America-first isolationism would mean he’d put a stop to FCPA work. Those millions of dollars of investigation work would slowly dwindle, I predicted, as the Orange One refocuses our government’s efforts away from what’s happening overseas and back on what’s happening in America.

I had really been enjoying those drinks.

Representing corporations under investigation for violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has been a huge moneymaker for U.S. law firms. Those investigations may be the single largest source of white-collar revenue for American firms.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Yet, there’s been reason to be skeptical of the value of FCPA enforcement for a while — it does seem odd to think that a U.S. company that does corrupt things in a foreign country should be punished here. If GE wants to bribe folks in Poland, why is that our problem and not Poland’s? Why should we care about corruption in Poland if Poland doesn’t? Indeed, if a Polish company can bribe but an American country can’t, doesn’t that put us at an unfair disadvantage? At the very least, why should U.S. taxpayers fund cleaning up Poland’s government?

This view was articulated in a paper put out by the New York Bar Association called “[The FCPA and its Impact on International Business Transactions—Should Anything be Done to Minimize the Consequences of the U.S.’s Unique Position on Combating Offshore Corruption](http://www2.nycbar.org/pdf/report/uploads/FCPAImpactonInternationalBusinessTransactions.pdf)” in 2011. The paper concludes with this:

Our position is that (1) the competitive landscape of the 21st century global economy warrants the reevaluation of the United States’ strategy in fighting foreign corruption, (2) the current anti-bribery regime—which tends to place disproportionate burdens on U.S. regulated companies in international transactions and incentivizes other countries to take a “lighter touch” —is causing lasting harm to the competitiveness of U.S. regulated companies and the U.S. capital markets and (3) even putting aside the disproportionate costs borne by U.S. regulated companies, the continued unilateral and zealous enforcement of the FCPA by the United States may not be the most effective means to combat corruption globally—in fact, in some circumstances it may exacerbate the problem of overseas corruption.

The committee that issued that paper was chaired by Jay Clayton, the Sullivan & Cromwell partner who was [just nominated to head the SEC](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/trump-nominates-sullivan-cromwell-partner-to-lead-sec/?rf=1) by the President-Elect. The SEC is, of course, one of the two government actors that conducts FCPA investigations.

So, there’s pretty good reason to think that Clayton may not be the biggest friend to continued aggressive enforcement of the FCPA.

That said, the paper does say that “[t]he moral sense of the United States to ‘do the right thing’ is clearly and laudably a motivating factor.”

So maybe that’s the sentiment that will guide Clayton at the SEC?

Absent that, I fear the margarita train may be in danger.

# Shearman Names New Leader After Merger Talks Flop
## It's time for someone new to take charge at the firm.

It was just last week that Shearman announced that its merger talks with Hogan Lovells were being [scrapped](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/rumored-merger-between-hogan-lovells-and-shearman-scrapped/). Now, the firm has announced a leadership change — and early one, at that, to “ensure a seamless passing of the torch.”

The firm recently revealed that [Adam Hakki](https://www.shearman.com/en/people/h/hakki-adam), who currently serves as global managing partner and head of disputes and litigation, will become Shearman’s next senior partner, subject to a formal election later this year. Hakki will be taking the reins from David Beveridge, who has served in the role since 2018.

Here’s what Beveridge had to say about the early leadership transition:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“We have made important progress in reshaping our business, and I believe this is the right time to begin a leadership transition to accelerate the pace of the firm’s ongoing transformation and the development of a new strategic vision. We have a clear opportunity to optimize across the business as we work to better focus our efforts on the areas where we are best positioned to succeed and increase revenue growth in the future. We have meaningful work ahead of us, and I feel strongly that the time has come for me to begin to pass the torch on to the next generation of leadership. I am fully confident that, in partnership with the management team, Adam will be the leader the firm needs to deliver on our ambitions.”

This is what Hakki — a lifer at Shearman — had to say of his prospective ascent to power within the firm:

“This year marks the firm’s 150th anniversary and as we look to the future, we are excited and energized by the opportunity to strengthen the firm in service of our clients around the world. We will maintain a laser focus on our clients and prioritize our core strength as a destination for the most complex and significant transactions and disputes for corporates, financial institutions, and funds, with true industry expertise. Through this we will maintain our prioritization of the most profitable legal markets. We will also continue to prioritize our most valuable asset – our people – in their development and in fostering a diverse and inclusive environment.”

Will Hakki be able to stem the tide of partner departures from the firm? We suppose we’ll see. He already has unanimous support from the firm’s key constituencies, and could begin in his new role before the year is over.

# 5 Ways To Piss Off A SmallLaw Lawyer

Gary J. Ross

I’m not often pissed off. In fact, I rarely even use the word “piss.” A lot of my anger was burned off in my 20s, so here in my 40s, it takes a lot to get me upset, which helps at work. (Advice to the wannabe negotiators out there: learn how not to lose your cool, but also learn how to act like you’ve lost it.) Once I found out life is better if you go through it joyously — and I don’t know how some folks make it through a day — I no longer got ticked off about small things, like when the shopping cart has a bad wheel or somebody says something on Facebook that doesn’t align perfectly with my narrow world view.

But we all have our limits. There’s only so much a person can take, even a person who from all outward appearances has it good. ([Who’s got it better than us? Nobody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucyYTKBiL4E))

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Here are five ways you can test the limits of a SmallLaw lawyer:

- You expect me to bow to Biglaw. “[Biglaw firm] drafted these documents, so you shouldn’t have any comments.” The clear implication being “who on earth are you to say there are any shortcomings with these documents, which were labored over by a bunch of second- and third-years and glanced at by a partner? Who are you??” I had a set of documents — that I had never seen before — dropped on me the other night and this is what they told me when they said I had to sign off on them by the next morning. Like I’m a rubber stamp. This pissed me off so much I wrote a listicle and led with this item. Never tell a SmallLaw attorney he or she should defer to anyone in Biglaw. Many of us came from Biglaw and rightly believe we’re far better attorneys now.
- You attach conditions to paying for work I’ve already completed. Usually by promising future work. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard, “You cut me a [price] break on this, I’ll reward you with future work.” How about we forget about the birds in the bush and concentrate on the bird in hand? Just pay me what you owe me, and we’ll worry about future work in the future. After all, what are the odds you’re going to ask me for a break on the future work? 1 to 3? 1 to 4? I don’t normally [gamble](http://www.peterose.com/), but those odds are pretty good. Some clients try to carry out a Ponzi scheme, by asking you to do future work in order to get paid for past work.
- You e-introduce me to vendors. We moved recently, and one of my “friends” saw fit to send an email introduction to me and a moving consultant. Not just an email to me, saying, “Hey Gary, I know this moving consultant guy. Here is his info.” Instead, it was, “Gary, meet Matt. Matt, meet Gary. Gary is moving his office, and Matt has a moving consulting service, so I thought I would put the two of you in touch.” I’m sure Matt is okay with that, but how I am supposed to respond?? While I’ll admit I’m mildly curious as to what a “moving consultant” does — maybe Matt comes in, looks around, says, “yeah, all this needs to be moved,” and then hands me an invoice — the last thing I need is for anyone to introduce me to yet another vendor under the guise of “networking.”
- You don’t respect my time. In SmallLaw, we have a lot of plates in the air, and it’s hard to find the time to spin them all. Something like excessive calling will suck up a lot of time, since mentally it’s hard to go right back to the place you were before the call.  Some amount of calling to shoot the breeze is perfectly fine; after all, many of us work either by ourselves, or just with a small number of others.  It breaks up the day a bit to chitchat. But persistent calling about matters either already settled or that I don’t have the ability to affect is just a nuisance.  Maybe you just like the sound of my voice?
- You don’t randomly PayPal me large sums of money. There’s nothing stopping you. My PayPal account is my email address. A few dollars before the holiday would be great.
It really just boils down to respect. For the most part, everyone in SmallLaw is friendly and helpful. But building and maintaining a practice can be a hard endeavor, and when respect is lacking, sometimes folks like myself will get upset. I can’t say any dire consequence will come if you manage to piss off me or another SmallLaw attorney, except I’ll note that many people responsible for building their own client base are relentless networkers. The more people you have at your disposal — who will answer your calls and emails, make introductions, and offer advice when needed — the easier things will be. So you probably want to avoid pissing us off if you can.

# Are Big Changes On The Horizon For Iraq's Energy Sector?
## A $27 billion investment comes with an interesting twist.

Rich oil deposits can be a blessing or [a curse](https://carnegieendowment.org/2015/09/30/oil-curse-remedial-role-for-oil-industry-pub-61445) for a country.

Norway, for instance, has [an oil fund](https://www.nbim.no/en/) that is the envy of the world, now invested in diverse income-generating equities and used to “help finance the Norwegian welfare state for future generations.”

Then you have places like Venezuela, [a petrostate in decline](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/venezuela-crisis), where corruption, concentration of power, and undiversified dependence on fossil fuel income has stymied progress for generations.
Nowhere is the dark historical baggage of oil reserves more pronounced than in Iraq.

Iraq is OPEC’s second largest oil producer, and Iraq’s oil played a leading role in the wars that have savaged the country for decades. But a huge new investment from a leading energy company might foreshadow big changes to the conventional wisdom in Iraq’s energy sector.

Nearly a hundred years ago, French company TotalEnergies made its first oil discovery in what is now Iraq. This week, [TotalEnergies announced a major new investment in Iraq](https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/06/business/total-iraq-solar/index.html) totaling $27 billion. In many ways, this investment is a return to the TotalEnergies legacy in Iraq. However, given that this is an investment from what has been mostly a major oil and gas company, this commitment comes with an interesting twist.

Although much of the investment is indeed going to fund oil and gas projects, none of it is funding new exploration. Instead, projects will enhance output from Iraq’s existing oil and gas fields. A portion of the first $10 billion, for example, is earmarked to recover flared gas on three existing oilfields, which will reduce waste, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and supply local power stations. Another project allowed for by the new funding involves pumping seawater into existing oilfields to increase production without impacting notoriously scarce local freshwater resources.

Getting more out of existing facilities is certainly an admirable exercise in efficiency. Yet, the real surprise for a company that has been traditionally associated with oil and gas is another part of the investment: constructing a major solar power plant.

The solar plant will supply Iraq’s Basra regional grid. It will have a 1-gigawatt capacity. (If you know your “Back to the Future” trivia, that’s just about enough to power Doc Brown’s DeLorean time machine. Or, you know, [the equivalent energy of 110 million LED bulbs](https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/how-much-power-1-gigawatt). Or, if you’d prefer, the energy of about 1.3 million horses.)

“Our ambition is to assist Iraq in building a more sustainable future by developing access to electricity for its people through a more sustainable use of the country’s natural resources,” Patrick Pouyanné, TotalEnergies’ Chairman and CEO, [said in a press release](https://totalenergies.com/media/news/press-releases/iraq-totalenergies-signs-major-agreements-sustainable-development-basra). 

The solar portion of TotalEnergies’ new Iraq development is relatively modest. By way of comparison, its first phase of the flared gas recovery portion of the project is set to supply 1.5 times the power generation of the solar project, and it will supply three times as much in its second phase. Still, a solar project of this size represents a significant investment, and it is a real departure from the status quo in a country still known for oil and gas.

It’s probably no coincidence that TotalEnergies’ push into solar power in Iraq comes at a time [when almost everyone supports expanding solar energy](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/06/08/most-americans-support-expanding-solar-and-wind-energy-but-republican-support-has-dropped/) production. Even so, the scope of the investment, particularly in a place in the world that has long been recognized for fossil fuel-based energy production, shows that this is not just a well-timed public relations gimmick.

In the future, more energy companies are likely to follow TotalEnergies’ example. And that’s not just good news for the planet: Energy companies that wish to follow more in the path of Norway than Venezuela are going to find that diversification is in their own best interests in the coming years. Sometimes good business and corporate responsibility align, and solar energy expansion in Iraq is one way of demonstrating how.

# Biglaw Compensation Leader To Close Office By Year's End
## Sources say profitability factored into the firm's decision to shut down the office.

Sometimes, in order to remain successful, even the most successful Biglaw firms must do something that seems completely out of character — like close an office. That’s exactly what’s happening over at Davis Polk & Wardwell, where the top 20 Am Law firm is slated to close its office in Paris, France, by the end of the year.

Opened in 1962, the office was DPW’s first international outpost, and now it will be shuttered after 60 years. On September 16, managing partner Neil Barr notified the firm of the closure by email. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/10/19/davis-polk-to-close-paris-office-by-end-of-2022-405-111670/) has some relevant details from Barr’s firmwide memo:

“Earlier this year, the firm undertook a strategic review of our French law practice,” Barr wrote. “After extensive discussions and analysis, the firm has made the difficult decision to end our French law practice, and thus close the Paris office. This is all effective December 31, 2022.

“In no way is this a reflection of the talent of our colleagues in Paris,” he continued. “They are exceptionally skilled and deeply committed to the firm and our clients. We are working with each of them on outplacement and other support services.”

As a reminder, Davis Polk brought home $1,970,000,000 gross revenue in 2021 and offered associates bonuses and salary increases hand over fist last year. Sources now claim that profitability was an issue at the office thanks to those high pay rates (after rounds of salary wars that were fueled, in part, by the firm) and the ultra-competitiveness of the Paris M&A deal market.

The compensation leader’s Parisian office has just a handful of lawyers, including one partner, and per the American Lawyer, all five will be transitioning to other legal roles, retirement, or sabbatical. We wish them all the best in their new pursuits.

# Thinking About A Possible Trump Plea Bargain

Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)

In a typical case involving the Manhattan district attorney and a billionaire defendant, there would be discussions about a plea bargain.

The DA might figure that business records charges are usually misdemeanors, and it’s a bit of a stretch to turn those crimes into felonies. A first-time defendant convicted of a business records offense in New York would never do jail time. The DA might thus propose that the billionaire plead guilty to one felony count, and the billionaire would be guaranteed no jail time.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The typical billionaire would then accept that deal. The case against the billionaire looks strong; most criminal defendants are convicted; the plea deal involves only one count and no jail time.

Case closed.

Could that deal happen in the case of New York v. Trump?

There are, of course, two sides in any plea negotiation.

Could District Attorney Alvin Bragg offer the deal? He should: Justice would arguably be done; Trump would plead guilty to a felony.

Bragg would not get the opportunity to try the case, which means that Bragg would not be able to make public certain evidence that might embarrass Trump. But that’s okay: When making prosecutorial decisions, prosecutors aren’t supposed to be thinking about whether they could embarrass a defendant.

If Bragg settled the case without a trial, he wouldn’t run the risk of a MAGA diehard on the jury refusing to vote to convict Trump. A hung jury would be a public relations godsend for Trump and a massive humiliation for Bragg. It should be worth a fair amount to Bragg to avoid that possibility.

What about the other side of the plea negotiation — could Trump accept the deal?  Trump is about to be convicted of a bunch of felonies. Pleading guilty to just one count, and avoiding all jail time, might sound pretty sweet.

Trump could probably convince voters that he had no choice but to accept the deal: “There’s no way I could get a fair trial in front of this corrupt judge and a Manhattan jury! They were going to convict me, and I would have been able to reverse that conviction only on appeal! Besides, the trial would have kept me off the campaign trail for six weeks, and it’s crucial that I campaign and be elected your next president! The country can’t survive another four years of Biden!”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
There might, however, be a few flies in the ointment. There’s a question about what Trump would have to admit in court for the plea deal to be accepted. Trump might have to stand before a New York judge and say, basically, “I admit that I fraudulently altered the books of The Trump Organization to conceal a payment I made to Stormy Daniels. That payment was intended to keep Stormy Daniels from disclosing in the days leading up to the 2016 election the affair I had with Daniels years earlier. I feared disclosure of that affair might have caused me to lose the presidential election.”

Those words, and the illustrations drawn by the courtroom sketch artists showing Trump in the well of a courtroom confessing his guilt to Judge Juan Merchan, might be too much for Trump to bear. The words would undercut any claim that Trump hadn’t committed a crime, and the image of Trump humbling himself before a judge might scar Trump’s tender psyche.

If, however, Merchan permitted Trump to insist that Trump was not actually guilty and was pleading guilty only to avoid a possible longer sentence after trial, the plea deal would become more palatable. (I’m no expert in New York criminal law, or Merchan’s preferences, so I really don’t know what Trump might have to say in connection with any plea bargain.)

Psychologically, of course, Trump would hate the idea of having been a loser in a criminal case.  But not having to admit that he’d violated the law, avoiding any possible jail time, and being released from spending six weeks in the dock in a New York courtroom, might be a fair tradeoff.

Then, of course, there are the ads that the Biden campaign would run to capitalize on Trump’s conviction. “Donald J. Trump, a convicted felon, has lost the right to vote in the coming election. He can’t even vote for himself. But the felon wants to be president; he wants to be responsible for enforcing the laws of the country. Don’t put a criminal in charge of law enforcement. Make America sane again; refuse to vote for the convicted felon. I’m Joe Biden, and I approve this message.”  Or words to that effect.

I’m not sure that Bragg could offer this deal. I’m not sure that Trump could accept it.

But discussions of this sort would surely occur in a normal case. It’s fair to consider how those discussions would play out in this one.

# This Judge Just WRECKED Obama's Justice Department

Judge Andrew Hanen

Let’s talk about how the entire Justice Department just got reamed in [a 28-page order](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/this-judge-just-wrecked-obamas-justice-department/2/) that [teetered between smoldering fury and white-hot rage](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=1202758102794/Texas-Judge-Blasts-Justice-Department-Lawyers-for-Conduct-in-Immigration-Case#ixzz498zXQU9T). That’s not a mistaken or overblown choice of words either. The entire emotional range of Southern District of Texas Judge Andrew Hanen collapsed upon itself like a dying star before exploding in a supernova of fierce benchslappery against not just “a” government lawyer, but pretty much “every” government lawyer.

Judge Hanen is overseeing the challenge — presently before the “Truncated Eight” that we call our Supreme Court — brought by 26 states against President Obama’s immigration plan. The challenge is, of course, pure political showboating against the administration’s plan to protect kids brought here illegally from having to come back here illegally a second time.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But what got Judge Hanen in an uproar yesterday was not so much the Obama policy, but his sense that the Department of Justice routinely lied, or at least recklessly misled him, throughout the case in violation of ethical obligations. In a nutshell, Judge Hanen is miffed that the Department of Homeland Security began bestowing benefits under this new program and that, on multiple occasions, the Department of Justice didn’t tell Judge Hanen about this while the court contemplated enjoining the government.

That’s pretty bad. No matter how stupid this challenge may be, the government can’t really blow off the judge hearing the case. The misstatements, at least as laid out by Judge Hanen, are devastating.

But like Icarus of old, Judge Hanen goes too far. It’s okay. Sometimes we all get angry and say things we don’t mean or have any rational reason to decree by judicial order.

After quoting at some length from Miracle on 34th Street — no, really — Judge Hanen orders:

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Therefore, this Court, in an effort to ensure that all Justice Department attorneys who appear in the courts of the Plaintiff States that have been harmed by this misconduct are aware of and comply with their ethical duties, hereby orders that any attorney employed at the Justice Department in Washington, D.C. who appears, or seeks to appear, in a court (state or federal) in any of the 26 Plaintiff States annually attend a legal ethics course.

If that weren’t enough, he also demands that, for five years, the Department of Justice provide him with a f**king list of every Justice lawyer who appeared in every applicable court throughout the year along with proof that the lawyer attended a course tailored to that jurisdiction. And online courses don’t count, because… obviously.[1]

This is a laughably insane overreach based on his beef with a narrow, if important to him, misstatement by a few lawyers in one case. But it goes to show how egregious he thinks this is. To wit:

Such conduct is certainly not worthy of any department whose name includes the word “Justice.” Suffice it to say, the citizens of all fifty states, their counsel, the affected aliens and the judiciary all deserve better.

Damn. Faced with this blistering sentiment, the nonetheless-unwilling-to-rename-itself “Justice” Department told the [National Law Journal](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=1202758102794/Texas-Judge-Blasts-Justice-Department-Lawyers-for-Conduct-in-Immigration-Case#ixzz498zXQU9T) via email that “the department strongly disagrees with the order.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
But there’s another interesting point in this opinion highlighted in Zoe Tillman’s coverage in the [National Law Journal](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=1202758102794/Texas-Judge-Blasts-Justice-Department-Lawyers-for-Conduct-in-Immigration-Case#ixzz498zXQU9T):

Hanen’s ire was directed at Washington-based Justice Department lawyers. He said there was no evidence that lawyers from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas committed misconduct. He also noted that none of the ethical breaches occurred under [current attorney general Loretta] Lynch, who took over as attorney general from Eric Holder Jr., now a partner at Covington & Burling, in April 2015.

Now, wait a minute. Either punish only the specific lawyers in front of you, or declare that the DOJ needs to subject every lawyer potentially trampling a citizen’s rights to some crazy course and reporting requirement. This artificial segregation of local and Washington-based lawyers is uncalled for (though not unprecedented, like when [Judge Hughes once said, on the record](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/judge-calls-doj-sons-of-bitches-on-the-record/), that Washington DOJ lawyers were “sons of bitches”).

It smacks of the unwarranted favoritism at play in favor of the government lawyers that judges see every day — remember the Ninth Circuit’s [uncomfortable giggle-fest](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/when-humor-in-the-courtroom-isnt-funny/) — who often have [the same job the judge used to have](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/07/opinion/the-homogeneous-federal-bench.html?_r=0), or work directly for one of the judge’s old colleagues.

More importantly, just because the always complex, often bureaucratic matters involving “Main Justice” present more obvious instances of mistake or deception, that’s no reason to assume running an indigent kid into an amorphous “conspiracy” conviction on greased rails is without shady tactics. Well-funded adversaries and high-profile political cases will reveal missteps that a federal defender and a supposedly routine criminal case may never be able to surface. The point is, if the DOJ is systematically asleep at the switch, then no DOJ lawyer should be spared.

In any event, the opinion is still a brutal benchslap of unmoored movie quotes, seemingly dead-to-rights transcript excerpts, and ham-fisted overreach.

Not to borrow from Sir Winston Churchill, though the late Prime Minister seems like a guy who’d have enjoyed a good benchslap, so why not: “Never have so many been benchslapped so mightily by so few.”

(The whole benchslap is available [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/this-judge-just-wrecked-obamas-justice-department/2/))

[1] Aside from the purely ethical aspects of the opinion, in one move designed to sneak a little substance back into an order otherwise about ethics, Judge Hanen ordered the Justice Department to provide him a list of all the immigrants who received benefits so that he could, under certain conditions, leak it to the states so they could… I don’t know, crack heads?

# Navigating Multiple Potential Offers: Timing Challenges In The Lateral Market
## What should you do if you have received an offer from a less-preferred firm but have yet to hear from your preferred firm?

Annual bonuses have hit the bank accounts of many law firm associates, kicking an already active lateral market into an even higher gear. With demand continuing to outpace supply, many lateral candidates can reasonably expect to receive offers from multiple firms. Unfortunately, the offers probably won’t arrive at the same time. Candidates often must make a decision about an offer in hand before receiving an answer from one or more other firms where they interview. This scenario begs the question: what should you do if you have received an offer from a less-preferred firm but have yet to hear from your preferred firm?

Each situation requires a case-by-case assessment, and a trusted recruiter can offer helpful individualized guidance. However, there are a few general principles that any lateral candidate should keep in mind.

Don’t underestimate the value of joining a firm that truly wants you

The clearest indication that a firm truly wants you is a decisive offer extended shortly after interviews. This is a strong signal that the firm will go above and beyond to integrate you into the practice, setting you up for success in your new role. It should also give you confidence that bumps along the road will be more easily manageable. For example, in the event your first performance review is less than perfect, you will be in a better headspace to receive criticism as genuinely constructive, rather than wondering if they even wanted you there in the first place. Given the sometimes cut-throat nature of law firm life, knowing that the team was thrilled to hire you can be critically important in helping you stay positive and confident through the inevitable ups and downs.

If the firm really wants you and also knows that you are considering other firms, you (or your recruiter) may be in a position to negotiate a signing bonus or, in the case of non-lockstep firms, a higher salary. Obviously, this will be valuable if you accept the offer. If you have doubts about your willingness to accept, even with an added financial incentive, you should be careful about potential damage to your reputation. It’s a bad look for a candidate to negotiate a robust signing bonus (either alone or through a recruiter), only to then decline the offer.

A full pipeline of work alleviates job security concerns

A prompt offer is a strong indication that the firm has immediate work for you to take on. This can mitigate concerns about failing to meet hours in a new group where you lack established relationships. Conversely, if a firm is slow to give you a decision, there is less certainty of an immediate need. If the practice group is not currently operating at full capacity, there is some risk that the firm will ultimately decide not to approve a hire — even if your interviewers judge you to be a great candidate.

There’s something reassuring about a confirmation that the role and the need are firm priorities. Even junior associates — who have experienced a remarkably strong market for the duration of their legal careers — sometimes fear that they will be “last in, first out” should the market sour and the firm start making cuts. This is rarely a serious risk in the current market, but knowing the practice you will be joining has a robust pipeline of work should put to rest any concerns about job security.

A less-preferred firm can sometimes be a stepping stone

In some cases, a less desirable firm may be a stepping stone to your preferred firm. This is particularly plausible where a candidate is seeking to transition to a new practice or subspecialty. If the less-preferred firm is offering a concrete opportunity to gain relevant experience in the new field, it may be wise to accept the offer and then re-apply to your preferred firm in the future, with a strengthened profile.

When accepting an offer, plan to stay for at least a year

With rare exceptions, it is a major red flag to leave a firm after less than a year. Keep this in mind if considering the stepping stone approach. If you cannot see yourself sticking it out for a full year or more, you are better off declining the offer and taking your chances that a more attractive option will materialize soon. Of course, how you feel about your current firm is also an important factor. If you are not desperate to leave, you can be more selective and risk-tolerant in your lateral search.

Working through these issues with a trusted recruiter can be invaluable

There is a lot of upside to working through these timing issues with the help of an experienced recruiter. Candidates often focus on the recruiter’s role in helping secure interviews, but a recruiter with strong relationships can also add value as the candidate’s advocate after interviews have concluded. For example, recruiters are typically in a better position than candidates to exert pressure when a firm is delaying its decision. Your recruiter can have a candid conversation with the firm, conveying the message that you are strongly considering other options and will soon be off the market.

In addition, a trusted recruiter can be a helpful sounding board as you weigh the various factors and come to a decision about how best to proceed. Juggling actual and potential offers is rarely easy, but your recruiter can help you navigate the process as smoothly as possible.

In the days following the invasion of Ukraine, we saw responses from a number of major law firms with business in Russia [shut down their offices](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/biglaw-offices-in-russia-and-ukraine-confront-reality-of-wartime-law-practice/) and [withdraw from representations](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/biglaw-firms-ditching-russian-government-clients-because-its-the-right-move/). But some firms didn’t make a clean break with Russian business, and some that did issued cagey statements that made the move sound like a temporary, sanctions-related decision primed for reversal at the earliest opportunity.

So what are law firms saying about Russian business?

Stanford Law School has [compiled a list of every public firm statement on the future of Russian work](https://law.stanford.edu/law-firms-and-russian-profits/).

The page divides firm statements between firms no longer doing work in Russia — like MoFo and Gowling WLG — firms that have dropped Russian government-related entities — like DLA Piper, Norton Rose, and Hunton Andrews Kurth — and firms that are either silent or issued equivocal statements.

Looking through the list of inconclusive statements, many just indicate that the firm will drop specific clients without elaborating. It’s very possible that some of these firms intended to be more direct but just failed to get the message across.

Hopefully this website inspires those firms to issue follow-ups clarifying their stances.

# Top 25 Biglaw Firm Wows With Elite-Level Raises
## Congrats on the big bucks!

Shares[](https://twitter.com/share?url=https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/weil-compensation-23/&text=Top%2025%20Biglaw%20Firm%20Wows%20With%20Elite-Level%20Raises)[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/weil-compensation-23/&display=popup&ref=plugin&src=share_button)[](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/weil-compensation-23/)[](javascript:void(""#ea-share-count-email""))
Less than a week ago, [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/cravath-announces-raises-comes-over-the-top-of-milbank-scale-for-some-associates/) brightened up the holiday season for Biglaw associates. How’d they do that? Money, of course! They announced raises that — for midlevel and senior associates — went over the [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/milbank-raises-associate-salaries-and-announces-year-end-bonuses/) raises from a few weeks prior. Now the only question is, which Biglaw firms will be able to match this new standard?

While it may be true that not every Biglaw firm will be able to match these raises, with over a billion in revenue, Weil was pretty much a lock. That’s right, last year, Weil made $1,767,107,000 in gross revenue, making it 23rd on the Am Law 100.

The result of all that success is a brand new compensation and bonus grid at the firm. The scale is as follows:

Class Year	2023 Overall Strong Year-End Bonus	Annual Salary Effective January 1, 2024
2023	$15,000 (prorated)	$225,000
2022	$20,000	$235,000
2021	$30,000	$260,000
2020	$57,500	$310,000
2019	$75,000	$365,000
2018	$90,000	$390,000
2017	$105,000	$420,000
2016 and more senior	$115,000	$435,000
Bonuses will be paid on January 31.

You can read the full memo on [the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/weil-compensation-23/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Lawyers Apparently Perform This Weird Ritual During Cravath Partner Funerals
## Do lawyers at your firm perform any strange death rituals during funerals?

The partner is dead, the firm lives.

— A chant that is traditionally recited [during the “Cravath Walk,”](https://www.ft.com/content/b9c96d04-376c-11e8-8eee-e06bde01c544) a procession of past and present partners at a deceased Cravath partner’s funeral.

[UPDATE (4/16/2018, 2:55 p.m.): A longtime former partner denies this: “The Cravath partners do NOT chant anything at a partner’s funeral or memorial service. They walk in and sit as a group only as a sign of respect to their departed colleague.”]

Geraint Thomas

Hours after allegations of inappropriate behavior were made against Eversheds Sutherland partner [Geraint Thomas](https://www.eversheds-sutherland.com/global/en/who/people/index.page?person=en/Thomas_Geraint), he was found dead. According[ to reports](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/brexit-lawyer-accused-inappropriate-behaviour-13782815), Thomas’s body was found on December 18th at the bottom of a 150ft cliff in Wales with a stuffed animal belonging to one of his daughters at the top of the precipice.

Thomas was a partner based in the Cardiff office of the international firm. His practice was in the banking and finance group and he styled himself as an expert on the impact of Brexit on businesses. He was married and had two daughters.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
According to reports, Thomas was brought into the firm’s London office on December 17th where he was informed that there were formal complaints made about his alleged inappropriate behavior at the firm’s holiday party in London. He then returned to Cardiff where his body was found. Police have indicated Thomas’s death is not being treated as suspicious:

A police spokesman said: “South Wales Police is investigating the sudden death of a 47-year-old man from Cardiff who was discovered at Southerdown.

“The death is not being treated as suspicious. Next of kin have been informed and a file of evidence is being prepared for HM Coroner.”

The Mirror [reports](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/brexit-lawyer-accused-inappropriate-behaviour-13782815) the two women who made the complaints about Thomas’s behavior have been “devastated” at the news of his death:

It is understood two female members of staff had made complaints about Mr Thomas. Both were later described as being “devastated” at hearing of his death.

A colleague said: “It is a terrible tragedy and a shocking waste of life.

“The staff involved are terribly shocked and traumatised.”

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Lee Ransom, CEO of Eversheds Sutherland, offered these words on the passing of a partner:

On behalf of the firm I can confirm with great sadness that Geraint Thomas, a partner in our commercial team, was found dead on 18 December 2018.

Details surrounding his death are unclear and we are currently liaising with his family and the police.

Geraint was a highly respected and esteemed lawyer who, having joined the firm in 1994 spent his entire career with the firm.

A truly exceptional lawyer, he will be remembered for his dedication to his clients and to the firm in equal measure. He will be greatly missed.

Our sincere sympathies and thoughts are with Geraint’s wife, family and friends at this exceptionally difficult time.

Many of Geraint’s colleagues have also been deeply affected by this tragic news.

We are working with everyone to ensure they have appropriate, professional support in the coming weeks and months.

As this is an ongoing investigation I am unable to provide further comment at this time.

Our thoughts go out to those affected by Thomas’s death.

# Reviewing Contracts While Working In-House
## For in-house counsel, contract review needs to extend beyond a simple checklist.

When I first began my career as an in-house lawyer, I had zero contract experience, but that lack of experience was of little concern to me. After all, I was joining a small, close-knit team of seasoned lawyers with contracting expertise. My job was to represent my employer in court and not at a negotiation table. Based on what I was told in my interview, I believed I would not be reviewing, revising, or drafting contracts immediately. I would be cross-trained by another lawyer on the team and that lawyer would provide support during that training process.

Well, you know what they say about “the best laid plans of mice and men.” Things rarely work out the way you expect. Soon after I began my tenure with my new employer, the lawyer who was primarily responsible for contract review began an emergency leave, and my employer looked to me to help pick up the slack while that lawyer was out. It was in that moment I realized I would need to learn what contract review was all about.

When I first began reviewing contracts, I believed that my only job was to check the contract using a list of standard terms and conditions acceptable to my employer. It wasn’t until years later that I came to realize that contract review required more than just ensuring that the contract contained acceptable standard terms and conditions included on a checklist. Contract review required a comprehensive analysis of the entire agreement, considering legal, business, and risk management aspects.

Here are several ways in which I came to understand that contract review needed to extend beyond a simple checklist:

Business deal. Contract review involves understanding the specific business goals and objectives that the contract aims to achieve. This requires a deep understanding of the business deal. When you understand the business deal, it is easier to ensure that the contract is designed to help achieve those business goals and objectives.

Risk analysis. Contract review involves identifying potential risks associated with the agreement. This includes legal risks, financial risks, operational risks, and more. If you identify the risks and you understand your employer’s tolerance for risk, you will be in a better position to assess strategies to mitigate these risks and ensure that your employer is well-protected.

Legal compliance. Contract review involves ensuring that the contract is in line with relevant laws and regulations. It involves an understanding of the legal landscape and any specific industry regulations that may apply.

Industry specific. Contract review often involves ensuring that the contract is tailored toward your employer’s industry, the nature of the transaction, and the parties involved. A checklist alone may not capture these nuances.

Realistic and measurable performance metrics and KPIs. Contract review involves taking a close look at the performance metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) contained within the contract. When reviewing a contract, ensuring that the metrics align with your employer’s broader business objectives and that the metrics are realistic and measurable is important.

Dispute resolution. Contract review involves an evaluation of dispute resolution mechanisms, ensuring that those mechanisms are fair, efficient, and practical. This involves considering alternative dispute resolution methods such as mediation or arbitration.

Post-execution considerations. Contract review involves more than just getting the deal done. It involves ensuring that the parties have thought about and included terms that relate to contract management, renewal, and termination.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Communication and collaboration. Contract review involves collaboration with various stakeholders, including internal business units, leadership, and other relevant parties, to ensure a holistic perspective is considered.

Technological integration. Contract review may involve leveraging existing technology, such as contract management software or artificial intelligence, to enhance efficiency and identify potential issues. If the contract relates to software, making sure that it can be integrated with existing software systems is important.

If you take anything away from this article, I hope it is this: While a checklist is a useful tool for ensuring that basic terms are present, contract review is a more holistic process that considers the broader business and legal context, risks, and relationship dynamics. It is a multifaceted analysis aimed at optimizing the value and minimizing the risks associated with contractual agreements.

What a difference a year makes when it comes to bonus announcements. Back in 2020, this firm was the [first one out of the gate](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/), leading the market on bonuses, and in 2021, it’s back to business as usual, following along with all the other firms.

We’re talking about Baker McKenzie, of course, and last Friday, while bonuses were still lagging (because Biglaw firms at large were waiting on Davis Polk’s then forthcoming announcement), the firm made a little announcement of its own: a match would soon be on the way.

Colin H. Murray, the firm’s CEO for North America, sent this message to associates:

By now you may have seen some announcements regarding a new bonus scale. The NA Leadership Team remains committed to pay market compensation and we do intend to match the prevailing scale for our U.S. Offices. A more detailed email regarding the new bonus scale and the Special Bonus eligibility will follow soon in early December.

This is, essentially, a big fat IOU note. Baker McKenzie didn’t know if the prevailing bonus scale had yet been settled, but at least leadership let associates know that bonuses would be coming down the line as soon as a final scale had been decided.

(And the “special bonus eligibility” Murray speaks of here has nothing to do with the newly announced Davis Polk special bonuses. He’s not psychic; he’s talking about the special bonuses the firm announced last April, with a January 2022 payout date, based on annualized hours as of year-end. We covered those [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/biggest-law-firm-in-the-country-announces-special-bonuses/).)

Congratulations to everyone at the firm on your future bonus matches!

“Wordsmithing! It’s all wordsmithing!!”

The client was upset. There I was, a junior associate who had innocently forwarded a few changes — okay, a lot of changes — to a registration statement to R.R. Donnelley. I didn’t know there was a per-word charge. Wasn’t the client paying a gargantuan Biglaw bill anyway? What did a few dollars per word to the financial printer matter? How much could it be? However much it was, it mattered to the general counsel. She had me put on the brakes.

“Tell me one thing. Point out one change to me — one change, just one change — that’s not mere wordsmithing. Just one.”

I knew the few edits I had were wordsmithing, because I barely knew what was going on back in those days (other than having some vague sense I was a sleep-deprived securities lawyer in Biglaw). But there were two partners on the deal, which was a little unusual in pre-financial crisis days, and they had both given me lots and lots and lots of edits. Surely a few of these were important.

“I’m waiting.”

Um, okay, time to think on my feet. I looked over the edits. Placing a list of numbers in descending order — yeah, I don’t think that edit is going to cut it. Passive to active voice? Maybe normally, but not right this second. Changing all straight quotation marks to curved? Yeah, right. But what is this? Maybe this one — ….

“Gary?!”

In my most authoritative Biglaw voice: “Here on page 17, there are several references to the company being able to spend a certain percentage of the members’ investments. We’ve changed all of these to “up to” the certain percentage, which is much better because it gives the company flexibility in case it doesn’t end up spending that exact amount. It’s important to preserve flexibility.” Whew! I had come through. Relief.

“We are going to spend every dime we can, that’s a ridiculous answer.”

Rats. Deflated, I gave up. “Um, let me ask [partner] when he gets back. I don’t always know what they’re thinking, and I don’t want to tell you none of these edits are important until I check with him.”

“Humph.” (She didn’t really say “humph.” But I sure felt a “humph” coming through the phone.)

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The senior partner materialized in my doorway. He slowly turned each page, looking over each edit one by one. After what seemed like an eternity, he turned to me and said, “none of these are vital.”

“I knew it,” said the general counsel later.

Are we merely wordsmithing, or are we adding value? If we’re only wordsmithing, our clients might as well be paying an editor $40 an hour instead of whatever it is we’re charging. Often we think we’ve really added value by, say, making sure each item in a list of factors is of similar length, but was that what the client was hoping to get out of our time?

In SmallLaw, our clients generally work with tighter legal budgets, so it becomes important to know when to take the time to make edits only a fellow lawyer would appreciate. Clients who have moved much of their legal work from Biglaw to SmallLaw consistently tell me they really didn’t mind paying $600/hour for the Biglaw partner. The wisdom and judgment the partners had were worth it. But they hated paying $300 (or more) an hour for associates to move words around. Thousands and thousands of dollars to review a document, often with no appreciable benefit.

The junior partner on the deal I referred to above kept insisting, “But these edits have to be made!” And to those of us who have been doing this a while, seeing numbers listed as “300, 4000, 78, 40” triggers a reaction similar to being stung by a bee. Oh my God, the 4000 must come first. Otherwise, it’s wrong. But is it “wrong” in that sense that the SEC is going to reject the filing because of it? Are investors not going to invest because the numbers weren’t in descending order? I didn’t even know that was a rule until I got to Biglaw, so I don’t really think a pension fund that would be otherwise interested is going to take a pass on investing because the “4000” was out of place. The general counsel sure didn’t seem to think so.

Here where I live in the world of securities law, I’m often drafting SEC filings that are not public. It doesn’t serve my client’s interests to spend hours and hours on a filing that’s only going to be seen by a handful of people at the SEC, trying to make sure it’s as readable as a Hemingway short story or an ATL column. My review to make sure the document meets the applicable legal requirements and that nothing can be later interpreted as inaccurate or misleading is where I’m adding value. Not me wordsmithing.

# Biglaw Associates Are Lateraling To Escape Returning To The Office In COVID Times
## If your firm has a remote work policy, it should stand by it instead of forcing associates to go to the office.

I spoke to an associate who told me that she’s otherwise happy at her job, but her main reason for seeking a new role is that she is being basically bullied into going in four days a week. She’s not comfortable with it.

— [Kate Reder Sheikh](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/kate-reder-sheikh?byconsultantorauthor=kate-reder-sheikh), a managing director for recruiting firm Major Lindsey & Africa, commenting on the woes of lateral candidates who are being [pressured to return to the office](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/big-law-remote-work-becoming-risky-career-move-associates-say) now that their firms have reopened. Many firms have publicly announced remote work policies that seem to accommodate associates, but according to Duane Morris partner [Jonathan Segal](https://www.duanemorris.com/attorneys/jonathanasegal.html), who advises other firms on workplace issues, those could be meaningless. “The most wonderfully-constructed policy means naught if a partner for whom an associate works makes clear, by words or actions, that any remote work is disfavored,” he said.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# The Lawyer Holiday Gift Guide: The Best Gifts For The Attorney In Your Life

We’ve done this gift guide for a number of years now and, generally, the process is simple: consider the broad categories of gifts you might want to get the fickle lawyer or law student in your life and update the previous edition with the hot new offerings. 

But a funny thing happened when we started working on this year’s gift guide. It turns out we spend a good deal of this guide hyping office apparel and desk toys and cool business luggage. But as we stare down work from home set ups for [at least the next five months](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/01/health/us-coronavirus-tuesday/index.html), and some firms toying with extending the policy at least on a voluntary basis through the end of next year, this is a good time to take stock of what your lawyer really needs.

For instance, we’d never considered that what lawyers might REALLY need right now are new baby gates for either the child they have to watch while working or the new dog they bought in a fit of loneliness. Or that the hot electronic device every lawyer can’t live without isn’t the latest ePaper device but a reliable Wifi extender.

###Books
Do you have a reader on your hands? Of course you do, you’re buying for an attorney! Grab a nice book to curl up with this holiday season — or to read on their next flight to some far-flung deposition.

It would be the good kind of surreal to start reading [Election Meltdown: Dirty Tricks, Distrust, and the Threat to American Democracy by Rick Hasen](https://amzn.to/2VpWnql) on December 26. The book was prepared before the Iowa Caucuses gave us all a preview of how our expectations of election results were poised to create mischief. He may not have seen it ending with Rudy Giuliani leaking on stage, but Professor Hasen outlined a lot of the problems we ended up seeing when [we chatted with him back in February](https://legaltalknetwork.com/podcasts/thinking-like-a-lawyer/2020/02/election-law-special-with-rick-hasen/).

America’s most famous Thomas M. Cooley Law School graduate put out his memoir this year. It’s understandable if you don’t think your special someone would appreciate contributing to the financial rehabilitation of Donald Trump’s long-time fixer, but as an historical artifact [Disloyal: A Memoir by Michael Cohen](https://amzn.to/3lAjFEJ) is fascinating. If nothing else, it’s a good lesson in how not to conduct a legal career.

There is no book that will ever convey the transition from law school to actual practice, but [The Young Lawyer’s Jungle Book: A Survival Guide](https://amzn.to/3lrdKBM) and [Survival Guide for the New Lawyer](https://amzn.to/36r9dec) endeavor to get as close as any text can.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
For the business-minded out there, consider [The Client-Centered Law Firm](https://amzn.to/3qjZUor). Clio CEO Jack Newton basically brings Dale Carnegie to the legal industry. Corporate management training has thrived for decades, but attorneys have, either stubbornly or innocently, avoided a lot of the lessons that could be lifted from the business world to create a thriving law practice. Bob Ambrogi [wrote a book review here](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/01/book-review-a-manual-on-becoming-a-client-centered-firm-from-clio-ceo-jack-newton/).

[Smoke But No Fire](https://amzn.to/2JgaY5j) shines a light on the disturbing process of convicting the innocent of crimes… that [never even exist](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/the-fight-against-convictions-where-no-crimes-exist/). Cassie Chambers probably didn’t intend [Hill Women: Finding Family and a Way Forward in the Appalachian Mountains](https://amzn.to/2JB0HjD) to be the answer to the question, “What if Hillbilly Elegy, but JD Vance wasn’t an asshole?” but it does, more or less, [answer that question](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/how-family-can-propel-you-to-the-elite-of-the-legal-profession/). Finally, the [Cult of the Constitution by Professor Mary Anne Franks](https://amzn.to/3qbDHZs) deals with the rise of [constitutional fundamentalism](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/yup-constitutional-diehards-are-a-cult/) probably best parodied by the Onion headline: [Area Man Passionate Defender Of What He Imagines Constitution To Be](https://www.theonion.com/area-man-passionate-defender-of-what-he-imagines-consti-1819571149).

###electronics
We’ll get to the super serious stuff in a second, but this is an amazing gift for lawyers that can be used at home or back in the office. The [Ember Mug](https://amzn.to/37momgg) allows the user to set the ideal temperature for their coffee or tea — and then keeps it there.

Have you heard your lawyers or law students rumbling about Internet connectivity? We can’t solve the nation’s chronic underinvestment in broadband capacity, driven by a cynically destructive anti-net neutrality policy and a complicit government, but we can help with routers. I struggled with Internet connections for years before investing in the [Google Nest mesh system](https://amzn.to/3lseN4j). It extends the range of a network while passing devices seamlessly between hubs to keep the connections strong across the house. There are a lot of products in this guide that I’m recommending second-hand based on input from other ATL staffers or reliable tipsters, but this one I can personally attest works like a dream.

These are only a couple of many options, but consider giving the gift of [noise-cancelling earbuds](https://amzn.to/3qjZtKA) or [headphones](https://amzn.to/36ocOd0). Home brings distractions and lawyers need to drown that all out and bill some time.

Have you considered how many devices attorneys need? If you have, then you might imagine the home office is a tangle of power cords befitting an Aliens set. This can help with [a whopping TEN OUTLETS](https://amzn.to/39yt0KG).

With the loss of Justice Ginsburg this year, some may be in a mood to honor the late justice. [Dissent Pins](https://dissentpins.com) sells a line of [pins and necklaces in honor of the justice](https://dissentpins.com/collections/rbg) and Etsy offers [some cute Supreme Court pins as well](https://www.etsy.com/listing/548266705/the-supremes-sotomayor-ginsburg-kagen?gpla=1&gao=1&utm_campaign=shopping_us_BoredInc_sfc_osa&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_custom1=0&utm_content=5436016&gclid=Cj0KCQiAiZPvBRDZARIsAORkq7eRKoh3MOfNO28WPwr1MOKxn_goZ_bvotEGhIQNaIGfdBosuUJroDEaAsX_EALw_wcB).

On that note, is there a more 2020 gift than a hot new mask? This mask [honors the women of the Supreme Court](https://www.etsy.com/listing/883164242/3d-icons-supreme-court-female-justices?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=sotomayor&ref=sr_gallery-1-7&organic_search_click=1&frs=1&cns=1). It was made before Amy Coney Barrett but if we’ve learned anything about the new justice it’s that she doesn’t have much use for masks — or science — anyway. Here’s one of [RBG’s collar](https://www.etsy.com/listing/874146427/notorious-rbg-face-mask-with-lace?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=lawyer+masks&ref=sc_gallery-1-1&plkey=2489ec1ae734ee07ea6ac90a64f1e5c77b1d4b54%3A874146427&frs=1) and a [specific dissent mask](https://www.etsy.com/listing/900610351/fabric-face-mask-i-dissent-mug-rbg?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=law+school+masks&ref=sc_gallery-1-6&plkey=a05aba3069b74329653b15a0f0957d6c40738cd0%3A900610351&pro=1). Beyond the Supreme Court, here’s [a Litigator mask](https://www.etsy.com/listing/843412341/lawyer-a-litigator-mask-reusable-fabric?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=lawyer+masks&ref=sr_gallery-1-46&organic_search_click=1&pro=1&frs=1) And, hey, [one for the paralegal who makes all the lawyers look good](https://www.etsy.com/listing/832739416/paralegal-face-mask-relax-the-paralegal?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=law+firm+masks&ref=sr_gallery-1-8&organic_search_click=1&frs=1).

Do you have a law student in need of the [perfect accessory for an ugly sweater party?](https://www.etsy.com/listing/884278513/law-school-student-ugly-holiday-sweater?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=law+school+masks&ref=sr_gallery-1-30&organic_search_click=1)

If you’re looking for [chic loungewear so your lawyer can live their best work-from-home life](https://fashionista.com/2018/06/work-from-home-clothing-outfits-style), our sibling publication Fashionista provides some suggestions.

[ESK Esq.](https://amzn.to/2Ec9yog) has a whole line of apparel for the lawyer out there including a stylized view of glorious [Blackacre](https://amzn.to/2EcruPx) of Property Law fame and an [International Shoe logo](https://amzn.to/2QcfxQm) for Civ Pro nerds. If you’re buying for a law student this season, [consider this Lawyer-Loading shirt](https://www.bustedtees.com/products/lawyer-loading-11211?_pos=6&_sid=a49bbe883&_ss=r) or this shirt featuring the [refrain of law students everywhere](https://www.teepublic.com/t-shirt/2780897-i-cant-im-in-law-school).

What about [a foul-mouthed lawyer](https://www.teepublic.com/t-shirt/7120142-lawyers-cuss-too-much)? We’ve got that covered too.

Here’s a shirt for every good Sunny fan who knows the benefit of a [solid education in Bird Law](https://www.teepublic.com/t-shirt/595674-bird-law?utm_source=paid_search&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=PLA&utm_content=t-shirt-child-1&feed_sku=595674D1V19G79A43C26S&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=PLA&ar_clx=yes&ar_channel=google&ar_campaign=959377862&ar_adgroup=56762606543&ar_ad=383964090637&ar_strategy=search&gclid=Cj0KCQiAiZPvBRDZARIsAORkq7dJM0Wnx7HH8838fTa4ifgSlpmc5shFQrWC2rl3TSqHi1cBS1sGoRsaAm1vEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds). Here’s a [Nelson & Murdock shirt](http://amzn.to/2pJHA94) for the comic book set — I’m still searching for a Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway shirt for the fan that wants to be really obscure.

There won’t be office holiday parties this year — hopefully — but there is a shirt you can wear on the [awkward office Zoom party](https://amzn.to/33yt9Kt).

What better stocking stuffer than… [stockings](http://amzn.to/2pcSdjI).

Finally, is there [anything lawyerly about these slippers](https://amzn.to/39tcoE9)? No. Are these essential footwear for the stay-at-home lawyer? Yes.

###Games
You’re stuck at home. You may as well have some fun with the situation.

It’s not so much a “game” but the [Magnetic Poetry set lawyer edition](https://amzn.to/3llLsZi)

The [LAWSUIT! board game](https://amzn.to/2Edm32V) is still around. The game’s setting is the day-to-day operation of a law firm where players bring fictitious lawsuits with whimsical premises, and can elect to settle or appeal cases.

Approach the Bench makes [bottle stoppers](https://approachthebench.com/product/wine-bottle-stopper/), [ornaments](https://approachthebench.com/product/holiday-ornament-figure/), and lawyer, Judge, and Blind Justice [chocolate bars](https://approachthebench.com/product/chocolate-figure/)!

###FOOD & DRINK
There’s no more kitchen or cafeteria stocked with goodies down the hall. Now you’ve got to do all that on your own. So how about [a super mini-fridge to keep your home office stocked](https://amzn.to/3qknCRt). It’s portable and plugs in to keep things cool (or warm). It’s not much bigger than a lunchbox, but it can keep you covered for the day.

Also… Jot.

Seriously, Jot is concentrated ultra coffee that you can get delivered to your home — which is, again, your new office. I’m merely one link on a word of mouth campaign and everyone I’ve seen test this stuff has gotten hooked. [Here’s a code for a discount on your first order](https://go.referralcandy.com/share/C9X9G7G).

This [wine bottle holder](http://amzn.to/2j6K66G) has been on the list for years and it’s just so delightfully weird that it comes all the way back around into awesome. There’s some serious detail work on this thing.

Or for the more honest out there, we have this [World’s Okayest Lawyer Mug](https://amzn.to/2Eabeyp).

What better way to get into the holiday spirit than to enjoy some holiday spirits? [Caskers](https://www.caskers.com/?ref=MDoyOjliZjA2MTIwNjgyMjUzYjk6VjN3UjlxUEc4VUJrR1ZldFF5ZGFYZz09), founded by Harvard Law grads, curates all varieties of the best craft spirits from around the world and offers discounts of up to 40% of retail prices.

[Teak & Twine](https://www.teakandtwine.com/) offers gift boxes for all people and occasions. While everything is customizable, the [Holiday Home Office](https://www.teakandtwine.com/products/holiday-home-office-gift) and [The Foodie](https://www.teakandtwine.com/products/the-foodie) seem like great options.

[Chocolate Text](https://www.chocolatetext.com) lets you send chocolate messages to anyone you desire. Personally, I’d go for “You’ve Been Served.” You can also order a “Selfie Tin.” Simply upload a picture and Chocolate Text places it on a tin of your choice of sweet treats. The perfect place for that photo of your favorite lawyer shaking hands with a Supreme Court justice or walking up to get their degree.

Is a lawyer having a good day or a bad day? This [wine glass](http://amzn.to/2q2MVM2) will let everyone know. Meanwhile this wine glass [explains why the lawyer is drinking today](https://www.etsy.com/listing/646293560/because-clients-cute-funny-stemless-wine?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=lawyer&ref=sc_gallery-1-5&plkey=2a0736c609aa3fdcc07d91a157191f42548c0e07%3A646293560&frs=1).

If you know someone who worked in the Trump administration, [might we suggest this gift](https://amzn.to/3muEOkD).

And, honestly, without being able to go to the store as often as I’d like, I’ve taken to ordering groceries. Did you know [FreshDirect offers gift certificates](https://www.freshdirect.com/gift_card/purchase/landing.jsp)? In case the lawyer you know is a big fan of meat, I’ve [taken to using ButcherBox](http://fbuy.me/p03P9) and it’s done wonders for keeping me stocked while on extended lockdown.

###Desk Toys & Office Decor
Someday, lawyers will get back to spending most of their lives behind their desks, so why not spice up the office a little? Sure they might appreciate a framed picture of their loved ones, but these thoughtful trinkets might make for better conversation pieces. Or maybe they’ll just make you smile in between Zoom conference calls.

Help the lawyer you love sit in style. This is a [stylish swivel chair](https://www.horchow.com/Angela-Swivel-Desk-Chair/cprod153950095/p.prod) that emphasizes the home in home office and will not look out of place when the lawyer goes back to having to have people over. If they aren’t the sort who worries about that sort of thing — or if they have a dedicated office space that doesn’t need to match the decor — they might appreciate the more [modern ergonomic office chair look](https://amzn.to/3lsz8GG) or this [super old school leather lawyer chair look](https://amzn.to/37o3epU). Personally, I like this one that [splits the difference](https://amzn.to/3ohEczh).

If they need a home desk — which most lawyers probably have by now, but law grads starting new jobs in 2021 might not — this is a [nice entry level home option](https://amzn.to/3lopLI9) that gets the job done without overwhelming the studio apartment.

As mentioned above, whether the lawyer is juggling child care with work or trying to keep their new dog at bay, consider [some baby gates](https://www.summerinfant.com/gates/custom-fit-walk-thru-gate-grey). I don’t have the need to lock up either, but the recommendation we’ve got from other ATL staffers is that this is “the best baby corral ever created!” We’ve also been told that this [3-in-1 potty training toilet](https://amzn.to/3fWzPaf) is essential for the working person who has to simultaneously teach a kid the ropes.

And then there are Funko Pops. You know, those big head toys that seem to be everywhere these days. They even make [Golden Girls Funko Pops](https://amzn.to/3lsHXjM) now, which seems like the border of market saturation. But there are some legal Pops out there like this one of [Matt Murdock](http://amzn.to/2ix3KZO) or this [lawyer She-Hulk one](https://amzn.to/2Y8OeH8). There’s a Citadel-dwelling [Lawyer Morty](http://amzn.to/2yZDBcB) from Rick and Morty. And, obviously, there’s [Saul Goodman](http://amzn.to/2j7FkWv) and [Jimmy McGill](http://amzn.to/2hLVNmK). For that matter, [Abraham Lincoln was a lawyer](https://amzn.to/2Pa9vfw).

It’s not exactly meant for the desk, but this is a nice decorative touch for the office. It’s a framed copy of the [patent artwork for the gavel](https://www.etsy.com/listing/129726284/judge-gavel-patent-art-wall-hanging/). Specifically, U.S. Patent 2,755,833 — also known as the Hollow-Headed Gavel With Telescopic Handle Section.

Someone at CafePress has a [billable hours clock](http://www.cafepress.com/+lawyer39s_wall_clock,75582193) available to mix decor with some wit.

###movies & Television
Lawyers may not have a lot of free time, but when they have a chance to catch up with the world, they can thank you for providing them something fantastic for their viewing pleasure.

Like the [complete series of Law & Order](http://amzn.to/2jGnPR2). If you wanted to know what twenty season bundle of disks looks like, well there you go.

Speaking of series, the complete runs of [Perry Mason](http://amzn.to/2zQvx0Z), [Matlock](http://amzn.to/2yZMYJ0), and [Ally McBeal](http://amzn.to/2B3w9i6) are all available. Personally, I’d take the [various seasons of Harvey Bridman](http://amzn.to/2z06Dsv) or [Better Call Saul](https://amzn.to/2Qeg3gR) though.

Classical movie buffs might appreciate this [50th Anniversary Edition of 12 Angry Men](http://amzn.to/2yYVyYt) or an opportunity to [revisit Atticus Finch](http://amzn.to/2yY4w8D) before he became a racist in Go Set A Watchman. On the ridiculous side, perhaps they’d enjoy Al Pacino’s turn as Satan in [Devil’s Advocate](http://amzn.to/2yY7FFh). Then there’s the greatest courtroom film of all time, [My Cousin Vinny](http://amzn.to/2zRhZCs).

###Luggage
[](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WH72OA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003WH72OA&linkCode=as2&tag=dealbreaker-20&linkId=4JREDL2MVQIZALOY)
The essential gift for a traveling lawyer! Remember when lawyers would travel?

The [ScanFast Briefcase](http://amzn.to/2zSwoy3) from Mobile Edge is a TSA-compliant laptop bag that allows the traveler to keep their laptop inside their bag while passing through TSA security checkpoints. This makes traveling with your laptop simple while keeping your laptop secure.

For a less standard design, [check out this option](http://amzn.to/2B3gxLs) (which also comes in three other color combinations). The bag is still TSA-compliant and boasts rich pink suede and brown faux-leather exterior highlighted by a bright color-accented satin lining. A matching shoulder strap, separate zippered workstation for files, and a trolley strap for rolling luggage included. Carries a Lifetime Warranty!

Seriously, peruse all of the MobileEdge offerings while shopping.

If you come across any more cool holiday gift ideas for attorneys, send them our way! We’re always looking to add more to the annual guide.
