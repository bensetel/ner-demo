# Drug-Addicted Biglaw Partner Dies During Conference Call

Peter, one of the most successful people I have ever known, died a drug addict, felled by a systemic bacterial infection common to intravenous users.

Of all the heartbreaking details of his story, the one that continues to haunt me is this: The history on his cellphone shows the last call he ever made was for work. Peter, vomiting, unable to sit up, slipping in and out of consciousness, had managed, somehow, to dial into a conference call.

— An excerpt from an [incredibly depressing (but important) New York Times piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/15/business/lawyers-addiction-mental-health.html?referer=https://t.co/yC2awPz6C6?amp=1) written by Eilene Zimmerman about her late ex-husband, Peter, a partner in the intellectual property group at Wilson Sonsini, and the trials and tribulations that lawyers who use and abuse drugs and alcohol go through on a daily basis as they try to find success in the legal profession.

UPDATE: Do you want to win a free helicopter trip to JFK? [Enter our contest here](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/tell-us-your-craziest-travel-story-win-a-prize/).

Have you ever found yourself furiously scrambling around the office to finish up the last loose-ends so you can get out to the airport for that early evening flight to who knows where to conduct the 30th in a stream of inevitably irrelevant depositions? Trying to get that last matter off your desk so you can avoid spending security nervously checking your watch and wondering if you’ll make it. It’s excruciating. Especially when you realize you’re about to spend over an hour crammed into a black car your firm booked because catching a cab during the rush hour shift change is madness, pure and simple.

It may make for a good story after the fact, but it’s not exactly an enjoyable use of your time.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Nor is it particularly productive for your client. That black car is going to run them big bucks — perhaps upwards of $200 — when it’s all said and done. Ultimately you’re going to end up billing some of that commute too and, at your rate, that could run them another couple hundred at least.

So why don’t you take a helicopter from the airport like some benevolent plutocrat? That might sound crazy and may seem like a hard sell to a client, but if you could get from Manhattan to JFK in a tenth of an hour of billable time for a mere $295, then it’s actually crazy not to consider it.

And even if you aren’t going on the client’s dime, it’s a no-brainer. If you’re an associate, you are, after all, a “HENRY” as one might put it. “High-Earner, Not Rich Yet.” Shelling under $300 for the luxury of a hassle-free trip to JFK is more than worth it.

That’s what you can get with Blade, a private aviation company that offers — among other trips — a rush hour-conquering 5 or so minute flight [from Midtown Manhattan to JFK](https://www.flyblade.com/bounce/) for $295. It’s the best trip you can take as a Biglaw attorney if you’re ever traveling to or from New York. And, stay tuned, because we’ll be giving away some free trips from Blade over the coming days.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Last week, Blade offered me the chance to try the JFK excursion and I decided, why not live out my infantile desire to put on my best faux Schwarzenegger and yell “Get to the choppah!” to people actually getting on a chopper. And the whole experience convinced me that this is the way to go if you’re ever even thinking of booking a flight after work.

Before we even get to the flight, let’s set the stage. Blade runs this flight out of their lounge at the West 30th Street Heliport on the far side of the West Side Highway every weekday at 5:15 p.m.

To interject, while every attorney could benefit from this service, this will be an absolute MUST for Boies and Milbank lawyers [moving to the new Hudson Yards complex](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/the-hot-new-location-for-biglaw/). You’re going to be within walking distance of the chopper.

You walk up to a seemingly sparse trailer along the water that doesn’t begin to suggest what you find inside. Suddenly you’re in a well-appointed lounge surrounded by images of famous helicopters — think Marine One and the Batcopter. A flight attendant dressed straight out of a vintage Pan Am ad checks your name against her register and offers you a drink from the full bar. I chose a Maker’s on the rocks… as one does when they’re about to take a chopper around New York on a windy Thursday.

After chatting with some of the other passengers while snacking on the complimentary chocolate covered almonds, the helicopter arrived. We surrendered our drinks (temporarily — our hostess made sure we got them back once we were secured on the aircraft) and walked out to the waiting helicopter.

Now there’s no sugar-coating it: the helicopter is a tight fit. Unless you score the seat up front next to the pilot, it’s a cozy vehicle. But you’re not going to be in it very long anyway. Less than a minute later, you’re pulling away from the helipad and off over the Hudson river.

It’s easy to forget this is all about convenience when the views are so stunning. The 5:15 p.m. departure in late January guarantees the setting sun reflects off every building as you make your way to the airport.

And then you’re there. Just like that. You hop off the airport into a private aviation terminal where a van is ready to take you to your airline’s terminal.

Or… well, Blade offers private charters too but that’s a whole other ball of wax. If you’re looking for [a quick excursion to Miami](https://www.flyblade.com/destinations/miami/) or a [quick lift to the Hamptons](https://www.flyblade.com/destinations/hamptons/) or [a charter anywhere](https://www.flyblade.com/charters/), they can hook you up.

(In the interest of full disclosure, Blade is not an advertiser, but they are giving us seats on their JFK helicopter as a promotion that we will be giving away to readers… watch Above the Law over the next few days to see how you can win them.)

Bigger may not always be better, but it does mean more money. Since Cravath announced the new scale for associate salaries, the top of Biglaw has been busy putting their size and cash to good use — raising associate salaries.

The latest firm to announce a new compensation scale for associates is White & Case. The firm made $2,828,000,000 in gross revenue last year, making it #7 on the Am Law 100 ranking, so they have the means to match these raises.

The new salary — and bonus — scale at the firm is as follows:


Bonuses will be paid February 14, 2024.

You can read the full memo on [the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/white-case-compensation-23/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Biglaw Job Offers WITHOUT Interviews?? What Hath The Hot Lateral Market Wrought?
## Biglaw firms find they need to move on sought after laterals before they've even had a chance to interview them.

We already know that Biglaw is super busy and there really aren’t enough qualified lawyers out there to handle all of the work. That has led to intense competition for qualified associates and begat a scorching [hot lateral market](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/the-biglaw-lateral-market-is-fire-right-now/) with all manner of repercussions, like [special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/davis-polk-bonuses-21/), [signing bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/biglaws-throwing-around-500000-signing-bonuses-in-red-hot-lateral-market/), [retention bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/is-skadden-arps-handing-out-retention-bonuses-to-only-some-associates/), [raises](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2021-associate-salary-increase/) — basically a lot of money is being thrown around.

But the competition for the best — or even just warm bodies — is intense. The latest proof of that is a trend of Biglaw firms hiring associates without an interview. Yup, you read that correctly, based solely on the strength on a lateral’s resume, there are firms taking a risk and bringing on attorneys. As an anonymous partner[ told Law.com](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/the-biglaw-lateral-market-is-fire-right-now/) of the trend:

“In any other year you’d have said it was stupid,” one of the partners said. “But competition for people has become so heated that big law firms are truncating what is normally a process of months into a matter of weeks.”

A recruiter also weighed in on the lowering of standards brought on by the competition for lateral attorneys:

“In an odd way [recruiting on the spot] makes sense for firms, so they are able to tell a client, ‘Well hey, we can actually do the deal now because we have the manpower’. So they’re locking people in before the interviews even take place. Or, alternatively, interviews are changing shape altogether. They’re informal. It’s now more about ‘let’s make sure they’re not crazy’, rather than ‘are they a good fit for us’.”

The recruiter added: “It’s either this, or the client goes elsewhere and you risk losing them forever.”

Another partner dished on the boon to associates looking to make a lateral move:

“Firms need people to get deals that are happening now over the line. So if you’ve got the firm history, training at a top firm, then firms are telling you, yes.”

Similarly, a partner at an elite U.K. firm said: “My friends who are partners at other firms have said that if somebody has a CV with relevant experience, they’re just hiring them on the spot.”

They added: “It’s definitely a good time to be somebody looking for a job.”

I haven’t seen such a bold hiring decision since Notre Dame took a flyer on Charlie Weis. Let’s hope it works out better for firms than it did for the Irish.

# Biglaw Firm Kindly Asks You To Stop Pointing Out That Their Client Cages Children

While lawyers, from the ranks of Biglaw to solo practitioners, line up to protect the rights of families separated at the border by the opportunistic gang of hooligans who’ve ensconced themselves in the White House, one Biglaw firm is out there making the world safe for the profiteers making a fortune off institutionalized racial animus. And if you’re wondering which firm’s staked its good name on aiding America’s private prison companies as they come under [increasing scrutiny](https://www.thenation.com/article/private-contractors-enable-trumps-cruelties-border/) for their [history of abuses](http://thinkprogress.org/immigration/2015/04/05/3642880/karnes-hunger-strike/), that would be our friends over at Holland & Knight.

Yes, apparently on the eve of on-campus interviewing, Holland & Knight decided the right move for their business was carving out the Make Biglaw Great Again slice of the market by backing up private prison company GEO Group, which just happens to be [ICE’s biggest contractor](https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/boca-ratons-geo-group-is-ices-top-contractor-10504265).

On the one hand, everyone deserves counsel willing to zealously defend their interests. On the other hand, part of zealousness is protecting your client from making a complete ass of themselves on a national stage. The sort of assification that follows sending laughable cease and desist letters to activist groups for reporting on the company’s unpleasant track record.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In a letter sent last week to Miami’s [Dream Defenders](https://www.dreamdefenders.org), Holland & Knight partner [Carolyn Short](https://www.hklaw.com/Carolyn-Short/) demanded the group stop inciting protests of GEO Group facilities and remove a number of “false and defamatory” statements from their website and social media. Specifically:

The false and defamatory statements in Dream Defenders’ publications include:

* Blatantly false allegations that GEO “separates” families;
* Blatantly false allegations that GEO “cages” children;
* Blatantly false allegations that GEO “puts Black, Latino and poor White people into jail;” and
* Blatantly false accusations that GEO asserts improper influence over the United States political system and an incorrect publication of a list of individuals to whom GEO supposedly made political contributions.

Except… GEO Group does every one of these things. Now, to be fair, the company can certainly make a semantic case that they don’t, but defamation claims don’t tend to favor hypertechnicalities.

Of course, GEO Group only detains people at the behest of the government. No one reads the Dream Defenders and thinks GEO Group is unilaterally kidnapping people across the country. But the problem with acting as an agent is, you know, becoming an agent. You can’t really say you’re not a participant in the scheme anymore and at the point that GEO is the one that physically puts kids in cages this becomes entirely fair criticism.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As for GEO Group’s lobbying efforts, [which are substantial](https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000022003), the company maintains that it doesn’t advocate for specific policies that increase needless incarceration, it only pushes the “benefits” of a public-private partnership. Unfortunately, this requires an astonishing level of naivete to swallow. That the lobbyists never tell a legislator “increase penalties” has little impact on the level of influence the company has in increasing incarceration by poisoning its “private-public partnership” agreements with provisions [requiring governments to increase enrollment lest they face financial penalties](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/04/28/how-for-profit-prisons-have-become-the-biggest-lobby-no-one-is-talking-about/?utm_term=.1a2f2371d9e4).

Everything about this letter is ill-advised. It’s not just the flimsy outline of a defamation claim, but the fact that this is just an engraved invitation for activists to tee-off on GEO Group’s tortured reasoning to create a public relations nightmare. I mean, the client runs private prisons, not ice cream stores! Most Americans are unaware that private prisons even exist, let alone the names of these companies. They don’t bank on a glowing public profile, they just need to keep their head down and hope no one catches on.

But now Holland & Knight’s made this a story and Dream Defenders got the opportunity to mock GEO Group with a widespread audience:

It isn’t only immigrant children and their families who are at risk. You’ve profited off of the incarceration of Black, Latino, and poor white youth in the criminal justice system for years. A federal court found that your operation of a youth prison in Mississippi “allowed a cesspool of unconstitutional and inhuman acts and conditions to germinate” and placed youth at “substantial ongoing risk.”

We guess you would prefer us to call your operations “academies,” “treatment centers,” “leadership development programs,” “residential facilities”, “family detention centers” or one of the many other euphemisms you list on your website? We’ll stick with the truth. You are caging children.

The whole letter, and the linked evidence it provides (links don’t appear to be working in the version on the next page, sorry), is damning. And it would have never cropped up to news outlets but for this boneheaded strategy of threatening protestors who are always struggling just to be heard above the noise of complacency.

# Which Biglaw Firms Still Require Summer Associates To Sign Mandatory Arbitration Agreements?
## The results are far from complete, but still provide meaningful information for students in law school.

When news broke that Munger Tolles & Olson was attempting to have the incoming summer associate class [sign mandatory arbitration agreements](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/biglaw-firm-tries-to-force-summer-associates-to-arbitrate-sexual-harassment-claims/?rf=1) it… didn’t go well for the firm. Faced with tremendous backlash, the firm responded to the outcry by admitting their mistake and backtracking on the mandatory arbitration clause for all employees. Other firms like [Orrick](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/this-biglaw-firm-is-the-first-to-step-forward-and-do-away-with-mandatory-arbitration-for-all-employees/?rf=1) and [Skadden](http://www.law.com/therecorder/2018/03/26/after-munger-metoo-snafu-orrick-touts-end-of-arbitration-agreements/) followed suit, but that wasn’t enough for student advocates who wanted to know which other firms interviewing on-campus might have similar requirements for employees.

In May, a survey letter on behalf of all T14 law schools went out to every law firm recruiting on their campuses, asking that the firms disclose whether they require summer associates to sign mandatory arbitration agreements and nondisclosure agreements related to workplace misconduct, including but not limited to sexual harassment. The results are now in, and they’re a mixed bag at best.

Despite sending out nearly 400 requests for information, about half of the firms refused to respond to the inquiry. Major Biglaw players such as Allen & Overy, Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, DLA Piper, Kirkland & Ellis, Littler Mendelson, Nixon Peabody, Ogletree Deakins, Reed Smith, Seyfarth Shaw, Sidley Austin, and Squire Patton Boggs have declined to answer. A statement from student activists at Harvard Law School reflects the disappointment over the sparse answers:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Molly Coleman, a rising second-year law student at Harvard Law School, was disappointed by the firms who chose not to respond. “Almost half of the firms who received the survey — nearly two hundred — have decided to hide behind a wall of secrecy. Especially in the #MeToo era, we are disheartened that they are unwilling to take a simple step to engage on this important issue.” For example, Kirkland & Ellis [reportedly requires employees to arbitrate](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/04/25/ian-samuel-is-shaming-big-law-and-its-working/), but declined to respond.

In sharing the results with the students, Berkeley Law Assistant Dean in the Career Development Office, Terrence J. Galligan advised students to seek out the information before accepting any offer:

The results include the names of employers who did not respond to the survey. If you are interested in employers that did not respond, you should feel free to ask them about their practices. You may decide to wait until after you receive an offer, but you should certainly ask prior to accepting it. If an employer indicates that it will ask you to sign an arbitration agreement, you should ask to see a copy of the agreement before accepting an offer.

As for the firms that did share information it’s clear there’s a wide range of practices in Biglaw when it comes to arbitration and non-disclosure agreements. The results (provided in full on the next page) show some firms,  like Latham & Watkins and Quinn Emanuel, have never required arbitration as a condition of employment; still others, like Gibson Dunn and Wilson Sonsini, do not require arbitration of summer associates, but do of the full-time associate classes of 2018, 2019 and 2020; and some firms like Paul Hastings and Cooley require summer associates and full-time associates to submit to mandatory arbitration.

# Jonathan Turley Bumbles Into Arguing Sex Trafficking Laws Are Unconstitutional... To Own The Libs

New York City filed a $708 million lawsuit against the bus companies that Texas uses to smuggle unwitting migrants across state lines. The suit cites New York Social Services Law § 149, which imposes a financial liability upon any actor who knowingly brings a person into New York for the purpose of making that person a public charge. Any entity violating this law must compensate the state for the cost of public services rendered.

Since Texas governor Greg Abbott loudly and repeatedly proclaiming that (a) he was [putting migrants on buses out of state](https://gov.texas.gov/uploads/files/press/O-KiddW.Nim202204062216_.pdf) and (b) for the purpose of [taking the financial burden off Texas and putting it on New York](https://nypost.com/2023/11/29/news/texas-gov-abbott-vows-more-migrants-to-nyc-and-other-cities-until-biden-secures-border/), and then you add in that Texas wasn’t buying a bunch anonymous Greyhound tickets but booking CHARTERS, it’s nigh on impossible for the bus companies to claim they didn’t know who they were carrying and why.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Now comes [GW Law professor Jonathan Turley](https://jonathanturley.org/2024/01/05/new-york-to-sue-bus-companies-for-busing-people/):

New York City Major Eric Adams [announced](https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/006-24/mayor-adams-suit-against-texas-charter-bus-companies-seeking-708-million-cover-costs) on Thursday that he is suing bus companies for over $700 million for busing undocumented persons to the state. This is truly a thing to behold. It is a frivolous lawsuit based on an absurd law motivated by raw hypocrisy.

“Frivolous” declares the man absolutely thirsty to get invited to appear on Fox News tonight.

It is doubtful that anyone in New York seriously believes that they can force bus or airline companies to pay for migrants coming to a self-proclaimed sanctuary city.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Paul Weiss isn’t really in the habit of bringing cases it doesn’t seriously believe in. The firm is representing the city in this suit.

Turley harps on this “sanctuary city” point a lot despite it being wholly irrelevant to the issue as a legal matter. All it means to be a “sanctuary city” is that local law enforcement refuses to be unofficially deputized by the feds. When an undocumented migrant comes to the police for help because they’re being beaten by their husband or to report a violent gang member, a sanctuary city just commits to not turning the victim over to ICE. As a policy, it’s designed to keep people from unduly suffering because they’re afraid that merely seeking help will get them deported… which is a pretty good idea!

But, again, that’s neither here nor there. Turley is arguing that New York Social Services Law § 149 is on its face untenable.

It is a cynical effort to impose litigation costs on companies to get them to refuse to accept such contracts. Yet, how is a company supposed to determine if someone purchasing a ticket is a potential “public charge.”  Does that apply to anyone who is impoverished? What proof of support is needed from the passenger? Such inquiries would themselves violated legal and constitutional protections.

Does he think we can’t have laws imposing liability on bus companies that — to use his own words — are just “transporting these people because they or a third party paid the fare for transport”?

“Yet, how is a company supposed to determine if someone purchasing a ticket is a potential “public charge.” [sex trafficking victim]. Does that apply to anyone who is impoverished [going to have sex in another state]? What proof of support is needed from the passenger?”

This is not a hypothetical.

The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act — and any number of state laws that mirror its language (including Texas Code § 98.002!) — [creates](https://www.pillsburylaw.com/en/news-and-insights/human-trafficking-raises-corporate-liability-concerns-for-the-hospitality-industry.html): “significant corporate liability for entities, including hotels, casinos and restaurants, that benefit from human trafficking if they know or ‘should have known’ about the exploitation.” As Biglaw firm Pillsbury noted in a white paper on the subject (emphasis added):

Any range of businesses may similarly come in contact with sex trafficking victims or benefit from their exploitation, including casinos, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, concert and sports venues, banks, advertisers and transportation companies.

No one seriously argues that the TVPA amounts to a constitutional overreach. No one suggests that it’s an untenable burden upon interstate commerce to go after bus companies that facilitate sex trafficking by their own reckless neglect. Because sex traffickers are going to go ahead and be criminals, but the respectable businesses that they exploit might actually do something to disrupt the criminal enterprise if they’re worried about getting sued.

Even Turley’s buddy Donald Trump reauthorized this law!

So… back to it:

“Yet, how is a company supposed to determine if someone purchasing a ticket is a potential ‘public charge.'”

When the governor buying the tickets explicitly says he’s doing it for the purpose of [shifting the financial burden to another state](https://gov.texas.gov/uploads/files/press/Mayor_Lori_Lightfoot.pdf).

Does that apply to anyone who is impoverished?

No, but it applies when the company knows (or is reckless in not knowing) that it’s participating in a scheme to transport impoverished people.

What proof of support is needed from the passenger?

Perhaps bus companies can’t develop policies to catch every instance where a 14-year-old girl buying a ticket is a sex trafficking victim. But they can avoid having whole buses chartered by someone holding a letter saying “we’re booking this to transport kidnapped sex slaves.” Given the record here, the companies have more than exceeded wherever one draws the reasonable line of proof.

Maybe Turley is prepared to explicitly declare the TVPA an unconstitutional infringement on corporate rights to profit off interstate sex trafficking. But, assuming he’s not, let’s go ahead and ignore his sophomoric analysis of New York Social Services Law § 149.

Welcome new “How Appealing” readers: Although nearly 99 percent of “How Appealing” readers who I meet on my various blog-related travels tell me that they have been reading this blog since shortly after its inception in May 2002, it appears that this blog’s inclusion [on Law360.com’s list](http://www.law360.com/articles/819414/the-top-5-law-blogs-all-lawyers-should-be-reading) (subscription required for full access) of the top-five must-read law blogs has produced some new visitors in recent days.

Indeed, one sure sign of that arrived yesterday when an administrative assistant at a Baltimore law firm sent me the email addresses of three lawyers at the law firm who wished to be added to this blog’s mailing list. Many blogs have mailing lists, but “How Appealing” is not one of them.

Here’s a guide for new (or not so new) visitors to this blog. In lieu of a mailing list, you can follow this blog on Twitter [via this link](http://www.twitter.com/howappealing). Thanks to all of this blog’s new Law360.com-based visitors in recent days who have already figured that out on their own.

This blog does not permit readers to append comments to posts, nor have comments ever been enabled at any point over this blog’s long history. If you have a comment, question, correction, suggestion, link, resource, or other communication that you would like to send to the author of this blog — meaning me — you can reach me directly 24/7 at [this blog’s email address](mailto:appellateblog@hotmail.com).

Lastly, you can access every single post that has ever appeared at “How Appealing” via this blog’s archives [at this link](http://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/archive.html).

# Top International Firm Is Now Tying Bonus Eligibility To Office Attendance
## Want your bonus money? Then this Biglaw firm wants you in the office.

Biglaw firms would really, really like associates to come back to the office. Whether it’s because of lease obligations, training woes, trying to build a culture, or all of the above, by and large, firms would love to have attorneys back in the office. The question is how to do it.

While we’ve seen some carrot approaches, but increasingly [mandates are the default](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/law-firm-reopenings/) — and that now includes four-day mandates. But what will happen to associates who don’t get on board with the rules of the road? They can expect to have their bonuses docked (or perhaps even worse, now that [layoffs of all kinds](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/layoffs/) are upon us). We’ve just learned that yet another firm has joined the ranks of the firms that are explicitly tying office attendance to associate bonuses.

Osborne Clarke — an international firm with nearly 1,000 attorneys that brought in $481,481,000 gross revenue in 2021, putting it in 121st place on the Global 200 — recently opted to make office attendance mandatory three times each week in order to be eligible for a bonus. [RollOnFriday](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-osborne-clarke-makes-office-attendance-mandatory-bonus) has additional details in an exclusive report:

The firm’s Chief People Officer, Graham de Guise, told RollOnFriday: “We do expect our people to be in the office ‘more often than not’,” which means “three days a week spent in one of our offices or with clients.”

Outlining how this would affect bonuses, de Guise said: “To be considered for a bonus, our people would normally need to reach our minimum expectations across a number of areas,” which includes “being in the office ‘more often than not’.”

He also extolled the virtues, from OC’s perspective, of working in the office, as he said it “brings so many benefits in building and maintaining relationships, collaboration sparking ideas and learning from each other as well as preserving our unique culture.”

Those who remain bonus-eligible at the firm may receive “performance bonuses up to 20%,” as well as “a discretionary long-term incentive plan with a bonus of up to 40% paid over a period of three years.” On top of that, the firm awarded eligible employees with a “4% profit share” in June.

Now that this attendance-based bonus eligibility trend has taken off, will other Biglaw firms follow? If your firm is linking bonuses to office attendance let us know. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Attendance) or text us (646-820-8477). Thanks.

The internet is all a-flutter with talk of how Biglaw firm Latham & Watkins, representing Hunter Biden, tried to pull a fast one on the court yesterday. That’s because U.S. District Court Judge Maryellen Noreika issued an [order to show cause](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67511765/united-states-v-biden/#entry-12) demanding the firm explain why they do not deserve to be sanctioned.

Apparently an amicus brief was filed in the U.S. v. Biden case, and defense counsel believes it contains Biden’s sensitive tax information that should be sealed. A Latham staff member, Jessica Bengels, the firm’s Director of Litigation Services, called the courthouse to get the material redacted or taken off the public docket. But here’s where things go pear-shaped. According to the court’s order, Bengels apparently “misrepresented her identity and who she worked for in an attempt to improperly convince the Clerk’s Office to remove the amicus materials from the docket.” The court believes Bengels falsely claimed to work with the author of the amicus brief, Theodore Kittila of Halloran Farkas + Kittila, in order to get the sensitive information taken down.

But Latham strongly denies the allegations and chalks it up to, well, a game of telephone. In [their letter](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ded.82801/gov.uscourts.ded.82801.14.0_3.pdf) to the court, they explain that Bengels is not a practicing attorney (though she’s barred in New York, she works as staff at the firm) and has not worked on the substance of the case at all. What’s more, the firm notes Bengels “represented her affiliation with Latham & Watkins LLP to the ECF Clerk with whom she spoke earlier today. Both her phone number and her affiliation with Latham also typically appears on Caller ID (which typically shows “LATHAM”).”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Indeed, Latham says that when asked substantive questions about the matter, Bengels couldn’t answer them without consulting with the attorneys on the case.

The ECF Clerk asked for more information about which specific materials should not have been filed on the public docket. Our Lit Services Staff Member did not immediately know the answer because she has had no involvement in this matter, other than occasional docket research. Because she did not know the answer to the ECF Clerk’s question, our Lit Services Staff Member indicated she would call the ECF Clerk back with more information. Shortly thereafter, and before getting a chance to call the ECF Clerk back, our Lit Services Staff Member received a call from a different employee of the Court. This second employee of the Court informed our Lit Services Staff Member that the filing had been removed from the Court’s docket.

And that just may be where the miscommunication arose:

We can only speculate how and when the misunderstanding occurred. We noted, however, that the Court employee who corresponded with Halloran (see Dkt. No. 8-1) is not the first ECF Clerk with whom our Lit Services Staff Member spoke. Our Lit Services Staff Member did not get the name of the second Court employee with whom she spoke.

In [an affidavit](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ded.82801/gov.uscourts.ded.82801.14.1_4.pdf), Bengels says she never misrepresented her firm on calls to the court: “I am completely confident that I never indicated that I was calling from Mr. Kittila’s firm or that I worked with him in any way.”

I am one of the first to say that attorney (or Biglaw Directors of Lit Services) can do misguided things. But in this instance, it is hard to imagine an administrative member of the staff with 18 years of experience at the firm is putting her career on the line for a lie that is easily discoverable. (And when caller ID probably gave it away from jump.)

The two firms came together to become Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer (super original, right?), but the latest branding for the firm lops off all mention of Kaye Scholer.

As [noted by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/nationallawjournal/2018/02/02/arnold-porter-scrubs-kaye-scholer-from-masthead-website/) Law.com, the firm’s logo, website, and email addresses have all changed to only refer to Arnold & Porter.

“The full legal name of the firm continues to be Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP,” the representative said. “The trend in the legal industry over the last 10 years has been toward shorter trade names.”

The venerable law firm of [Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/cadwalader/), one of the nation’s [oldest law practices](http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/which_law_firm_is_the_oldest_in_the_united_states), has been through a lot in its more than 200 years of existence. It has hired up, and it has [slimmed down](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/07/breaking-cadwalader-announces-layoffs-of-96-lawyers/). It has opened offices around the world, and it has [closed them](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/biglaw-firm-to-close-two-offices-lay-off-25-lawyers/).

This year will probably go down in CWT’s history as one of retrenchment and rebuilding. Last month, the firm announced it would be [closing its two China offices](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/biglaw-firm-to-close-two-offices-lay-off-25-lawyers/) and laying off 25 lawyers. And the firm has seen significant voluntary departures as well, the most recent of them reported in the [New York Law Journal](http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/this-weeks-news/id=1202769144592/Cadwalader-Loses-Two-Lawyers-But-Forges-French-Alliance?mcode=1202615036097&curindex=4&slreturn=20160905121638):

Two Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft attorneys said Monday they had been hired at other law firms as partners, marking the latest departures from New York’s oldest firm….

Gregory Markel, a former litigation co-chair at Cadwalader before becoming senior counsel at the firm this year, will join Seyfarth Shaw as a partner. Shane Stroud, who was special counsel in Cadwalader’s executive compensation practice, has moved to Hughes Hubbard & Reed as a partner.

Markel’s exit is another drain on Cadwalader’s litigation team, especially in New York. It comes a week after Martin Seidel, chair of Cadwalader’s corporate litigation group, announced he was [joining Willkie Farr & Gallagher](http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/this-weeks-news/id=1202768586250/Cadwalader-Corporate-Litigation-Chair-Jumps-to-Willkie-Farr).

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Markel and Seidel aren’t the first prominent partners to leave CWT in 2016. In August, antitrust star Charles “Rick” Rule and three other partners [jumped over to Paul, Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/musical-chairs-cadwalader-antitrust-stars-decamp-for-paul-weiss/). In March, Lou Solomon, another former co-chair of litigation, [left for Greenberg Traurig](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/4-leading-litigators-leave-cadwalader-for-greenberg-traurig/), along with three fellow partners.

Greg Markel is moving to Seyfarth Shaw along with one associate, Heather Murray. Here’s what he had to say about his move in an email announcement sent to friends and colleagues:

I’m excited to announce that I have moved my practice to Seyfarth Shaw, an AmLaw100 firm, where I’ve joined the Litigation Department. I will continue to focus my practice on corporate governance litigation, mergers and acquisitions litigation, directors and officers defense, securities litigation, and antitrust litigation.

This is, of course, a significant move in my career. The opportunity to build a strong platform for my clients, and Seyfarth’s deserved reputation for client-service innovation have convinced me that this is the right place for my clients. If we haven’t had the chance to work together for a while, you can click on the button to the right to review my [full biography](http://www.seyfarth.com/GregoryMarkel).

Markel’s move shouldn’t shock folks who have been following the palace intrigue at Cadwalader over the past few years. In January 2015, he left his post as litigation co-chair (after what one CWT source of ours [described](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/01/musical-chairs-a-major-move-out-of-cadwalader/2/?rf=1) as “a coup in the litigation department”). In early 2016, Markel left the CWT partnership and took the role of senior counsel.

Markel isn’t the only former practice head to leave Cadwalader in recent weeks. Last month, Steven Eckhaus, who chaired the firm’s executive compensation and benefits practice, took his talents [to McDermott Will & Emery](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202766708947).

In this episode, I speak with [Jodi Schwimmer](https://www.reedsmith.com/en/professionals/s/schwimmer-jodi-e), partner at Reed Smith and global co-lead of the Financial Industry Group, about how she balances firm leadership responsibilities with her practice. Jodi shares how the Financial Industry Group has changed because of the pandemic, and some firm priorities for this year. She also discusses some of the biggest successes and failures of her career.



The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!


Kathryn Rubino is a Senior Editor at Above the Law, host of [The Jabot podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/1XC11QhFCWxWr4NQrk2sEA), and co-host of [Thinking Like A Lawyer](https://legaltalknetwork.com/podcasts/thinking-like-a-lawyer/).

# Boutique Partner Says Opportunities Are Not The Same For Black People
## Black lawyers are the least represented minorities in the legal profession.

Why am I not getting the same opportunities? I know how black people see and think. It is very similar to how my grandparents felt, my parents felt. How I feel. We’ve expressed that, so now I think other people need to do the hard work of challenging what they’re thinking and feeling and doing something about it.

How do non-black people address racial issues in their circle and their family? On the golf course? How do they respond to comments and statements and stereotypes? The rooms that black people aren’t in, those are the environment where people need to stand up and speak out and have the courage to speak out. Those backroom deals, the golf course, those are incredibly important for justice and equality.

— [Angela Crawford](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angela-crawford-15268133/), co-founder of corporate compliance boutique [Crawford & Acharya](https://crawfordacharya.com/) who previously spent time as a partner at both DLA Piper and Kirkland & Ellis, commenting on the [inequalities black Americans face](https://www.law.com/2020/06/03/it-could-have-been-me-black-attorneys-reflect-on-george-floyds-death-and-what-comes-next/). According to the latest data from ALM, while black lawyers make up 3.6 percent of the Biglaw community, only 2.1 percent of them have been elevated to the ranks of partnership within the Am Law 200.

# Biglaw's New, Inclusive Trend -- Just In Time For Recruiting Season
## Davis Polk is making a step in the right direction.

Pride month is in full swing, so it only makes sense to focus on some progress being made in Biglaw firms. We’ve been hearing that some prominent Biglaw firms are making a genuine effort to be inclusive to trans/genderqueer/nonbinary folks. As a tipster reports:



[The firm] offers She/Her, He/Him and They/Them pronoun options for students and attorneys to add to their nametags, if they’d like to do so, out on the nametag table at every event….Many students and attorneys [] have been wearing the ribbon in solidarity and to make those in the LGBTQ+ community feel more comfortable wearing one should they choose or need to.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The firm in question began using the ribbons during the last recruiting cycle, and now we understand the practice is set to spread to other Biglaw firms, just in time for recruiting season to begin. Hopefully, this soon becomes the standard in the industry. (We’ve reached out to the firm(s) involved but have yet to hear back. If your firm is doing something similar, please [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Pronouns) and let us know.)

UPDATE: We can confirm that Davis Polk & Wardwell is the firm leading the way with pronouns! DPW has been at the forefront of the inclusive practice for over a year now. Well done!

This serves as an important reminder that [pronouns matter](https://thegrapevine.theroot.com/janet-mock-why-gender-pronouns-matter-1835423219?utm_medium=sharefromsite&utm_source=The_Root). And while this Biglaw firm may not include all gender-neutral pronouns in common usage (for example ze/zir), it breaks down the assumption that you should know someone’s pronouns just by looking at them.

It’s a remarkably simple move, but one that goes pretty far in setting the tone of inclusion.

# Where Law Firm Partners And IT Pros Differ On Cybersecurity
## 3 takeaways from a recent ATL/iManage survey.

A recent survey conducted by Above the Law in partnership with [iManage](https://imanage.com/) dug into how attorneys and law firm leadership think about and address potential cybersecurity concerns. 

Read on to discover more about what attorneys are saying about the state of cybersecurity in the legal industry, [or click here to download the full report](https://info.abovethelaw.com/how-todays-law-firms-are-tackling-cybersecurity-challenges).

Partners and IT Staff May Differ

The responses gathered in this survey focus on what individuals working in law firms — including IT team members — deem most important to maintaining their firms’ cybersecurity. 

One interesting discontinuity appeared between the opinions of law firm partners and counsel and those of their IT teams regarding how important it is to monitor user activity to flag odd behavior.

While partners and counsel rated this measure a 4.0 on a scale from one to five, IT staff rated the measure a 3.0 and favored a focus on antivirus and malware protection and other less user observation-based measures.

Clients Are Focused on Security

With remote and hybrid working arrangements remaining popular among attorneys (and especially [with associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/biglaw-firms-grappling-with-how-to-get-associates-back-into-the-office/)), law firms have had to adjust their security practices to account for lawyers using their unsecured home networks.

Clients seem aware of the potential risks that come with the often sensitive work attorneys are engaged in. 

The survey also found that the respondents believe security-focused clients are likely to perceive bigger firms as having more robust security measures in place — a perception that nearly all survey respondents agree gives an advantage to large firms over midsize and small firms.

Firms Are Concerned With Costs 

Costs associated with improving security capabilities emerged as a clear leader in terms of what survey respondents felt was the greatest barrier to addressing security challenges, with 37% of respondents ranking it first out of five possible answers. 

Closely following cost-related concerns across all rankings were the process of transitioning away from legacy applications and issues related to implementing the right new system.

# Guide To Choosing The Right Firm For You
## There is no perfect firm, but there are better options more aligned with your career goals. Let Lateral Link help you find the best option.

You are looking to make a lateral move to another Biglaw firm. You make a checklist of things you want from your next move. You want to work for a firm that provides a good environment, partners who are willing to help with all your questions, mentors throughout the firm, higher salaries to help with that massive student loan, and a chance to move up fairly quickly. There is never a perfect choice as lots of good options exist — but Lateral Link can help get you as close to a perfect situation as possible.

Keep in mind that the field you have chosen comes with expectations that might seem daunting when you sit and think about it. An all in compensation increase is usually a big factor. But the initial starting compensation isn’t as meaningful as the long term upside. I oftentimes see attorneys make long-term decisions without considering the real long-term compensation differences. At the very least, you should know the lockstep associate ranges, and even more important, the partnership prospects and that that actually means should you receive the invitation.

Before deciding on which firm to join, consider these tips, provided by [Lateral Link](http://www.laterallink.com/).

Don’t believe everything you hear. While in law school, many students hear various things about specific law firms. Word of advice? Don’t listen. Every experience is different, every situation is different. Law students must understand that there is no “one” perfect firm. Most things you hear during your law school tenure are inaccurate, superficial, and out of date. Students should use their lawyerly skepticism without being cynical. The publicly available rankings are mostly fluff. The reality is that every firm changes its composition every year based on the lateral movements, both in and out, that the firm realizes. Take Dewey for example:



Balancing work and life is always challenging — no matter which firm you choose. It seems like the moment you decide to start a family is the exact same moment your legal career is at its busiest. You have chosen a tough and demanding profession. The years when you learn your craft, develop your specialty, gain acceptance, earn a promotion, and cement relationships with clients are in direct and substantial conflict with the years when you start and raise your family. That will not change. What you can do is discuss with your life partner the choices you are going to make in order to manage the process as effectively as possible. Additionally, U.S News & World Report provided some pointers on [How To Handle Workplace Stress](https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/slideshows/how-to-handle-workplace-stress).

Do not assume that size always matters. Do not assume that taking a job at a smaller law firm necessarily means less hours and kumbaya in the office. Many lawyers who make the leap from large firms to small firms are dismally surprised when the hours and pressure does not change, and even more troubled that what they thought was a millennial culture with group hugs and unlimited kombucha on tap is actually a firm where the pressure to produce is paramount. To that end, sometimes in house roles actually require more hours and less pay than what you would see at a law firm. This information isn’t readily available via online resources or self-flattery. A good recruiter will know the difference in expectations among various career options.

Choose a firm based on the people. Pick a firm based on the people. The structural components are helpful, but ultimately, decision makers make the decisions that will most affect where you fit in the structure. Who cares if a firm has $4mm PPP when you are invited into the partnership. You may be better off with a firm that has much lower metrics if you are someone who stands out and is rightfully recognized.

For those of you who are not parents but believe that that is in your future, there is really no way to put into words the benefits and burdens of parenting. It’s the most rewarding and demanding job you will ever have. It’s unpredictable, time-consuming, draining, exhausting, and fascinating. And that’s just in the first few days after you bring a child home from the hospital. Setting aside the moments of wonder and awe — it is also tiring and difficult. There are days when your eyelids ache. There are nights when you can’t sort the burdens of work from the burdens of parenting. You will experience sleepless dawns followed by demanding days.

So what’s the moral of the story? There is no perfect firm, and anyone who says there is probably also has a bridge to sell you and doesn’t deserve your trust. But there are better options more aligned with your career goals. Contact one of our well-versed recruiters today to discuss your specific goals so that we can create a bespoke plan that fits your needs.

# The Perspective Of Important Partners
## From Mark Herrmann's in-house perspective, Biglaw partners have become pretty condescending and snooty.

I’ve recently chatted with fairly influential partners at ridiculously rich firms.

To give a sense of the people with whom I was speaking, while maintaining their anonymity, let’s say that I spoke to one partner each at two of the United States’ 10 most profitable firms.  These firms, and these partners, are doing quite well.

Two things startled me.

First, the condescension is getting pretty bad.

Years ago, I heard a rainmaker say that he wasn’t interested in the opinions of partners who were “unburdened by clients.”  That was pretty nasty, but at least it was funny.

Within the past few weeks, however, I heard someone say that his (or her) firm had recently lost a group of partners:  “We lost a group of about 10 partners, but only two of them were real partners.  The other eight were just service partners, so they didn’t really matter.”

Oooh, oooh, oooh.  That’s awfully snooty.

I realize that some folks do it all:  They attract business, and they do a great job of handling the business.

But that’s a fairly small minority.  Most firms need people to attract business, and the firms also need folks to labor in the fields, producing the top-notch legal work that keeps clients coming back.

Maybe the person I was talking to was one of the few all-stars, but that’s pretty unlikely.  I suspect the person was just a rainmaker, heavily reliant on mere “service partners” to keep clients happy.  A little less condescension might go a long way toward keeping this person’s law firm intact.

So the first thing I noticed was this relatively new type of snootiness.  I don’t think it existed 10 years ago, back when I was in private practice. 

A second thing also startled me.  Both of these partners, at two high-PPP firms, scoffed at the type of work that I did back at a firm:  Mass torts.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
I picked my area of specialization the way everyone does:  A little bit of choice, and a little bit of randomness.  For a while, you gravitate toward the cases that interest you; later in life, you do what comes in the door.  For me, that was [mass torts](https://www.amazon.com/Device-Product-Liability-Litigation-Strategy/dp/0198803532/ref=dp_ob_title_bk).  But there was some thought involved there:  When a mass tort hits, the defendant is immediately facing a corporate life-threatening event.  Logically, life-threatening events are those in which clients don’t worry too much about cost:  The client must win, price be damned.  (There were other reasons, too, for picking this field:  Mass torts are great for lawyers at all levels within a firm.  Junior folks get to take lots of depositions; senior folks get to try cases and worry about MDL strategy; for the most part, these cases use everyone to their maximum capacity.  Some of the cases are likely to go to trial.  The field of law is interesting.  I saw lots of advantages here.) 

But last month, the rich guys scoffed at mass torts:  Both of them said, in different conversations, that their firms rarely did mass tort work anymore because of price-sensitivity; clients wouldn’t agree to pay their firms’ rates. 

Both of these firms do, indeed, have eye-popping rates.   

I was startled nonetheless. 

The desire to raise rates has gotten to the point where only single cases that put oodles of money on the line are attractive to these extraordinarily profitable firms.  Financial institution litigation?  For the right cases, yes.  Private equity transactions?  For the right deals, yes.  Internal investigations?  For investigations raising worries in 30 different countries around the world and thus requiring a law-firm-empire, yes.

But a few thousand people claiming to have been injured by a drug? 

Clients may pay for top-notch trial talent.  In select cases, clients may pay for top-notch appellate talent.  But clients are not going to pay top rates to work up each of several thousand cases.  Either the work is being sliced into pieces — the less expensive firm works up the cases, and the client worries about hiring trial counsel later — or a less expensive firm (or group of firms) handles the cases from start to finish. 

In a sense, this is hardly an issue.  In the words of the sage, “May all your problems be tax problems.”  If pharmaceutical companies don’t want to use the most highly priced firms to defend their mass torts, so be it.  The drug companies survive.  The high-PPP firms survive.  And plenty of folks still make a living defending mass torts at perfectly respectable, if slightly more reasonably priced, law firms. 

But I, at least, shed a tear for my former self. 

I thought I was being so clever when I decided to go into mass torts, and it turns out I miscalculated.  Good thing I went in-house, I guess.

# Is The Prospect Of Being A Partner In Name Only Driving Lawyers From Biglaw To Boutiques?
## Why make the switch? Boutiques provide the experience that newer lawyers crave and cannot get in Biglaw.

Biglaw or boutique law? While Biglaw still entices young lawyers (and even those not-so young) with the siren call of big money, the reality of what Biglaw costs attorneys is becoming more of a talking point for those already in the profession and entering it.

Joe Patrice wrote about it in a recent post about how there’s a title shell game in Biglaw: [“partner” in name only](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/repeat-after-me-partnership-without-equity-is-not-a-partnership/). Should that be called “PINO”? As Joe points out, the deequitization trend is anything but transparent. When is a partner not a partner? When the firm says she isn’t, and the use of that misleading term when that it is not the case does no one any good, neither the “partner,” nor the firm. A client may think her matter is in the hands of a “partner,” and it is in the hands of a partner, but a PINO. Does anyone in the firm ever explain to the client the differences between a real partner and a PINO? Do you think that would be a good idea so that the client knows exactly what a PINO is and where that person is in the hierarchy and the extent of what a PINO can do without an equity partner’s supervision?

Sara Randazzo’s article in the last Saturday’s print edition (West Coast) of the Wall Street Journal is “The Flip Side of Making Partner.” Dinosaurs will remember that there was an “A” side and a “B” side of records and almost always it was the “A” side that was promoted and sold the most copies. You had to have a “B” side, but oftentimes that side was just there because you had to have a “B” side. So, are PINOs the “B” side?

As Randazzo points out, it’s all about “bill, baby, bill” today, and the camaraderie that was an essential part of the fit (and partners would look for that in prospective hires) is gone. Collegiality doesn’t mean what it used to, long live billable hours. She writes that “all partners are not created equal, and that data and money rule.”

Randazzo notes that in the mid-1980s, The American Lawyer started its comparisons of revenue and profits of the Biglaw firms. It was then off to the races, and the profession has never been the same since. I think we lost something that we will never retrieve.

Steven Brill was the founder of The American Lawyer. In his book Tailspin, subtitled “The People and Forces Behind America’s Fifty-Year Fall—and Those Fighting to Revise It,” he acknowledges the role that The American Lawyer has played in the transformation of the law practice. Writing about the very first report that the magazine published in the summer of 1985, he says that “there is no denying that the fallout of this report and those that have followed since The American Lawyer and other trade publications was significant and double-edged. The new flow of market information about these businesses made those who ran them more accountable to their partners, their employees and their clients, but it also transformed the practice of law by the country’s most talented lawyers in ways that had significant drawbacks.” You think? What was lost in what was gained?

Question: When you have a firm of thousands of lawyers, how do you avoid client conflicts when there are lawyers all over the world handling all sorts of different transactions, different litigation, different regulatory issues? Is it ever possible to have a clean conflict check? Your client is your client and you don’t want to relinquish that work because a partner (and not a PINO) in another part of the country or somewhere else in the world outranks you and you lose the work. What is your client’s reaction? Your client knows you are a “partner.” Yes, but….

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Take the [poll that ATL is running now](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/what-do-you-wish-you-knew-about-biglaw-before-you-started/), asking the question, “What do you wish you had known about Biglaw before you started?” Tell ATL how you really feel.

What is happening is that associates are now taking themselves and their work to “boutique law firms,” where these associates do not get lost in the shuffle but get to do meaningful work from the get-go. Law.com has a podcast now about three lawyers (early in their careers) who [left Biglaw to join boutique firms](https://www.law.com/therecorder/2019/08/09/good-bye-big-law-hello-boutiques-why-these-young-lawyers-are-sold-on-smaller-firm-careers/) that do much more to satisfy both their professional and personal needs.

Why make the switch? Boutiques provide the experience that newer lawyers crave and cannot get in Biglaw — there are opportunities to do both paid and pro bono work, and in these smaller firms, the associates often drive the pro bono work. In boutiques, they not only do the depo prep but they take the deposition. There’s a partner by your side at the depo, but you’re taking it, not the partner. You go to court with a partner and argue the motion, but you are arguing, not the partner. All three of the lawyers said making the switch gave them the opportunity to get “boots on the ground” experience, rather than just observing others. They are doing, not watching.

Benefits play a part as well in the decisions to switch — availability of both childcare and elder care, flexible schedules, to name just a few.

It’s easier to have a voice in a smaller firm, and, as one lawyer noted, it’s harder to get buy-in for a project, an idea for associate development, across a ginormous firm. It’s also easier for newer lawyers in a boutique firm to build business, to be entrepreneurial, because the firm can be flexible, especially when representing startups and billings can be deferred. Smaller firms are nimbler in what they’re willing to do to get their associates up and running, to help them succeed.

And implicit in what all three lawyers said is the collegiality that a boutique law firm can provide. Yes, we all became lawyers to do good and, as a collateral benefit, to have a comfortable lifestyle. We knew we were all in this together. At least, we were. Not so much any longer.

What Biglaw associate doesn’t love bonus season? It’s a nice fat check that says the firm appreciates all of the effort and hours (and HOURS) you put into the year.

Now Milbank has enter the bonus conversation.

With $1,359,000,000 in revenue last year, the firm picked up the 31st spot on the Am Law 100. And it looks like the firm is using the cash to reward associates for their hard work by matching the prevailing market bonuses.

The bonus scale at Milbank is as follows:



Bonuses will be paid by December 31 to associates in good standing at the firm. Unlike some of their peer firms, both the class of 2015 and 2014 are on the bonus scale. Bonuses for special associates will be individualized. You can read the full memo [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/skaddens-bonuses-22/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Law Firm Fakes Out Its Associates Over Pay Raises
## Are you trying to troll these associates?

Heads up to law firms around the country: associates are really on pins and needles regarding compensation. They’re refreshing Above the Law hoping to see some “peer” firm has increased associate compensation to the new Cravath scale and hoping that’s enough to convince the executive committee that they too deserve raises. Even when associates are pretty sure their firm won’t do a full match to [MoneyLaw](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/what-firms-miss-the-moneylaw-cut/) levels, they are still pretty hopeful that there’ll be enough pressure to eke out some sort of a raise.

Keep that in mind when planning events this summer, particularly if they involve [celebratory drinks and an announcement](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-firm-throws-roving-party-to-announce-pay-raises/). It is only natural that associates will jump to the conclusion you’re about to announce pay raises, which, in fairness, is less of a jump than a small little hop given the rapidly changing market.

Take what happened at Vedder Price yesterday. As a tipster reports, the firm recently moved to the old, $160K scale, but profits per partner are healthy and associates figured, in order to avoid a mass exodus, the firm would be providing some kind of raise. And then they were summoned to the conference room for an announcement and a champagne toast:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The associates (it is a small office) huddled outside of the conference room and we were all nearly certain that we would get the news that we were waiting for over the last week (a pay raise as a result of the new Cravath salary scale).  Maybe not completely to the new Cravath market salary, but at least a $20k raise for each class year.  Our associates have all been reading about how other firms have been notifying their associates and then celebrating with champagne.  And with the email from the firm’s CEO sent to us about the announcement and champagne only one week after the Cravath bomb was dropped, what else could it be?

Oh, you poor, hopeful souls. No raise for you, at least not yet:

Much to all of the associates’ complete surprise, the champagne toast and great news had nothing to do with the compensation of its associates.  It was announced that the firm voted for three of its non-voting shareholders to be let into the club as full voting shareholders. Not only has management been radio silent regarding its intentions for associate compensation, but the firm, today, just made sure that its associates shared in the “joy” of the occasion of making the pockets of already well-paid shareholders even fatter.  What do you say to that?  “Thanks Vedder!  You really just have no idea that at least one third of your associates (firm-wide) are seriously considering jumping ship. But we sure are glad that those non-voting shareholders are now full equity voting members with greater compensation potential.”  The faces of the associates during the “announcement” looked like their pet puppy just died in front of their eyes.  Bottoms up…

Cheers to more wealthy people that are not the associates?!?!? Talk about tone deaf.

Let this be a note to all firms: don’t tease your associates with a champagne toast. Save the bubbly till after you give them a raise. Unless you’re trying to troll them. In that case, break out the Dom and laugh at the sad associates — just be sure to film their reactions and send it to ATL.

We are covering associate raises as market conditions develop, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

[](https://abovethelaw.com/top-outside-counsel-2020/)Earlier this month, in partnership with our friends at [Lake Whillans](https://lakewhillans.com/), we released our [Outside Counsel rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/top-outside-counsel-2020/), a look at the Biglaw firms most trusted by corporate legal departments. Today, we look at the firms that were rated highest by in-house attorneys based on the industries in which they practice.

Drawing on input from GCs and in-house counsel from a range of business categories, we’ve compiled rankings for seven different industries: Consumer Products, Telecommunications, Energy, Media/Entertainment, Life Sciences/Health Care, Finance, and Technology.

Seventeen firms appear on more than one of our industry lists; these three firms below show up on three (!) or more:

- Kirkland & Ellis (Tech, Energy, Defense)
- Latham & Watkins (Energy, Finance, Consumer Products)
- Gibson Dunn (Energy, Defense, Healthcare, Consumer Products, Media)
Wow, Gibson Dunn with impressive range across five specialities. Congratulations to all the firms recognized.

[Miami] is the hot place in the US . . . It’s becoming Wall Street south.

— Private equity partner [Jeremy Liss](https://www.kirkland.com/lawyers/l/liss-jeremy-s-pc) of Kirkland & Ellis, commenting on the firm’s new outpost in Miami, Florida, in an interview with the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/88159913-1882-43f8-b2c5-9d587005cd6d). Liss, who is leaving the firm’s Chicago office to run its Miami shop, says many of his colleagues at the firm are eager to join him, speaking of a hot legal scene in in the Magic City. “The initial demand has been extremely strong,” he said. “It’s probably even stronger demand than we had anticipated.”

# Performance Reviews Suck, But This Biglaw Firm Is Trying To Change The Game

As a former HR (human resources fka personnel) lawyer for many years, I heard clients whine ALL THE TIME about performance evaluations, having to write them, having to deliver them, and then suffering the blowback from employees who were royally pissed about the review, the number grade, and the paltry amount, if any, of a raise. It was not pretty. No one, unless someone was sadistic and/or had way too much time to spare, liked the whole process, which seemed to change from year to year without rhyme or reason. One year a “1” would be “walks on water,” or superb, and the next year, a “5” would be superb, while the “1” would be code for “clean out your desk, you’re outta here.” Huh?

Here are just a couple of the issues I routinely saw with performance evaluations:

1) The “sandbag” situation. The supervisor/manager, or whoever was in charge of writing the review and giving it, would save up all the problems, concerns, failures, and the like until review time. The unsuspecting employee would think her performance was fine until the evaluation IED blew up at review time. Talk about a lack of due process, talk about the inability to correct problems during the course of the year, talk about the unfairness of a process that left the employee marching to HR after the review to complain.

Yes, the employee could write a response to the review, and yes, HR would review the rebuttal, and then HR would investigate the concerns. Days, weeks, if not months were consumed resolving the fallout from a bad review. Wouldn’t it have been so much easier if there had been conversations during the year about what needed to improve?

I don’t think any employee wants a bad review, and there’s usually something that the employee does that merits praise. Too often, it’s all or nothing. Talk about a workplace morale killer.

2) The “I want X gone today” situation. The supervisor/manager would want to terminate someone RIGHT THIS MINUTE, but there was not a single scrap of documentation to justify the termination at that point in time. The common scenario here would be the HR person coming into my office, closing the door (one reason why I am in favor of having private close-the-door availability of lawyer space), and tossing an employee file on my desk. “The manager wants today to be X’s last day.” Huh? Why? I’d review the file and there was nothing in the file, no documentation of oral warnings, no written warnings, no final warnings. Nada, zip, zilch. And the basis for the termination is? Any violation of the code of conduct? Any other violation that merits immediate termination? The good old standby of performance issues?

“Nope,” would be the response. “The manager just wants X gone.” We all know how that story goes.

3) The “Do it Yourself” review. The supervisor tells the employee to grade herself and then discuss it with the supervisor. My feeling is that if you want to do it yourself, then go to a DIY store. So, I’ve thought a lot about performance evaluations over the years. There has to be a better way.

Now comes the story of how a Biglaw firm is [changing its approach to evaluations](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/biglaw-firm-scraps-their-old-performance-reviews/?rf=1).

Kathryn Rubino reports that now employees will get “flash feedback,” letting them know how they are doing during the year instead of waiting for the annual review torture. It seems that the “flash feedback” is designed to help develop employees, so that they can learn from mistakes as they make them (not that associates in Biglaw ever make mistakes) and/or show associates how to handle matters without reinventing the wheel and without having to write off all the associate time in so doing.

In principle, it sounds like a good idea, and it dovetails with the premise that [millennials wants feedback on a continuing basis](http://fortune.com/2017/02/07/leadership-career-advice-millennials-praise-feedback/), not just at review time (a process that could also go the way of the dinosaur.)

However, Hogan’s approach is [three pieces of feedback](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/hogan_lovells_ditches_annual_performance_reviews_for_program_with_flash_fee/) from coworkers every four months.  Is that often enough?

Remember, dinosaurs, when the term “feedback” was used exclusively in science? When it was purely that high-pitched, annoying noise emanating from a speaker or microphone that forced us to cover our ears in school assemblies? That term has come a long way since then.

Will the lawyers who provide the flash feedback be willing to document the conversations that when it comes time to decide whether to retain the associate or cut him loose, will there be sufficient documentation to support whatever decision is made?

Many management researchers and practitioners have long thought, as far back as the 1950s, that the [traditional performance appraisal method sucks](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackzenger/2017/10/12/what-solid-research-actually-says-about-performance-appraisals/#12d4348d2b59).  It creates employee defensiveness, perpetuates a vicious circle of declining performance, and no one wants to be defined merely by a number grade.

Despite our well-deserved reputation for being professionally confrontational, I think that many of us are loathe to criticize our colleagues, at least on paper.  (We’ll exclude from this discussion those of us who bully, scream and yell at staff, dress down junior lawyers, and who display other reprehensible interpersonal skills.) I think we tiptoe around criticism, having to give it, and especially how to take it, but I think the “flash feedback” method makes sense, especially for the millennial generation of lawyers.

We, as dinosaurs, have been much more stoic about performance appraisals, dutifully awaiting them every year, and not pushing back against the formula as the millennials are. Good for them.

We need to innovate every aspect of the profession and stories abound about innovations in the practice of law from technological perspectives. One workplace innovation that is lagging behind is the care and feeding of employees, professionals, and staff.  If “flash feedback” is the start of innovation in the employer-employee relationship, then bring it on. May it be the start of many more.

She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

“Spit in a cup . . . now drink it.” Disgusted…?

So was I, when the request was made to me (along with many of most powerful Am Law managing attorneys on the planet).

So who made this outrageous(ly disgusting) request, and why?

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The who was [Dr. Larry Richard](http://www.lawyerbrain.com/about-dr-larry-richard) (Penn Law grad, 10 years as a litigator, and a Ph.D. in Psychology). Larry, who consults for firms all over the world, was keynoting a talk about the peculiarities of the lawyer’s brain (which, incidentally, is the name of his [consulting company](http://www.lawyerbrain.com/)!).

The why, was to show (to prove) that each of us is a visceral, emotional, and feeling being — even us lawyers. No matter how much logical training we receive from our Ivy League institutions, we each harbor unconscious bias, taboos, and other irrational thoughts. To this day, I tell the spit story (too much, if you ask my wife), as it was self-evident proof (to me anyway) of my own irrationality. Try it yourself, and think about the following.

That spit in the cup, the good doctor explained, had, moments ago been comfortable resting in our own mouths — causing zero emotional angst.  Now, just moments later, and residing in a sterile Dixie cup, it has become unthinkable — inhuman even — to contemplate the oral reentry of this vile, revolting, disgusting substance! What was once part of us, is now a taboo contaminant — and I challenge you to use your powers of logic to convince yourself otherwise, and take a swig of the frothy brew.

But this column is about alt.legal businesses, not psychology!  So, today we are going to sit down with Dr. Richard and learn about the lawyer brain, as well as his own business serving lawyers. While we often talk to legal tech CEOs, it’s important consider another types of legal-industry problem solvers — in this case, a doctor of juris doctors.

Dr. Richard is using his understanding of the legal mind to help lawyers and law firms perform better, be less negative, and more resilient. If you are a practicing lawyer, read below for insight into what makes you so weird (yeah, it’s a lot).  If you are an alt.legal entrepreneur, find out what makes lawyers tick, and how you can help turn spit-in-a-cup into lightning-in-a-bottle.

Joe Borstein: Lawyer depression and mental health issues have become a core topic in the legal industry (see [here](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2018/03/28/quinn-emanuel-partner-suffers-from-depression-and-he-wants-everyone-to-know/) and [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/new-survey-proves-lawyer-is-the-loneliest-profession-of-all/), which the audience should read!).

From your studies of the lawyer brain, is there something inherent in practice of law that causes the high levels of mental health problems we are seeing?

Dr. Larry Richard: How much time do you have!

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
There are lots of reasons lawyers are more prone to depression and other mental and emotional stresses. We will explore three.

First, the very nature of what lawyers do is that they look for problems. Admittedly, this is done for a good reason — to protect their clients. But it trains their minds to always suspect both people and data. Lawyers question the motives of others. They focus on the 5% that’s problematic instead of the 95% that’s working.

​Research shows that when we think negative thoughts, they precipitate negative feelings and ultimately negative hormones — cortisol, adrenalin, and a bunch of other nasty chemicals. Repeated training in looking for problems also tends to atrophy a person’s capacity to look for and notice the good things in life. So the end result — especially for those lawyers who don’t have a good way of protecting themselves from this negativity or of balancing it out with positivity — can be a steady descent into depressive thinking and ultimately, for some, into clinical depression.

JB: Interesting.  So to some degree the practice of law can create depression.  What about the lawyers themselves?

LR: Yes, that is reason two.

People who go into law, according to my research, are very low in a trait called Resilience.

When they are criticized or rejected, they feel hurt, wounded, get defensive, and become stressed out. High Resilience people generally let life’s adversities roll off their backs, but low Resilience people take these events much harder. And my data consistently show that 90% of lawyers score in the bottom half of the Resilience scale!

Finally, as if that weren’t enough, lawyers often are called to represent clients who may not be likable or whose values may conflict with the personal values of the lawyer. Some lawyers will decline to take on such cases, but many feel they have no choice. This dilemma can create an ongoing values conflict which can eat away at self-esteem and further amplify negative moods.

There are probably 4 or 5 other reasons why lawyers are more prone to depression, but it would be too depressing to answer your question in that much depth.

JB:  That’ll do!  Tell our readers about your personal transition from lawyer to doctor, and then to business owner?

LR: I come from a family of lawyers going back three generations. It seemed like the family business, and I never really considered any other career. I went right from high school to college to law school. And from day one, I hated it.

But I put my head down and plowed through. Earned my J.D. Tried a variety of jobs, mainly as a litigator, but finally after 10 years of increasing unhappiness, I had to face the fact that I was in the wrong career. So I quit.

I tried a couple of interim jobs, and did a lot of soul-searching. The end result — it became clear to me that who I am, at heart, is a psychologist. I decided to earn a Ph.D. and to study lawyers and the legal profession, which I did.

I got very curious about the personalities of people who go into law — I’ve always been curious about what makes us tick. What kind of person goes into law? Are we different from others? This curiosity has only grown over the years. It still fuels me today.

After graduate school, I worked as a solo consultant for a few years until I was recruited by Altman Weil. I became a partner there, and worked there for a few years until Hildebrandt recruited me away. Brad Hildebrandt asked me to create and head up a team focused on providing leadership skills and organization improvement skills to large law firms, and that’s what I did during my seven years at Hildebrandt. In 2011, Hildebrandt’s then parent company, Thomson Reuters, divested the Hildebrandt operation, and many of us left and hung out our own shingles. I started LawyerBrain, and I’ve never been happier.

JB: So this column is about legal entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship. Lawyer psychology aside, you have started a business serving the legal industry. Tell our audience about what’s unique about working with and for lawyers as a business.

LR: ​ There are two main challenges to working with lawyers, and they both stem from distinctive lawyer personality traits — Skepticism and Autonomy.

​Because lawyers are skeptical, sometimes they can be their own worst enemy. When a consultant gives advice in a law firm, you can expect more than the typical amount of pushback, scrutiny, challenges, etc. I’ve come to expect this and I prepare for it, but in comparing notes with my friends who consult to conventional businesses, we all get pushback — that’s human nature — but the level and complexity of the pushback we see in law firms is usually greater. I see it as just a fact of life that you have to accommodate to.

Because lawyers have high needs for autonomy, law firms tend to shy away from highly structured, hierarchical lines of authority. Instead, many decisions are made by committees or even by the full partnership. In most business corporations, a manager at a given level has a budget and a set of clear responsibilities and can generally make a decision to move forward on a project — or not — in a relatively quick time frame, but many similar decisions in law firms can take much longer because there are often no clear “buck stops here” decision-makers. That means the buy-in process is both more important and it takes longer to build. Again, this is just a fact of life in working with law firms — you come to expect a longer lead time in launching a project.[ ](http://www.namadr.com/)

The offsetting good news is that because lawyers are generally cautious and risk-averse, once you establish your credentials and competence, they tend to keep hiring you because they can count on your consistently delivering the high level of quality they’ve come to expect. I think there’s less “shopping around” than my friends who work with conventional companies report.

JB: So when selling to legal, they’re harder clients to obtain, but more loyal clients once you do?  A lot of our readers are trying to get lawyers to try something new (tech or service or other). What advice would you give them, knowing what you do about the lawyer brain?

LR: How do you get lawyers to try something new? The most effective strategy is to demonstrate that other firms are already doing it — especially if those other firms include firms they consider “peer firms” or better. Equally effective — show them that actual clients of theirs place a high level of value on the thing you’re trying to get them to do/try. These two strategies are variations of a principle in psychology known as “social proof” — it’s been well-documented as a motivating force.

Of course there’s always the chicken-and-egg question — how do you get that first firm to try something? There, the answer is more complex. There are a number of strategies, and we don’t have the space to cover them all. The most important one is “relationship” — the stronger and longer the trusting relationship you have with a firm leader, the more likely you’ll be able to encourage that leader to experiment with a new behavior/product/program/etc. Other strategies I can tantalize you with include reciprocity, endorsement, alignment with strategy, and competition. Each requires longer explanation that we don’t have the space for here, but you can get a rough idea about some of them by looking at a series of blog posts that I wrote on my What Makes Lawyers Tick? blog — look for the tag “Accountability” and there are 4 posts that address influencing strategies.

JB: Any last thoughts on legal entrepreneurship?

LR: Yes, I think the most important parting thought takes us back full circle to the idea that we lawyers are trained to look for problems (in order to protect our clients.)

This mindset can lead to “hardening of the smarteries” — my name for a type of myopia that limits us from thinking creatively and innovatively. And it’s innovation and creativity that we need most in order to successfully entrepreneur. The cure is simply to (a) become more mindful about our negative (problem-seeking) mindsets, and (b) to train our brains to hunt for the good stuff — i.e., to actively look for strengths, opportunities, good news, etc. — in order to re-activate and strengthen our brain’s positivity-seeking circuitry. This not only offsets and balances the negative mindset, but research shows that it also expands our field of view. It makes us more likely to see creative solutions.

# Philadelphia Biglaw Firms Get On Board With Raises For Associates
## These firms are showing associates the money -- if they're in the right market, that is.

While a good number of firms have moved to a national salary scale for all associates during this summer’s salary wars, others have stuck with their prior, market-based approaches to compensation. For those firms, associates in larger markets moved up to the now-prevailing $205.000 salary scale, while associates in smaller markets received commensurate raises.

That’s exactly what’s going on at Philadelphia-based firms Blank Rome and Duane Morris. Both firms recently raised salaries, but some associates will be receiving less money than others based simply on their office location.

Thanks to Jeff Blumenthal’s intrepid reporting over at the [Philadelphia Business Journal](https://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2021/07/19/two-more-big-philadelphia-law-firms-hike-salaries.html), we now know that Blank Rome has raised salaries for first-year associates in its larger markets (New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and D.C.) to $205,000 and increased starting salaries for associates in its smaller markets (Wilmington, Princeton, and its home base of Philadelphia) to $190,000. All other associates will receive commensurate market salary increases. The firm did not disclose what raises, if any, first-years in other offices would receive.

Duane Morris, on the other hand, has raised salaries for all associates in its major markets (Philadelphia, New York, D.C., and Chicago) to $190,000, with commensurate raises for all other associates depending on class year, market location, and practice area.

This all seems a little black-boxy for our tastes, but as we keep saying, a raise is a raise is a raise. If you’d like to help us crack the compensation code for Blank Rome and Duane Morris for other class years, please feel free to send us an email. We will be sure to keep you anonymous.

We depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post.

## It looks like the tide may be turning and we'll see even more firms increase associate compensation.

The more Biglaw firms that get onboard with the latest and greatest associate compensation grid, the more that will follow. It’s like a pebble rolling downhill — that shit’s gonna pick up steam. That’s why everyone at firms that haven’t announced raises should be cheering for the good folks at Akin Gump, because the powers that be have just announced raises.

For those of you that may have, somehow forgotten what that scale looks like, let’s refresh your memory:

And they’ll also be taking home special bonuses, consistent with the prevailing market rate:



It has taken longer for this year’s Biglaw salary bump to be matched by the market than 2016. Back then, after nearly 10 years without a raise, firms all across the country were quick to pony up the money. In 2018, raises are taking longer, but it looks like the tide may be turning and we’ll see even more firms increase associate compensation.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# So Who Is Pissed About Their Bonuses?!?

It’s that time of the year — BONUS SEASON. Sure, some people in Biglaw will be taking home six-figure paydays, but a lot of you are not. Whether it’s because your firm has stretched out its financial obligations making MoneyLaw raises earlier this year or is generally known to be Grinch-y (or will just enroll you in a Jelly of the Month Club), there’s some anger a-brewin’ in the associate ranks.


We’ve even started getting complaints. Take this Jones Day associate:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
[A]s bonus season rolls around, associates at JD are getting even more frustrated.  There have been rumors that JD will do an off-cycle raise in January to mitigate the market gap issue that y’all highlighted earlier this year, but no one from the administration has confirmed this, nor does anyone really believe it will bring us up to (or near) market.

And Morgan Lewis folks are anticipating getting screwed already:

Morgan Lewis has made clear that they intend to cut bonuses for associates that made their hours (2000) by anywhere from 25 to 75% based on subjective factors in the discretion of firm/practice group management (this was explained during webinars the firm held for associates this past October apparently to get us geared up for the upcoming disappointment).

….

With Dechert announcing [full bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-firm-from-the-good-part-of-pennsylvania-matches/) for those that make their hours (1950), I thought it would be a good time to make everyone aware of how different their crosstown rival compensates their associates so that anyone trying to make a choice between the two will know what is at stake.

So who else out there knows the holidays won’t be happy (at least money-wise)? Drop us an [email](mailto:kathryn@abovethelaw.com?subject=Your%20Column) and let us know — we’d love to hear you bitch. Funny, biting, or otherwise interesting responses may be published here on Above the Law, anonymously of course.

# Another Global Firm Matches The Scale Right Before Thanksgiving

Cleary Gottlieb sent its associates off to the holiday with something to be thankful for, announcing a full Cravath match for its associates on its U.S. compensation scale. In other words, the New York and Washington attorneys and those international lawyers paid the American scale.

This isn’t a surprise for Cleary, a firm that dutifully keeps up with the Cravaths when it comes to attorney compensation. Observers may note that there aren’t any bells and whistles offering [premium bonuses for top billers or lumps of coal for those who missed targets](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/biglaw-firm-offers-30-percent-premium-over-scale-for-top-billers/) because Cleary remains old-school in its commitment to collegiality, and at the heart of that commitment is a lockstep compensation regime that respects its associates enough to know they’re all working hard and hour fluctuations are more a factor of assignment chance than someone shirking. It’s a professional mindset that’s increasingly fading away in Biglaw.

Anyway, here’s the scale:

Editor’s note: This is the latest installment of the “Reference Manual of Legal Tech Lists,” an eBook set for release this spring. [Read the prior installments here](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/wolters-kluwer-lists/), and feel free to pre-register for your copy of the complete eBook using the form below. 

In our continuing effort to explore the various [nooks & crannies](https://www.factsnfiguresinc.com/post/do-you-know-how-thomas-the-english-muffins-slogan-nooks-crannies-came-to-life) of the legal tech world, we’ve now taken up list creation by category. Each entry of our brand-new “LegalTech Reference Manual of Lists” will explore a new category lurking in the dark recesses of legal tech – you know, [the kind that are buried deep down, of the sort you don’t talk about at parties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FnO3igOkOk).

This time, on the list of lists, we’ll cover the five most underutilized features in legal tech systems. While limiting ourselves to five options only might be understating it significantly, it’s what I’d call a good start.

1. eSign. At this point in time, post-pandemic, almost every law firm is at least aware of eSignature functionality, and the vast majority of law firms are aggressively using it.

But lots of attorneys are getting their documents — from engagement agreements to multi-signer contracts — electronically signed via a standalone tool. And, those tools work, for sure — though, you may be paying for them unnecessarily.

That’s because lots of softwares now have proprietary or white-labeled eSignature tools available as part of your subscription, especially broad productivity suites like case management software for law firms, and other productivity systems, including [customer relationship management tools](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/crm-software-for-law-firms/id1557663598?i=1000557107934). 

Now, this is a situation where you’ll really need to read the fine print — because, depending on your subscription level, you may be looking at a truncated option. 

(For example, some companies limit the number of eSigns you have access to each month, depending on your particular subscription type. So, you’ll want to be aware of whether you have 10 eSigns accessible every month versus 100, based on your established volume. Though, if you go over, you can always buy more eSigns, at a pre-established rate.)

But, the good news is that, if an eSignature offering in a current tool is available for you, and fits your requirements, you may not need to pay an additional subscription fee, or manage another, separate, siloed product. Plus, built-in eSignature features allow you to place more of your workflow management into a single system, saving you time and effort. (More on that later.)

2. Document Assembly. Attorneys treat document assembly like they’re trying to manage nuclear fission. And, yeah: It’s not easy to effectively utilize document assembly in a law practice. But the reason most lawyers get all worked up about the process is because they’re perfectionists and completists. 

You know that’s right. As you’re reading this paragraph, you’re starting to break out in hives, aren’t you? And, it’s because you’re thinking about revising all of your templates, and also figuring out all of the field placements and all of the logic twists in your documents that no software could ever replicate. OH . . . MY . . . GOD . . . We might as well just continue to use paper notes! What are we doing here?!?

But, let’s think smaller. You don’t necessarily have to conceive of this so broadly.  Lots of softwares, again including law practice management software, as well as time and billing software, offer some pretty basic document assembly features that can streamline your processes pretty effectively, with minimal effort. The two most common documents you can build, in more products than you think, are the two most common law firm document types: engagement agreements and invoices. Pretty much every modern, cloud-based time and billing software will allow you to create an invoice, or billing, template, that you can send to your clients. 

Now, that’s a pretty simple document assembly ask: slap a logo and letterhead on top + populate the billing components — but, that’s also a heck of a lot better than generating an invoice in Microsoft each and every time you need one. 

And while those fee agreements are a little more complex — the scope and rate may be different every time — these documents are susceptible to rapid production also. 

If your system can account for document logic, you can simply select the case type and/or fee structure (or have it selected automatically), and generate the right document for the right new client. Even where a system is only going to be adding document fields, you can still create different types of standard fee agreements for different situations, and get the client and basic case information added to each of  those documents automatically.

3. Client Portals. By now, you know that sharing sensitive information via email (attachment) is a bad idea. (Right?) The reason for that is because email is an inherently unsecure method for sending data. There are two types of data, from an information security perspective: “resident data” and “moving data.”  

The real problem, when it comes to data security, is when data moves, because it then becomes infinitely harder to control. So, when you send unencrypted files or documents via email, that email and/or attachment passes through multiple servers before it gets to its final destination, and you can’t guarantee that all those servers are encrypted. So, your data is exposed. Now, you could encrypt your attachment(s), or encrypt your entire email system. But, that’s another step + more cost for you, as a business owner.

The better option then, is to use what is colloquially referred to as a “client portal.” What this means is that you’re providing someone external to your organization, like a client or a referral source, with access to only a portion of your data set, like a client file or even a single document, via a dedicated sharing portal available in a technology system you use. 

This method better protects your data, because the information remains nestled in the relative security of your encrypted document storage container, where your invitee accesses it — there’s no more data transfer, so you don’t have to take special or additional steps to protect that “moving data.”  

In this scenario, the person you’ve invited to access information via your “portal” will create a unique password (their email is usually the username) to access the initial data set you have shared with them, plus any additional information you seek to share, in the future (their password will remain the same, unless they change it). Not only does this method better protect your law firm data, in line with state laws and jurisdictional [ethics rules](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ethics-for-legal-tech-with-mark-palmer/id1557663598?i=1000601814187), it also places the burden (mind you, a small one) of taking the step to access secured data on the person or organization you’re sharing that data with (i.e., they will need to create a username, rather than your having to encrypt information and send it separately).

Any document cloud storage system (including [Google Drive](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2494822?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop), [Microsoft’s OneDrive](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/share-onedrive-files-and-folders-9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07)/Sharepoint, [Dropbox](https://help.dropbox.com/share/share-with-others), etc.) will include this feature for sharing files and folders. And law practice management softwares and customer relationship management tools will offer the same option for files and folders, but also invoices and client notifications.

Another plus is that using an internal system like this one will allow you to skirt the usual size limitations on sending information via emails.

4. Workflow Management. Lately, law firms have been aggressively seeking processes, in order to ramp up efficiency within their offices, including the hybrid ones, where attorneys want to ensure that work is getting done at home, as well as in the traditional office setting. This desire really ramped up during the pandemic, when old-school office work was forever broken, and attorneys realized that, moving forward, they would need to figure out a way to oversee employees and staff in remote locations. 

Fortunately, workflows (which are simply: aggregated list of tasks, built in a chronological order, with specific task owners and deadlines) are the best answer for managing remote staff. Modern workflow management systems allow business owners to select a case or matter, and access an overview of the tasks both completed and pending. Effectively, this eliminates the need for those burdensome “all case” review meetings — which is why I quit practicing law in the first place!

Constructing workflows is a whole other discussion — because you want to get really granular about how you do it. But, just having them, in any format, is a great start. 

And, as per the theme of our little essay, many major law firm tools now feature workflow systems, from productivity softwares to case management softwares to financial management systems to CRMs, and more. 

Some of those systems will offer only manual workflows (i.e., you/your staff will be reminded to do something, then you actually have to go do it). Others utilize automations — i.e., the system will take the action for you, including for requests (e.g., payments) and follow-ups (e.g. , “You haven’t paid us yet, please do so.”)

Clearly, the latter option is appealing to lawyers, who want to reduce the work burden on themselves and their staff.

5. Reporting/Dashboards. Modern business segments are pretty consistently utilizing data to make better business decisions, from [the sports industry](https://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-Art-Winning-Unfair-Game/dp/0393324818) to [the financial management sector](https://www.businessinsider.com/wall-street-data-science-business-schools-mba-wharton-columbia-northwestern-2022-2). And, partly because they’re beginning to develop workflows (which make data more accessible) in their law practices, attorneys are beginning to catch up. 

While most lawyers still avoid manipulating datasets for decision-making for the same reason they tend to avoid leveraging document assembly — it seems like a really big job — the fact of the matter is that you’re not necessarily looking to leverage “big data” like the kind maintained by Google or Meta, to improve how you run your law practice.  [“Small data,” like the sort you keep about your clients and your processes, is really all you need](https://digitalcommons.law.wne.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1734&context=lawreview), to compete, or even crush, your competition.

Now, as luck would have it, this data is more susceptible to interpretation than it’s ever been before. 

Legaltech softwares, as well as general business softwares that lawyers regularly use, have been making improvements to reporting tools over the course of time — even if lots of attorneys still continue to ignore those features. 

For one thing, more data is available in-system now. With the advent and domination of cloud software in the legal market, as well as the prevalence of integrations between tools, including via third party technology, more data than ever before is accessible within individual systems. 

Especially in case management software and customer relationship management software, which are (effectively) anchor programs for most law firms, attorneys can effectively array nearly all of the information for individual matters, from whatever source, for review in one place. That means that reports generating from those systems are more meaningful and robust than they’ve ever been. 

Plus, reporting is no longer accessible only via “walls of text” or dense spreadsheets. New school systems offer reporting “dashboards,” which represent graphical interpretations of law firm information, including trends over time.

That’s right: You’ve got pie charts, line graphs and colorscapes, to beat the band; so now, your eyes won’t gloss over looking at endless chains of numbers. Even better, you can arrange dashboards in the places where you want them in your software, including at your main access page. And, because the new dashboards are more focused on primary [KPIs (key performance indicators) for law firms](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/kpis-and-reporting-for-law-firms-with-mary-juetten/id1557663598?i=1000599411200), you can get what you need faster, and more accurately.

The data revolution for law firms is here, and it’s spectacular. And, all you have to do to access it is click + drag.

# A Departure Memo, From David Lat
## I'm proud of Above the Law, grateful to my readers and colleagues, and excited to begin the next chapter of my career.

Years ago, when I left Wachtell Lipton as a fourth-year associate, I had an unusual plan: to move to Los Angeles and become a Hollywood talent agent. I can’t recall how this got into my head — no, I wasn’t inspired by fellow gaysian Lloyd Lee of Entourage, which hadn’t aired yet — but this was my announced intention. It puzzled my colleagues, but at the same time, they knew that [Biglaw wasn’t for me](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/22/technology/he-fought-the-law-they-both-won.html).

I never ended up moving to Tinseltown. Before upending my life and trading coasts, I decided to give myself a taste of what it would be like to toil in an agency mailroom and work my way up the ranks, the traditional path to becoming an agent. I was lucky enough to land an internship in the New York office of Creative Artists Agency — and after a summer spent fetching coffee and making photocopies for minimum wage, I realized I didn’t have the stomach for years of low-paid apprenticeship at CAA or any other agency.

Fortunately, I had been interviewing around the same time with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New Jersey, where I had spent a great summer interning after my first year of law school. So when then-U.S. Attorney Chris Christie offered me a position as an assistant U.S. attorney, I shelved my Hollywood plan and jumped at the opportunity.

The [rest](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/11/21/scotus-watch) of my [story](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/22/technology/he-fought-the-law-they-both-won.html) has been [recounted elsewhere](https://web.archive.org/web/20130211110135/http://www.details.com/culture-trends/career-and-money/201212/david-lat-above-the-law-legal). The abridged version: I started writing a saucy judicial gossip blog called [Underneath Their Robes](https://underneaththeirrobes.blogs.com) (under a pseudonym, since I was still working as an AUSA); the site grew popular, and I [revealed my identity as its author](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/11/21/scotus-watch) in an interview with Jeffrey Toobin of the New Yorker; and in the summer of 2006, I left the practice of law and launched Above the Law, which has grown over the years into one of the largest legal news websites in the country.

But now, years after my departure from Wachtell Lipton, I’ve come full circle. I’m becoming a talent agent after all — for lawyers.[1]

Today I’m pleased to announce that I’m joining [Lateral Link](https://www.mainspringlegal.com/laterallink/), one of the world’s leading legal search firms, as a managing director in the New York office. I will represent and place top associates, partners, and partner groups into preeminent law firms around the country, and I will use my experience and expertise as a journalist to assist Lateral Link with media and public relations, including social media and content marketing. (For more details, see this [press release](https://www.mainspringlegal.com/lateral-link-expands-in-new-york-with-addition-of-legal-journalist-david-lat/).)

Why legal recruiting? As readers of Above the Law know, lateral movement by lawyers is at record levels, with an estimated [$17.1 billion in business](https://www.law.com/2019/02/04/a-live-discussion-about-the-robust-and-risky-lateral-market/) moving with lateral partners over the past five years. Being a recruiter represents a chance to participate in this process, one of the most important forces shaping the legal industry today.

Some worry about the consequences of lateral movement for firm culture and collegiality, but movement is actually a good thing. As labor economists will tell you, a fluid and dynamic talent market [is a positive](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/25/business/economy/fewer-workers-choose-to-move-to-new-pastures.html), allocating human capital more efficiently — and in the business of law, human capital is the most important capital there is. It’s worth noting that the past few years, marked by record lateral movement, have also seen Biglaw revenue and profitability reach [record highs](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/04/23/the-am-law-100-reached-new-heights-driven-by-nearly-universal-growth/).

In less abstract and more personal terms, legal recruiters help lawyers become… happy! Or at least less unhappy.

I can’t tell you how many young lawyers I’ve met over the years who were miserable in their jobs, especially their first jobs out of law school as Biglaw associates, and thought about leaving the legal profession entirely. There’s a reason why “associate attorney” was once voted the [unhappiest job in America](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/03/unhappiest-job-in-america-take-a-guess/), and why the pages of Above the Law contain many tales of Biglaw woe (along with advice and resources for coping).

But I also know many young lawyers who decided to give law another chance — by moving to a boutique firm, an in-house position, a government post, or a Biglaw firm with a different culture. And many of these attorneys are glad they did, going on to fulfilling, successful, and long-lasting legal careers.

Whether the story turns out to have a happy ending, however, depends in large part on the quality of the career choices the lawyer makes. While you can’t completely remove risk from any process, you can reduce the risk associated with a job move, by conducting careful due diligence and getting wise counsel from knowledgeable advisers.

So I view legal recruiting as an extension of my work over the years at Above the Law: providing people with more and better information, both positive and negative, and helping them make sounder decisions. I believe my two decades as a lawyer and legal journalist have prepared me well for my new role as a recruiter, providing me with industry experience, knowledge, and contacts that will benefit my clients and candidates.

Why Lateral Link? First, it’s one of a few top-tier, national legal recruiting firms (most of them [ATL advertisers](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/thanks-a-bunch-to-our-advertisers-9/)). Second, I happen to have the longest relationship with Lateral Link, which in 2007 became Above the Law’s first advertiser and has worked with ATL ever since. As both recruiters and rainmakers will tell you, the length of a relationship matters.

(Of course, I’m grateful to all of the other superb recruiters who were kind enough to speak with me over the past few months. As legal recruiting has grown and matured, the industry has attracted increasingly impressive individuals, many of them former practicing lawyers, and I definitely noticed this during my due diligence.)

Although I’m no longer a full-time editor of Above the Law, I will remain involved with the site as “editor emeritus.” I will write a column (to appear every other week on Tuesdays), attend and participate in ATL events, and assist with select editorial and sponsored projects. Beyond Above the Law, I will continue to [write for other publications](https://davidlat.com/writing/) and [speak at law firms](https://davidlat.com/speaking/), at firm-wide retreats, partner retreats, summer associate events, and diversity initiatives.

I will miss Above the Law as a workplace. But I know that ATL will continue to thrive under the ownership of [Breaking Media](http://breakingmedia.com), the leading publisher of websites and social-media channels for influential, affluent business communities. This isn’t the first time I’ve adjusted my involvement with Above the Law. In 2017, after my husband and I [had our son](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a45722/gay-parents-surrogacy/), I [stepped down as managing editor](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/a-changing-of-the-guard-at-above-the-law/) and spent a year and a half “leaning out” (i.e., hanging out with my baby, going to the gym a lot, and trying to figure out what to do with the rest of my life). I turned over leadership of ATL to my longtime colleague, Elie Mystal. The result? In 2018, the site enjoyed record traffic and revenue.

I will have more detailed [reflections on my time at Above the Law](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/reflections-of-an-editor-emeritus-above-the-law-2006-2019/) in my first column as editor emeritus, which will appear tomorrow. For now, I’d just like to thank everyone — terrific colleagues, readers, sources, sponsors — and urge all of you to please [stay in touch](https://www.mainspringlegal.com/team/david-lat/).

[1] There are important differences between talent agents and legal recruiters. Talent agents work for the “talent” — actors, writers, directors — and get paid a percentage commission from the talent’s earnings (setting aside the complex and controversial issue of [packaging fees](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/07/business/media/writers-guild-talent-agencies.html)). Legal recruiters, on the other hand, get paid by law firms, who are their actual “clients”; the individual lawyers who get placed are “candidates.” So the gist of this ATL post by columnist Steven Chung is accurate — [“Recruiters Exist To Help Employers, Not Job Seekers”](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/recruiters-exist-to-help-employers-not-job-seekers/) — and you shouldn’t take it personally if you reach out to a recruiter and don’t hear back (or if you hear back and the recruiter explains why you aren’t a fit).

If you’re an associate at a top firm or a partner with a sizable book of business, then you can probably benefit from the services of a recruiter (and if you already get lots of cold calls and emails from recruiters, that’s a good sign). If not, though, then working with a recruiter might actually be to your detriment, by making you more expensive to hire (because the law firm must pay the recruiter’s placement fee on top of your salary). So you might be better off applying to firms on your own, especially if you have a connection like a friend or law school classmate who already works at the firm and can flag your application.

# The Latest COVID Screw Up: Character & Fitness Reviews
## This seems like an unreasonable request.

UPDATE: While the committee is refusing to respond to inquiries from candidates, the Unified Court System tells us that there is no deadline for resubmitting these materials.

The lockdown presents all sorts of unexpected obstacles to the practice of law, and while [seating for the upcoming bar exam](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/law-school-deans-rail-against-grave-injustice-of-waiting-a-few-months-to-take-the-bar-exam/) is the hottest topic right now, the folks who have already passed the exam are facing bureaucratic nonsense too.

We’ve started hearing from candidates seeking admission to the bar that some Character & Fitness Committees are struggling to get their work done remotely and have put the onus on the candidates to reinvent the wheel. One tipster forwarded this message from a C&F source instructing the candidate to start from scratch:

Submit your entire application electronically. Although you have already physically submitted your application, I don’t have access to your file. My entire staff is required to work remotely and your documents are physically in an office that I am not allowed to enter.

That’s a reasonable enough request… two months out. However, the email was apparently sent FIVE DAYS before the materials are due. This is an application that requires chasing down recommendations from former employers and materials from law schools — all people who aren’t responding in a flash to random requests right now. And, yes, it requires chasing these down because the applicant doesn’t just have copies since the committee requires these be sent in directly by the authors without passing through the candidate!

If there’s a trend that flows through all of the bureaucratic fights we’re seeing right now it’s an acute case square peg/round hole syndrome. Obviously paper forms are inaccessible. A rational response to this would be to request more limited and easily acquired materials, perhaps coupled with an expanded personal interview over teleconferencing services to allow the committee to issue limited provisional approvals. Develop a regime for random spot inspections of trust accounts for attorneys on a provisional approval or something. At the very least, a proposal to blow out the deadline to realistically offer applicants an opportunity to regather the more onerous materials. Instead, the committee is trying to find a way to complete the full review within the existing timeline without access to the file.

The pandemic has radically shifted how everything works. Stop pretending that it’s possible to conduct business as usual with a few hacks.

# Predictions For 2023
## If you're ready to keep reading my predictions, I'm ready to keep writing 'em.

Yes!
Politico was identifying a list of predictions made in 2022, and [one of my predictions](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/8199676061886085868#) from last year made the list!

Unfortunately, [it was a list of the worst predictions made in 2022](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/8199676061886085868#): I predicted that people in Florida would be offended by (1) a high number of deaths from COVID-19 and (2) an anti-abortion candidate in a generally pro-choice state.  After the reversal of Roe (which I correctly anticipated), I guessed that the voters in Florida would send Ron DeSantis to defeat in his gubernatorial reelection campaign. Instead, DeSantis won in a landslide.

I have to admit, this wasn’t my finest hour.

But predictions made by Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Tucker Carlson, and Paul Krugman also made Politico’s list of stinkers, so at least I was in good company.

Anyway, if you’re ready to keep reading my predictions, I’m ready to keep writing ’em. Here are my three predictions for 2023.

First, Donald Trump will be indicted, and violence will ensue.

The first part is easy: Too many prosecutors are investigating Trump’s suspicious activities in too many places for Trump to dodge all of the bullets. Maybe it’s Georgia, maybe it’s the documents at Mar-a-Lago, maybe it’s fomenting an insurrection in D.C., maybe it’s something else. But Trump is getting indicted in 2023.

You heard it here ninety-fourth.

I’ll add an obvious wrinkle: After Trump is indicted, there will be violence.

Trump’s supporters have shown that they will be violent. Trump has fomented violence in the past. Trump is already trying to foment violence to avoid getting indicted. And Trump encouraged people to sack the Capitol building when he was at risk only of being thrown out of the presidency; imagine what Trump will do if he’s at risk of being thrown behind bars.

Trump will be indicted, and there will be violence.

Here’s my second prediction for 2023: At least one of the defamation lawsuits now pending against conservatives or conservative news organizations will result in a plaintiff’s verdict. The plaintiffs’ verdicts in the recent lawsuits against Alex Jones have shown that juries will find liability when the facts demonstrate that a conservative pundit recklessly disregarded the truth. There will be similar results in 2023.

Dominion Voting Systems has sued Fox News (and its parent company, Fox Corp.) complaining about Fox’s reporting about Dominion’s voting machines. [The evidence appears to support Dominion’s claims](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/8199676061886085868#). Dominion [has sued](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/8199676061886085868#) One America News Network on similar grounds.

[Dominion has also sued](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/8199676061886085868#) Mike Lindell (the MyPillow guy), Rudy Giuliani, and Sydney Powell on somewhat similar claims. [Smartmatic](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/8199676061886085868#), another voting machine company, has filed defamation claims against broadcasters and others. And [Georgia election workers have sued](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/8199676061886085868#) Giuliani for falsely claiming that they committed election fraud. There’s a long list of pending defamation cases arising out of the 2020 elections.

I know that some of these cases won’t be set for trial in 2023. I know that other cases will settle. But I’ll go out on a limb here: At least one of the defamation cases against a conservative or a conservative news organization will result in a plaintiff’s verdict in 2023.

Hey: How wrong can I be with that one? (And how likely is it that Politico would put me on a list of crappy predictions for two years in a row? I think I’m safe.)

Here’s my third, and last, prediction for the year: Downtown office real estate will undergo a transformation that starts in 2023.

A piece of this prediction is obvious: Corporations and law firms have realized that working from an office full-time is both unnecessary and costly. There’s no reason to do it, and firms won’t.

Vacancy rates for downtown office space are already high. Occupancy rates are protected somewhat by the fact that law firms (and others) tend to sign long-term leases, and those leases will expire only gradually over the coming years.

But some of that office space will eventually have to be put to other uses. The question is: What use? It’s quite expensive to convert downtown office buildings into apartments: the plumbing is all wrong, and office buildings frequently have a lot of interior space and relatively few windows, so conversion is difficult. But something has to happen with that space, and I predict that the change will begin in 2023.

(This prediction of course doesn’t apply to warehouse space, or real estate other than offices. My crystal ball there is much too cloudy.)

So those are my three predictions for 2023. Let’s hope I don’t look too silly at this time in 2024. And I have one final thought — which is not a prediction, but a wish — for the coming year: I hope your 2023 is a happy and healthy one.

# Biglaw Firm Wows All Employees With Brand New Family-Friendly Benefits
## Which firm just rolled out a fully paid, gender-neutral policy, with additional time off?

One by one, Biglaw firms across the country have realized that in order to recruit and retain the best talent, they need to offer the best perks and policies for a progressive new generation of lawyers. That may be why yet another firm has decided to truly support its attorneys — and staff members — who are embarking upon the fantastic journey into parenthood.

Which firm is the latest to modernize its parental leave policies? That would be Taft Stettinius & Hollister, which recently announced that a new, gender-neutral leave policy would be implemented, ensuring that attorneys and staff members alike will receive additional time off following the birth or adoption of their new child.

All employees at the firm will now receive 16 weeks of fully paid parental leave, and on top of that, Taft is now offering on-demand child and adult back-up care that will be available in the employee’s home, in a hotel (if the employee is traveling for firm-related business), or in an adult dependent’s residing city.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Christine L. Birch, Taft’s Chief Operating Officer, said this of the firm’s new policy:

It is an exciting time at Taft as we implement new and forward-looking policies. We understand that it can be challenging at times to manage both work and family needs. When life is easier on the home front, it is also easier to have a rewarding and fulfilling career. We’re constantly looking for meaningful ways to advance and support our attorneys and staff.

Taft joins many other Biglaw firms that have recently adopted enhanced, gender-neutral parental leave plans, and a handful of other firms that treat their staff members somewhat equitably in terms of parental leave.

We’ve often wondered whether Biglaw employees will choose to take full advantage of the parental leave policies that are being offered by their firms, and it’s now clear that large firms really want them to, without fearing for their safety of their jobs upon their return to work. These benefits are being offered for a reason: these law firms want associates to feel that they can grow with the firm — not just professionally, but personally. Taft’s new policy strives help associates and staff do just that.

Kudos to Taft on its new parental leave benefits. Firms stepping up their family-friendly policies is something we’ll continue to pay attention to — particularly as we head into recruiting season. Hopefully your firm is changing its ways when it comes to important policies like parental leave. Please [let us know](mailto:staci@abovethelaw.com) when it happens.

# Summer Associate Drinking Etiquette Debate
## Navigating the open bar events.

It’s that time of year where law students flock to the firms to get hands-on experience with practical legal work… but mostly go to lunch and firm parties.

Which has experienced attorneys sharing their homespun summer associate advice. Nothing big… stuff like “don’t [slap attorneys](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/did-a-biglaw-lawyer-just-get-slapped-by-a-summer-associate/),” “avoid [initiating a love triangle with the managing partner](https://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/we_know_what_you_did_last_summer),” or “never [involve the Coast Guard](https://abovethelaw.com/2006/11/an-update-on-aquagirl-things-are-going-swimmingly/).”

But one bit of advice kicked off a social media debate: should summers avoid drinking at firm events? Cybersecurity law professor Jeff Kosseff thought no:

Summer Associate Advice

1. Don’t drink at firm events.

2. Proofread your work.

3. Ask questions, but don’t be the summer associate who asks the most questions. This is not law school. You are receiving an obscene paycheck to go to lunch and baseball games.

Certainly would underscore the second point. And I can think of [a couple lawyers who used ChatGPT in a filing](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/chatgpt-bad-lawyering/) who would probably agree right about now.

But should law students really go fully on the wagon for the sake of the summer? It turns out there are some strong feelings on the subject:

While some heartily endorsed the advice, others questioned whether refraining from alcohol at events designed around open bars could undermine their career prospects. A firm wouldn’t consciously no-offer someone for not drinking, but could a summer assiduously avoiding happy hours and being “out of step” with the sobriety level around them get dinged for “not fitting in”?

They shouldn’t. Firms are far more conscious of substance abuse and peer pressure than they were in the past — arguably [a little too conscious](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-summer-programs-phasing-out-boozefests-to-create-all-new-worse-sexual-harassment-opportunities/) — so there is little risk that you’re compromising your career by passing on the free drinks.

Well, unless you’re the guy Lawprofblawg is snarking on here.

If I see someone *not* snorting cocaine at an event, I'll need to know why. Not snorting cocaine because you can't control yourself is just as valid a[] reason as any other why I wouldn't hire you.

It’s also arguably an ADA violation to not hire someone because you think they’re a recovering alcoholic, so don’t do this.

Speaking of opening the firm up to legal action, asking after a non-drinking associate is fraught with opportunities to land in hot water.

Folks had a lot of thoughts and there were a lot of lengthy threads (not this one though):

HERE IS HOW SUMMER ASSOCIATES SHOULD DRINK ALCOHOL

1/258

— Joe Dudek (@JoeDudekJD) [June 1, 2023](https://twitter.com/JoeDudekJD/status/1664399836307660801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

So should summers drink at firm events? Sure… if they want to. Or don’t if you don’t want to. As long as you don’t end up gracing the pages of Above the Law in the bad way, do whatever you want. The firms expect summers to drink, so don’t abstain for fear of getting tipsy. But firms also don’t want to fish you out of the river, so don’t get drunk.

Not to sound like a liquor commercial, but be responsible. If that means not drinking, no one (at a serious firm anyway) is going to mind. And if it means drinking for you, stay professional.

# What's Behind The Bad Vibes At Biglaw Firms?
## Some firms focus on profits to the detriment of their associates.

What makes the culture of a Biglaw firm? That’s a surprisingly difficult question to answer without defaulting to Potter Stewart’s “I know it when I see it” explanation. But the folks at Major Lindsey & Africa have attempted to parse it all out in their [2023 Law Firm Culture Survey.](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/insights/research/2023-law-firm-culture-survey)

The survey author, Ronald Wood, a managing director at MLA, [explained](https://www.law.com/2024/01/23/a-sweatshop-lawyers-detest-law-firm-cultures-that-emphasize-profitability/) how they hit upon the methodology. “We tried to come up with a list of things that people place value on. How do those compare to what you see in your firm? What do you want to see more or less of?” he said. “Because culture is out there in so many different ways, let’s pull it together in one place and see what it actually means when you sample the lawyer population.”

And the results are interesting. Almost 40% identified “profit-mindedness” as something that induced negative feelings toward their law firm. While profits fuel the $225,000 associate pay scale, it’s the exclusive focus on revenue that has negative reverberations throughout firms. [We’ve seen ](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/k-l-gates-layoffs/)Biglaw firms tout their stellar profitability on one hand while engaging in associate layoffs to maintain those numbers with the other.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The anonymous comments from the survey also show this:

“It is a boys club that is singularly fixated on getting everyone to return to the office 5 days a week and billing as many hours as possible with zero regard for other people’s job satisfaction, work/life balance, or mental health. Female attorneys are leaving in droves and I have no idea why other than I am miserable too.”

Others referred to their firm as “a cold sweatshop” or an employer with “almost no focus on training and mentorship.”

While the profit focus garnered the most negative reactions from respondents, lack of transparency and poor partner/associate ratios rounded out the top three reasons the vibes are off in Biglaw firms.

If that’s the list of what makes a bad Biglaw culture, you have to wonder, what makes a good one? The survey identified the following as positive culture indicators: “high priority on client service,” “high quality performance expectations,” “integrity,” and “firm is well-managed from a financial standpoint.”

Biglaw firms come in all shapes and sizes, and even the smaller ones are quickly adopting the DPW’s money moves when it comes to associate compensation.

Brown Rudnick — a firm with just over 200 attorneys that brought home $$216,367,000 gross revenue in 2020, landing it at No. 144 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — will be paying out salaries on the new Davis Polk scale for associates at all of its U.S. offices. Here’s what that looks like at the firm:

- 2020: $205,000
- 2019: $215,000
- 2018: $240,000
- 2017: $275,000
- 2016: $305,000
- 2015: $330,000
- 2014: $350,000

# Abusive, Sexist Partners In Biglaw: Better Just Endure It!

[Silence]

It’s the money.

But what should we make of the seemingly competing posts about Biglaw published here on Above the Law. One post’s headline declares that “[If You Have The Chance To Work In Biglaw, Take It!](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/if-you-have-the-chance-to-work-in-biglaw-take-it/)” Another decries that “[The Screaming In Law Firms Needs To End](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/the-screaming-in-law-firms-needs-to-end/).”

Take the Biglaw job … and endure the screaming?  Why?

I wrote[ here](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/10-commandments-on-how-not-to-make-partner-in-biglaw/) that “Let’s face it: everyone who goes to law school — just everyone — longs to land a job in Biglaw, right?  You passed through law school, the first phase of the law-hazing process, and passed the demanding entrance exam to become … a lawyer! And now, Biglaw!”

The many virtues of Biglaw

I’ve also [extolled](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/5-reasons-not-to-work-from-home-and-stay-at-biglaw/) the many virtues of Biglaw: “the leisurely lifestyle, the sense of freedom and autonomy, the back-slapping camaraderie (isn’t your Biglaw firm like that?), and the … (wait … umm, there was one more minor thing), oh yeah … the money.”

Sure, [I wrote](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/5-reasons-not-to-work-from-home-and-stay-at-biglaw/), everyone knows about those virtues of Biglaw, but are there others?

Of course: there’s the wonderful incentive to keep running faster on that billing treadmill because of “the constant cajoling and threats to ‘BILL MORE!’ and the warnings that if your hours fall below 2,400 hours, the $1,000 bonus would not be given, or you could be canned,” as well as “the wonderous mysteries of compensation” and the “kiss[ing] up to the right people” and the “fun game of hide-and-seek fun game of hide-and-seek by devising creative ways to be scarce on Friday afternoon [trying] … to be scarce on Friday afternoon.”

See? The virtues abound!

But there must be some downsides to Biglaw, right?

I suppose.

Maybe.

Kathryn Rubino [wrote](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/the-screaming-in-law-firms-needs-to-end/) here about “screamers” at law firms, and how “it’s a form of abuse designed to keep subordinates, well, subordinate.”  She noted that “Biglaw firms (at least those that tout their culture as a benefit) love saying they don’t have any screamers. But, unfortunately, that can be wishcasting by folks in charge who have no idea what it’s like to work three floors up in a different department.”

So count the screamers as a negative — that is, only if you don’t like screamers.

“You should almost never assault associates – physically!”

Well, now that you mention it, the Biglaw firms that I was at had a lot of screamers. One partner screamed so loud and hard at associates that one was almost rendered “lame and halt,” and the partner was no longer permitted to work unmediated with associates.

In another Biglaw firm, a partner whipped a paperweight at an associate’s head — and just missed possibly killing him.  Boy was that partner given a lecture for that: “You should almost never assault associates — physically!”

White male hegemony in Biglaw

Oh yes — I now recall[ a post that I did](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/sex-and-biglaw-why-do-the-suits-keep-coming/):  “Sexual harassment and gender discrimination are being rooted out in every other institution, so why not Biglaw? After all, it’s no secret that Biglaw (and its national trade group, the ABA) has an unhappy history of discrimination.  Recall that African-Americans were [not permitted to join](https://books.google.com/books?id=1lOIjQUG4aoC&pg=PA546&lpg=PA546&dq=ABA+and+black+members&source=bl&ots=QFJ4-VWqK4&sig=9UyBrXFfOnhVNcVaOixox4RblQM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjz97bC1drYAhWyQ98KHadBBLgQ6AEIUjAN#v=onepage&q=ABA%20and%20black%20members&f=false) the ABA until 1943. Oh yes — and gender. (The [first woman member](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Bar_Association) of the ABA was not admitted until 1918).  So it’s no surprise that in the age of #MeToo, white male hegemony in Biglaw is being exposed, called out, and challenged, and its Biglaw factories sued.”

Funny … guess it just slipped my mind.

Coming from an advantaged social background helps only men and hurts women

Similarly, even given the recent confirmation hearings, I somehow forgot that I[ previously noted](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/why-higher-class-women-wont-get-that-biglaw-job-hiring-biases-that-you-wont-believe/)[ an article ](https://hbr.org/2016/12/research-how-subtle-class-cues-can-backfire-on-your-resume)by two professors who discussed “subtle class cues” and [prior research](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10457.html) which showed “that hiring in top professional services firms is highly skewed toward applicants from wealthy families,” and their disturbing conclusion that “coming from an advantaged social background helps only men” and hurts women.

“Biglaw apparently deems ‘higher-class women as ‘flight risks,’ who might desert the firm for less time-intensive areas of legal practice or might even leave paid employment entirely.”

Right, right… the discrimination, harassment, and misogyny.  Okat, so there are one or two negative things about Biglaw.

Nothing to see here … keep moving

But, critics of Biglaw, these things are totally unsurprising aspects of Biglaw. It’s not a particularly well-kept secret that these things are simply inherent in its structure: power, authority, submission — all of which seeks to maintain white make hegemony.  Why should this shock you or even deserve mentioning — the same thing exists in every other long-established hierarchical bureaucracy.

“It should come as no surprise,” I once[ wrote](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/sex-and-biglaw-why-do-the-suits-keep-coming/), that Biglaw perpetuates white male hegemony, since “it’s built into the Biglaw DNA.”

“Nothing to see here … keep moving,” I say.

The screamer is a rainmaker … he’ll pack up his ball and go to another firm

In her post, Kathryn Rubino said that “Usually this kind of unacceptable behavior is justified at a law firm because the screamer is a rainmaker and everyone’s scared that he’ll pack up his ball and go to another firm.”  Quite true, and also inherent in the Biglaw model.

As I [posted here](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/can-women-lawyers-ever-find-equality-in-biglaw/) last year, “[a]s long as the profits keep rolling in, why should Biglaw care about gender equality? … Nothing must get in the way of billing, the billable hour, the almost-sacred realization rate, or profits per partner. Certainly not you, lady!”

So …

So, deal with the screaming partners — an inherent aspect of Biglaw, which must maintain partner authority.  Kathryn put it well that the screaming is “a form of abuse designed to keep subordinates, well, subordinate.”

So, deal with the “paperweight flingers” — okay, so they go a little overboard sometimes.

And deal with the sexual harassment and inequality — an inherent aspect of Biglaw, which values power relationships and misogyny over respect and equality.

Oh, One More Thing…

In mentioning the one or two small downsides to Biglaw, I forgot all about that recent post which is a counterweight to the naysayers, “If You Have The Chance To Work In Biglaw, Take It!”

As the author astutely notes, “it is undeniable that law school is extremely expensive.”  Indeed, very expensive; most initiation or entrance fees to trades or professions are quite steep.  And, therefore, he touts the biggest virtue of Biglaw:  that if you “got debt” and are “considering a career in public service, but ha[ve] the chance to work in Biglaw, take a job right out of law school that pays the most money.”

See, it’s the money!!  That’s the whole point.

He concludes his left-handed compliment of Biglaw by stating that “if you can bear deferring your dreams for a few years, the reward of financial freedom might just be worth it.”

Dreams are a lot of crap, anyway!

Takeaway

Forget the screamers — let it roll off your back.  I told you that it was all about the money.

But just don’t forget to duck when the paperweight starts flying.

# MoFo Makes Bold Decision To Spy On Its Attorneys

Everyone knows one of the absolute worst parts of Biglaw is timekeeping. Sure, sure, it’s how firms get paid so we GET why it’s important, but it’s still a trudge. So the advent of newer technology designed to help out with this menial task is welcome. But, what that definitely doesn’t mean is that it’s okay for Biglaw firms to install software mandatorily on firm devices so they can watch every mouse click an associate makes.

But that’s exactly what’s going on at Morrison & Foerster.

Business Insider (subscription required) [has the details](https://www.businessinsider.com/mofo-time-logging-software-raises-surveillance-fears-new-normal-2021-4):

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
On April 21, New York timekeepers — law-firm speak for anyone who bills by the hour — had a feature called Intapp Time Capture turned on on their computers, according to an internal email seen by Insider. The feature has been available since October, with 15% of timekeepers opting in. But it will now be turned on automatically, according to the email. Pitched as a way to capture “valuable data,” it tells users how much time they spend in which files, on which websites, and on which phone calls so they can file more accurate records of billable hours.

Partner Tim Harris gave the feature a thumbs up, saying, “I have been using this tool for several years and it has helped me capture TONS of billable time.” But… wasn’t it nice that he got to choose whether to opt in? The feature itself isn’t the issue as much as requiring its use. And, also, a senior partner has almost an infinite amount of freedom compared to associates. Younger attorneys (probably correctly) will fear the long hand of Big Brother MoFo getting all in their business about every minute they spend in the course of a day.

Insiders definitely feel the warm breath of surveillance on their necks:

“Everyone just presumes the firm did it to monitor our behavior more — true or not,” said a Morrison & Foerster lawyer who asked to remain anonymous because they did not have permission from the firm to discuss the policy.

And the timing is real shit too. Like everyone is feeling the strain of quarantine life, the end of which is nearly in our grasp, and now the firm is really sticking it to folks to make sure they get every damned billable second out of associates? As an insider told BI, “Rather than more moral support, it was more pressure.”

All of which means morale has taken a real hit, as Above the Law tipsters report:

Excuse my French, but it’s a bunch of bullshit. Morale at the firm is at an all-time low. First, they wait until the very end to announce bonuses. Then they install the Time Capture application, which is really meant to track us at every waking moment and/or squeeze an extra .6 out of each day.

Tipsters also point to MoFo’s recent switch to “unlimited” vacation time (which actually can make it a lot harder to justify taking [the much needed time off](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/its-time-for-all-vacations-to-be-billable-and-bonus-eligible/)). All of which is a recipe for increased stress and burn out.

Biglaw needs to take the technology available to help and support its associates, not use it as a backhanded way to ratchet up the pressure. That’s not a good — or sustainable — idea for anyone.

# A Day In The Life Of This In-House Counsel
## In contrast to senior associate life as an employment litigator, my life as in-house counsel is more varied.

I am often asked by law students what one of my typical days is like, and it often makes me laugh because there is no such thing, at least with regard to the things I get to work on. In contrast to senior associate life as an employment litigator, where most of my days were centered around research, drafting documents, and meetings with shareholders around a piece of litigation, with an occasional opportunity for oral advocacy, my life as in-house counsel is more varied. Add the fact that I am a mom of three, active in the community in nonprofits and professional organizations, and get to work mostly from home.

To give you an idea of what one of my days is like, here’s an example:

7 a.m.: Get up and get kids out the door by 7:30 a.m. to school and daycare. My husband and I have a great routine down, including very easy and light breakfasts of microwavable egg bites or pancakes, yogurt, cereal, or toasted croissants. While I am not proud, if we are late, sometimes my older kids will grab a Clif bar or worse, a bag of Funyuns. Yes, you read that right.

8 a.m.: Get a Peloton workout in, followed by meditation and journaling. Throw a load of laundry in if I can before my first meeting. Eat overnight oats at my desk while triaging email, prepping for the first call, or while posting on LinkedIn. Sometimes, I have an urgent client call or meeting instead. Truth be told, I’m grumpy for most of the day if this happens because it’s harder for me to fit in my workout if this happens.

9 a.m.: Usually my first call of the day with a client with a specific ask or issue. Some calls are only 20 minutes while others are 50 minutes to a full hour. This meeting is about complying with a new law (probably from California). I don’t have any homework out of this meeting because I did some prework, gave the legal advice, and shared a one-page resource for reference, but I calendar a reminder to follow up with the participants. When you’re in-house counsel, it is important to trust but verify.

9:30 a.m.: Attend a call with outside counsel to get their initial thoughts on a new litigation matter. Align on next steps and strategy. Ask them to send me calendar invites for upcoming deadlines.

10 a.m.: Attend a team meeting of all employment lawyers. Here, I give updates on what we’re working on so everyone is in the loop, brainstorm on issues that affect all our clients so we can speak with “one voice” and mitigate potential “forum shopping” and also information-share about what’s going on in the company. It’s also an opportunity to envy one another’s vacation or connect over shared experiences like kids’ saying the darndest things or lament over workouts.

11 a.m.: I block off 30 minutes to prep for a call with my general counsel. I use this time to review what I’ve already sent her, try to anticipate the questions she will ask, and strategize over what I will lead with first. If you’re in-house counsel, this is my pro-tip. Schedule at least 15 minutes before and after every meeting to prepare, to ensure that you show up the way you intend, and for after the meeting, make sure you document and calendar what you need to follow up on.

11:30 a.m.: Meeting with my general counsel and my manager, vice president and associate general counsel.

12:00 p.m.: Rotate laundry to the dryer before I microwave and eat my nutritious-but-not-delicious lunch as I join and actively contribute to a monthly board meeting for The Podium, a nonprofit I founded with seven other fabulous lawyers. We are a working board, and I always leave the meeting impressed by how much we accomplish and inspired by each of the members.

1:30 p.m.: I block off 30 minutes to prepare for the three-hour basic employment law training that I provide to new managers. I review my outline, double-check my microphone and camera, and that I am able to project and share documents, and that the Mentimeter engagement app works.

4:30 p.m.: Sign off to pick up my older kids from daycare (they pick up my kids from elementary and shuttle them to daycare where my toddler is — worth the money!) and take them to tae kwon do or swimming. I use this time to review and respond to emails and plan my next day with a laptop, in between cheering and praise, doing the best I can to be present and witness their work as I try to get mine done.

If we don’t have an after-school activity, I won’t pick my kids up until 6 p.m. and use this time for reviewing and responding to emails, reviewing documents and prepping for the next day. Half the time, I will have calls, and if it is not something that I am leading, I will often multitask by unloading the dishwasher and cooking so that dinner is ready by the time the kids get home.

6 p.m.: Pick up my toddler from daycare just as it closes (don’t judge! I give great holiday gifts to my teachers), and it’s mommying until 8 or 8:30 p.m. I also try to watch an episode of something with my hubs so we have some connection before I log back in.

9 p.m.: This two-hour block after the kids are in bed is my focus and deep work time. I am a night owl and do my best work when everyone is asleep and the emails have stopped rolling in. This is where I substantively review summary judgments sent to me by outside counsel, prepare executive presentations or create training, and do my original drafting of work product.

11 p.m.: Bath, book, and bed — ending with a five-minute Peloton meditation in the dark. If it’s been a particularly stressful day and if I have the calories to spare, a glass of wine or hot tea with generous amounts of honey accompanied my bath. There’s something very restorative for me about “washing” the day away and starting anew the next morning.

What’s not easily depicted in these time increments are the constant emails, Microsoft Teams messages, missed calls, and text messages that I respond to throughout the day and use to calendar future meetings. Most of my “brain drain” comes from “toggling” through all the mediums of communication and making sure nothing falls through the cracks.

Most weeks, I work 40 to 45 hours a week, but occasionally 50 to 60, depending on what is going on. Above all else, I love the flexibility I have in working from home but for one week a month, which allows me to be both the lawyer and parent that I want to be.

# These Senior Attorneys Are Zabel To Earn $375K

Today’s rash of announcements is testing my [commitment to headline wordplay](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/tying-on-another-biglaw-salary-raise/). But you haven’t bested me yet, law firm universe!

Schulte Roth & Zabel, Am Law’s number 90 this year with $444,700,000 in gross revenue, just announced salary increases and unsurprisingly, the firm is matching the Davis Polk scale.

With one significant exception…

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Comp Year	Annual Base Pay
2021	$202,500
2020	$205,000
2019	$215,000
2018	$240,000
2017	$275,000
2016	$305,000
2015	$330,000
2014	$350,000
2013	$365,000
2012	$375,000
Yes, there’s a class of 2012 in there.

Most firms are capping the new scale at $365K for “2013 and senior” with only — I believe — [Gunderson](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/the-biglaw-raises-continue-and-this-time-theyre-going-global/) bucking that trend and giving an additional bump to the ninth-years. Beyond that, salaries are individually determined.

Congrats, everyone. The [full memo is here](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2021/06/SRZ.jpg).

# Biglaw Firms Are Trying To Rightsize Their Ranks Through Tougher Performance Reviews
## Good luck during your performance reviews, associates, because they're going to be extra tough.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Where there might have been performance issues among lawyers at the firm, firms are more likely to deliver tougher messages in performance review than in a stronger environment. In the rush to hire people to deal with the surge in demand in 2021, firms might have found themselves in a position where they might have to bring on lawyers who, in a much different market, may not have found employment with those firms.

— Gretta Rusanow, head of advisory services in Citi’s Global Wealth at Work Law Firm Group, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2023/11/01/big-firms-less-bullish-on-growing-leverage-than-a-year-ago-survey-finds/) on the company’s midyear survey on leverage projections. Rusanow went on, saying that because Biglaw firms are attempting to rightsize without resorting to layoffs, associates will continue to face tougher performance reviews than they otherwise would have.

Back [in 2012](https://abovethelaw.com/dewey-leboeuf/page/6/) (hell, [in 2013 too](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/10/dewey-have-a-postmortem-for-you-the-new-yorker-dissects-deweys-death/)), all anyone in Biglaw wanted to talk about was the spectacular collapse of Dewey & LeBoeuf. And it’s no wonder. Two historic firms — Dewey Ballentine and LeBoeuf Lamb — [merged](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/12/dewey-leboeuf-a-bunch-of-nazis/) to create a mega firm, but all was not well. The collapse of Dewey & LeBoeuf left thousands without jobs, generated multiple personal [bankruptcies](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/01/dewey-know-a-biglaw-partner-driven-into-personal-bankruptcy-by-the-firms-collapse/) and[ criminal cases](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/03/dewey-finally-have-criminal-charges-against-former-leaders-of-this-failed-firm/), and [shook](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/10/quote-of-the-day-look-before-you-leap-laterals/) Biglaw to its core.

But as shocking as it was 11 years ago, according to a new study, it didn’t hurt the careers of the rank-and-file attorneys caught up in the scandal. As [reported by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/10/23/11-years-later-ex-dewey-lawyers-are-doing-as-well-as-industry-peers/) Law.com:

For lawyers, at least, the experience didn’t appear to taint their careers. Associates who worked at Dewey in 2012 had the same odds of becoming a Big Law partner by 2022 compared to associates at peer firms with comparable partner profits, while former Dewey partners had the same odds of remaining partners at Am Law 100 firms as their peers as well.

“There is no statistically significant evidence to suggest that being at Dewey hurts people’s chances of becoming or remaining a partner at an Am Law 100 firm a decade out,” said Andrew Granato, a J.D.-Ph.D. candidate studying law and financial economics who recently presented his [paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4607798), “After the ‘Partner Run’: The Dewey & LeBoeuf Diaspora,” at the Conference on Empirical Legal Studies.

At least in the long run:

“The people whose relational capital within the profession was smaller and localized to their employer, associates, left private practice much more than established partners who were able to lateral and bring their clients along relatively easily,” Granato writes. “Long-term results, however, indicate that such effects do not last, despite the distinctiveness of the form of organizational failure of the partner run.”

Attorneys’ relative ease in getting back to the top of Biglaw surprised Granato, “A large part of making partner is managing reputational capital and being part of the law firm as a business entity and a social entity. If you shatter that unit and everyone scatters, I thought it would be a lot harder for them to become partner at a comparable Big Law firm.”

Firms that did the bulk of the scoop-up, hiring former Dewey attorneys at a notable clip, include Winston & Strawn (they got the most former Dewey attorneys immediately after the collapse), DLA Piper, Proskauer Rose, and Holland & Knight.

UPDATE (5:00 p.m.): This post has been updated with Williams & Connolly’s denial of merger plans.

This could be the Biglaw wedding merger of the decade! Two incredibly well-known, leading litigation firms are thinking of tying the knot: Quinn Emanuel and Williams & Connolly.

Legal Business [reports](http://www.legalbusiness.co.uk/index.php/lb-blog-view/10568-quinn-emanuel-breaks-tradition-as-merger-talks-with-dc-disputes-leader-williams-connolly-begin) that the two prestigious firms are in talks to become one, and it is more than just rumor. John Quinn himself has confirmed it — though it should be noted talks are in the preliminary stage:

Quinn Emanuel managing partner John Quinn said: ‘It is true that we had a meeting on this subject but it was very preliminary and we don’t know what, if anything, will come of this.’

So don’t go buying the prospective couple new china just yet, but the merger still has the possibility to alter the Biglaw landscape. The talks reportedly began last month, and if successful could represent Quinn’s first full-scale merger. But there are still some potentially significant differences between the firms that need to be hammered out:

Williams & Connolly now comprises over 300 lawyers and ranks 94th in the latest [Global 100](http://www.legalbusiness.co.uk/index.php/analysis/10272-the-global-100-2017) with a turnover of $420m and profit per equity partner standing at $1.6m. In contrast, Quinn – the second-most profitable law firm in the world, which has made a virtue of being one of the premier independent disputes specialists – has a PEP of more than $5m against global revenues of $1.2bn.

We can’t wait to see if these two litigation powerhouses can actually make it to the altar.

In this episode, I welcome [Grant Sovern](https://www.quarles.com/grant-sovern/), partner at Quarles & Brady LLP, to talk about his area of concentration: Employment immigration. Grant recalls how he shifted to immigration law and describes the challenges of working as an immigration lawyer. Additionally, Grant shares his work with Afghan refugees and where the immigration law stands on this.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# What Are Your Clients Really Saying About eDiscovery?
## A new survey looks at how clients see the discovery landscape.

Lawyers offer a lot of lip service to how earnestly they “listen to the client.” And it’s not entirely untrue. Obviously, Biglaw will take to heart any complaint raised by the folks paying the bills. On the other hand, how often do firms seek out input from clients? Because if lawyers aren’t proactive, they can miss what concerns clients the most. And blindspots are even more likely with tasks that are the historical domain of lawyers — work that outside counsel has performed, and excelled at, for years.

When it comes to discovery, not only has the role of lawyers in the process shifted radically, the very nature of the task is in constant flux. Techniques and tools that sufficed last year may be woefully inadequate for the challenges of a litigation in 2017. Are clients and lawyers on the same page when it comes to the state of discovery?

A recent survey by the [Cowen Group](https://www.cowengroup.com) (and sponsored by [NightOwl Discovery](http://nightowldiscovery.com)) asked Fortune 500 companies about their eDiscovery takes and trends. Are the results what Biglaw lawyers expect?

What are the top pain points clients face in 2017?



It turns out the sheer variety of data sources out there are top of mind for clients. Phone calls, emails, texts, tweets, Chat Roulette… is everything out there getting captured in discovery? Nothing is more frustrating than discovering, months after the fact, that extra tranche of documents you thought you’d put to bed.

Just ask James Comey.

Clients feel the same way and just want comfort that they won’t be forced to take the professionally embarrassing step of admitting that they failed to produce the entire universe of responsive material. They aren’t even as concerned about the exploding volume of data as they are about data hiding in cyber nooks and crannies that lawyers and vendors might miss on the front end.

Based on the results of this survey, clients are looking inward when it comes to solving most of these problems:



But firms and vendors can’t sleep on these results because even though clients lean toward insourcing to solve most of their pain-point problems, there’s more opportunity than crisis in these numbers for outside counsel and service providers. Overall, work is up — 67 percent of the Fortune 500 reported an uptick in Corporate eDiscovery work, 77 percent of survey respondents hope to increase their usage of AI and advanced analytics over the next 12 months, and two-thirds see their eDiscovery work increasing over the next 6 months. In-house counsel don’t have the resources to pull this off on their own. Ever wary of needless spending, in-house counsel will try to insource through efficiency; 85 percent of respondents don’t intend to add new staff to deal with these problems, presenting a rich opportunity to lawyers capable of guiding clients through this process.

That’s roughly 37 percent of respondents looking outside the company to either firms or vendors for help — even more once they realize “efficiency” is a nice buzzword that rarely materializes.

All this is to say that this work is out there waiting for you if you’re able to show clients you’re really listening.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Biglaw Firm's Individualized Bonuses Do Right By Associates -- Assuming You've Been Busy Billing
## Yes Virginia, it's still bonus season.

Christmas may be over, but that doesn’t mean your good friends at Above the Law have stopped caring about associate bonuses. On Friday, right before folks started scattering for the holidays, Baker Botts announced individualized associate bonuses. Even though there is not a lockstep scale that all associates are on, sources at the firm believe it to match the bonus schedule [set by Cravath last month](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/breaking-cravath-announces-annual-bonuses/) — provided associates hit their hours requirement.

As one tipster at the firm noted, Baker Botts is paying associates market bonuses if they’ve billed 2,000 hours this year. Plus, associates who missed on hours for [the firm’s summer bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/look-who-decided-to-join-the-elite-biglaw-associate-compensation-scale/) but made them up by the end of the year were made right as well.

From what I’ve seen, they’re matching market for people who hit 2000 hours. The firm is also making up summer bonuses for people who didn’t get a bonus over the summer because they were behind in hours but ended up hitting their year-end target.

So that’s good news if you’ve hit 2,000 hours. And sources also report high billers with a threshold of 2,150 hours received extra money above the market scale. But there is bad news — from what we understand from tipsters, only hitting 1,800 hours netted associates no bonus.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Latham Offers Up Big Bonus Bucks For Associates

It’s a new week, and Biglaw special bonuses are still coming in hot.

Latham, one of the most profitable Biglaw firms in the country, with $3,767,623,000 gross revenue in 2019, just surprised its lawyers with big bonuses to start the day.

The firm is matching the scale [set by Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/), paying out up to $64,000 depending on class year. Here’s what it looks like at the #2 firm in America:

Latham will be making its payments on May 14 and October 15. Associates will only be eligible for payouts if they are “at or above their individual hours budget” as of April 30 and September 30. It doesn’t seem like the firm will be offering associates the chance to play catch-up with their hours for future make-up bonus payments, as a few other firms have offer.

Better start billing, Latham associates. Congratulations!

Kathy Hochul serves as governor of New York because [a sexual harassment probe](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/nyag-investigation-concludes-andrew-cuomo-committed-multiple-sexual-harassment-violations/) finally did what years of mismanagement couldn’t and sent Andrew Cuomo packing. She won election in her own right on the back of the one-two punch of centering pro-choice policies in the wake of Dobbs and being the only Democrat on the ballot.

But since then, she’s set out to torch every bridge that got her in office by nominating Hector LaSalle to succeed Janet DiFiore (who has [her own ethical issues these days](https://www.law360.com/newyork/articles/1510545)). Somewhere in the vetting process, Hochul managed to overlook the judge’s record on several hot button issues, including abortion, that happen to be critically important to Hochul’s constituency.

And, like clockwork, when a white politician finds themselves in a political jam, she’s invoking Martin Luther King Jr.

Hochul initially shrugged off concerns as the work of radical progressive groups, a strategy that Cuomo employed for years while packing the state’s top court with Republicans and conservative Democrats. Alas, Hochul’s ersatz Cuomoism ran into a brick wall when a collection of 46 law professors [laid out a comprehensive case against LaSalle’s record](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScFifZMWxcfrVeGcbw5gS_1s8rbkzCP0zBpQjdbGDh1RpZAIw/viewform), Democratic state senators began publicly bailing on the nomination in droves, [NYU Law students started compiling devastating critiques](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/01/kathy-hochul-hector-lasalle-prosecutor-corporate-lawyer.html), and union leaders stopped mincing words:

WOW this Union guy is PO’d about Hector LaSalle nomination — and Hochul for making it so soon after wanting Union help to beat Zeldin

Hochul’s measured response to this message from one of her most critical corners of support was to yank his invitation to the state of the state speech. One labor source told me during the election that Hochul held off a primary challenge from NYAG Letitia James by virtue of organized labor support tilting toward Hochul in the early stages of the campaign. Whether that’s true or not, hemorrhaging union support is a poor strategy for any Democrat in New York.

Beyond the record including opinions providing companies more leverage over labor by opening the door to lawsuits against labor leaders personally, a long record of prosecutor-friendly criminal justice opinions, and a ruling that stymied efforts to investigate anti-abortion groups for fraud, there’s a pretty decent case that [LaSalle lacks the administrative chops to perform the most important role of the Chief Judge](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2023/01/16/new-yorks-courts-need-a-new-kind-of-leader-thats-not-lasalle/).

In another tactical whiff, Hochul managed to secure [an open letter from prominent New York practitioners](https://pfnyc.org/news/open-letter-from-the-legal-community-on-the-governors-nomination-of-a-chief-judge/), misdiagnosing her dwindling support in the state senate as a sign that lawmakers concerned over organized labor and criminal justice just needed to hear from millionaire Biglaw partners. It turns out that the attorneys who represent major corporations in labor disputes think LaSalle is a “consensus builder.” Cool story.

And then…

Yes, I think if Martin Luther King were alive today his greatest concern would be making sure Kathy Hochul manages to save face in a political blunder entirely of her own making. Apparently one person was quoted as finding the speech [distasteful](https://hellgatenyc.com/governor-hochul-mlk-said-to-not-judge-people-so-stop-judging-my-judicial-nominee), which is in the running for understatement of the year. Someone — probably multiple someones — on her staff looked at these remarks and thought, “Yeah, this seems like the right place to spice up the civil rights remembrance with some stuff about you and your choices.”

It’s also a bizarre connection to make when the presumed reason she chose LaSalle in the first place was a laudable effort to select the first Latino chief judge. But when [more Latino state senators have come out against the nomination](https://twitter.com/JuliaCarmel__/status/1606435376473710592?s=20&t=RrZzADmoxv9_k73R4SSkig) than support it, Hochul’s support comes across as tokenism.

LaSalle’s first hearing takes place this afternoon. Perhaps he’ll find a way to swing the critical mass of state senators back to his side. But barring something dramatic, Hochul’s refusal to back down and the embarrassing lengths she’s gone to over this pick are just puzzling. She could have walked this back weeks ago and started the long task of repairing her relationships with core constituencies.

She seems determined not to eat crow… but the only other item on the menu is lame duck.

# Biglaw Firm Goes Over The Top Of Market Bonuses
## They'll see your market bonus and raise you a special bonus.

The bonus scale that Cravath set last month is a very nice, generous end of the year bonus. Associates around the country are grateful their firms feel the need to meet that standard. But one Biglaw firm has just announced that in addition to the (admittedly expected) end of the year bonuses, they are also offering special bonuses.

Cahill Gordon & Reindel is the firm in question. They have [a history](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/biglaw-firm-beats-cravath-scale-with-special-bonuses/) of giving out special bonuses, and this year is no different. They are offering an additional $10,000 – $50,000, depending on class year, on top of their regular bonuses, which match the Cravath scale.

In an email to all attorneys, firm executive director Michael Colpo said the extra moola was a thank you for the hard work of 2017:

The special bonuses are being awarded to attorneys for outstanding effort and performance in 2017. Both the special bonuses and the regular bonuses will be paid to associates who are in good standing in their classes. In general, part-time associates and associates who have been with the Firm less than the full year will receive adjusted amounts of the bonuses.

Special bonuses will be paid on January 5th, and the regular bonuses at the end of January. It might be annoying to wait until 2018 for bonus money, but the extra cash certainly makes up for it.

So how’s all this money treating you Cahill people? Feel free to sound off [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Not Every Biglaw Firm Is As Inflexible About Working From Home As Others
## Do we really need to mandate office time? No, we do not.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

[W]hether it’s someone saying ‘I want to be in the office on a regular basis,’ or someone who wants to be at home, the answer is, ‘Great.’ Because now we’re in a hybrid environment. I do believe personally there is real value in people interacting and spending time with one another and training and work product, but does that have to happen on a mandated level every day? No. I haven’t come across anyone in recruiting that feels differently.

— Lisa Pilotto, chief recruiting officer at Polsinelli, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/07/26/on-the-path-to-in-office-mandates-big-law-reached-an-inflection-point/) concerning Biglaw firms and the mandate to return to the office. As Pilotto notes, some firms are much more flexible than others when it comes to their hybrid work models.

# Flat Is The Future ...
## The juicier stuff often lies in the analysis of the fees charged by the winning side’s lawyers.

Pound for pound, it is hard to top reading attorney’s fees decisions as a worthwhile investment of time for patent litigators. They don’t come around so often, even in these post-Octane days of weaponized attorney’s fees motions in patent cases, but they have much to teach us. Take the case profiled in my June 2018 [column](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/an-exceptional-example-of-how-not-to-run-a-patent-defense/?rf=1) on this issue. There, I noted how “patent litigation defendants who are clearly unprepared to mount a full defense of the case brought against them” were at risk of being tagged with attorney’s fees when their inevitable loss came along. And how, as a practical matter, patent litigators pitching for defense work would do well to make sure that the prospective client had the resources and will to take the fight to the end before signing on as defense counsel. Nothing magical, just an easy example of a lesson learned from reviewing just one attorney’s fees decision.

In addition to learning what to do to avoid an attorney’s fee award, attorney’s fees decisions are valuable for a few other reasons. For one, they often present insights into how district court judges weigh the merits of arguments made in patent cases. While a judge may or may not let the parties know whether a summary judgment or claim construction decision was a close call at the time it was made, attorney’s fees motions force that same judge to provide an honest appraisal of the strength or infirmity in the arguments underlying the critical decisions in the case. Additionally, attorney’s fees decisions are helpful in terms of analyzing the factors that lead to a patent case being decided on the merits, as opposed as through the overwhelmingly usual vehicle of settlement.

There is also a voyeuristic element to attorney’s fees decisions, at least for those of us interested in the costs of patent litigation. Yes, it is important to know what types of costs will be credited by the court to the winning party. But the juicier stuff often lies in the analysis of the fees charged by the winning side’s lawyers — including whether the judge in a particular case is willing to determine that those fees are reasonable. As we all know, hourly rates for senior patent litigators can easily approach four figures — and rare is the litigation firm (Biglaw or boutique) where even junior associate rates are less than three hundred or four hundred dollars an hour. While most attorney’s fees decisions involve some commentary from the judge as to whether such rates are reasonable, it seems like judges around the country recognize that patent litigation is a premium practice and is priced accordingly. So as long as there is no obvious overcharging, most attorney’s fees requests seem to pass muster more or less intact.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
One thing, however, is clear about the overwhelming majority of attorney’s fees decisions to date. They hold tight to the traditional hourly billing model as the basis for determining fee awards. Which makes sense, considering how entrenched hourly billing for most litigation remains. At the same time, alternative billing models — such as flat-fee or hybrid arrangements — have taken hold, especially at the upper echelons of the litigation universe. In the patent realm, some of the leading proponents of alternative fee arrangements have been leading litigation boutiques, even as Biglaw IP groups have also been forced to compete by deviating from their sky-high hourly scales as well. While these alternative billing arrangements have taken root in patent disputes, there has not been much discussion yet of how to treat such arrangements in the context of attorney’s fees awards. Probably because so few patent cases actually reach that stage.

The scarcity of discussion on the changing reality of how IP firms charge clients for patent work in attorney’s fees decisions presents a challenge for clients, lawyers, and courts forced to confront such issues. I was happy, therefore, to see that a recent attorney’s fees decision addressed some of these thorny issues head-on. The case at issue involved Straight Path IP — a former darling of the publicly traded patent enforcement business era — as well as tech heavyweights Apple and Cisco. With the latter prevailing at trial and appeal, the inevitable attorney’s fee motion ensued. Once granted, the court decided to appoint a special master to sort out the fee awards to Apple and Cisco. While the award to Apple was relatively straightforward, Cisco’s use of alternative fee arrangements with its counsel made for a more interesting treatment.

In fact, the special master ([Matthew Borden](https://www.braunhagey.com/matt-borden)) did an excellent job of framing the issues around alternative fee arrangements in the attorney’s fees context. For one, his report discusses the increased adoption of alternative fee arrangements by sophisticated litigants like Cisco and Microsoft, as well as the motivations that make such arrangements attractive for those companies and their chosen firms. At the same time, the report recognizes that large contingency fees have traditionally not been recoverable for a prevailing party — and that under certain circumstances a flat-fee arrangement could mimic a large contingency fee if the result was achieved with fewer hours than expected. Or that “opportunity for mischief exists” with certain types of fee structures, particularly where the client and firm may be tempted to engineer a larger-than-necessary fee to gain leverage over a counterparty. At the same time, the report suggests that reasonable flat fees should be recoverable in patent cases, subject to some measure of accountability and judicial review.

Ultimately, the special master in Straight Path recommended that Cisco recover half of its expended fees, based in part on the unique circumstances of the case, including that Cisco had swapped counsel midstream. Despite the haircut, Cisco was entitled to recover nearly $2 million in fees — a sizeable sum by any measure. More importantly for both Cisco and future patent litigants, the report provides a welcome starting point for courts confronting flat fee arrangements in attorney’s fees motions. Because flat is the future, at least when it comes to fee arrangements in patent cases.

# How To Simplify Crafting Responsible AI Policies
## Don’t let uncertainty stop you from crafting an AI policy, especially when you can rely on much of what you already know to simplify the process.

A GC recently shared an interesting perspective on the generative AI craze and the hesitancy it seems to have instilled in lawyers. She said, “Our role is not so different from before. We still manage people and their expectations, including our legal teams, company vendors, employees, and business partners. Only now, we have more advanced tools at our disposal.”

For example, cloud platforms allow GCs to centralize legal vendor management. With greater control comes the benefits of discounts, economies of scale, and improved service levels. Or consider how the skillful management of lawyers has always required meaningful conversations about career aspirations. Only now, the availability of modern AI systems significantly impacts career expectations. 

AI can enhance business efficiencies, lower the costs of services, and enhance work life in many ways. However, AI can also amplify biases, raise transparency concerns, and pose risks to privacy. Many legal teams still need to take charge to manage AI risks and maximize its benefits.

- Only 13% of 97 public companies surveyed have an AI use framework, AI policy or policies, or an AI code of conduct, according to the Society for Corporate Governance’s [2023 Board Practices Report](https://www.societycorpgov.org/currenttopiclandingpages/tpboardpractices/2023-board-practices-ai).
- Just 37% of the 399 company leaders surveyed by employment law firm [Littler Mendelson](https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/2023/09/25/ai-study-reveals-how-employers-are-using-the-tools-and-with-what-safeguards/) provide policies and guidance on proper AI usage to employees.
- Only 24% of companies provide policies or guidance on AI usage at work, and just 17% of employees say they’ve received training on how to use AI in their day-to-day work, according to the [Asana “State of AI at Work Report”](https://asana.com/press/releases/pr/asanas-state-of-ai-at-work-report-ai-is-poised-to-dramatically-improve-the-way-we-work-but-proper-guidance-is-needed/fa38bb67-6220-446a-8cfe-5aa09f592e9e) on a survey over 4,500 United States and United Kingdom knowledge workers.
Don’t let uncertainty stop you from crafting an AI policy, especially when you can rely on much of what you already know to simplify the process. The following four tips can help you draft a flexible policy that ensures AI’s ethical and responsible use. 

Align Your AI Policy With Your Existing Policies

First, don’t reinvent the wheel. AI policies are not the first or only technology-related guidance legal teams create. Data protection and privacy, information security, and social media policies are just a few of the policies and programs lawyers help create to ensure the responsible, ethical, and legal use of technology. 

Integrate AI policies with existing policies and governance frameworks. This alignment provides a comprehensive and cohesive approach to AI that promotes consistency and deters conflicts.  

Learn Data Literacy Skills

Data is the lifeblood of AI. You’ll no more understand AI without data literacy skills than you would understand courtroom or contract procedures without a law school education. And both require constant learning. 

To supervise AI systems, you must first understand data collection, management, and governance. Learn about the types of data AI uses, how AI uses data, and related standards such as privacy regulations and the rights of individuals to control their data. Regulatory frameworks that govern data can help inform your AI policy. 

Communicate Clearly With Visuals

Present AI policies with clear and concise language that stakeholders across the organization can easily understand, regardless of their technical or legal expertise. Avoid legal and technical jargon and complex terminology. 

Use visuals to highlight key points and reinforce your message. Incorporate images, graphs, and charts. Use arrows, fonts, colors, and emojis to demonstrate relationships and connections and enhance clarity. Visuals help readers engage and retain information. 

Regularly Update Company AI Policies

It’s easier to glue a boat to water than to accurately anticipate every impact of AI’s use. That’s why AI policies are living documents. Create AI policies now that fulfill current needs, such as guiding the use of generative AI tools, using AI-driven software to centrally manage vendors, and helping lawyers learn new skills.  

When changes come, update your AI policy to keep pace with emerging ethical considerations, technological advancements, and legal developments related to data privacy, bias mitigation, intellectual property rights, liability, and other areas. 

The future is more dynamic than ever, and your AI policy should be, too. 

Are you crafting an AI policy for your organization? What would you add to this list?

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

It’s some body blows, but nothing fatal at this point. But every time there seems to be some momentum some extraneous event puts a damper on it. Hopefully, we can avoid a few of those for at least a couple of months and see what happens.

— [Bill Hartnett](https://www.cahill.com/professionals/william-hartnett), co-chair of Cahill’s executive committee, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/03/29/body-blows-but-nothing-fatal-with-cap-markets-and-ma-down-cahill-drops-19-5-in-revenue/) on the firm’s double-digit revenue decline last year. Cahill saw a [19.5% drop in revenue](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/biglaw-firms-reliance-on-capital-markets-and-ma-responsible-for-its-financial-decline/), going from $515 million in 2021 down to $415 million in 2022. “[The firm’s financial] decline was attributed entirely to our corporate practice, which is highly dependent on the capital markets and M&A transactions,” he said, noting that the leveraged finance market was “down about 75%.” Harnett said the firm will continue its work in capital markets leveraged finance because its attorneys work in “the most resilient market there is in leveraged finance.”

Could today be the day that kicks off the 2018 Biglaw bonus season? Based on your responses to our survey, the answer, unfortunately, is probably not. Only 11 percent of survey respondents thought this year’s Biglaw bonus bonanza would begin before Thanksgiving, as it did in 2014, when Simpson Thacher announced its bonuses [ahead of the holiday](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/bonus-season-comes-early-and-its-not-cravath/) (and perhaps even more notably, ahead of Cravath).

When do you think 2018 bonuses will be announced?

- Last week of November (68%, 245 Votes)
- First week of December (21%, 74 Votes)
- Before Thanksgiving (11%, 40 Votes)
Total Voters: 359

Based on past precedent, it seems much more likely that bonuses will be announced on either Monday, November 26, or Monday, December 3. Cravath tends to stick a schedule as far as these things are concerned, and in recent years, it has announced its bonus news on either the last Monday in November or the first Monday in December. Either way, Biglaw associates can soon look forward to their bank accounts being stuffed like the Thanksgiving turkeys they’ll gobble down next week.

While associates are busy counting down the hours until B-Day, they’re likely even busier counting up the hours they’re on track to bill in 2018 to meet their targets for bonus eligibility. This summer, many firms announced increased billing requirements to go hand in hand with their increased salaries, and some associates continue to scramble to make up the difference. That being said, a whopping 68 percent of survey respondents are on track to bill 2000 hours or more in 2018.

Here are the full results from our survey:

How many hours are you on track to bill in 2018?

- 2000 - 2099 (19%, 158 Votes)
- More than 2400 (18%, 149 Votes)
- 2100 - 2199 (15%, 125 Votes)
- 1900 - 1999 (11%, 93 Votes)
- 1800 - 1899 (9%, 79 Votes)
- 2200 - 2299 (9%, 73 Votes)
- 2300 - 2399 (7%, 61 Votes)
- Fewer than 1600 (5%, 46 Votes)
- 1700 - 1799 (4%, 32 Votes)
- 1600 - 1699 (3%, 22 Votes)

Remember these strong numbers when bonuses begin to hit bank accounts. You may have worked your Biglaw bums off, but 70 percent of survey respondents thought that this year’s bonuses would be no different than last year’s bonuses. Keep this in mind: Instead of complaining, be thankful that your salary is larger than it ever was before and that you’re receiving very generous bonuses on top of it.

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file.

Don’t forget, if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please enter your email address in the box below. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish — including, of course, the first such announcement.

Keep your fingers crossed for happy bonus news this season!

Jeffrey Wertkin

You remember the [case of Jeffrey Wertkin](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/akin-gump-lawyer-arrested-trying-to-sell-the-details-of-a-whistleblower-complaint/), right? He was arrested — while wearing a disguise — at the end of January for allegedly attempting to sell a whistleblower complaint to the target company. The going price for his reputation was allegedly $310,000, and according to authorities he said, “My life is over,” when arrested.

Well, he’s lawyered up, natch.

But while you might expect a big deal partner to tap a mega firm in these circumstances, he didn’t go Biglaw for his representation. Wertkin has hired [Cristina Arguedas](http://achlaw.com/cristina-c-arguedas/) of Arguedas, Cassman & Headley. But though the firm isn’t “big” it does do a lot of high profile work. Arguedas has represented Barry Bonds, FedEx, was on O.J. Simpson’s “Dream Team” and is on a winning streak, as per [The American Lawyer](http://www.americanlawyer.com/home/id=1202779081140/ExAkin-Gump-Partner-Taps-BigName-Defense-Lawyer?slreturn=20170114103554):


Cristina Arguedas

Arguedas and her team have recently racked up a string of significant wins when pitted against federal and state prosecutors in California. In June, less than a week after Arguedas made opening arguments on behalf of FedEx, federal prosecutors [abruptly dropped](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/06/17/feds-drop-1-6b-case-against-fedex-in-middle-of-trial/) their $1.6 billion case accusing the company of conspiring with illegal online pharmacies to ship addictive prescription painkillers without face-to-face doctor visits. In December, the defense lawyers won [a ruling](http://www.therecorder.com/id=1202774419462/Charges-Dismissed-in-Online-Brothel-Case-Against-Backpagecom-Execs?kw=Charges%20Dismissed%20in%20%27Online%20Brothel%27%20Case%20Against%20Backpage.com%20Execs&et=editorial&bu=The%20Recorder&cn=20161218&src=EMC-Email&pt=caweekend) from a state court judge in Sacramento dismissing online brothel charges against former Backpage.com shareholders Michael Lacey and James Larkin.

Also of note: Arguedas was named the lawyer other lawyers would hire if they got arrested by [California Lawyer](https://ww2.callawyer.com/clstory.cfm?pubdt=NaN&eid=347038&evid=1). It seems Wertkin agrees.

# Biglaw Firm's Bonuses Leave A Lot To Be Desired
## Associates say this firm's bonuses are 'awful.' Yikes....

Is this it?

Bonus season may seem long gone by now, but some Biglaw firms are still handing them out to their eager associates. Good things usually come to those who wait, but unfortunately for associates at this firm, their bonuses are well below market.

Fox Rothschild — a firm that brought in $668,015,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 71 in the most recent Am Law 100 — recently announced bonuses for associates, and according to Above the Law’s sources, they’re “awful.”

Just how “awful” are we talking? As noted by insiders at the firm, Fox Rothschild isn’t just off market when it comes to salaries (which range from $160,000 to $260,000 depending on office; NALP lists the firm’s first-year salaries at $195,000). Sources say that the firm’s hours-based bonuses are “well behind competitors.”

As a reminder, this is what the prevailing Milbank/Cravath bonus scale looks like:

- Class of 2023 – $15,000
- Class of 2022 – $20,000
- Class of 2021 – $30,000
- Class of 2020 – $57,500
- Class of 2019 – $75,000
- Class of 2018 – $90,000
- Class of 2017 – $105,000
- Class of 2016+ – $115,000
Keeping these numbers in mind, this is what the hours-based bonus scale looks like at Fox Rothschild.



It looks like the only associates who come out ahead on their bonus compensation are first-years who billed 2025 hours or more, second-years who billed 2100 hours or more, and third-years who billed 2275 hours or more.

Fox Rothschild is often regarded as a work-life balance firm, which is definitely appreciated, but now associates know just how much money is being left off the table for that “balance” — which has associates billing more than their colleagues at other firms to earn less in bonus money.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of compensation updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us ([646-820-8477](tel:646-820-8477)) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus/Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus/Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Why Did I Go From Biglaw To Litigation Finance? Good Question.
## Whether you're working as a reporter, a Biglaw associate, or in litigation finance, it's always about asking the right questions.

Since joining the Lake Whillans team this summer, I’ve been asking a lot of questions. To effectively finance litigation, our team must completely understand the factual and legal basis for the claim. So we ask questions. But they have to be the right ones — informed by diligent research on the particular case and our legal knowledge and experience.

Fortunately, I’ve had a lot of experience asking questions.  In a former life, I worked as a newspaper reporter. I’d get a news tip or hear something on the police scanner, and would have to figure it out. Go to the scene. Interview the people involved. Put the events in context. And, of course, ask the right questions — often of people who had little time or patience for dealing with a reporter.

I was lucky enough to attend a phenomenal law school that had questioning at its very core. The University of Chicago Law School is famed for its commitment to the Socratic Method. This ethos carried over to my work on The University of Chicago Law Review.  As editor-in-chief, I participated in innumerable meetings and discussions with fellow staff members and authors where we questioned and tested everything.

Post-law school, my reporting experience melded with my academic experience. I was fortunate enough to clerk for two brilliant, humble, and fair-minded judges, from whom I learned how to look at a set of real facts and apply the law. And then to explain the decision in a clear and uncluttered manner.

When I moved on to practice law at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz,  as in my reporting days, I had to start with the facts. But this time, I was looking through the lens of the law: What facts matter in the particular legal context? What did they mean as applied to the law? And how do we present these facts and law most favorably to our client? (Of course, while working at Wachtell, partners, other associates, and clients also asked me a lot of questions about law, facts, strategy and everything in between.)

I began thinking about litigation finance as a career over the past few years while talking with Lake Whillans co-founder Lee Drucker, who happens to be an old college friend. The more I thought about it the more sense it made. Litigation finance combines all of those skills that I’ve learned through the years: the analysis of facts, the application of law, and, of course, the continual questioning of arguments, positions, and assumptions.

The past few months have borne this out. We are an inquisitive group. We seek to really learn the story, and then once we’ve digested it, to ask a lot of questions. We will question your facts and test your arguments.  We will engage in a candid dialogue about a case’s strengths and weaknesses. Doing so allows us to have confidence in our decisions and offer competitive terms. And those that explore funding with us will have the benefit of knowing they’ve received a full, fair, and honest evaluation.

While the complex cases we explore differ from the stories I picked up by listening to a police scanner, the same essential questions guide our evaluation: who, what, where, when, why, and how. I’ve been asking them for a long time, and am excited to keep doing so on the Lake Whillans team.

# COVID-19 Salary Cuts Are Still A Thing In Biglaw
## COVID-19 cuts aren't done yet.

Yes, it is June, but as rising cases of the novel coronavirus across the country have proven, that doesn’t mean that COVID-19 is done with us yet. And that includes the pandemic-inspired austerity measures sweeping Biglaw. The latest firm to announce cuts is Holland & Hart, a firm that made $243,515,000 in gross revenue last year, making it 128th on the Am Law 200.

According to the firm, the equity partnership is expected to take the biggest hit to their compensation: “equity partners’ profit distributions will be reduced such that equity partners will incur the highest percentage reduction in expected compensation over the entire year.” But salaried attorneys are also taking a hit to their paycheck — to the tune of a 15 percent reduction, beginning in June. Employees that make between $60,000 and $99,999 have their compensation reduced by 5 percent, and those making under $60,000 will not be impacted by the reductions. And the employer portion of the 401(k) matching program was suspended.

A spokesperson for the firm had this to say about the austerity measures:

Like many firms, Holland & Hart preemptively implemented compensation reductions at the beginning of June that will allow the firm to weather the continued uncertainty caused by the Coronavirus pandemic and position the firm for success as the economy ultimately improves. The firm may dial back these measures at any time based on its financial performance.

# Law Firms Struggling With Arcane Billing Guidelines Can Look To AI For Relief
## AI may not be able to solve every legal problem, but it can get lawyers paid.

Over the last few years, in-house legal counsel have leaned on [increasingly onerous](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/2019/12/10/in-house-counsel-make-increasingly-arcane-billing-demands-and-its-costing-firms-money/) “billing guidelines” for outside counsel. Clients scold Biglaw firms that the lawyers won’t see a penny until the bills comply with a hefty billing Bible of bilious demands. Clients claim it’s about controlling spend, but it feels more like an excuse to drag out collections with red tape.

And clients feel satisfied that they’ve micromanaged the lawyers… and lawyers just raise their rates to [cover the overhead of all this frustration](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/outside-counsel-guidelines-continue-to-be-productivity-drain/).

Artificial intelligence may not be prepared to solve every legal industry problem, but it might be the perfect fit for this one. [ZERO](https://zerosystems.com/) CEO Alex Babin is always talking about developing automation to recover [the money lawyers lose doing non-billable tasks](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/2021/08/27/law-firms-waste-far-too-much-time-on-non-billable-work/), so it’s unsurprising that the company has turned its attention to the industry’s billing fiasco. And when it comes to billing guideline compliance, ZERO estimates that firms can recover millions by introducing AI to the process.

Because just “following the guidelines” isn’t always enough. Some guidelines are explicit. Others leave a world of interpretation. Still others are explicit, but no one on the client side actually cares enough to force outside counsel to waste time correcting the issue. Where ZERO’s product comes in is in understanding the guidelines and the history of rejections and appeals surrounding the bills to figure out what the bill needs to look like to get the lawyers paid with the least hassle.

“In this particular product, [Verify](https://zerosystems.com/lp-ai-powered-policy-enforcement/), there are four models being involved,” Babin explained. “One model understands the context of the billing guidelines. Another model understands the appeals and the rejections and everything. A third model actually compares the guidelines, appeals, and does reasoning on top of it. And the fourth model rewrites the narrative specifically for that attorney.”

And by “rewrites the narrative specifically for that attorney,” he means it will actually recommend new text in the attorney’s voice. “It actually mimics the language of that specific billing partner,” he said. “How she’s been using words before, and what clients like, what they don’t like, and so on and so forth.”

A human from billing can approve all these changes and interact with the recommendations to understand the AI’s reasoning. Here’s a video demo:


Of course, Verify isn’t limited to Biglaw billing and can be used for any policy compliance task. But for Biglaw attorneys looking for a use case, dramatically shortening collection cycles without adding overhead is a solidly practical one.

He lost despite a $1.4 million cash lead in the race, including contributions from his former colleagues at Boies Schiller, Jenner & Block, and others who have moved to other powerful firms like Paul Weiss and King & Spalding.

But even the money couldn’t overcome those newly drawn maps.

# Lateral Move Taking You To A New City? Factors Every Attorney Should Consider
## This should serve as a general roadmap of what to expect during an intermarket lateral attorney move.

As you progress through your legal career in a busy lateral market, attractive career opportunities will arise both locally and in other cities.  As a significant number of lateral attorney hires per year include those relocating from other jurisdictions, we thought it may be helpful to examine the nuances of planning for and navigating an intermarket lateral move.

Common reasons why attorneys relocate to another region include moving to their home state, moving to be closer to family/friends, following a significant other, or moving for an opportunity that is too good to pass up.  We also hear from attorneys who, for a variety of reasons, did not land in their first-choice city right out of law school, and are looking to lateral in order to be in their city of choice.  Equally as common are those who seek to relocate to a less crowded city with a better cost of living.  Conversely, some attorneys want to move to a larger market to work on more sophisticated matters and gain exposure to a busier practice, while enjoying the hustle and bustle of a larger city.  The reasons are endless, and law firms are very accustomed to hiring attorneys from different markets.  In fact, certain types of experience gained in other markets is highly coveted, such as training from a top New York corporate or finance practice group or experience from a leading IP litigation group at a firm in Silicon Valley or D.C.

Where to Begin? Whether you are evaluating a specific opportunity in another market that you were recruited for or you are conducting a comprehensive job search in a specific region, there are a number of beneficial resources to use in your diligence process.  When looking at law firms in a new location, it is important to review the prospective firms’ practice area strengths and capabilities and overall reputation both locally and nationally.  You can utilize select resources to determine the key players within a specific market.  Chambers and Partners, Chambers Associate, the Legal 500, and Vault are helpful periodical resources that can provide guidance.  In addition, a good recruiter located in the specific market you are considering can assist and effectively streamline the application and interview process.  When selecting a market-specific recruiter, you should choose a recruiter with strong local relationships and a comprehensive understanding of the city’s law firms and practice groups.  More importantly, your recruiter should be able to offer intel on the firms’ cultures, partner to associate ratios, matter staffing, lateral integration, and the interview process for specific practice groups.  Also, if the market you are relocating to has a substantial alumni base from your law school or undergraduate university, you can reach out to a fellow alum at firms of interest to gain his or her perspective.

Timing and Planning Your Move. For a relocation, it is prudent to begin well in advance of your anticipated move and start date.  Factoring in résumé and deal sheet preparation, initial applications, first- and second-round interviews, offer-stage/negotiation, conflicts and background checks, and actually completing your move, the process itself takes at least three months and often longer based on firm hiring needs and coordinating multiple applications.  You’ll probably also want to take some time off in between jobs so that you can settle into your new city and start the new job feeling refreshed and energized.

Geographic Market Ties and Licensing. In preparing your introduction to a firm located in another market, your recruiter should convey your specific ties to the geographic location.  While certainly not required, firms like the assurance of a long-term commitment to the city you are applying. Your recruiter should, therefore, share ties to the area and reasons for relocating.

Being eligible to waive into another jurisdiction without having to take the bar exam is another attribute you should highlight in your application to a firm in another market.  Most states have adopted the Uniform Bar Examination (UBE), giving attorneys greater mobility between states.  In most jurisdictions, a score of 266 or higher on the UBE allows you to waive into another state’s bar without examination.  Becoming licensed only requires completing the character and fitness application component.  If you are relocating to a non-UBE jurisdiction or have not taken the UBE (e.g., if you are in a state that recently adopted UBE after you took the state bar exam), you may still be able to waive in to the bar without taking the exam if you have actively practiced law for at least three-to-five years (depending on the state).  Also, certain corporate in-house roles may not require you to have passed the bar in the jurisdiction in which you work, so long as you meet the criteria to work as in-house counsel in that state. Even if you are unable to waive into another state bar, most law firms are very receptive to candidates who are not yet licensed in the state if they are coming from prestigious law firms and have strong academic credentials.  In this circumstance, an attorney may practice under the supervision of other attorneys licensed in that jurisdiction and simply take the next offered bar exam.  Most firms will cover bar registration and licensing fees as well as preparation courses and offer time off for the attorney to study, which is typically three to four weeks.

Interviewing and Offers. Most interviews for a position in another market will begin with a brief phone or videoconference interview.  If you have upcoming plans to be in the city that you are relocating to, your recruiter should notify any potential employers to try to arrange an in-person interview.  An initial in-person interview is preferable to a phone interview as you can more easily connect and build rapport with the interviewer.  In addition to general interview preparation and strategy, as a relocation candidate, you will want to detail your reasons for relocating and highlight any ties and contacts to the market (as mentioned above).  Importantly, you will also need to impart why you are specifically interested in the firm or practice group you are applying to and avoid the perception that you are simply looking to relocate without adequate knowledge of the particular firm or company with whom you are interviewing.  You should have sufficient working knowledge of recent matters a firm has handled and discuss comparable matters you have been involved with that align well with that firm’s practice.  Following a successful first-round interview, a second-round interview will usually be in-person with several attorneys and often include a lunch or dinner.  Most firms will reimburse for interview-related travel expenses.

Regarding scheduling, it is useful to have a local recruiter to centralize coordinating multiple firm interviews in one trip to avoid the inconvenience of making multiple trips and being conspicuously out of the office of your current firm.  This will also allow the interview results to progress concurrently so that you can compare, and contrast multiple offers at once and follow-up with any negotiation points.

The Relocation. Typically for relocation expenses, firms will reimburse up to $5,000 for expenses associated with moving and will often assist in connecting you with preferred realtors or set you up in temporary corporate housing.  Firms understand that moving is a significant process, so following your acceptance of an offer, firms will often afford additional time for relocation (beyond the two-week notice given to your current employer).  It is not uncommon for firms and companies to allow a month or so between acceptance and start dates for relocation candidates.

We hope this serves as a general roadmap of what to expect during an intermarket lateral attorney move.  If you are considering a geographic relocation now or in the future, teaming up with a qualified recruiter can make the process exponentially easier.  Our expert recruiters can be an invaluable resource when navigating this process, so feel free to connect with one of us anytime if you are curious about another legal market.

[Jessica Mager](https://www.taftlaw.com/people/jessica-a-mager), a partner at Taft Law (formerly known as Taft Stettinius & Hollister), is facing a disciplinary[ complaint](https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/movannoqbpa/Certified%20Complaint(1).pdf) for engaging in a sexual relationship with a client. In October of 2019, Mager, whose practice focuses on family law, represented a client in his divorce proceeding when the Ohio Office of Disciplinary Counsel said she engaged in a sexual relationship with the client in violation of the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct, “specifically Prof.Cond.R. 1.8(j) [prohibiting a lawyer from soliciting or engaging in sexual activity with a client unless a consensual relationship existed between them when the client-lawyer relationship commenced].”

As [reported by](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/attorney-faces-disciplinary-action-after-engaging-in-relationship-with-client) ABA Journal, Mager is alleged to have exchanged sexually suggestive text messages and engaged in sexual activity with the client:

Their conversations became “increasingly personal,” as shown by text messages sent in October 2019, according to the complaint. In one exchange, Mager asked her client, “Can we go on like a normal date, like ever!?” Her client responded, “Yes like 4ever and ever if u want me.”

On Oct. 19, 2019, Mager’s client went to her house, where they had dinner and wine and engaged in sexual intercourse, according to the complaint. She later sent a text message to her client, saying “I do want you and I do want to see where it goes. I think I have said that and my actions support what I am saying.”

A few days after that encounter, on October 21, 2019, the client was found dead by suicide following an altercation with his wife.

The firm issued a statement on the allegations:

“The firm and Ms. Mager take these matters very seriously and will fully cooperate with the board. Taft remains deeply committed to upholding and enforcing the highest ethical standards of conduct in the practice of law.”

Mager said that in her two-decade career she “earned a reputation for integrity. However, two years ago, during a difficult time in my life, I made a serious error in judgment. I have no one to blame but myself, and I accept full responsibility for my actions.”

# Top 20 Biglaw Firm Matches Cash Compensation Tsunami For Associates
## This is the latest firm to ride in on this big-time money wave.

One by one, Biglaw firms are quickly lining up to match the soon-to-be prevailing salary scale [announced by Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/davis-polk-raise-2022/) just yesterday. (Compare this to the painfully slow matching process that occurred when [Milbank announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/) its new salary scale last month.)

If beginning the afternoon with a raise isn’t a big motivator to do your best work, then we don’t know what is. That’s exactly what just happened at Ropes & Gray, one of the top Biglaw firms in the country.

Unsurprisingly, the firm is matching the Davis Polk salary scale — with even more money for its most senior associates. Here’s what that looks like at Ropes:

Class year	New 2022 base salary
2021	$215,000
2020	$225,000
2019	$250,000
2018	$293,500
2017	$335,000
2016	$360,500
2015	$381,000
2014	$396,500
2013+	$406,500
Note that the firm is doling out $406,500 salaries to the class of 2013 and beyond (just like [Debevoise](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/crush-those-wednesday-worries-with-a-cash-stack/) before it). Will any other firms be willing to make this match for its most senior associates?

Associates at the firm will see their raises reflected in their March paychecks, retroactive to January 1, 2022. Congratulations, everyone!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Ropes & Gray.)

# The Philippines Shows Us What We 'Have To Lose' By Electing Trump

While Americans are merely considering electing Donald Trump, the Philippines just went ahead and did it. Rodrigo Duterte was elected on a “law and order,” “war on drugs”
[kind of platform](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/world/asia/philippines-duterte.html) that makes Batman sound like a civil libertarian. He’s been president for about seven weeks and, well, people are dying.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The [New York Times reports](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/23/world/asia/philippines-rodrigo-duterte.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news) that nearly 1,800 people have been killed in Duterte’s “war on drugs.” In seven weeks! The killings have been carried out by police and vigilantes. That’s regular people just whipped up into a frenzy to go out and kill some drug dealers.

Were all the people killed actually involved in the drug trade? Who knows. Who cares? I’m sure many of them looked like drug dealers, and that’s enough when you have untrained civilians going out there to take back the streets:

Under Mr. Duterte, who campaigned on a pledge to rid the country of drug dealers, 712 suspects have been killed in police operations, National Police Chief Ronald dela Rosa said. Vigilante killings have totaled 1,067 during the same period, he said, although it was unclear how many were directly related to the illegal drug trade…

Mr. Duterte is said to have incited the wave of killings with his vow to eradicate crime. He has said the police should “shoot to kill” when they encounter members of organized crime or suspects who violently resist arrest.

In related news, Duterte’s popularity has soared.

Human rights groups and the United Nations have expressed horror about the opening stages of Duterte’s regime. He’s brushed off those concerns with insults and cursing… which is apparently the way world leaders are supposed to handle criticisms to look “authentic” to their supporters in 2016. [From Al Jazeera](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/duterte-threatens-pull-philippines-160821063128459.html):

“I will prove to the world that you are a very stupid expert,” he said [about two U.N. human rights experts who reported on the violence], urging them to count not just the number of drug-related deaths but also the innocent lives lost to drugs…

“I do not want to insult you. But maybe we’ll just have to decide to separate from the United Nations,” he said.

“Why do you have to listen to this stupid?”…

Asked about the possible consequences of his comments, he said: “What is … repercussions? I don’t give a sh*t to them.”

He said that the UN should have acted according to protocol by sending someone such as a rapporteur to talk to him.

“You do not just go out and give a sh*tting statement against a country,” he said.

Does this guy remind you of anybody?

Duterte went on to criticize the U.N. for not speaking out against the U.S., a classic deflection maneuver he probably learned at Trump University:

And Duterte asked why police killings in the United States were not attracting the same kind of criticism as the Philippines.

“What do you think the Americans did to the black people there? Is that not rubbing off also? And (critics) say what?”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The plight of African-Americans is the world’s counterargument to America’s moral authority.

The vigilantism is the thing that should worry American observers the most as we contemplate electing our own foul-mouthed strongman. Who knows what Mike Pence’s Donald Trump’s actual policies would be, on immigration or anything else. The nuts and bolts of it might not matter much. Duterte is showing the world what happens when your supporters feel justified in comitting extra-judicial acts of violence. The white supremacists who have brought Trump this far will take his election as a vindication of their worldview, and can be expected to act accordingly. (Related: racists will take his loss as a vindication of their worldview and act accordingly. There’s really no upside when political candidates rely on white grievances to win elections.) “Law and Order” candidates are supposed to respect both half-hours of the original show: the part where cops find the bad guy, and the part where the bad guy gets a fair trial with a proper defense lawyer. Trump and Duterte don’t have the patience that criminal justice requires.

And their supporters think that even waiting for the cops to show up is an act of weakness.

Could it happen here? Of course. I’ll prove it. Go on Facebook and tell a Trump supporter that his new campaign promise is to kill 1,800 “drug dealers” in his first 100 days. They’ll believe you (these people will believe anything so long as it is presented to them without scientific evidence or support). And I promise you, they’ll applaud. They’ll applaud and won’t even ask pertinent follow-up questions like “do we need a warrant for that?” or “is dealing drugs a capital offense?” Tell them they can even personally get in on the killing, and they’ll say “Second Amendment, baby” and then show you a picture of one of their guns.

We don’t have to imagine a Trump administration, we can see it playing out in real time on the other side of the world.

Of course, the people who will vote for Trump think that Manila is the name of a folder-making company, so this opportunity to learn from others’ mistakes will be missed.

# (Don’t Just) Show Me The Money!
## The solution to the law firm compensation dilemma has nothing to do with money.

If you took physics back in high school, you may recall that one of the basic laws of nature is that gases in a closed container will always expand to occupy 100% of available space. Allow me to propose an equally immutable law about law firm compensation: I believe scientists will prove conclusively in our lifetime that every law firm attorney on earth believes they’re worth at least 15% more than they’re actually being paid.

If there’s one topic sure to cause law firm partnerships around the globe to bring the knives out, it’s the compensation structure. Every law firm managing partner I’ve spoken with has lamented the pain that comes with partner compensation. It’s a universal, endemic problem in virtually every law firm.

The tensions inherent in choosing a compensation system are classic, and primarily come down to a problem of priorities. How much do you set aside to keep your rainmakers happy, since without them you wouldn’t have work to do? How much goes to the “service partners” and associates, who know the cases even when they aren’t the relationship lawyers? Do you take care of partners following a series of down years in their practice out of the hope they’ll pick back up, or do you divert their salary to ensure that today’s rising stars stick around? When an attorney has a huge year, do you reward them right away, or wait to see if the boom will repeat? It’d be simple to throw money at all these problems, but there’s never, ever going to be enough to make everyone happy. Priorities have to be set, which means perceived winners and losers get chosen.

And nobody wants to be a loser.

Even a firm that has a strong handle on how it wants to prioritize its funds then has to grapple with determining a system to enact those priorities. Do we go with a fully objective comp and bonus system, where everyone knows what they’ll get? But if not executed correctly, that can lead to infighting over client credit, apportionment of receivables, calculation of overhead, or any of the other subjective calls that are made in setting up any objective system. Purely objective comp systems also may leave the firm without a good way to financially recognize non-monetary contributions to the firm overall, such as pro bono work, firm and community leadership, or other activities that only indirectly help the bottom line.

We could solve those deficits by integrating more subjective systems, but subjectivity opens its own can of worms. Even the most evenhanded, fair-minded compensation committee may end up accused of cronyism, favoritism, or blindness by attorneys who don’t believe their contributions were fully valued. Subjective structures are inherently susceptible to criticism, and when done wrong they can damage attorney relationships.

Many, if not most, large law firms attack this problem with a compromise system, one that attempts to balance the many competing interests at stake. But like a philosopher once said, [a good compromise leaves everybody mad](http://hobbesdeep.tumblr.com/post/16890635494). Partners with huge books wonder why so many bonuses are going to the attorneys who don’t have them. Attorneys without huge books feel like their experience and institutional knowledge aren’t valued as much as they should be.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Other firms forgo the messiness of compromise in favor of a clear, defined compensation system that unapologetically sets priorities. Cravath is a famous example, with its lockstep seniority-based salary. Anyone heading into a stint at Cravath knows what to expect. Your salary will depend on what year you are, full stop. Bonuses are guaranteed to be a certain amount, with some small discretionary extras for exceptional performers. In theory, it allows attorneys to stop fighting over client credit and focus on bringing in dollars. It’s accepted that some underperforming attorneys will be overpaid, and some overperforming attorneys may be underpaid. The clarity of purpose and expectation are the primary features of the system. And, for decades, Cravath has had great success with its system — even in the face of other firms steadily abandoning the model since the 1980s.

But now, even the Cravath system is starting to show its cracks.

Any time an attorney gets left feeling undervalued, they’re vulnerable to poaching. Case in point, just a few weeks back it was announced that [Sandra Goldstein](https://www.reuters.com/article/moves-kirklandells-goldstein/moves-cravath-ma-litigator-goldstein-leaves-for-kirkland-ellis-sources-idUSL1N1RQ28T), former head of litigation at Cravath and one of its most senior rainmakers, is moving over to rival Kirkland & Ellis. Goldstein is just the latest of Cravath’s senior partners that Kirkland has snagged in the past few years. Cravath’s lockstep system, which theoretically should have favored Goldstein hugely given the length of her tenure, wasn’t enough to keep her onboard. Kirkland’s flexible compensation structure has been pointed to as one of the primary tools it’s used to bring partners over in recent times. The pay-for-performance and book of business market pressures are becoming too great for even a juggernaut like Cravath to withstand.

Compensation is a universal problem with no clear universal answer. Rival compensation systems are eternally locked in a rock-paper-scissors dynamic where any given system is necessarily going to have weaknesses that other firms can exploit to steal talent with the promise of higher earnings. Compensation systems that reward seniority necessarily do so at the expense of younger high earners, who can get paid better somewhere that bases paychecks exclusively on dollars received. Eat-what-you-kill firms will struggle to keep the partners that do all the administrative work, but don’t get financially credited for it.

And that leads to the real point that I want my fellow firm managers to take away from this article. There’s almost always someone out there who’s willing to pay your attorneys better than you are. You’ll never find the perfect comp system, and you’ll never make everyone happy with their take-home pay. The basic realities of law firm management don’t allow it. That means that if compensation is your only strategy for retaining your best and brightest, you’re playing a losing game.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
If you want to keep your attorneys happy, and keep them around, compensation has to just be part of the larger puzzle. To really keep attorney retention rates high, a firm needs to develop its [internal culture](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/the-culture-card-in-law-firms/?rf=1). Attorneys need to know they have a home that values what they value. They need a team they’re glad to see every day. Those are the kinds of benefits that can’t be compared to other firms in an apples-to-apples kind of way. Happy attorneys who feel part of something greater are much less likely to seek out greener pastures than attorneys whose only connection to their firms are their direct deposit stubs.

Remember when you were a kid on the playground, playing Rock Paper Scissors, and some punk would come into the circle and throw Jackhammer, or Volcano, or some other crazy play that they said beat everyone else, no matter what they threw? That kid was onto something. When Alexander the Great couldn’t untie the Gordian Knot, he [grabbed a sword and started hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_Knot). To solve an unsolvable problem, we need to look off-menu for our solutions. Waving goodbye to the concept of the perfect compensation system seems as good a start as any.

# Biglaw Partner Learns The Hard Way You Can't Launch 'Baseless' Accusations Of Antisemitism

The Patent Trial and Appeal Board isn’t going to let just any attorney argue before it. Kramer Levin partner [Paul Andre](https://www.kramerlevin.com/en/people/paul-j.-andre.html)‘s motion to be admitted to argue before the board pro hac vice was denied, and he will not be permitted to represent client Centripetal Networks in a patent challenge.

The denial came as a result of a 2021 [sanction](http://www.law360.com/articles/1450087) Andre received from Western District of Texas U.S. District Judge Alan D. Albright. In that case, Andre accused opposing counsel of being antisemitic and racist. Judge Albright called those allegations “vitriolic and unsubstantiated,” “shocking,” and “offensive to this court.”

As [reported by](https://www.law360.com/articles/1573929) Law360, the pro hac denial also referenced other misconduct allegations by Andre:

The PTAB also pointed to Judge Albright saying Andre had committed [previous misconduct](https://www.law360.com/articles/1406930/alsup-oks-5-9m-fees-from-finjan-slams-kramer-levin-attys) in his court, in a case where he was accused of trying to artificially boost damages and misrepresent an earlier decision, among other concerns. There, the judge did not issue sanctions, but he did warn that the actions were “improper and frustrated the fairness of the proceedings.”

“Judges in the future should take this into account when dealing with them in future cases,” Judge Albright said in a July 2021 decision, referring to Andre along with fellow Kramer Levin attorneys Lisa Kobialka and James Hannah.

The PTAB also denied Andre’s motion to have Administrative Patent Judge Brian McNamara recused, based on stock ownership. Judge McNamara did ultimately recuse himself, but the PTAB called the allegations levied against the judge “frivolous,” and that saying he had “personal bias” against Centripetal was “reckless.”

“The arguments Mr. Andre has already presented in this case (before being admitted) thus appear to bear more than a passing resemblance to the ‘baseless attacks on the integrity of [the] court’ that resulted in the sanctions imposed by Judge Albright,” the order states.

Andre commented on the PTAB’s move, saying, “The PTAB’s denial of Centripetal’s counsel of choice is yet another example of their ongoing disregard of Centripetal’s rights.”

# Top Firms Get Richer In Otherwise Poor Year For The Legal Industry
## Citi releases its annual survey results, and your industry outlook depends on what kind of firm you are.

It wasn’t that 2016 was a bad year for law firms. It just wasn’t a very good year.

On the other hand, like a lot of 2016, the year is best measured by your point of view. If you’re a fan of anyone from Bowie to Gene Wilder to Princess Leia or a typical member of the Am Law 200, you didn’t have a great year. That said, if you’re a white supremacist, a Patriots fan, or one of the elite law firms perched atop the Am Law 50, 2016 wasn’t all that bad.

The Citi Private Bank 2016 report — an annual survey of 193 firms (77 Am Law 100 firms, 53 Second Hundred firms, and 63 niche/boutique firms) — shows [a relatively bland year in the legal industry](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202779035805/Citi-Report-Growth-Slowed-in-2016/), with a noticeable break between the performance of top firms and the rest of the pack. Not that we weren’t expecting this [based on the quarterly reports](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/biglaw-strikes-back-the-rich-firms-get-richer-this-quarter/) Citi put out throughout 2016, but it’s more evidence of a trend we’ve seen for the last several years.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As Gretta Rusanow of Citi explained in Am Law Daily:

As a further indicator of industry dispersion, we saw that the 15 most profitable firms who report to us outperformed the industry, with PPEP up 6.6 percent and net income up 6.9 percent. As most of these firms are in the Am Law 50, we noted that they drove the strong performance of that segment, by increasing both demand and rates, and collecting faster than in 2015. The Am Law 50 outperformed other segments in profit growth, and was the only segment to beat its 2015 performance. Am Law 51-100 and Second Hundred firms saw expense growth outpace revenue growth, as both segments saw modest rate increases and a slowing of collections, and in the case of the Am Law 51-100 firms, a 1.2 percent drop in demand. Going into 2017, niche firms were the only segment to see stronger year-end inventory growth compared to 2015, and only just (up 3.7 percent, compared to 3.6 percent).

Don’t expect this trend to reverse itself anytime soon just because the economic outlook is rosy. The market may be surging, but the big banks are [substantially driving that train](http://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/goldman-sachs-visa-power-dow-through-20k-small-caps-jump/), and those are exactly the clients that tap the elite firms to do all their work.

Speaking of expense growth, that’s another figure that looks steady across the industry as a whole, but when you break down the players, it appears to hit the Am Law 51-200 much worse:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Expense growth of 3.4 percent was consistent with 2015, and might surprise many, in light of the midyear associate salary increases. The key here was careful management of operating expenses. Compared to the 3 percent growth in operating expenses seen in 2015, the industry managed to control growth in 2016, reporting just a 1.9 percent increase. On the other hand, compensation expenses grew 5.4 percent, much higher than the 3.8 percent increase reported in 2015. While lawyer head count growth contributed to this, we also believe the increase in associate salaries was a key driver. The full effect of these increases is yet to be reflected in the results, as we’ve heard anecdotally that while many firms implemented these increases in mid-2016, others delayed implementing them to the fourth quarter of 2016 or the start of 2017.

As we enter a full year of higher salaries and more lawyers, no doubt firms will find it a challenge to manage expense growth. Of greater concern is the pressure that the associate salary hike is already having on many firms who matched salary increases for competitive, rather than performance, reasons. In our conversations with firm leaders, many express bafflement as to why so many firms adopted the increases when their productivity and profitability results couldn’t support them.

We [certainly expressed bafflement](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/crowell-moring-matches-wait-what-in-the-holy-hell-is-going-on-here/). So did Professor Bill Henderson [when we talked to him about it](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/an-actual-expert-weighs-in-on-the-law-firm-salary-extravaganza/). This isn’t to say associates didn’t deserve a bump for their hard work, just that the rapid succession of “me too” salary bumps — especially across all markets — seemed extreme. And the fact that a number of firms are entering 2017 with expenses their performance didn’t justify is just one more reason to expect the rich firms to get richer in 2017.

Looking forward:

While we are cautiously optimistic that 2017 will be another year of modest growth, in our conversations with law firm leaders, we note a higher than usual level of uncertainty, caused by the confluence of current macro events. As firm leaders remind us, we are in the early days of the Trump administration. The timing and scope of Brexit remain unclear. There are several national elections in key economies in 2017, in an environment of populism and anti-globalization. On the other hand, the strong performance of equity markets and continuing low bond yields are positive signs for transactional activity. So is President Trump’s rhetoric about infrastructure spending, lowering taxes, regulation, healthcare and energy. In this context, our outlook for 2017 is modest industry growth, with continued dispersion and volatility, likely driving further consolidation.

In other words, we may all die in 2017, but Wachtell is still going to have a good year.

Two big moves have left Sedgwick 40 lawyers lighter.

In the first, 23 lawyers in Sedgwick’s Texas office are packing their bags for Drinker Biddle, launching the latter’s entry into the Dallas market — Drinker is even expected to take over Sedgwick’s Dallas office space. As the American Lawyer [reports](http://www.americanlawyer.com/home/id=1202777703825/Drinker-Enters-Dallas-as-Sedgwick-Sheds-40-Lawyers-in-Texas-New-Jersey?slreturn=20170027145916):

Sedgwick partners Wayne Mason, Alan Vickery, W. Neil Rambin, E. Paul Cauley Jr., George McCall, Susan Egeland, Travis Gamble, Dawn Shawger McCord and Sondra Sylva are joining Drinker Biddle to launch the firm’s Dallas office, effective Feb. 1, along with two counsel and 12 associates.

Their practice areas include products liability, class actions, insurance coverage, business disputes and commercial litigation. The additions bring Drinker Biddle to more than 635 lawyers in 12 offices.

The second move impacts the Newark, New Jersey office, where some big players are launching their own firm, taking a total of 17 attorneys from Sedgwick. The new firm, Tanenbaum Keale is expected to have offices in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

A trio of Sedgwick partners, including a chair emeritus and head of its complex litigation team, is spinning off from the firm and launching a litigation boutique called Tanenbaum Keale LLP on Feb. 1 that will boast three other Sedgwick partners and 11 of its attorneys.

Veteran Sedgwick partners Michael A. Tanenbaum, James H. Keale and Thomas D. Robertson — longtime colleagues whose relationship predates their firm — announced the pending launch of the firm in a press release Wednesday, saying it will focus on pharmaceutical, medical device and environmental mass tort litigation and defense of product liability and catastrophic injury.

According to a statement by Sedgwick Chair [Michael Healy](http://www.sedgwicklaw.com/michael-f-healy/), the firm plans to repopulate the picked-over offices. Indeed, Healy’s statement looks forward to a bright new future: “Our partnership – in fact, all of our lawyers – are bullish on the opportunities for Sedgwick in 2017. We will focus on our established competencies and serve our clients around the country and from our international offices.”

Healy seems to be conveying that all the lawyers leaving at the same time is just a curious coincidence, and not a harbinger of something more ominous. (See, e.g., [Dewey & LeBoeuf](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/02/wheres-leboeuf-an-update-on-doings-at-dewey/) or [Kenyon & Kenyon](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/whats-going-on-at-kenyon-kenyon/).) Best of luck to the firm as it moves forward.

# The Who’s Who Of Kinney Recruiting: Katherine Loanzon Didn’t Find Recruiting, Recruiting Found Her

Katherine Loanzon, Managing Director at Kinney Recruiting.

“The most memorable placements are the life changing ones. The times when I’ve tripled an attorney’s salary or placed them in a position where they were able to move closer to their end goal – whether it’s the city they’re in, becoming partner of a firm or working at a specific company – I like knowing I had a hand in changing someone’s life.”

Born and raised in New York City to a family of immigrant entrepreneurs, Katherine Loanzon was born to make dreams come true. She spent her childhood summers at her family’s Chinese bakery in New York’s Chinatown, a family business her grandfather started when he emigrated from southern China. Today, Katherine is a Managing Director at Kinney Recruiting, where she matches attorneys to law firm and in-house opportunities in New York and nationwide. “I really enjoy providing career advice that will genuinely advance an attorney’s career. In this industry, you can’t help every attorney who comes to you. Not all advice is something that an attorney will be open to receiving initially, but I always try my best to guide them so that they eventually end up in a position that will fulfill their needs and aspirations.”

After graduating from high school, Katherine attended New York University where she earned her BA in Romance Languages. Her studies, partnered with a melting-pot backdrop of New York City, sparked her wanderlust and she soon set off to study abroad, living in Spain and Italy. Shortly after graduating, she applied for law school and simultaneously earned a certificate that allowed her to teach English as a second language to recent immigrants in New York City. With that in her pocket, Katherine moved to Tokyo where she taught English to Japanese university students before heading home for law school. “Growing up in an entrepreneurial environment, I felt that going to law school would give me skills to navigate the professional world. It would teach me how to think analytically and generally navigate the legal system – useful tools to add to my toolkit. My parents were very encouraging because they not-so-secretly wanted to have a lawyer in the family, which was useful because we had a family business. While English is my first language, I grew up in a household where Cantonese and English were spoken interchangeably, so I saw the value in the strong communication skills law school can give you. My family’s encouragement sparked my interest in law, but it was the life skills that drew me to it.” She returned to New York City and went on to receive her JD from City University of New York School of Law and become a litigator at a small litigation firm.

In 2008, Katherine decided to temporarily trade litigation for lullabies, and she and her husband started a family. Shortly after her daughters were born, she began her solo practice where she advised startups and food businesses. In true full-circle style, Katherine even helped build a bakery in the West Village from scratch. After seven years of solo practice, Katherine debated returning to a law firm environment and mentioned that idea to a legal recruiter she had met. “I told him that I really enjoyed the hustle required of soloing but I no longer wanted to be in an environment where I was always looking for a way to one-up opposing counsel or have adversarial relationships. I wanted to be an advisor, and I had developed a passion for it.” Seeing something in Katherine she hadn’t yet seen in herself, the recruiter responded with, “I’ve got a better idea, consider recruiting!”

That interaction turned Katherine toward recruiting, a career she hadn’t really considered and didn’t know much about. “I had this perception that the only time I would come across a legal recruiter was in a job posting and I didn’t really know what a career in recruiting looked like. It seemed so foreign to me as a profession because no one had ever mentioned how you actually become one. That’s when he finally pulled back the curtain and explained that, just like in every other job, you have to learn how to do it and that there are companies that will train you and teach you the basics. So that’s what I did.” Shortly after that fateful phone call, Katherine joined a New York legal recruitment agency, where she was an Attorney Search Director and Division Director. Being a top recruiter, and a natural at that, she was quickly promoted to a senior role in her office.

In 2018, Katherine joined [Kinney Recruiting](https://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/), and she hasn’t looked back. Kinney Recruiting’s market-leading infrastructure and global connections allow her to advise a diverse range of candidates and make her a part of a solid team of recruiters all working towards the same end goal – matching excellent candidates with excellent firms. Katherine is currently working with one of her favorite clients to find a corporate associate who wants to be part of a family-centered work environment, where attorneys and staff don’t compromise their family life for their clients. “One of my favorite clients is not an AmLaw firm, it’s a boutique firm with a special culture specific to New York City. The firm appreciates people with grit and a down-to-earth attitude. The attorneys there successfully service their clients, while also being able to devote time to their families, and this is something I see practiced from top-level management.” You can check that job [out here](https://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/jobs/mid-to-senior-level-corporate-transactional-attorney/).

“I think the key to being a good recruiter is being a good listener.” Katherine believes that attorneys should always stay curious and that the best firms are those that really listen to the needs of their attorneys. Katherine is a member of The Asian American Bar Association of New York, AABANY, an organization that is close to her heart. Not only did she meet her husband there, but she’s been involved with the organization since she was a law student. “I’ve been a part of AABANY for almost 20 years. It’s volunteer based, so whenever they ask me to help in their mentorship program or be a part of their panels, I always say ‘yes’. It’s my way of giving back to the community and helping advance junior attorneys’ careers. I’ve made very good friends through AABANY and getting involved has always been a great experience. People don’t forget the goodwill that you’ve built, how you’ve made them feel or how you’ve been able to help them.” This explains why Katherine’s advice to candidates is to start building relationships early. “Begin networking early in your career, not actually when you think you’ll need it, because relationships take years to build, as does credibility. Be open-minded and humble and form genuine connections with people. You never know where they will take you.”

With scores of placements made at Kinney Recruiting so far, Katherine isn’t slowing down anytime soon. And we probably couldn’t slow her down even if we tried. Katherine is in a city that she loves, doing a job that she loves: helping other attorneys find jobs they can love. That’s a whole lot of love.

# Biglaw Firm Cutting Salaries For All Employees And Furloughing Staff
## Partners' next paycheck is cut by up to 90 percent!

Biglaw firms continue to tighten their belts. The economic upheaval that was brought about by the global pandemic continues to burn a path through the economy, and even giant law firms are feeling the pinch. The latest firm to announce COVID-19 austerity measures is Shook Hardy & Bacon, [ranked 103rd in the Am Law 200.](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=273&name=Shook-Hardy-%26-Bacon)

The firm has instituted a number of cost-cutting measures in order to put the firm on the firmest footing. There’s salary cuts across the board, though the percentage of the cuts varies by position. Equity partners are seeing the biggest cut — 90 percent of the upcoming draw (scheduled for this week) will be cut, and thereafter their monthly draws will be cut by 75 percent. Income partners will have their April salary cut by ~50 percent and future payment will be reassessed. Associates will take a 25 percent hit, and professional staff will see a 20 percent decrease in compensation. Additionally, we understand there have been some temporary furloughs of professional staff who have work that is dependent on a physical location.

When reached for comment, the firm had this to say:

Despite the many challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, Shook was one of the first law firms to successfully transition to a fully virtual firm model. In doing so, we have continued to provide our consistent excellent service to clients during this health crisis. The creativity, teamwork and dedication demonstrated in all areas of the firm have been extraordinary.
We entered the current period in a strong financial position, but like most businesses, we are taking prudent anticipatory measures consistent with our business continuity planning and financial modeling to appropriately mitigate the significant risk and uncertainty created by the pandemic. These measures include delaying or deferring various operating expenses, deferring some partner distributions, reducing partner draws, introducing pay reductions, and temporarily furloughing some employees.
If feasible, our intent is that these temporary measures will be lifted once the business and economic climate improves. Our overarching objective is to emerge from the current environment in a continued position of financial and strategic strength—ready to serve our clients’ needs as we have for over 130 years.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# What's Up With Counsel Salaries?
## We've not been hearing much from senior lawyers, but what we've heard isn't great.

Amid all the excitement about associate salaries, those senior attorneys occupying the critical yet underappreciated role of “counsel” have gotten lost in the shuffle. It’s not entirely our fault, though. After all, most firms don’t put out memos of lockstep counsel pay, and in many firms the number of counsel is so low that none dare exposing themselves as the Above the Law leak.

But we’ve been gathering information on counsel compensation wherever we can. So far, it seems as though, generally, counsel are suffering for those associate raises. Which is extra troubling given that women, more often than men, occupy the counsel ranks for a variety of reasons. Back in the day, it was considered an ideal landing spot for valuable female attorneys whose desire to have a family put them out of partnership consideration. Mercifully that sort of obvious bias is receding, but that a role traditionally dismissed as feminine is now getting overlooked in compensation should raise red flags.

Let’s examine what we know about counsel compensation at three firms where counsel compensation is — like at most firms — left out of the firm memo: Skadden, Hogan Lovells, and Haynes and Boone.

First we have Skadden, a firm sufficiently replete with counsel that they actually put out a separate memo for these lawyers (available in full on the next page):

1st Year Counsel	$335,000
2nd Year Counsel	$345,000
3rd Year Counsel	$355,000
4th Year+ Counsel	$360,000
To figure out what happened here, we need to look at where Skadden’s counsel compensation was before this round of salary boosts:

1st Year Counsel	$300,000
2nd Year Counsel	$310,000
3rd Year Counsel	$320,000
4th Year Counsel	$330,000
5th Year Counsel	$340,000
6th Year+ Counsel	$350,000

So it looks like what Skadden functionally gave the full $35,000 “Cravath” increase to 1st, 2nd and 3rd year Counsel, $30,000 to 4th year Counsel, $20,000 to 5th year Counsel, and $10,000 to 6th year Counsel and above. Sucks to be an older counsel I guess.

If you were thinking that counsel might be making this up on the back end with their bonuses, the memo addresses that too. The “maximum bonus opportunity” for counsel will be increased $10,000 for 1st and 2nd year Counsel and $35,000 for more senior Counsel. But therein lay the rub! A 1st year Counsel who hits the “maximum bonus opportunity” is getting an overall raise this year of $45,000 compared to $35,000 for a fully bonused top-level senior Counsel. That’s hardly fair.

But Skadden is positively counsel-friendly compared to some other firms we’ve heard about. Take [Simpson Thacher](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/simpson-thacher-finally-announces-its-new-salary-scale/), which we’ve heard didn’t move counsel compensation at all:

While Simpson has matched the associate pay raises announced by Cravath, they have chosen to keep counsel pay the same. This means that Simpson’s already below-market counsel now make just $10k/year more than the class of 2008 [$325K versus $315K].

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
While associate compensation has gone up, counsel compensation has not. Counsel now make $15k less in base compensation than senior associates. The firm is not committing to make up this difference at the end of the year. Counsel are angry, and senior associates who are up for counsel this year are feeling vulnerable.

Sadly, Hogan Lovells isn’t alone. We’re also hearing that Haynes and Boone opted, so far, to leave their counsel out of the cavalcade… to the extent that associates are, as we understand it, now making more:

Associates will be making on average more than most Counsel — even those that are allegedly lockstep…. Can’t wait to head into the office tomorrow to supervise and make comments on the work product of associates who are now making 40 grand more than us.

One hopes that Haynes and Boone will look to rectify this soon. They did only raise associate salaries this week so it’s possible they haven’t had time to process the impact this has on their counsel yet.

UPDATE (6/24/16 12:12 p.m.): We’ve heard some more troubling news about counsel mired in a compensation quandary:

Cahill did not bump up those in class 07 and above. General sense is it’s penny pinching to go along with their recent termination of the technology stipend for all lawyers. I wouldn’t be expecting another round of summer bonuses this year.

But at least we got some good news from a counsel at an unnamed firm:

I’m a second year “Special Counsel” (class of ’06) and my salary has just been raised to $365,000 (from $340,000)

Hopefully there will be more of those reports in coming days.

# It's A 'Perfect Storm' For Attorney Malpractice Claims
## The industry is seeing a rise in high-value malpractice claims.

The large international firms are doing work at a crazy level, especially on the transactional side. Combine that with the effects of COVID, with eight to 10 attorneys on the same deal not being in same room. You’ve got overworked lawyers going from 2,400 hours now to 2,800 or 3,000. Combine all these factors together and it’s a perfect storm.

— Hinshaw & Culbertson partner Matthew Henderson [told law.com](https://www.law.com/2022/04/19/as-deal-work-flourished-high-value-malpractice-claims-followed/) some of the factors behind a rise in attorney malpractice claims, particularly in transactional work. He also described an erosion of factors that, historically made corporate clients hesitant to file lawsuits against their attorneys, opting instead to resolve issues through fee credits or other solutions that were appealing to institutional clients. But now Henderson says, “Large law firms are handling matters for startup companies, fintech companies, and some of these more cutting-edge businesses that don’t necessarily have the same sort of corporate governance that a public corporation would. Those make for dangerous clients, as they often have some unrealistic expectations. These companies aren’t exhibiting a reluctance to sue. They don’t have those long-term relationships.”

# Biglaw Firm Finally Admits It's Closing

The dream that was LeClairRyan is over. Of course, for those of us following along with the once Biglaw firm, this was expected; after all, [last week we reported LeClairRyan had begun the process of dissolution](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/leclairryan-begins-the-process-of-dissolution/) of the firm. Which was after a 2+-year-long span of trouble, including [partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/the-partner-departures-at-this-biglaw-firm-are-really-piling-up/)[ deserting](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/biglaw-firm-that-just-lost-over-a-dozen-partner-loses-even-more/) the firm [en masse](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/biglaw-firm-loses-over-a-dozen-partners-as-more-firms-spread-to-boston/) (notably including [name partner Gary LeClair](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/name-partner-bolts-from-struggling-biglaw-firm/)); being prevented by their lender from returning [departing partners’ capital contributions](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/biglaw-firm-prohibited-by-lender-from-returning-former-partners-capital-contributions/); giving staff [WARN Act notices ](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/is-this-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-this-biglaw-firm/)of mass layoffs; and [being sued](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/problems-pile-on-for-struggling-biglaw-firm/) for back rent and for gender discrimination. But through it all, the firm, somewhat stubbornly, has refused to comment — until now.

Yesterday, the firm released a statement saying its members have “voted to commence an orderly wind-down of the firm’s business.” And going on to note:

“The firm, through its dissolution committee, is working in cooperation with its lender to ensure the continuity of client service until such time as the firm ceases to actively practice law and turns its attention to post-practice activities.”

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/08/07/leclairryan-acknowledges-firms-dissolution/) Law.com, in a statement on the closing of the firm, CEO Erik Gustafson focused on a smooth transition for the firm’s clients:

“On behalf of my colleagues, we are deeply saddened to make this announcement today,” now-former CEO C. Erik Gustafson said in a statement. “Through our transition, we will continue to focus first and foremost on the success of our clients, as we have always done. I am thankful to all of the clients who have chosen to work with our team over the last 30 years, and I am grateful for the exceptional lawyers and professionals who continue to work with dedication and determination towards winding down the firm in an orderly fashion.”

So, what happens now? Well, associates have reportedly been told their last day at the firm will be August 30th. Headhunters have been contacted to assist with finding new firms for any groups of attorneys that somehow missed the writing on the wall and are still at the firm. It is currently unclear whether the firm will wind up in bankruptcy court, or if they’ll manage to navigate the dissolution of the firm without that process.

What’s happening at LeClairRyan may, in fact, [be a harbinger](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/what-a-week-in-legal-news/) for other Am Law 200 firms. At least according to Bill Brandt, chairman of Development Specialists and a law firm restructuring expert:

However it proceeds, LeClairRyan’s situation highlights the perilous positions of some firms in the Am Law 200, especially in the Second Hundred.

Brandt said firms in LeClairRyan’s size bracket—in roughly the 200-partner range—are in a tough position. “Those midrange Am Law firms” don’t have the geographic and practice base to pull in lot of clients, but they can’t manage themselves like a boutique, he said. “They are very vulnerable right now.”

We’ll definitely keep our eyes and ears open to see what ripple effect LeClairRyan closing may have on the larger legal industry.

# Former U.S. Solicitor General Complains That Biglaw Adjusts Too Well To Its Woke Clientele
## If a man can't defend gun companies and make several hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, why even study the law?

STOP CARING ABOUT THE HISTORICALLY DISENFRANCHISED! I’M HERE TO MAKE MONEY!

Sure is tough working a Biglaw job. It isn’t all wearing fancy suits and making $250k+ a year — some of the stuff you have to deal with is anathema to a peaceful work environment. Not the long hours or the stealth layoffs your firm is gaslighting you into believing are your fault. No, [we all know what the real problem is: wokeness.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/paul-clement-laments-kirklands-cancel-culture-or-capitalism-as-the-case-may-be/) From [ABA Journal](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/biglaw-is-too-woke-former-solicitor-general-clement-tells-federalist-society):

BigLaw is too woke, according to a former U.S. solicitor general who left Kirkland & Ellis in a dispute over representation of gun clients.

Appearing on a Saturday panel at an event for the Federalist Society, former U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement said large law firms have a “very serious” problem of liberal bias, [Law360](https://www.law360.com/legalethics/articles/1548879) reports.

Clement and another Kirkland & Ellis lawyer, Erin Murphy, [left earlier this year](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/scotus-litigator-says-kirkland-gave-him-a-choice-abandon-gun-clients-or-leave). They started a new appellate boutique, Clement & Murphy. Clement said at the time that Kirkland had offered him a choice: Drop his Second Amendment clients, or withdraw from the law firm.

Other panelists agreed that partners at large law firms are more liberal than conservative. But they said there is still room for conservatives in BigLaw, according to Law360.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
A thing we should remember about the operative word here, too, is that it is relative. Considering that[ FedSoc recently ousted a co-founder because he dared to claim that racism exists](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/federalist-society-tells-founder-he-cant-call-himself-founder-in-purity-purge/), color me suspicious.

OMG! [#FedSoc](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FedSoc?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) tries to muzzle 1 of its own leaders! See transcript of interview I did this A.M. w Steve Calabresi abt his ISL brief at [#SCOTUS](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SCOTUS?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/fC9gDgsaYK](https://t.co/fC9gDgsaYK)

— Nina Totenberg (@NinaTotenberg) [November 11, 2022](https://twitter.com/NinaTotenberg/status/1591119064440635396?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

FedSoc — right-wing chicken slinging cult that it is — calling anything too “woke” is like a police officer saying they smell “too much weed” in a car or a Klan member saying that there are too many Jews nearby; it applies just as well to when there is a lot of the offending presence as when there is none. Remember when Yale’s FedSoc called[ backlash against a “Trap House” party making fun of women and Black people](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/yale-law-school-trap-house-incident-not-a-free-speech-thing-no-matter-how-hard-folks-try/) too woke? Or [when FedSoc women were shocked to discover that they weren’t getting fair treatment from their colleagues](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/women-resign-from-law-school-fedsoc-board-after-realizing-what-fedsoc-is-all-about/)? It should be no surprise that Fedsoc is against “wokeness,” be it treating women and Blacks with respect, given that their holy grail of legalistic interpretation goes back to when both those categories of people were considered objects. At this point, if you aren’t being called woke by some FedSoc member, I’d like to know where you were on January 6th, 2021.

The response to “things are getting too woke in here” should not be “Hey, we still allow conservative opinions in Biglaw!” It is too easy of an equivocation between being conservative and being against common sense — Steven Calabresi’s recent and modest recognition that a country that has hosted 400 years of chattel slavery may have a bit of racist residue left resulting in a purge is proof of that. When you hear things like this:

“Part of the phenomenon is that big law firms are becoming increasingly woke because their clients are becoming increasingly woke,” Clement said.

The response should be that values matter. A workplace isn’t necessarily hostile because it doesn’t defer to your wish for less minorities or more opportunities to defend makers of rifles that kill children. It isn’t a cardinal sin for a business to… adapt to its clientele. Free markets, right? May mean your services would be better met working somewhere else, though. And remember, the people doing all this complaining about blackballing are very well connected. Just read the article — complaints about wokeness aside, Clement is still in the position to be able to offer folks jobs working with him. Trust me — there are a bunch of people grinning and bearing at complaints about “encroaching wokeness” because they don’t have nearly as much job security as the complainers.

Since we broke the news of the market bonus scale for associates at large law firms in the United States — a trend that was [started by Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/breaking-biglaw-bonuses-are-here/) on Thursday, November 7, 2019, and finally [followed by Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/cravath-announces-bonuses-now-the-2019-bonus-season-can-really-begin/) on Monday, November 11, 2019 — many firms quickly fell in line and matched the scale. It’s now nearly February 2020, yet dozens upon dozens of firms have remained completely silent on bonuses.

As usual, we are compiling a table of all the firms that have already matched the new bonus scale, the markets where those bonus matches were made, the minimum hours required to receive those bonuses (if available), and the date those bonuses will be paid. Today, we unveil that table for your viewing pleasure. We will be updating this table on a daily basis, sometimes multiple times, as news on bonuses is announced. If you see any information here that is incorrect or needs clarification, [let us know](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Bonus%20Scorecard%20Correction).

Help us help you now (and if/when you decide to make a lateral move in the future). Let us know what your firm’s minimum billable hours targets are for bonus eligibility and when your firm will pay those bonuses. You generally must remain at your firm until the payout date to receive them, as stated in most memos, which could make it all the more difficult for you to leave your place of employment.

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file.
Don’t forget, if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please enter your email address in the box below. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Cheers to a happy bonus season, everyone!

You want to know why the billable hour is so entrenched and not going anywhere any time soon? It’s because it provides a direct, measurable metric or benchmark for the value of a lawyer to a law firm.

The billable hour is generally reliable (assuming accuracy), it demonstrates a form of ROI, and it provides the basis for some of the most important metrics law firms rely upon, like leverage, utilization, and realization. Few, if any, firms are tracking the type of work, and none that I’m aware of are looking at the quality of the work (at least not in any systematic way). Heck, many firms don’t even bother to use phase and task codes to categorize their work.

While we’ve come a long way from the days when an invoice from a law firm simply said “For services rendered” and included a dollar amount, there still appears to be some dissonance in the legal industry about how best to track and measure legal work and outcomes of legal projects.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Last week, we suggested that legal operations professionals need to identify at the outset of a legal matter what the success of a legal project will look like. This week, we explore ways to measure the success of a project.

According to the CLOC, the Corporate Legal Operations Consortium, in 2018 medium- to large-sized corporations averaged 400+ litigation matters. These corporations also spent on average in excess of $2 million dollars each on eDiscovery. Interestingly, only about half of these organizations use a case or matter management system. Yet somehow, 70 percent of them track budgeted costs to actual costs on a per matter basis.

I spoke to my friend John Rowley, the Director of Corporate Sales for ELM software company [Onit](https://www.onit.com/). John and I have been talking about project management and legal matter management metrics for 10 years. “Tracking outside counsel spend and managing to a budget on a matter are quite common, even when organizations are still doing it in spreadsheets and haven’t implemented an ELM tool yet,” says John.

But these metrics are just the tip of the iceberg. As John works with corporate legal departments, he recommends to “invest some time to figure out the types of metrics you need at a matter level, metrics to measure risk, and outcomes.” John said, “Take a look at the metrics you are reporting on today, who are you sharing those metrics with and are they helping you to successfully drive business decisions at the department level, within business units and the company. Every organization has their own thoughts about how best to measure these things; about what metrics they want to measure and track and what the next steps are in their journey on metrics maturity.”

Outside counsel spend and budget to actual on each project are no-brainers. In order to fully understand the value of litigation, however, there are other metrics corporate legal departments could be tracking.

My thinking on this, as I pointed out [last week](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/metrics-what-metrics-kpis-that-legal-ops-professionals-need-to-track-part-i/), is that every legal matter tends to involve very similar events and follow a pattern of tasks and activities. So, looking at a litigation matter, for instance, one might categorize work into the Pre-Litigation Phase, a Pleadings Phase, a Motions Phase, a Discovery Phase, and a Trial Phase.

How might we measure the work in each of these phases? For too many, the default is the time and money spent to draft or answer a complaint or research and write a motion or brief or respond to interrogatories. But what about the organization’s exposure in the matter? What’s the value of this case? What are the consequences (think: risks) associated with losing? Is there a phase and task-based budget for the matter? What about the jurisdiction, the court, the parties? What type of matter is it? Which firms are involved? And what about the outcome? Did you even win? These are some of the questions I’d be seeking answers to if my company were involved in litigation. The good news is that this is all information that is easily available.

In discovery, an aspect of litigation with which I am particularly familiar, I keep track of all sorts of eDiscovery metrics. Years ago, before we had the smart business intelligence tools capable to reach inside any data store, I used to do these case studies — mostly because some lawyer asked me for the numbers, not because I enjoyed gathering metrics. We would measure every data point we could think of across the spectrum of the EDRM. How much data was identified? How much data was collected? What type of data? Where did it come from? Who are the custodians? How much data per custodian? Per source? How much data was left after filtering and culling? After processing? What data was promoted to review? What is the volume? How many reviewers were involved? How long did it take? Time spent on each document, by file type or data source? How many documents were produced, from what source or by file type?

If you’re not measuring these data points across the EDRM, you’re not getting a full picture of where the money is going, how you might realign resources, or whether you’re overpaying for services.

These are just a few of the metrics organizations should be tracking. But today, with technologies like machine learning, there are a host of additional data points that may be tracked with relative ease. There’s really no excuse for not gathering metrics.

In the end, it’s true that most of this — gathering and measuring metrics — really does just come down to money. We all use dollars to assess the value of the products or services we purchase. But other informative metrics could lead to new and innovative ways to measure and manage legal risk and new ways of thinking about and making strategic decisions.

Imagine a world in which we know in advance that a wage-and-hour suit filed by Firm X in the Southern District of New York before Judge Y is going to last three years and cost $500K in legal fees to prosecute or defend, and we know the value of the case is only $250K. Wouldn’t that be useful? Think “money ball” for litigation, as one of my good friends likes to say.

(But even if it existed, they probably wouldn’t want to pay up anyway.) [[Big Law Business](https://biglawbusiness.com/trump-organization-urges-judge-to-toss-cohen-suit-for-legal-fees)] * In case you missed it, Dentons, the world’s largest law firm, has tapped Chicago finance partner Mary Wilson, “an enthusiastic, exceptionally passionate lawyer and leader,” as the first woman to serve as its U.S. managing partner. Congratulations! [[American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/04/15/dentons-taps-chicago-finance-lawyer-as-new-us-managing-partner/)] * After years tied up in patent and antitrust litigation, Apple and Qualcomm settles in the middle of opening statements at trial yesterday afternoon. Now the feuding companies will have to behave, at least for the next six years. [[The Recorder](https://www.law.com/2019/04/16/apple-and-qualcomm-settle-in-midst-of-opening-statements/)] * Remember Jeffrey Wertkin, the Akin Gump partner who [disguised himself in a wig](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/akin-gump-lawyer-arrested-trying-to-sell-the-details-of-a-whistleblower-complaint/) to try to sell a copy of a whistleblower complaint to Fortinet?

In the wake of yesterday’s attempted coup at the U.S. Capitol, Americans are searching for leaders to guide them since there is no leadership to be found at the head of our government, with President Donald Trump seeming to relish in the riots in his honor. Lawyers from one prominent firm have already taken heed, and are now calling for Trump to be removed from office — and they hope more law firm leaders will join the charge.

This morning, the leaders of Crowell & Moring, a Washington, D.C.-based Am Law 100 firm, issued a statement calling for the “defense of Constitutional democracy.” In that statement, the members of the firm’s management board demanded that the 25th Amendment be used to strip Trump of his title and duties. Here is the [full statement](https://www.crowell.com/NewsEvents/PressReleasesAnnouncements/In-Defense-of-Constitutional-Democracy):

Yesterday, we watched in horror as the U.S. Congress was subject to a mob’s raid and occupation of the Capitol, interrupting one of the most sacred traditions in our orderly transition of Constitutional power: the receipt and certification of the ballots cast by the states to the Electoral College. It was a scene framed by forcible illegal entry, assault on law enforcement officers, and a senseless death. It was the direct and predictable result of a rally summoned by the President, at which he reinforced false claims of a rigged election that have been rejected or outright disproven by every public and judicial review of our November 2020 presidential election. It was a riot incited by the President’s own words addressing that rally, and then excused by his words after it.

Lawyers have no special province when it comes to politics. We have our views, like all citizens, and we should act on them. But when it comes to defending our Constitution and our system of laws, we have a special duty and an exceptional perspective. In this moment, we must speak out, in devotion to these bedrock principles of our nation.

The President has proven himself unfit for office, and a reckless and wanton threat to the Constitution that he pledged to preserve, protect, and defend. We call upon the Vice President and the Cabinet officers to invoke Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, and to declare to the leaders of Congress that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. We further call upon all law firm leaders and all lawyers in government to join in this call, and to stand up for the democratic institutions and traditions of our republic and the Constitution that gives them life and protection.

Other law firm leaders have [given statements](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/01/06/inciting-a-riot-legal-community-erupts-in-calls-for-trumps-removal-as-mob-storms-capitol/) about the horrific events that took place yesterday at the nation’s capital, but Crowell & Moring is the first law firm whose leadership has called for Trump’s removal from office. Will the leaders of your law firm join the call to remove a president whose actions have put our nation in danger?

# Summer Associate Allegedly Fired For Making Racist Remarks
## Let this summer associate’s fate serve as a cautionary tale.

It’s been quite some time since we’ve heard about a seriously scandalous summer associate story. Unfortunately, the recession sucked the soul out of summers and made them fear for their futures; after all, a future without an offer is really no future at all. But are things changing now that we’re so far removed from the unsteady hiring environment that led to rescinded offers and deferred start dates?

Apparently so.

Last year, a summer associate at Skadden Arps “jokingly” [slapped an associate in the face](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/did-a-biglaw-lawyer-just-get-slapped-by-a-summer-associate/) in what was a case of mistaken identity. This year, a summer associate at Skadden allegedly made some inadvisable racial remarks to another member of his summer class — and found himself on the receiving end of a pink slip.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Several sources have informed us about the incident, which purportedly occurred sometime last week during a firm outing. We’re told that the summer associate in question made an inappropriate remark to a fellow summer associate of Hispanic origin about their heritage, and things quickly spiraled out of control. Tipsters say the firm quickly disposed of its errant summer associate.

We’ve reached out to Skadden for comment, but have not yet received a response. We will update this post if and when we do hear back from the firm.

In the meantime, our sources have been light on the details of what actually happened here. If you have any additional insights, please contact us via [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Skadden%20Summer%20Associate) (subject line: “Skadden Summer Associate”), text (646-820-8477), or tweet ([@atlblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). Let this summer associate’s fate serve as a cautionary tale — your words have meaning, and the things you say can get you fired.

# Good Lawyering Is Less Effective In Busy Courts
## Lawyers who want a court to better consider their arguments do have a few options.

Clients might believe that good lawyers will have the best impact on a court since they can advance the most persuasive arguments and convince a court to side with their position. Of course, it is true that when a court has the time to read all of the papers and carefully consider all of the arguments, the party which advanced the best points is usually the one that will prevail. However, some courts are so busy and have so little time to review papers and evaluate arguments that good lawyering is less effective in advancing a client’s position in such venues.

Many state courts in a city in which I practice are extremely busy, mainly because the courts do not have the resources to handle the vast amount of cases that are filed. Whenever I go to these courts in person, it is astonishing to see the incredible number of other cases that are also being managed by the court, and I always wonder how the court can give each of these matters the attention they deserve.

In order to deal with the volume of litigation, these courts adopt practices that make it difficult for good lawyering to shine through when handling a matter. Discovery disputes are handled by centralized systems in which the parties must mostly agree on discovery issues to move a case forward. Many of the courts also have expansive mediation services in an attempt to resolve as many cases as possible and alleviate the burden that the volume of litigation has on the judicial system.

These courts also tend to have some practices in place when it comes to handling dispositive motions. Perhaps the biggest indication that the courts are busy when it comes to dispositive motions is that these motions are rarely granted. The courts know that it is much easier to deny dispositive motions than to grant them, and they are much less likely to get overturned on appeal by doing so.

Moreover, if dispositive motions are denied, and cases get close to trial, it is likely that cases will settle, and the court will not need to deal with such matters in the future. Even if lawyers make great points, and outshine their adversaries at every turn, it is still difficult to break through the sheer volume of matters courts need to deal with to convince a court to grant a dispositive motion.

Lawyers who want a court to better consider their arguments do have a few options. If they can get their cases into federal court, in my experience, it is more likely that their arguments will be more persuasive to a court. As I have seen in my practice, federal courts typically have more resources and smaller caseloads than state courts, and federal judges might have more bandwidth to consider interesting arguments that can help a client prevail. Some state courts also have specialized parts that deal with larger (often commercial) matters since they seem to understand ordinary state courts are overburdened, and these specialized courts can benefit lawyers wishing to receive more attention from a court.

I am not at all blaming judges and court officers for the practices they need to implement to deal with the sheer volume of cases they often handle, and these public servants work extremely hard to ensure that matters get the most attention possible. Legislatures should likely give courts more resources so that judges and court officers are not overburdened with voluminous dockets. However, lawyers and clients should understand that in some legal contexts, courts are simply too overburdened to provide their utmost attention to a matter, and good lawyering might not be helpful in these situations. Understanding this could impact case strategy and the forum in which parties wish to litigate.

In the digital age, data has become the lifeblood of our societies and economies. It is everywhere, embedded in every click, swipe, and digital interaction. This omnipresence of data is not merely a byproduct of our increasingly connected world; it is a driving force behind it. With the advent of advanced technologies, we are processing data at an exponential rate, turning raw information into actionable insights that drive innovation and economic growth. Despite this growth, the rapid pace of change presents significant challenges, particularly around privacy. 

So, how do we continue to govern data and AI without hampering innovation?

The Privacy Challenge 

The speed of technological change has outpaced the evolution of our regulatory frameworks, leaving them ill-equipped to protect privacy in the digital age. Traditional privacy laws were designed for a world where data was static, collected, and stored in discrete databases. Today, data is dynamic, constantly being generated, collected, and analyzed across various platforms and devices. This shift has blurred the boundaries of privacy, making it increasingly difficult to define what constitutes personal information and how it should be protected. 

Moreover, the sheer volume of data being generated and processed has made it increasingly difficult for individuals to maintain control over their personal information. Every day, we leave digital footprints across the internet, from the websites we visit to the posts we like on social media. These footprints can be collected, analyzed, and used in ways that we may not fully understand or consent to. This has led to growing concerns about data privacy and security, with many people feeling that they have lost control over their personal information.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) compounds the challenges of data privacy, introducing complex issues around AI governance and ethics. [AI is expected to see an annual growth rate of 37.3% from 2023 to 2030](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/ai-statistics/#:~:text=AI%20is%20expected%20to%20see,technologies%20in%20the%20coming%20years.). As AI systems increasingly make decisions that impact individuals and societies, questions about accountability, transparency, and fairness become paramount. Who is responsible when an AI system makes a mistake? How can we ensure that AI systems are transparent and explainable? How can we prevent AI systems from perpetuating or exacerbating societal biases? These are just a few of the questions that policymakers, technologists, and society at large must grapple with as we navigate the AI era. 

AI governance is a complex and multifaceted issue. It involves not only technical considerations, such as how to design and implement AI systems responsibly and ethically, but also legal and societal considerations, such as how to regulate AI use and mitigate its potential harms. This complexity makes AI governance a challenging task, requiring a multidisciplinary approach and a deep understanding of both the technology and its societal implications. 

In addition to these challenges, AI governance also involves addressing issues related to data quality and integrity. AI systems are only as good as the data they are trained on. If the data is biased or inaccurate, the AI system’s outputs will also be biased or inaccurate. [A more complete ](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/03/theres-more-ai-bias-biased-data-nist-report-highlights)understanding of bias must take into account human and systemic biases. Therefore, ensuring data quality and integrity is a critical aspect of AI governance 

Another key aspect of AI governance is ensuring that AI systems are used in a manner that respects human rights and democratic values. This includes ensuring that AI systems do not infringe on individuals’ privacy, do not discriminate against certain groups, and do not undermine democratic processes. It also includes ensuring that individuals have the right to challenge decisions made by AI systems and to seek redress if they are harmed by these decisions. 

However, developing effective AI governance frameworks is a complex task that requires balancing various competing interests. On the one hand, there is a need to protect individuals and societies from the potential harms of AI. On the other hand, there is a need to promote innovation and economic growth. Striking the right balance between these interests is a key challenge in AI governance.

The Regulatory Response 

In response to these challenges, Europe and other countries are attempting to establish governance principles for data and AI. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), for example, has set a global standard for data protection, introducing stringent rules around consent, transparency, and the right to be forgotten. Similarly, the EU’s proposed Artificial Intelligence Act aims to create a legal framework for AI, establishing requirements for transparency, accountability, and human oversight. 

However, these efforts are proving difficult due to the complex, global, and rapidly evolving nature of digital technologies. Data and AI do not respect national borders, making it challenging to enforce regulations in a global digital economy. Moreover, the pace of technological change makes it difficult for regulations to keep up, leading to a constant game of regulatory catch-up. 

In addition to these challenges, there are also concerns about the potential for regulatory fragmentation. As different countries and regions develop their own regulations for data and AI, there is a risk of creating a patchwork of conflicting rules that could hinder the global development and deployment of these technologies. This highlights the need for international cooperation and harmonization in the development of data and AI regulations. 

Furthermore, there is a growing recognition that traditional forms of regulation may not be sufficient to address the unique challenges posed by data and AI. Traditional regulations tend to be reactive, responding to harms after they have occurred. But with data and AI, there is a need for proactive regulation that can anticipate and prevent harms before they occur. This requires a shift towards more dynamic and flexible forms of regulation, such as risk-based regulation, which focuses on managing the risks associated with data and AI, rather than prescribing specific behaviors or technologies. As cited by the European Parliament, [“The EU should not always regulate AI as a technology. Instead, the level of regulatory intervention should be proportionate to the type of risk associated with using an AI system in a particular way.” ](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220318IPR25801/artificial-intelligence-the-eu-needs-to-act-as-a-global-standard-setter)

There is also a need for more inclusive and participatory forms of regulation. Given the broad societal impacts of data and AI, it is important that all stakeholders – including businesses, civil society groups, and the public at large – have a say in how these technologies are regulated. This can be achieved through mechanisms such as public consultations, multi-stakeholder forums, and citizen juries, which can provide diverse perspectives and insights on the regulation of data and AI. 

Finally, there is a need for greater regulatory capacity and expertise. Regulating data and AI requires a deep understanding of these technologies and their societal implications. This requires investing in regulatory capacity building, such as training for regulators, the creation of specialized regulatory agencies, and the development of interdisciplinary research and expertise in data and AI regulation. 

Balancing Regulation and Innovation 

Balancing the need for regulation with the desire for innovation is a delicate task. On the one hand, we need robust regulations to protect privacy and ensure ethical AI use. On the other, we need to avoid overly restrictive rules that could stifle innovation and economic growth. Striking the right balance is critical, but it is also incredibly challenging. 

Regulation is essential to ensure that the use of data and AI aligns with societal values and norms. It can provide a framework for ethical behavior, set boundaries for acceptable use, and protect individuals and societies from potential harm. However, regulation can also hinder innovation if it is too restrictive or not well-designed. It can create barriers to entry, limit the development and deployment of new technologies, and stifle creativity and experimentation. [“Approaching AI regulation through rigid categorization according to perceived levels of risk turns the focus away from AI’s actual risks and benefits to an exercise that may become quickly outdated and risks being so over inclusive as to choke future innovation.” ](https://iapp.org/news/a/the-case-of-the-eu-ai-act-why-we-need-to-return-to-a-risk-based-approach/)

Innovation, on the other hand, is a key driver of economic growth and societal progress. It can lead to new products and services, improve efficiency and productivity, and solve complex problems. Unchecked innovation can also lead to negative outcomes, such as privacy violations, discrimination, and other societal harms. Therefore, it is crucial to find a balance between regulation and innovation that promotes the beneficial use of data and AI while mitigating their potential risks. 

To achieve this balance, we need to adopt a more nuanced and flexible approach to regulation. Instead of imposing rigid rules and restrictions, we should aim to create a regulatory environment that encourages responsible innovation. This could involve the use of regulatory sandboxes, which allow innovators to test new technologies in a controlled environment under the supervision of regulators. It could also involve using outcome-based regulations, which focus on the results that need to be achieved rather than the specific methods or technologies that should be used. 

At the same time, we need to foster a culture of innovation that is mindful of ethical and societal considerations. This involves not only providing the necessary resources and infrastructure for innovation, but also instilling a sense of responsibility and accountability among innovators. It involves encouraging innovators to think critically about the potential impacts of their work and to engage in open and honest dialogue with stakeholders about these impacts. 

Moreover, we need to promote collaboration and cooperation between regulators and innovators. Instead of viewing each other as adversaries, they should see each other as partners in the quest for responsible innovation. This involves creating platforms for dialogue and exchange, fostering mutual understanding and respect, and working together to solve common challenges. 

Balancing regulation and innovation is not a zero-sum game. It is not about choosing between protecting privacy and promoting innovation, but about finding ways to achieve both. It is about creating a regulatory environment that safeguards our rights and values, while also fostering an innovative ecosystem that can drive economic growth and societal progress. It is a challenging task, but with creativity, collaboration, and a shared commitment to responsible innovation, it is a task that we can achieve. 

Expanding the Balance 

To further expand on this balance, it’s important to recognize that innovation in the field of data and AI is not just about technological advancements, but also about innovative approaches to governance, ethics, and societal engagement. This includes developing new models of data governance that give individuals more control over their personal data, creating AI systems that are transparent and accountable, and finding new ways to engage the public in decisions about data and AI use. 

Innovation can also play a role in addressing some of the challenges posed by regulation. For example, technologies such as privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) can help to reconcile the tension between data use and privacy protection, by enabling the use of data in a way that preserves privacy. Similarly, AI can be used to automate and enhance regulatory compliance, making it easier for businesses to adhere to regulations and for regulators to monitor and enforce compliance. 

At the same time, regulation can also stimulate innovation. By setting clear rules and standards, regulation can create a level playing field and provide certainty for businesses, which can in turn foster competition and drive innovation. Regulation can also stimulate demand for new technologies and services, such as privacy-enhancing technologies or AI auditing services. By addressing societal concerns about data and AI, regulation can help to build public trust in these technologies, which is crucial for their widespread adoption and use. 

Achieving this balance between regulation and innovation is not a one-off task, but an ongoing process. It requires continuous monitoring and adjustment, to ensure that the regulatory framework remains fit for purpose as technology and society evolve. It also requires ongoing dialogue and collaboration among all stakeholders, to ensure that diverse perspectives and interests are considered. 

In this process, it’s important to recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Different countries and regions may need to strike different balances, depending on their specific context and values. What is important is that the balance is struck in a way that is transparent, inclusive, and accountable and that it is continuously reassessed and adjusted as needed. 

Ultimately, the goal is not just to balance regulation and innovation, but to harness them both in the service of societal well-being. By doing so, we can ensure that the benefits of data and AI are widely shared, while the risks are effectively managed. And we can create a future where data and AI are used not just to drive economic growth, but also to enhance our lives, strengthen our societies, and fulfill our human potential.

The Innovation Imperative 

In the face of these challenges, it is important to remember that innovation is not just about creating new technologies or products. It is also about finding new ways to solve problems, improve processes, and create value. This is where the true potential of data and AI lies. By harnessing the power of data and AI, we can transform industries, create new business models, and improve the quality of life for people around the world. 

Innovation in the use of data and AI can take many forms. It can involve developing new algorithms and machine learning models, creating new data-driven products and services, or using data and AI to improve decision-making and operational efficiency. It can also involve finding new ways to protect privacy and ensure ethical AI use, such as developing privacy preserving machine learning techniques or creating AI systems that can explain their decisions in understandable terms. 

We need to create an environment that fosters innovation. This involves not only providing the necessary resources and infrastructure, but also creating a culture that values creativity, encourages experimentation, and accepts failure as a part of the innovation process. It also involves creating a regulatory environment that supports innovation, while still protecting privacy and ensuring ethical AI use. 

The Way Forward 

So, how do we continue to govern data and AI without hampering innovation? The answer lies in crafting dynamic, future-oriented regulatory frameworks that safeguard individual privacy and uphold ethical AI practices, while simultaneously nurturing an environment conducive to technological progress. This necessitates an ongoing, inclusive dialogue among policymakers, technologists, and other stakeholders, coupled with a steadfast commitment to adapt and evolve in stride with the ever-changing digital landscape. 

One approach is to adopt a principles-based regulatory framework, which sets out broad principles that must be adhered to, rather than prescriptive rules. This approach can provide flexibility for innovation, while still ensuring that the use of data and AI aligns with societal values and norms. It can also be more adaptable to technological change, as the principles can be interpreted and applied in different contexts as the technology evolves. [“For AI regulation to remain effective in protecting fundamental rights while also laying a foundation for innovation, it must remain flexible enough to adapt to new developments and use cases, a constantly changing risk taxonomy, and the seemingly endless range of applications.” ](https://iapp.org/news/a/the-case-of-the-eu-ai-act-why-we-need-to-return-to-a-risk-based-approach/)

Another approach is to promote self-regulation and industry standards, which can complement formal regulation. This can involve developing codes of conduct, ethical guidelines, and best practices for data and AI use. It can also involve certification schemes, which can provide a market-based incentive for companies to adhere to high standards of data and AI governance. 

Conclusion 

Ultimately, our ability to balance these competing interests will shape the trajectory of our digital future, determining whether we can harness the full potential of data and AI to drive innovation while preserving the fundamental rights and values that define our societies. This is not just a challenge for policymakers and technologists; it is a challenge for all of us. As we navigate the data wave, we must all play a role in shaping a digital future that is innovative, inclusive, and respectful of our privacy and rights. [The AI market is projected to reach a staggering $407 billion by 2027, experiencing substantial growth from its estimated $86.9 billion revenue in 2022. ](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/ai-statistics/#:~:text=AI%20is%20expected%20to%20see,technologies%20in%20the%20coming%20years.)So the time to act is now. 

The quest for responsible innovation in the era of data and AI is a complex and multifaceted challenge. It requires a delicate balance between regulation and innovation, a deep understanding of the technology and its societal implications, and a commitment to ongoing dialogue and adaptation. It is a challenge that we must meet head-on, with creativity, courage, and a shared vision for a digital future that benefits all of humanity. 

Innovation, in this context, is not just about creating new technologies or products, but also about finding new ways to address the challenges we face. It is about using data and AI to improve our lives and our societies, while also ensuring that these technologies are used responsibly and ethically. It is about fostering a culture of innovation that values creativity, encourages experimentation, and accepts failure as a part of the process. 

As we move forward, we must continue to engage in open and inclusive dialogue about the future of data and AI. We must work together to develop dynamic, future-oriented regulatory frameworks that protect privacy and ensure ethical AI use, while also fostering an environment conducive to innovation. And we must remain committed to adapting and evolving as the digital landscape continues to change. 

In the end, the goal is not just to harness the data wave, but to ride it towards a future that is innovative, inclusive, and respectful of our privacy and rights. It’s a challenging journey, but one that we must undertake together. And if we succeed, we will not only have harnessed the data wave, but we will have set a course for a future where data and AI are used to drive innovation, improve lives, and create a better world for all.

Hot on the heels of Kirkland & Ellis announcing [layoffs among its China offices](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/03/worlds-wealthiest-law-firm-conducts-layoffs-due-to-market-conditions/), yet another Biglaw firm has decided to close up shop within the region.

As noted by [Law.com International](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/03/05/perkins-coie-fourth-us-firm-to-shutter-china-office-in-8-months-405-137446/), Perkins Coie just became the fourth Biglaw firm to shutter an office in China within the last eight months. The firm offered the following statement on the closure of its Shanghai office:

“China has one of the world’s most dynamic technology and business markets for established companies, venture capital, startups, and entrepreneurs and we remain committed as a firm to our China practice and clients.”

“We are providing significant support to our lawyers and staff in Shanghai during this transition and truly appreciate their commitment to the firm and our clients.”

Perkins Coie employs a handful of lawyers in its Shanghai office (three of whom are primarily based in the U.S.), as well as several patent consultants. The firm maintains at least one other office within China at this time (Beijing). It also has an office located in Taipei.

Best of luck to those who are being displaced thanks to Perkins Coie’s decision to close its Shanghai office.

Which Biglaw firm will be the next say zàijiàn to its offices in China? You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20China%20Office%20Closure) or text us ([646-820-8477](tel:646-820-8477)) if you have any intel. Thank you.

# Edward Blum Might Not Be Done Suing Law Firms Over Their Diversity Programming After All
## Thus far, all firms that Blum has sued have bowed to his desires to essentially eliminate their DEI employment policies.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

If we learn of a law firm that has a policy similar to the ones we sued and they have not changed it, and a plaintiff wants to apply for that position who is disqualified because of their race, we will file a lawsuit against that law firm.

— Conservative legal activist Edward Blum of the American Alliance for Equal Rights, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/12/21/is-edward-blum-done-suing-law-firms/) on his recent spate of lawsuits filed against Biglaw firms over their diversity fellowships. All law firms that were sued revised their DEI fellowships to remove race as a factor, leading to the lawsuits being dropped. “If that [using “racial preferences”] is forbidden in higher education then I think most law firms have recognized that other entities outside of higher education that use racial classifications and preferences to achieve diversity are suspect,” Blum said. “That’s the whole ball of energy behind what has happened with the law firms.”

# Am Law 100 Firm Slashing Salaries And Furloughing Staff
## Revenue shortfalls are no joke.

The COVID-19 austerity measures continue to spread through Biglaw. The uncertainty of dealing with the global pandemic has impacted nearly every facet of our society, and the legal profession has been far from immune.

Nelson Mullins, the Biglaw firm that captured the [#68 spot on the 2020 Am Law 100 ranking](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/04/21/the-2020-am-law-100-ranked-by-gross-revenue/#), is the latest firm that has implemented cost-cutting measures. According to multiple tipsters, the firm is anticipating revenue shortfalls. Though they worked on reducing expenses, the firm still needed additional measures.

Ultimately, Nelson Mullins settled on a salary cut system that might result in an associate being “made whole” by the end of the year. A tipster described the salary cut scheme ([the firm email on the subject is available on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/nelson-mullins-cuts/2/)):

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Nelson Mullins (2019’s fastest growing AmLaw 100 firm) associates will have a temporary 9% salary reduction per annum (ie ~13.5% gross reduction per remaining paycheck) starting with May 15 paycheck and going through December. Good news is that associates who meet collections goal will “earn” their reduction (aka “holdback”) back within a month of meeting their collection goal. (Nelson Mullins has long had a collections goal in addition to an hours goal. Collection and hours goals must be met by Nov. 30th.) Further, this is separate from bonuses that are given annually for meeting collections and hours goals. Thus, if I meet all my goals, I could get two large paychecks in December.

But, you know, associates have virtually no able to influence collections, so associates can’t really do much more than bill and cross their fingers that clients pay:

On the other hand, in this climate, fewer associates will be able to meet their collection goals even if they bill like crazy–clients are just going to take longer to pay. And associates have little to no agency re collections.

Plus staff has been told they will be furloughed for a week of their choosing between June 1 and September 30. ([Firmwide email on staff furloughs available on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/nelson-mullins-cuts/2/))
