# Am Law 100 Firm Slashes Salaries But Hopes To Avoid Layoffs
## Salary cuts are spreading through Biglaw.

The COVID-19 austerity measures that are tearing their way through Biglaw have claimed another firm. This time it is Crowell & Moring, who made $401,074,000 in gross revenue in 2018, making the firm 95th on the Am Law 100 ranking.

So here’s the scoop: there will be salary cuts at the firm, with the top echelons of the firm taking the biggest hit. Equity partners will take a 25 percent compensation cut, income partners will see their paycheck cut by 20 percent, associates and counsel are seeing a 15 percent cut, and staff who make $100,000+, which the firm estimates is about a third of staff members, will see cuts in the range of 5 to 20 percent.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Philip T. Inglima, chair of Crowell & Moring, had the following statement on the austerity measures:

Crowell & Moring is in very good financial health, with a balanced array of practices and revenue streams. Over the past month, we swiftly transitioned our people to an almost entirely remote work environment, as we continued meeting our clients’ needs, including those that have arisen from the COVID-19 pandemic.

We are taking prudent and responsible steps to keep our firm strong as we, and our clients, navigate the economic uncertainty and challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to aggressively managing all expenses that we can forgo or defer, we will postpone distributions and adjust partner draw levels for the months ahead in 2020. We also will institute tiered compensation reductions for all non-partner attorneys, as well as a segment of our professional and administrative team, for the balance of the year. These adjustments avoid any lay-offs and mean that two-thirds of our staff are spared any reduction in compensation.

We are positioning our firm to meet our current and anticipated financial and operational needs and to keep our team intact. We look forward to returning to our prior compensation practices as soon as possible.

These proactive steps are consistent with what every business must do during this unprecedented time: contain costs and expand cash resources to weather the storm. By taking these actions now, we are confident that we will be able to continue providing outstanding service to our clients and to support our people. We will get through this challenging time together.

Points to Inglima for coming right out and saying the cuts should be enough to avoid layoffs. It’s awful when firms realize [their first round of austerity measures weren’t enough to save jobs.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-announces-attorney-layoffs-and-furloughs/) Here’s hoping Crowell can avoid layoffs.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# Former Associate Gets Jail Time In Biglaw Extortion Case
## White-collar crimes have consequences.

Michael Potere

The[ curious case](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/biglaw-associate-arrested-over-plot-to-extort-partners/) of Michael Potere has reached its conclusion — or at least the sentencing phase.

For those who haven’t been following along with the former Dentons associate’s case, buckle in — it’s a doozy. You see, Potere got fired from the mega firm, but instead of taking his three months’ severance and trying to figure out the next stage of his career, he allegedly threw it all away on a harebrained scheme to extort the partnership.

Potere received access to a partner’s email account when he was working on a case and he took that opportunity to download sensitive information about the firm. He then met with two partners and threatened to leak that info to none other than Above the Law — unless he got $210,000 and a piece of artwork.

The justification for what he attempted? “[P]eople his age were getting ‘screwed’ and that hypothetically he might have a chance to ‘screw back.'”

Though, according to the FBI, he [bragged](https://www.dailyjournal.com/) at the time he wasn’t scared of jail time for his actions against the firm, saying “people who rape other people do not get jail time so [he] is not worried about jail time for [his] actions against [the firm].”

Let’s just say U.S. District Judge John Walter feels differently.

Potere [took a plea deal](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/fired-associate-takes-plea-deal-in-biglaw-extortion-charge/) to avoid facing charges that carried a penalty of up to 20 years in prison. But that doesn’t mean Judge Walter let him off easy. Though prosecutors had asked for only a three-month prison sentence, Walter handed down a five-month term, with one year of supervised release, noting that white-collar crimes should carry “meaningful punishment.” As [reported by](https://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/1003993/breaking-ex-dentons-atty-charged-in-extortion-plot-gets-5-months) Law360:

At an hourlong sentencing hearing Monday morning, U.S. District Judge John Walter said that while Potere does have a history of anxiety and depression, his conduct appeared to be carefully thought out and stem from anger management issues. The judge also said of Potere’s 13-page letter to the court describing his state of mind at the time of the criminal acts that he found Potere’s attempts at justification “arrogant” and even delusional.

“He should’ve realized there would be consequences,” Judge Walter said.

# Biglaw Firm All About The Plaintiffs' Side Now
## Bold change for a mega firm.

You don’t expect to hear of a giant multinational law firm making the pivot to plaintiffs-side work —- particularly not the firm that tops the Am Law 100 list with the most revenue. But here Kirkland & Ellis is announcing last week that they’re “doubling down” on contingency cases on behalf of plaintiffs.

As [reported by ](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/07/10/kirkland-makes-push-for-plaintiffs-side-contingency-cases/)Law.com the mega firm is looking to do 10x the plaintiffs work:

“We’re betting on ourselves now,” said partner James Hurst. “Truly doubling down.”

On Wednesday, the firm announced it is launching a plaintiffs-side trial group, aiming to “increase by ten-fold or more the number of contingency cases we’re taking on,” Hurst said.

Kirkland says they aren’t focusing on slip and fall cases, natch, but they aren’t even targeting securities or whistleblower cases. Instead, the firm is zeroing in on complex litigation cases:

“We took a look at the historical results we’ve achieved on the plaintiffs side over the last one or two decades for plaintiffs, and we’ve had some huge wins,” said partner Andrew Kassof (above, right), who co-led the team that represented Tronox Litigation Trust in winning $14 billion in damages in 2013 against Kerr-McGee in a fraudulent conveyance suit.

Their conclusion: “We don’t think law firms need to stay so firmly on one side of the ’v’ or the other,” Kassof said. “We want to align our incentives with our clients, and put the full breadth of the resources of the firm behind it. If we don’t come through, the clients don’t have to pay.”

Kirkland thinks such a massive Biglaw firm taking such a high-profile step away from the billable hour could be “disruptive” for the market. Only time will tell if this can truly change Biglaw’s dependence on the billable hour.

# Quinn Emanuel Is Out With Its Detailed Bonus Matrix

This is bonus week at Quinn Emanuel, where there’s a lot of money on the table for folks. But you may need a calculator to figure out what Quinn associates are getting relative to the market.

It all goes back to the [special bonuses the firm issued in October](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/quinn-emanuel-announces-special-fall-bonuses/), placing the associates a bit ahead of the game even before this round. So let’s check out what they’ve announced now.



On its face, the matrix requires associates to bill between 2100-2399 hours just to get back to level with the rest of the market. But in actuality, those associates are already ahead based on October. Let’s do a little math to see where everyone really is by adding October and December.

Class	2000-2099	2100-2399	2400-2699	2700+

So it’s not as bleak as it looks at first blush, but if someone is working at Quinn they do appear to have to get over 2100 hours to keep up with their compatriots at other firms. Though they can really get ahead if they are substantially over.

But the real moral of the story is “Quinn needs to hire people who understand round numbers.”

# Two Elite Biglaw Firms Handing Out New COVID Bonuses To Hardworking Staff
## Money is the best way to say thank you!

Woohoo! This is what we like to see! Two global Biglaw firms, Clifford Chance and Herbert Smith Freehills, recently announced all staff worldwide will be getting an extra special thank you in the form of cold, hard cash. The standard at both firms is 5 percent of salary, and is in addition to the usual yearly bonus process.

As [reported by](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-clifford-chance-gives-all-staff-covid-bonus-hard-work-following-herbies) RollOnFriday, Herbert Smith Freehills made the first move:

Earlier this week, Herbert Smith Freehills also announced that it would provide an additional 5% bonus to all staff. CEO Justin D’Agostino said the payment is an acknowledgement of the “dedication and hard work” of staff “in the face of the tremendous disruption and challenges experienced in the last year.”

“The firm is performing well so far this year. In recognition of that, we will be paying all staff globally a one-off financial payment of 5 per cent of salary, payable in March,” said D’Agostino. “I am delighted that all our people will be sharing in our good performance.” In July last year, the firm posted a rise of 2.5% in revenues to £989.9m.

But Magic Circle firm Clifford Chance was quick to join in the bonus fun:

“Over an extraordinary year, and in the face of sometimes immense personal challenges, our people have consistently gone the extra mile to support our clients and to support each other,” CC’s Global Managing Partner Matthew Layton told RollOnFriday. “I could not be prouder of our team here at Clifford Chance.”

Let’s hope other Biglaw firms will also be generous with staff.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonuses) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonuses”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Biglaw Firm Wastes No Time Kissing Up To New Democrat Judges In Texas
## This is the kind of Biglaw service clients are paying for.

Beto O’Rourke didn’t win his Senate race in Texas. Don’t be too sad, he’s a white man who lost, so Democrats will probably nominate him to run for president.

Despite losing, O’Rourke’s coattails helped a lot of other people win. Notably for this space, Texas Democrats were able to win a bunch of judicial elections in places where Texas Democrats usually aren’t even competitive. Texas’s Fifth Judicial District, which hadn’t elected a Democratic judge for 19 years, elected eight Dems, flipping party control of that court.

Electing Democrats for the first time since before 9/11 is bound to cause some ripples in the Texas legal market. Texas is the most important state when it comes to oil and gas regulation, especially given that the country is now run by anti-environment de-regulators who are confident that they will be long dead before their children and grandchildren have to pay the cost for environmental destruction.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The Biglaw firm of Haynes and Boone is wasting no time cozying up to the new judges. Here’s an email that went around the firm this weekend:



That’s just good client services. I’m being serious. Haynes and Boone has clients who will have business in front of these new judges. Haynes and Boone probably hasn’t spent a lot of time ingratiating itself to Democrat judges. This is just how you make a freaking sausage.

Haynes and Boone isn’t doing anything particularly wrong. What would be wrong would be if these judges took the Haynes and Boone money, and gave the firm’s lawyers favorable treatment going forward. Oh, no judge will admit to such corrupt thoughts. But… it’s worth pointing out that Beto O’Rourke, the man to whom these judges likely owe their positions, took no corporate money during his campaign.

# Law Firms Should Go All Out When Planning Holiday Parties
## People might judge a firm based on how awesome their holiday party is.

Before starting my own practice about four years ago, I worked at several different law firms. Each of the shops I worked at had a holiday party, and each firm spent varying amounts of money to throw such events. One of the firms at which I worked had a holiday party at a country club — a really swanky affair. Another one of the law firms I worked at had a holiday party at a bar, which must have cost much less money. Still another shop held its holiday parties at restaurants, which afforded a solid atmosphere. Although holiday parties may cost thousands of dollars that could go into the pockets of partners, law firms should consider going all out when throwing holiday parties.

Perhaps the main reason why law firms should host an incredible holiday party is that it can be crucial to developing a law firm culture and connecting attorneys and staff to the firm. People who work at a law firm rarely interact with each other outside of an office. Most of the time attorneys and staff see each other, it is in the rigid environment of an office. A law firm holiday party might be the only time each year that attorneys and staff interact in a more casual setting, and this can be crucial to forging connections that can be important when completing work and forming an attachment to a firm.

One often-underrated reason for hosting a law firm holiday party is that it can be the perfect occasion for firm alumni to mingle and reconnect with people who they used to work with. I have discussed in previous articles how law firm alumni can be powerful when developing business, building connections within the legal profession, and for other reasons. When people leave law firms, they often go in-house, enter the judiciary, or pursue a number of vocations that can all be helpful to a law firm if they are able to keep contacts alive.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
In my experience, it is common for law firm alumni to attend law firm holiday parties if the alumni do not have scheduling conflicts. Indeed, I distinctly remember meeting my predecessor at a firm during that shop’s law firm holiday party, and this person was welcomed back by all of the partners. It was great to talk to this person about issues we both faced, and I am pretty sure that this alumni of the firm threw some work to his old bosses if he could not handle the work himself in his new role. With all of the responsibilities people have, it might be difficult to invest time in law firm alumni or host a dedicated event for these individuals. However, by hosting a law firm holiday party, law firms can not only create a great event for people who currently work at a shop, but can also have a way to reconnect with lawyers who have left a firm for other jobs.

Lastly, holding an epic holiday party can be a source of pride for some law firms. People who work at a shop, and even those who do not work at a firm and only hear about the holiday party, might judge a firm based on how awesome their holiday party is.

For instance, there is a plaintiffs’ firm in my area with many people at a shop where I worked interacted. This firm apparently had an epic holiday party each year, and everyone wanted to be invited to the party and swapped stories of the crazy things that happened at the event.

Even within a firm, past epic holiday parties can be a source of pride for partners. I once worked at a shop that had seen better years in prior decades since the partners were close to retirement, and the law firm had been downsizing. The partners glowingly talked about past holiday parties, including an event that took place at Windows on the World, an amazing restaurant and event complex that occupied the top floors of the North Tower of the World Trade Center. If law firms throw an epic event, it can be something they might be proud of for decades, and this is worth the expense of hosting such an event.

Apologies for publishing this article so late in the holiday season! Since holiday parties are already occurring, law firms likely cannot heed the advice in this article during the current holidays. However, when it comes to planning law firm holiday parties, shops should consider investing in such events since it can yield dividends in how it positively impacts law firm culture.

# Baker Botts Rolls Back COVID Cuts, And Makes Another Round Of Special Bonuses

I don’t know about you, but I could sure use some good news. I don’t expect an election result, well, any time today, so how about some Biglaw news? Like maybe a Biglaw firm doing an about face on COVID austerity measures and throwing in some extra bonuses for good measure.

Thanks for the election news reprieve Baker Botts.

After previously announcing [a plan of “collective sacrifice” t](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/baker-botts-cuts/)o get through the global health crisis, Baker Botts changed course.[ In July](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/baker-botts-bonuses/), the salary cuts — 20 to 30 percent based on salary level for counsel, 20 percent for associates, and 0 to 20 percent based on salary level for staff — were reduced by 50 percent (at the associate level, that made it just 10 percent). And now the firm has announced, that effective November 1st, the entirely of the COVID salary cuts will be reversed.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
What’s more, when announcing the July rollbacks, they also did a round of interim bonuses for the May 1 – July 31 period. In announcing this rollback, there is another round of bonuses in the offing:

As mentioned in prior announcements, we will also be awarding interim bonuses to non-partner timekeepers who have made exceptional contributions over the past months. Bonus eligibility will be determined based on a number of factors, including utilization and exemplary client service, for the August 1 – October 31 period, as recorded in adherence with the Firm’s time entry policy and deadlines.  To be eligible for this interim bonus, which will be paid before year-end, timekeepers must be in good standing and actively employed at the Firm on the date of payment.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm announces any type of bonus payment for associates, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonuses) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonuses”).

# World's Largest Law Firm Announces Special Bonuses
## Finally! Associates are very happy right now.

The spring 2021 special bonus trend officially started on Friday, March 19, 2021, when [Willkie](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/willkie-spring-bonuses-2021/) offered associates between $7,500 and $40,000. Willkie’s generosity was quickly [one-upped by Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/) on Monday, March 22, 2021, when the firm announced it would be offering bonuses ranging from $12,000 and $64,000. It’s been more than a month, and now the world’s largest law firm has finally decided to weigh in on bonuses.

Good things come to those who wait, and Dentons — a firm with almost 11,000 lawyers spread across the globe, with most of them situated in the U.S. — announced yesterday that they’d be matching market bonuses for associates. Here’s what the bonus scale looks like at the firm:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
To receive a full bonus, associates must meet 2,000 creditable billable hours by the end of the year, and those who hit 2,250 hours or more will be entitled to a bit of a bonus boost. Only associates on track to hit their minimum hours will receive bonus money. As noted above, a separate, smaller bonus scale will apply for associates located in Honolulu, Kansas City, and St. Louis. Bonuses will be paid out in July 2021 and January 2022. Congratulations to everyone at Dentons!

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks for all of your help!

# Mandating COVID-19 Vaccines? Biglaw Leaders Seem Wary Of Pushing The Issue Before Reopening Offices
## Instead, many firms will be encouraging employees to get the vaccine.

My personal opinion is we all should be vaccinated. I’m concerned if we mandate it at this point, you will force that conflict to center stage. Also, we are in a position that everyone who wants a vaccine hasn’t had that opportunity. There are a lot of opinions about this.

— [John Hensien](https://www.clarkhill.com/people/john-p-hensien), chief executive officer of Detroit-based Clark Hill, commenting on his firm’s plans to [encourage COVID-19 vaccination](https://www.law.com/2021/05/12/firm-leaders-trying-to-find-a-middle-ground-in-covid-19-vaccine-debate-as-in-person-work-resumes/) but not mandate it. Many firms are struggling with this issue as they plan the reopenings of their offices following a prolonged period of working from home due to the pandemic. As [Keith Fullenweider](https://www.velaw.com/people/keith-fullenweider/), incoming chairman of Vinson & Elkins noted, because there are “many opinions” on the vaccine, his firm is “trying to find a middle ground, first looking at safety [and] making sure people aren’t pushed into any situation.”

What does it take to cultivate job satisfaction at a law firm? In a new report from BTI Consulting, associates pointed out exactly what they wanted from and valued in their work lives, and which firms were the best at committing to their overall happiness.

According to BTI, Biglaw associates are looking for these eight core activities from their firms when it comes to their professional happiness:

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
- Commitment to helping associates in their career
- Specific action to help develop a career path
- Access to training they need
- Good mentoring
- Optimism about growing within their firm
- High levels of job satisfaction
- Being well paid
- Having at least one partner watching out for them
After going evaluating 4,000 responses, BTI found that 147 Biglaw firms did the best job when it came to associate satisfaction. Unfortunately, it turns out that women aren’t nearly as satisfied at their Biglaw firms. When separated by gender, women associates ranked just 122 firms as the best for overall job satisfaction. In fact, women rated their job satisfaction as 13.5 percentage points lower than that of their male counterparts, and 62% of them saw their firms imparting “limited or no commitment to helping them in their careers” (compared to 48% of men). Oof.

Today, we’re going to take a look at the thing that makes the world go ’round: money. According to BTI, just 16% of women associates consider themselves well paid; in fact, 50% consider themselves extremely underpaid. Above the Law has tracked [raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-raise-tracker-2022/) and [bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/biglaw-bonus-tracker-2021/) for years, but there’s much more to compensation than just a dollar amount. For women in Biglaw, it’s not just the money — it’s about their workload, the level of respect they receive, predictability, and more. Here’s what BTI evaluated:

Associates rely on a subjective formula to evaluate how well they are paid. This formula includes salary, bonus, competitive norms, hours of work expected, hybrid work policies, perceived control over working hours, treatment by partners, feedback, and the opportunity they see for themselves within the firm. Market rate salaries are minimum expectations.

That said, women associates singled out 46 law firms that were able to offer a “winning comp combination,” but these 13 firms were identified as the best of the best when it comes to all matters of compensation:

- Armstrong Teasdale
- Baker Donelson
- Choate
- Debevoise & Plimpton
- Faegre Drinker
- Fenwick & West
- Finnegan
- Goldberg Segalla
- Greenberg Traurig
- Hunton Andrews Kurth
- Milbank
- Sullivan & Cromwell
- Wilson Elser
Congratulations to each of these firms. When market money is just the baseline, providing women associates with a better quality of life will get your firm a boost when it comes to overall “compensation.” Great work!

# How Have Millennials Changed Law Firm Culture? 
## We want to know about these lawyers’ priorities.

As the oldest millennials turn 40 this year — and more of them become law firm partners — we’re once again [taking our annual look](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6EayshZZjGVlJ5Q) at this generation of lawyers. 

In partnership with our friends at Major Lindsey & Africa, we want to particularly delve into the dynamics of how millennials continue to affect legal industry culture. 

Starting today, we are running a series of [quick surveys](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6EayshZZjGVlJ5Q) intended to capture the viewpoint of younger lawyers and help determine what differentiates them from both their (non-attorney) generational peers and their older colleagues.

[Today’s survey](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6EayshZZjGVlJ5Q) concerns the workplace priorities of millennials, covering topics as varied as diversity and inclusion, mentorship, and work-life balance.

Please take a couple of minutes and tell us what you think. (Please note we are not exclusively interested in hearing from millennials; lawyers of all ages are encouraged to [take the survey](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6EayshZZjGVlJ5Q).)

# Biglaw Mergers Off To A Hot Start In 2023
## Does your firm have the urge to merge?

As far as law firm mergers are concerned, 2023 is off to an action-packed start.

According to a recently released report from legal consultancy Fairfax Associates, there were as many large law firm mergers completed during this year’s first quarter than in all of 2022 combined. Fairfax characterizes “large mergers” as those where both law firms have at least 100 lawyers each. Last year, the only large law firm mergers completed were between Arent Fox and Schiff Hardin, and Taft Stettinius & Hollister and Jaffe Raitt Heuer & Weiss.

[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/big-law-firms-quicker-merge-2023-so-far-report-shows-2023-04-03/) has the details on the large law firm mergers that have taken place in 2023 thus far:

So far this year 1,400-lawyer Holland & Knight merged with 257-lawyer Waller Lansden Dortch & Davis in March, and 1,050-lawyer Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe combined with 100-lawyer Buckley in February. …

Smith, Gambrell & Russell, a 285-lawyer firm, also just completed a merger with 110-lawyer firm Freeborn & Peters. That deal was set to close March 1 during the first quarter, but the firms said in a Monday statement they completed the combination April 1.

The merger between large Southeastern firms Maynard Cooper & Gale and Nexsen Pruet just missed the first quarter cutoff, as the firms combined on April 1 to create Maynard Nexsen.

Not to be forgotten, of course, are the proposed large law firm mergers that flopped in the first quarter. Those include failed talks between Shearman & Sterling and Hogan Lovells, as well as failed talks between Womble Bond Dickinson and UK firm BDB Pitmans.

Which Biglaw firms will be the next to combine? We can’t wait to see if the rest of the year is as successful for mergers as the first quarter was.

# What To Expect From Complex Litigation Through Discovery
## Complex litigation can feel more manageable with an understanding of how it works and how to prepare.

Hardly a day goes by without reading news coverage of a major lawsuit. While the stories about litigation may distill these disputes into easy-to-understand facts and claims for general consumption, the reality is that litigation — especially between large companies — is usually a highly complex affair.

High-stakes litigation can involve massive volumes of relevant materials in a party’s possession, custody, or control. Before a company and its lawyers are fully immersed in litigation, it’s critical to understand and manage the scope of those materials. 

PLI’s One-Hour Briefing, [The Do’s and Don’ts of Complex Litigation: An Overview of an Action Through Discovery](https://www.pli.edu/programs/the-dos-and-donts-of-complex-litigation--an-overview-of-an-action-through-discovery?t=live), will highlight the key issues of complex corporate litigation through the discovery phase. A panel of litigation experts from major corporations and top law firms will give an overview of how to approach complex litigation and what attorneys and parties should expect in the process, including:

- An introduction to what complex litigation is and the issues it might present
- How to create a “game plan” for preserving discoverable information going into complex litigation
- The importance of certain activities governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, such as the Rule 26(f) meeting and the 16(f) scheduling order, as well as the topics that should be considered in preparing for these activities
- Tips for conducting fact and expert discovery
- What “pause points” are in connection with resolution or other considerations and how to determine if you need them
Complex litigation can feel more manageable with an understanding of how it works and how to prepare. [Register](https://www.pli.edu/programs/the-dos-and-donts-of-complex-litigation--an-overview-of-an-action-through-discovery?t=live) for the program today to learn more.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

# Davis Polk Confirms That We're In The Twilight Of The Lockstep Firm
## Another firm transitions away from full lockstep compensation.

For decades, one marker of a truly prestigious law firm was a commitment to lockstep partner compensation based on seniority. It reflected a “one-firm” philosophy that every partner’s practice contributed to the overall success of the firm and that long-term partnership buy-in was a mark of strength. Firms that allowed partners to “eat what they killed” could collect high-quality talent, but clients looking to build a relationship with a firm that would stand the test of time could look to the lockstep firms as paragons of top-notch stability. There’s a reason why there are bigger firms and there are more profitable firms but we still deploy a special reverence when discussing Cravath and Debevoise.

Davis Polk was also on that ever-shrinking list, but Bloomberg Law reports that yesterday [the firm decided to tweak its lockstep formula](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/elite-wall-street-firm-davis-polk-moves-to-modified-lockstep-pay):

“The firm is strategically focused on measured growth and we are cognizant of the market environment in which we find ourselves,” said Davis Polk managing partner Neil Barr in an interview with Bloomberg Law.

“We ultimately concluded that our existing compensation structure, which paid partners solely on the basis of seniority, was simply not compatible with our strategic designs going forward.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
It’s not like Davis Polk is going to stop being one of the world’s elite law firms and transition into a firm of fiefdoms. Lockstep competition is still at the root of the new model. Rather it’s a recognition that the world is changing. To the extent anyone had trouble reading the writing on the wall, circumstances sandblasted off the rust when Cleary Gottlieb, another of the old-school lockstep firms, [lost a rainmaking team to Freshfields last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/major-lateral-moves-its-open-season-on-cleary-partners/). It’s a competitive market out there and lawyers at the front end of the seniority curve have few incentives to stick around and wait for the big rewards that lockstep offers down the road when a growth-oriented firm is prepared to evaluate and compensate talent as it comes. Offering some modifications allows Davis Polk to be more competitive in seeking out and retaining young stars unwilling to wait to reap the benefits of the value they have today.

When it comes right down to it, this is still a service industry and client philosophies have changed. A generation-spanning relationship of trust with a lockstep firm isn’t as much of a priority when clients can micromonitor their matters and shop legal work around to find the best deal — with [most aiming to work with a handful of law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/in-house-counsel-are-both-unconcerned-about-new-privacy-laws-and-completely-unprepared-for-new-privacy-laws/) rather than one or two relationships covering the wide gamut of matters. And firms need to meet clients where they are.

That’s not to say that something isn’t lost as the lockstep model wanes. I’ve said before that one of the reasons I chose to work at Cleary out of law school was the lockstep worldview. Lockstep at the top bred the culture of a shared endeavor. Resources weren’t hoarded internally and associates weren’t placed in an immediate scramble to lock down a spot in the orbit of the “right” partner to advance their career. It also mattered to me that the vagaries of the business cycle didn’t drive the firm — corporate is bringing in all the money one day and then a recession shifts the balance to bankruptcy and groups didn’t need to worry that they’d get trimmed because everyone knew that these rough patches were why the leadership agreed to get paid equal shares in good years and bad. Lockstep may exist for the benefit of the partnership but it’s a model that really did trickle down.

But it’s also a little like complaining that sports aren’t as “good” as they were before free agency. The bargain of pure lockstep was a career where everyone gets theirs eventually. But with two economic freefalls in 12 years, it’s unreasonable to ask a partner sitting on substantial business to wait their turn. Maybe someday we’ll find a model that balances the benefits of lockstep with the realities of the free agency period in partner books.

More than eight years ago (heaven help me), I published [A Partner’s Lament](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/12/inside-straight-a-partners-lament/) — a column about why life at law firms may actually get worse as one moves up through the partnership ranks.

A couple of weeks ago, I had lunch with a non-equity partner at a major firm, who’s now looking for an in-house job.  And what was his (or her) story?  The partner’s lament.

The more things change, the more they stay the same.

This person was appreciated when he (or she) was a junior partner.  He did good work.  He was in demand.  He stayed busy.

And then he (or she) aged.

Unless you learn how to develop significant business, that’s a problem.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
In law firms, you can’t ask for help from people who (1) practice in your field and (2) are senior to you.

If you’re 55, you can ask a 40-year-old to help.  If you’re 40, you can ask a 33-year-old to help.  But if you’re 55, you simply can’t ask a 57-year-old to help (except in the very largest of matters).  Lateraling up looks bad.  It isn’t done.  And it’s always possible the client will ask why you’re bailing out of the case and getting someone else to handle it for you.

By the time you’re older than the average person bringing in business, you’re no longer in demand.  Doing good work is no longer enough.  Unless you generate business, you’ll no longer be able to stay busy.

My lunch companion had all the usual complaints:  “I brought in a big overseas investigation!  I thought the firm would make me an equity partner!  And then the firm hired a new lateral partner.  The firm suggested the new partner assist me on the investigation.  Soon, the client was asking why we had two senior people working on the same case.  The client wanted only one — and the client picked the other person.  I lost my own client.”

And:  “The firm always picks the same people to appear at beauty contests.  I’m not on the list.  So the firm’s doing nothing to promote my career.  It’s just too hard to survive in an environment like this.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And the clincher:  “I think things have changed since you left law firm life 10 years ago.”

Things may have changed.  But not in the ways you’re talking about.

Because I wrote [The Partner’s Lament](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/12/inside-straight-a-partners-lament/) eight years ago, and you’re singing from that very hymnal.

I explained to my lunch companion:  “People at law firms haven’t gotten sharper elbows.  You’ve just aged.  The firm used to appreciate your good legal work.  The firm doesn’t appreciate that anymore, because of your age.  Now, the firm appreciates only your capacity to develop business.  The firm bestows business on some people; the firm hands down institutional clients or grooms some partners to take charge.  But you’re obviously not one of those lucky few, and the firm plainly doesn’t view you as one of the people it should present to clients.  So you’re on your own: You can figure out a way to develop business without the firm’s help — or maybe despite the firm’s efforts to handicap you.  You can move to another firm or an in-house job, if it’s available.  Or you can struggle on, unappreciated (but still handsomely paid, compared to the average Joe) through retirement.  Those are the choices.”

That’s the reality for most partners at most large firms.

The average partner at an above-average firm is being paid far less than the firm’s “profits per partner.”  As I’ve [written before](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/10/you-wont-get-the-money/), 70 percent of equity partners at large firms receive less than a firm’s average profits per partner.  That’s required as a matter of arithmetic, but it’s also compelled by the way firms operate.

A very few people are anointed.  Some bring in business with institutional help; some bring in business without institutional help; those people run the joint.

Everyone else survives, perhaps feeling as though they’re doing battle with the institution.  As one big firm partner said:  “There are three kinds of lawyers at this firm:  the associates, the partners, and the owners.”

“The owners” is a very small group indeed.

Most partners never get there, and it’s why life for partners who are not significant rainmakers may get worse as partners age.

# Biglaw And Boutique Law Firms Are Bringing In Big Bucks From Democrats And Republicans
## Which firms are leading the pack this election season?

With election season looming, Democrats and Republicans alike have opened their wallets to pay Biglaw and boutique firms millions upon millions of dollars for their services, ranging from standard campaign finance regulatory and compliance advice to all manner of litigation related to voting rights and election laws.

But which law firms have taken home the most money so far?

The [National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2023/09/11/these-law-firms-are-the-top-paid-counsel-for-republican-and-democratic-national-committees/) recently published a roundup of the Biglaw and boutique firms that have served as legal counsel to Democratic and Republican national committees, and boy, have these firms taken in a ton of money. Here are some of the details, courtesy of the NLJ:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, Elias Law Group, and Perkins Coie have been the top-paid law firms by the Democratic National Committee in the first half of the year, while the Republican National Committee has turned to Consovoy McCarthy, McGuireWoods, and Wiley Rein, according to Federal Election Commission records from January through the end of July. Meanwhile, Jones Day has been a top recipient of the GOP’s congressional and Senate committees.

The DNC has paid $732,246 to Wilmer, $613,209 to Elias Law Group and $481,570 to Perkins Coie, according to FEC records from January through July. For its part, the RNC has paid $1.3 million to Consovoy McCarthy, $856,236 to McGuireWoods, and $417,277 to Wiley Rein in the same time period.

While the DNC recently cut ties with Marc Elias in a disagreement over his legal strategies, his firm remains the one of the top-paid firms by the Democrats. In fact, the firm is raking in money for work done for the fundraising arms of the Democratic House and Senate, with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee paying the firm $3.2 million, and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee paying the firm $1.4 million.

On the flip side of the political spectrum, we’ve got some familiar Biglaw and boutique heavy-hitters representing Republican interests. While Jones Day has stepped away from Trump, the firm has remained close to its Republican friends in government, having been paid more than $2.5 million by the NRSC and $179,191 by the NRCC. Consovoy McCarthy — the firm that recently had a hand in doing away with affirmative action — is bringing in tons of Republican dollars, with the National Republican Senatorial Committee paying $500,000, on top of the RNC’s $1.3 million.

We’ll see what these figures look like when we get closer to Election 2024, but we wouldn’t be surprised if the final tallies are even more eye-popping than they are now.

# Raises -- But No Bonuses -- To Get You In The Celebratory Spirit
## Raises and no bonuses are better than no raises and no bonuses.

It was nearly a month ago — June 4th, to be precise — when [Milbank announced raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) for its associates, kicking off the summer of money. Not to be outdone, Simpson Thacher[ announced special summer bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/) for all associates, ranging from $5,000 – $25,000 depending on seniority. Then Cravath asserted its dominance,[ slightly raising the market standard for senior associates’ base salary](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/). The[ majority of the Biglaw](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises-2018/) — well, at least the elite firms — has gotten on board with this standard, which the firms made effective July 1st. But just because the effective date of the raises has passed, it doesn’t mean firms are done announcing raises — and what perfect news before getting a well-deserved day off in celebration of the 4th of July.

Take Sheppard Mullin. This firm [ranks 47th in Biglaw profitability and 46th in profits per partner](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/by-any-metric-these-firms-really-should-have-raised-associate-compensation-by-now/?rf=1), and today they’ve finally decided to announce raises to associate base salaries, in line with the market standard:


But don’t get too excited — the firm has elected NOT to pay the special bonuses other firms are offering. They’re “comfortable” the firm offers more opportunities than competitor firms, and they’ll reevaluate their bonus amounts at year end:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The Executive Committee has decided not to pay the “summer bonuses” that some firms have announced. With this increase in salaries we are comfortable that our overall package is competitive. We are proud of the superior opportunities we provide to our Associates to have meaningful client contact, develop a practice, and make Partner — the pathway to build a rewarding career. That said, we will over the coming months evaluate our overall associate bonus program to ensure our total Associate offering remains competitive. And we will continue to recognize those required to work extraordinary hours on behalf our clients by paying 10% and 20% more than “market” year-end bonus amounts at the 2200 and 2400 hour levels.

Though the move puts the firm below overall market compensation, most tipsters just seem glad the firm has acted on the raises.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

# Demand For Corporate Work Expected To Drop By More Than 20% By Year's End

Today’s economically uncertain times have caused a great deal of unrest in the corporate world. There’s a constant barrage of conflicting reports coming out, and despite everything still being up in the air, the default setting for most businesses right now will be risk aversion.

It will be up to lawyers to instill confidence by guiding clients through the months and years ahead with accurate insights on economic activity, new legislation and regulations, and worthwhile growth opportunities.

— Dylan Brown, the editor of a new report by LexisNexis Legal & Professional, in a statement on how lawyers can handle the expected [continued decline in demand for corporate legal work](https://www.law360.com/legalindustry/articles/1537539/corporate-law-demand-expected-to-drop-22-by-end-of-year). According to the report, it’s predicted that demand for corporate work will drop by about 22% by the end of the year, compared with what demand looked like in 2021. The report also predicted that corporate work will rebound in 2023.

# Biglaw Firm Hands Out Raises -- For Some Associates
## No special bonuses at this firm...

Associate compensation is once again a hot topic in Biglaw. Special bonuses have made their way through the elite of Biglaw, and we are just waiting to see how much of the rest of the pack will match. One firm that isn’t handing out special bonuses is McGuireWoods — but they did manage to make (at least some) associates happy.

According to emails ([available in full on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/mcguirewoods-raises/2/)) send by firm management, they’re moving to a single compensation grid for associates in all offices. This means that associates in smaller markets are getting a raise, everyone else, not so much.

As a tipster at the firm notes:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
McGuireWoods is not doing special bonuses for 2021. Instead they are moving to full lockstep, “single salary scale for all associates across all US offices.” Great day for associates in small market cities…not exactly anything new for the rest of the associates…

The firm’s new scale is as follows:


Also of note, the firm is increasing their productivity bonus pool. Associates billing 2050 are eligible for up to twice as big of a bonus, and the amounts are increasing for all productivity categories.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus or raise news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Bar Complaint Filed Against Lawyer Representing Both Kanye And Trump Campaigns Because These Two Things Are Exactly The Same

Is it ethical to represent two different candidates for president in the same electoral cycle? Asking for [Lane Ruhland](https://www.huschblackwell.com/professionals/lane-ruhland) of Husch Blackwell, LLP, whose clients include both the Trump campaign and Kanye West’s [sham effort](https://www.forbes.com/sites/randalllane/2020/08/06/exclusive-kanye-west-indicates-that-his-spoiler-campaign-is-indeed-designed-to-hurt-biden/#6244c5436397) to peel off black voters from Joe Biden by getting his name on the ballot.

As [previously noted](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/donald-trumps-biglaw-attorney-is-helping-kanye-west-get-on-the-presidential-ballot/), Ruhland serves as counsel for Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. in its [suit](https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/trump-wjfw.pdf) to force tiny NBC affiliate in northern Wisconsin to yank a pro-Biden ad off the air.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Ruhland, whose [bio](https://www.huschblackwell.com/professionals/lane-ruhland) reports that she “enjoys helping clients navigate the intersection of law, politics and media awareness” should probably have realized that showing up in person to drop off those [hinky signatures](https://elections.wi.gov/sites/elections.wi.gov/files/2020-08/Challenge%20Complaint_Brent%20v.%20West.pdf) might garner some attention. The media was probably going to figure it out anyway, but appearing in public to all but announce she was working both sides of the street was probably not the “due diligence in this legal sector [which] must go beyond compliance and encompass campaign image” promised on the firm’s website. [Husch Blackwell told everyone there’s nothing to see here](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/biglaw-leaders-reassure-firm-that-representation-of-kanye-west-and-donald-trump-is-not-a-conflict-of-interest/).

But someone is doing their diligence, and it is the Campaign for Accountability, which filed a [bar complaint](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7031169-Campaign-for-Accountability-Ruhland-OLR.html) against Ruhland with the Wisconsin Office of Lawyer Regulation demanding an investigation into the conflict, which it characterizes as non-waivable.

Simultaneous legal representation of two candidates competing for the same office is a paradigmatic example of a conflict of interest. With limited and express exceptions, Rule 1.7 of the Rules of Professional Conduct for Attorneys, Supreme Court Rule 20, prohibits layers from representing a client “if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest.” A conflict is defined to include circumstances where “the representation of one client will be directly adverse to another client” or where “there is a significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by the client’s responsibilities to another client.” Rule 1.7(a).

The interests of Kanye West’s 2020 campaign for U.S. President are clearly adverse to the interests of Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., as both individuals cannot simultaneously obtain the office and hence legal steps that advance the interests on one candidacy harm the interests of the other candidacy.

CfA also notes Ruhland’s extensive work for the Wisconsin GOP and the Republican National Committee which raises “questions regarding whether she has personal commitments and interests inconsistent with zealously representing the interests of Kanye West’s presidential campaign.”

But NYU law professor Stephen Gillers disagrees, pointing out that the suit against the television station does not pertain to ballot access, and thus there is no inherent conflict.

“If West’s goal is to be a spoiler, not a serious candidate, there is no conflict at all,” Gillers [told](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/08/07/group-accuses-lawyer-working-trump-and-west-campaigns-simultaneously/3318242001/) the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in an email. “The candidates have the same goal — to help Trump get the votes by drawing votes from Biden.”

By which he means Black votes. So all Ruhland has to do to answer the charges is explain that she’s engaged in a cynical ploy to trick African Americans into throwing away their ballots on a spoiler candidate, and she’s home free!

[Complaints to keep Kanye West off Wisconsin ballot cite phony signatures, including from Mickey Mouse and Bernie Sanders](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/08/07/group-accuses-lawyer-working-trump-and-west-campaigns-simultaneously/3318242001/) [Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]

# December 1: The Date All 1Ls Who Want To Work In Biglaw Should Be Prepared For
## What does this date really mean in the legal recruiting cycle?

Having emerged from a Halloween-caused sugar coma, many 1Ls see that it is now November, meaning that December 1st will soon be upon them.  For those who are not dealing with the unique stress of being a first-year law student, the first day of the last month of the year (assuming that you abide by the Gregorian calendar) signals nothing more than a confirmation that you will be inundated with holiday muzak, wherever you go, for the foreseeable future.  But for 1Ls, December 1st is a vital date because it marks the beginning of the summer job search season — or the date when you should have submitted, preferably at 12:01 a.m., all of your job applications — or something else entirely.

When I hold my initial one-on-one meetings with 1Ls, no topic arises more frequently than that of December 1st and no topic is the source of more confusion for students.  By the time 1Ls come into my office, they have heard a mixture of truths, half-truths, and never-truths that bounce around the walls of the law school.

So, what does this date really mean in the legal recruiting cycle?

We’ll start by returning to a [familiar place](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/legal-recruiting-and-you-how-the-sausage-is-made/) for this column, National Association for Law Placement’s (NALP) Principles and Standards for Law Placement and Recruitment Activities.  In this case, the relevant section is Part V.D.2., which states:

Recognizing that opportunities to learn about professionalism, professional development, and the legal profession are appropriate early in law school and recognizing that law schools will differ as to whether and how to include prospective employers in career development activities, educational and professional development contact with 1Ls is permitted at any time at the discretion of the school.  Prospective employers and first-year law students, however, should not initiate contact with one another and employers should not initiate formal one-on-one recruiting contact with one another, including applications, interviews, or offers to first-year students, before December 1.  Appointments with candidates for interviews should be established for a mutually convenient time so as not to unduly disrupt candidates’ studies.

Does this mean your 1L summer job search has to be put on hold until the last of the leftover Thanksgiving turkey has been consumed?  No.  While the highest level of the U.S. government has seemingly [forgotten how to read the plain text of a provision](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/31/18047896/trump-supreme-court-birthright-citizenship), that does not mean we all have to follow suit.  A close read of V.D.2 reveals that 1Ls should[[1]](#_ftn1) not “initiate formal one-on-one recruiting contact” with firms.  But that merely means that a 1L cannot send in a formal application, i.e., a cover letter and résumé explicitly asking for a summer associate position.  Similarly, law firms cannot officially interview 1Ls for a summer position or extend offers until December 1st.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
So what can an enterprising 1L do between now and December 1st to put them in the best position to land a summer position?  Pretty much anything and everything.

During my time at Vanderbilt, I have come across students whose December 1st strategy is to have hundreds of applications sitting in their draft email folder, stay up until midnight on the 1st, and then click submit until they pass out from exhaustion.  This is not the best idea.



I often analogize this strategy to taking a giant fishing net and dragging it along the bottom of a river.  Yes, you might catch some fish, but you are also likely to catch some old license plates, or kitchen appliances, maybe even a rusted, abandoned car.  The 12:01 mass mailing strategy is also extraordinarily time intensive, and it is not as if the first year of law school is known for providing students with a lot of downtime.

So what should 1Ls be doing during the month of November?  First, do your research.  In the [first part](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-fall-recruiting-season-part-i/) of my award winning[[2]](#_ftn2) four-part series on Fall OCI, I discussed how rising 2Ls could research the firms coming on campus.  That advice applies for 1Ls as well.  Check out the [NALP Directory](https://www.nalpdirectory.com/) to find what firms hire 1Ls.  Read as much as you can on the firms which interest you.  Talk to the 2Ls and 3Ls about their experiences both getting a position at that firm (especially if it was as a 1L) and working there.  Second, network.  As noted above, Part V.D.2. only prohibits 1Ls from directly applying to a firm before December 1st.  This does not prohibit reaching out to attorneys at the firm and finding out more about the work they do and their path to the firm.  As noted in my previous [networking opus](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/you-gotta-network-to-get-work-baby/), reaching out to alumni of your law school is second only to having friends or family working at that firm.  Law firms are very big into advertising themselves — after all, everyone needs clients — so most firm websites will not only list all of their attorneys but also give you the opportunity to search by law school alma mater.  Rather than sending out 100 applications on December 1st, send out 100 emails during November to law school alumni practicing at the firms you which to work.  I can almost guarantee you that the latter will yield greater results.

An important caveat to this entire discussion is that the December 1st timeline only applies to NALP firms, i.e. Biglaw.  If you are interested in a summer position with a smaller firm, or something outside the firm context — which is advisable since most 1Ls will not get law firm summer associate positions — the application season is like the Wild West, there are no rules, apply at will.

While the December 1st timeline can often cause a lot of confusion among 1Ls, it is unnecessary.  Reviewing the NALP guidelines shows that while you cannot formally apply for a job until Thanksgiving is well behind us, there is much you can do to help you become one of the lucky few to be a 1L Biglaw summer associate.

[[1]](#_ftnref1) It is also important to note the use of the word “should” through this provision of the Principles and Standards.  While I would not recommend blatantly violating the guidelines NALP has set forth, at the end of the day, these are just recommendations.  There is no NALP police force that will arrest you for violations, nor a NALP judiciary to deprive you of your liberty.

[[2]](#_ftnref2) Self-given awards still count.

Obviously Trump’s biggest mistake with ACB involved causing a White House superspreader event, but we didn’t know that when we recorded this week’s show. So we spend some time talking about his other mistake — nominating ACB before the election and giving “never Trumpers” everything they want and leaving them with zero incentive to reelect him. We also discuss the wave of Fall bonuses among Biglaw firms and more importantly, the firms that aren’t joining the party and what it means for the legal landscape.

# Successful IP Associate Checklist: Breadth (Part I)
## Acquiring breadth of experience as an IP associate bears important fruit later in a lawyer’s career.

Checklists are important. Pilots (and their passengers) rely on them every time they fly. So do surgeons when performing even the most routine of operations. As with many things, however, a checklist is only as good as the person or people who put it together. A checklist created by an amateur pilot without deep and broad experience flying planes, for example, might be helpful to that pilot. But it would pale in comparison to a checklist created for taking off and landing a 777, created by an industry-wide consortium of expert pilots. In short, the value of a checklist is reflective of the expertise and thoughtfulness of those creating it.

In my experience, lawyers do not use checklists nearly enough. Perhaps because they are time-consuming to create. Nor are they easily delegated to associates to craft, except for perhaps the most mundane or routine tasks, like handling ECF filings in a particular court. Moreover, creating checklists runs counter to the familiar lawyer pretension that all matters are necessarily unique — thereby justifying static (and high), rather than variable, billable rates whenever the lawyer can get away with it. Either way, I have no desire to create a checklist in this series of columns. Instead, I want to encourage IP associates — particularly the newbies who may be starting work at their first post-law school firms over the next few weeks — to start thinking about what kinds of checklists a successful IP associate might aim to use.

To that end, it is helpful to consider what the true goals of a successful IP associate should be. Now that I am over a decade removed from my own time as an IP associate, I think the best articulation of what an IP associate (and any lawyer) should strive for was made by one of my own supervising partners, the inimitable and exacting [Barry Schindler ](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/professionals/s/schindler-barry-j)of Greenberg Traurig. He would often exclaim how important it was to learn how to do things right so “you know what you are doing when you are 40 years old.” A clear exhortation that I should do whatever I could to get both broad and deep experience in as many aspects of IP legal practice as possible, while I still had the guidance of more senior lawyers readily available.

At the same time, the built-in wisdom of that statement is in forcing associates to recognize that the lawyer they will be at 40 can and should be a much better version of the lawyer they are now. To get there, however, IP associates must be both curious and determined, as well as self-motivated. I have yet to see a firm where there is a genie doling out the “best experience” for each and every associate out at each step of every associate’s career. But that is okay, since it helps distinguish the associates actually cut out for long-term success in IP practice from their just-collecting-a-check compatriots. But before you can start planning how to achieve the goal of becoming a well-rounded IP associate, it is helpful to think a bit about the difference between broad and deep experience, while acknowledging how important getting both is in any successful legal field.

Let’s start with how to get broad experience — otherwise known as trying to get exposure to as wide a range of lawyers, clients, and legal matters as possible. We can discuss each in turn, but first a word of caution. It can be very frustrating to ambitious young lawyers when they don’t get the exposure they want to a breadth of matters. If you find yourself in that situation, try and remember a few things. One is that nothing lasts forever, and that good work on whatever you are stuck with will open up other opportunities later. Second, that you can and should always seize whatever control you can of your time to make sure you don’t get discouraged. So try and keep a side project — whether it is an article, research project, or whatever — going at all times. Heck, you can even create a checklist for the type of matter you are stuck on to help the next generation of unlucky souls stuck with a similar project.

Back to acquiring a breadth of experiences as an IP associate. We can assume you will seek them out, while keeping in mind that the words “I can help” carry disproportionate power at law firms. Start by taking an inventory of the partners in your group. Can you find a way to work with as many of them as possible? Expand that out over time to trying to work with partners in other offices (believe me that making a good impression on them is super important in partnership election discussions about you) and other practice groups. Grab opportunities to interact with other lawyers you are working with, whether they are local, co-, or even opposing counsel. There is something to learn from everyone, even other IP lawyers

Take a similar approach to acquiring a breadth of exposure to different types of clients. In IP, you can find yourself working with inventors and designers during one hour, followed by discussion with in-house counsel at a global technology company the next. Breadth of client exposure includes seeking out a chance to serve foreign and domestic companies, of all sizes, operating in a wide variety of industries. Again, true breadth of experience needs time, so be patient. But also be mindful of whether the firm you are at is giving you as broad an exposure to a range of clients as you think you need for long-term success.

Perhaps most importantly, seek out breadth of exposure to as full a range of different IP matters as possible. It helps keep things from getting stale professionally, and in my view, there is little value to either a lawyer or a firm for junior associates to classify themselves as strictly patent or trademark lawyers, for example. Yes, client matters will drive an associate’s exposure to the different IP disciplines, but associates should also be seeking out exposure to each of those disciplines as well, which means looking out for patent (including design patents,) trademark, copyright, and trade secret matters. Ideally, that exposure will include experience with litigation, prosecution, and licensing matters — including at least some exposure to marketing of IP services, litigation funding considerations, and IP acquisition or divestment matters. It may not all be possible at your current firm, or with your current practice, but it is worth being ambitious about acquiring that full breadth of experience as quickly as possible. 

Ultimately, acquiring breadth of experience as an IP associate bears important fruit later in a lawyer’s career. Having broad experience can make a senior lawyer more marketable, as well as more attractive to clients with a range of IP needs. Broad experience also helps prevent burnout, while allowing the bearer to see and appreciate the interplay of different aspects of IP rights. In short, broader is better when it comes to experience for IP associates. So start thinking about how achieving breadth would impact on your personal IP associate checklist. Next week, we will strive for some depth.

# Lawyers: Don’t Make These Client Development Mistakes In 2019
## Always strive to understand your client’s business. Identify a potential problem, opportunity, or change that impacts potential clients and present them.

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](https://www.mainspringlegal.com/laterallink/) team of expert contributors. [Cordell Parvin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cordellparvin/) is a Senior Director with [Lateral Link](https://www.mainspringlegal.com/laterallink/) based in the Dallas, Texas office. Prior to coaching and recruiting lawyers, Cordell built a national construction law practice at an Am Law 100 law firm. Cordell is a well-known speaker, writer and blogger on career development and client development. He has made presentations to law firms and bar associations throughout the US and Canada. Cordell has published four books on career and client development. You can subscribe to his blog at [http://www.cordellblog.com/](http://www.cordellblog.com/), connect with him on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/cordellparvin), join his [Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Cordell-Parvin-Lawyer-Coaching/222291473905?ref=ts), and follow him on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/cordellparvin).

When I was a young lawyer there were no books or articles on client development. There were no marketing directors or other guidance available. So, I generally learned about client development by the seat of my pants and by making mistakes. Here are some of the top mistakes I and my fellow attorneys made, and how to avoid them.

Just Do Good Work

How many young lawyers are told they don’t need to spend any time on client development. Instead, they should just focus on doing good work and business will follow?

I strove to become the best lawyer I possibly could be, by continuously increasing my quality of work. I quickly learned that being a top-notch lawyer, and doing quality work, was only the ante — the price a lawyer pays to be in the game.

Initially, I was focusing more on the actual practice of law, and less on what my clients needed. It quickly became apparent that client development is about relationship building and client management. Each client is different and ultimately their needs and priorities can greatly differ too. That first awakening contributed greatly to my ultimate success in building a practice.

Don’t Be a Generalist

I know several generalists who have been very successful. They became their clients’ “trusted advisors.”

However, the current market makes it difficult to attract, retain, and expand relationships with clients if you do not have a niche specialized practice.

I started my career as a commercial litigator and even though I was practicing in a city of just 100,000 people, there were already several well-known litigators that drew the majority of litigation work, crowding me out.

In 1978, I started on a new path. While I continued to litigate a wide variety of cases, I focused my marketing efforts on the construction industry. I wrote and published a law review article and spoke at the ABA Annual Meeting on a construction law issue. I became active in construction industry associations and I frequently spoke at their meetings and conventions. I wrote articles and created workshops on issues that affected their business. I began to build relationships both with the clients and with the association executives who recommended their members hire me. In essence, I found my niche and business boomed.

Don’t Try to Be a Salesman

There is a financial advisor with whom I have played golf a few times. For years he tried to invite me to lunch. Finally, I ran out of excuses.

He spent the entire lunch telling me about his firm, his own experience and what he could do for me. The only question he asked me was when I was getting up to leave. He asked: “Cordell, how would you like to put more money away tax-free than you can with your 401k?” I responded that I had already talked about a defined benefit plan with my financial advisor.

You have likely had a similar experience with a financial advisor or insurance salesman. Your clients do not want you to “sell” them. If you are selling, you are thinking of your own needs first and your clients second.

Developing business requires working on your listening skills. Learn about the client and its business. Ask questions rather than making statements and actually listen to the answers. Don’t ask for business. Instead earn the business. I have found that when I started focusing more on serving and less on selling, I was far more satisfied because I knew I was making a difference in my clients’ businesses, which in turn got me more business.

Don’t Just Focus on Attracting New Clients

I loved attracting a new large client. But I quickly learned that my most important client development activities were in service to my existing clients.

I realize that a young lawyer with few clients may not have a choice. But, a lawyer in a large law firm would be well served to spend the majority of her time on current clients. Some suggest that 80 percent of time should be spent on relationship building and only 20 percent of the time on reputation building. The theory is the time and cost to replace a client lost is a multiple of the time and cost spent to make that client a satisfied one.

Don’t Focus Your Attention on the Wrong Clients

I coached lawyers who were focusing attention on the wrong potential clients. One lawyer I coached was persuaded to give a half-day presentation for a legal seminar company. Think of the number of hours he spent preparing for a four-hour presentation.

When he arrived for the workshop, he was struck by three things. First, only eight people showed up. Second, he discovered that most of the firms represented were small companies who would be bankrupt if they had a big problem and could not afford him to handle the problems they could survive. Third, he found that those who attended for the firms that could afford him were not the right people.

Don’t Fail to Differentiate Yourself

Many lawyers and law firms fail to differentiate themselves from their competitors. Their websites and website bios look like many others.

Your potential clients discern the little differences. How can you differentiate yourself? The key is striving to understand your client’s business. Identify a potential problem, opportunity, or change that impacts potential clients and present them.

Don’t Fail to Prepare a Business Plan

If you have read any of my writing, you likely know I believe many lawyers spend more time planning their vacation than they do planning their career.

At the end of the year, they frequently ask: “Where did this year go?” I have always found that if a lawyer does not have a written plan, they are not likely to make the efforts needed for their career and client development.

The famous author Stephen Covey teaches us that there are four quadrants of time. He believes many people do not spend enough time doing quadrant two activities-those activities that are important but not urgent.

David Maister, a noted expert on professional services notes that many professionals focus on their income statement and not balance sheet. Client development is both a quadrant two activity and one that builds the balance sheet. It is important and should be well planned.

Some lawyers, practice groups, and law firms make a plan and never execute it. They develop a great plan, but simply do not follow through. When a young lawyer said to me, “Let me show you my client development plan,” I doubted whether he had actually acted on it. If he had said, “Let me show you what I have done this year and the results,” I know he is executing his plan.

As Nike says, “Just do it.” A fair marketing plan being executed is better than a perfect one that never gets off your hard drive.

Don’t Fail To Operate as a Team

Lawyers have historically not been great team players. Many law firms do not encourage teamwork in their compensation systems. Those firms reward client origination.

In those firms, some lawyers may think: “I need to bag this one to increase my client origination credit.” Clients sense this is what is going on.

When that mistake is made, lawyers are competing with their partners internally rather than competing with their competitors externally. In the end, individual lawyers will not develop clients as well as collaborative law firms.

What Now?

Today there are many books, articles and guidance on client development. Many are well worth reading for any lawyer interested in not making the mistakes described above in developing client relationships. If you have a topic that interests you, send me an email. I’ve likely read a book covering that topic.

# Biglaw Firm's Fashionable New Perk
## Jeans! Five days a week!

Think you can’t be a high-powered attorney and wear jeans to work? Think again. Though the legal profession has a reputation for being staid, the business casual revolution has taken root in Biglaw. As proof that we are never going back to the world of mandatory suits five days a week, may I present the new business casual policy of Dechert. The firm announced yesterday their definition of business casual will now include jeans, which means (obviously depending on what meetings/appearances an attorney may have) Dechert employees can now wear jeans five days a week.

Praise Levi Strauss.

The firm was already a business causal workplace, but the jeans policy was unclear and inconsistent based on location. As Law.com [reports](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/03/12/from-white-shoe-to-blue-jean-firms-get-casual-to-draw-in-talent/), the firm hopes this move will make all their employees more comfortable:

Some offices within the firm had already allowed lawyers and staff to wear jeans on certain days or parts of the year, Bernard said, but there was a desire for a more uniform policy.

“This is just trying to make life easier for people, make people more comfortable, more innovative and letting our talent do their best work,” Bernard said.

Plus the firm is also giving all associates a garment bag to keep a change of business attire available in the office for the unexpected client meeting/court appearance/etc. Clever way of reminding them they need to be ready to shift into “real lawyer” mode at a moment’s notice.

Bernard also focused on the culture moves like this — as well as the firm’s updated parental leave policy and wellness initiative — creates:

“Compensation is always important, prestige is important, but the culture of a firm is one of the biggest drivers of career choice,” Bernard said. “I think these are major, major drivers of how people are choosing where they want to work.”

* Human rights attorney Amal Clooney is handling a dangerous new legal matter. She intends to put ISIS commanders on trial for their war crimes, and she sat down with Cynthia McFadden of NBC News to discuss her campaign. The full interview is set to air later on the Today Show. [[NBC News](http://www.nbcnews.com/video/nbc-news-exclusive-amal-clooney-s-dangerous-mission-against-isis-767822915952)]

* Per Justice Elena Kagan, the longer SCOTUS only has only eight members, the more likely it is that it’s going to become a problem when it comes to the Court’s work: “We’re there to resolve cases that need deciding, answer hotly contested issues that need resolving, and you can’t do that with a tie vote.” [[AP](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_SUPREME_COURT_KAGAN?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT)]

* In the meantime, Supreme Court nominee Judge Merrick Garland has been languishing in limbo for more than six months, and many Senate Republicans are still refusing to grant him a hearing or confirm him — not even in the lame-duck session if Hillary Clinton is elected president. This decision may come back to bite them. [[CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/13/politics/mitch-mcconnell-merrick-garland-lame-duck/)]

* “It is unacceptable for law to be the least diverse of all comparable professions.” According to a new study published in Diversity in Practice which found that “black lawyers are less successful in changing employers,” firms may be failing when it comes to diversity because of law firms’ lateral hiring cycles. [[Stanford Business Insights](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/why-are-law-firms-failing-diversity)]

* Who is the most famous practicing lawyer? You can cast your ballot here. If you need help, there are almost 50 candidates listed — of course, only seven of them are women, and quite a few big names are missing (e.g., Roberta Kaplan, Kathryn Reummler, etc.). We can’t even get some gender equality for a lawyering contest. [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/who-is-the-most-famous-practicing-lawyer-in-big-law/)]

# Habits I’m Starting In 2024
## A little planning can help you avoid burning out in the new year.

Admittedly, I left 2023 a little burnt out and uninspired and am doing my best to ease into 2024. I gave myself some time over the holidays to lean into connection with family and community — and opted out of personal development work for some good ol’ Netflix-binging with my hubby and watching the “Star Wars” saga with the kids. But now, as January is almost over, I don’t want to repeat last year — so here are some habits I’m reviving or picking up in 2024.

Time Blocking

If you follow me, you know this is a strategy I use often. I just need to be more consistent with it — and try planning three to four weeks ahead, instead of the usual week at a time. Right now is a great time, where you have a fresh calendar, because most people haven’t scheduled much yet. If you have big projects, calendar your weekly team check-ins and time to work on the project now, whether that is in one- or two-hour increments weekly, or half-days every other week, or monthly (whatever works best for working style). Otherwise, you will find yourself working on it late at night or weekends because your time was filled up with other people’s meetings (and priorities). If you have Microsoft Teams, it has a feature where it can block off “focus time” for you, and that’s a great start if you’re new to this strategy, but I like to know what I’m using each “focus time” for — so the more project-specific method works better for me.

Other tasks I block time off for:

- Checking email — at least a couple of 30 minute blocks during the day. This allows you to stay on top of anything urgent, even if you have back-to-back meetings or calls.
- Lunch — the intent is so that you don’t forget to eat until you find yourself hangry at 3 p.m. but, admittedly, I have used this as buffer time — I’ll offer this up if something is truly urgent. I also use it to check email, read legal articles, listen to CLEs, mentor, for community board meetings, or to get a quick workout in.
- Reading legal blogs and articles — I find that I do better if I set aside intentional time to learn.
- Time for thinking and planning — Blocking time off to review my calendar and plan for the week ahead, as well as strategic thinking.
- Travel time (for kid pickup) — Nothing worse than not blocking off the time and stressing to pick up your kid before the daycare closes because a meeting ran long. I’ve learned that I am less stressed if I block off the time and take calls only as needed and when I know that the call in question is one that I can take in the car versus one where I have to review documents on a screen.
Calendaring PTO

While this may not work for everyone, I like to block off my PTO for the entire year, even if tentatively, to make sure that I use the time. If you have kids like I do, much of this is around their breaks from school. I also like to schedule my kids’ birthdays off so I can be intentional about celebrating with them and so they don’t have a stressed-out, unpleasant mom. You may also want to consider pre-scheduling a mental health day at least once a quarter if you have the days.

Making Time For Networking

After some reflection last year, I realized that my network is mostly outside my company, and I need to do a better job at developing relationships at my company. So something new I’ve started is just reaching out to people I meet through the normal course of work for a coffee or virtual coffee. I’m starting small with a goal of one new person a month. I’ve already met that goal for January, and it was fun. I’ll let you know how it goes!

# The Second Most Profitable Law Firm In The Country Gets In On The Associate Compensation Game
## There was never a reason for the firm to skimp on associate compensation.

Shocking precisely no one, Cleary Gottlieb has raised associate salaries, and given special bonuses consistent with the Franken-[Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/)/[Simpson](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/)/[Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) scale.

With over a billion dollars in revenue — $1,214,044,000, to be precise — you knew, eventually, Cleary would raise associate salaries. They’re the [second most profitable law firm](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/04/24/the-2018-am-law-100-profitability-index/), according to the most recent Am Law 100 data, so there was no way they were going to leave their associates hanging (especially not with on-campus recruitment season just around the corner).

For those that need the reminder, this means associates at Cleary will now be paid according to the following chart:

# Everyone Seems To Be Overreacting To These Boies Schiller Departures
## Not every string of departures is created equal.

It must suck to announce to the world “we’re making major changes” and still having to deal with a constant drumbeat of stories sharing deep concerns that the firm might be changing. It seems like every time a group of partners leaves Boies Schiller, the accompanying media write-up frets that this might be the product of some sort of financial trouble brewing for the firm, or a calculated lateral raid by peer firms, or some kind of rejection of David Boies himself.

Here’s a radical thought… maybe it’s because they told you this was going to happen from the start.

In the latest iteration of Chekhov’s Departure Memo, 15 California-based attorneys announced that they’re leaving the firm, resulting in stories [characterizing the lawyers “defecting.”](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/04/23/15-boies-schiller-flexner-partners-defect-in-california-most-to-king-spalding/) Indeed “defect” is the most popular term when it comes to covering Boies Schiller — you see it [here](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/thirteen-boies-schiller-partners-defect-to-king-spalding), [here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/01/15/more-defections-from-boies-schiller-as-several-attorneys-leave-to-launch-new-boutique/), and [in here](https://www.ft.com/content/867c7d19-2a62-4b2f-ab98-d467a3fd5f69)… as legal journalists, we really need a thesaurus. But digging deeper, most of the attorneys in this move are products of the 2017 tie-up with Caldwell Leslie & Proctor, which would make them fairly likely candidates to move on if the stated goal of the firm’s new leadership is to scale back and bring the firm back to its core.

Which is exactly what the firm’s managing partners, Natasha Harrison and Nick Gravante, have been saying out loud for a while now. “With 350 litigators it was difficult to be a firm that limited itself to only the best and most important matters,” Gravante told the Financial Times. Over the years, the firm has built an eclectic group of partners seemingly tied together only by the fact that they’re all talented. And while that’s been true within the big city offices, it’s also the big reason why the firm has outposts in places like Albany and Hanover, New Hampshire. It’s somewhat to be expected of a firm with a well-known entrepreneurial comp structure — when pay is so heavily eat-what-you-kill it can create a “gathering of fiefdoms” where everyone’s off doing their own thing without a unifying vision. As the firm grew, it left you wondering whether it was trying to craft itself as a DLA Piper with offices everywhere and prepared to take on matters great and small or a Williams & Connolly with a narrow focus on the most high impact of cases. There are merits to both approaches, but in the end a firm needs to choose.

That’s not to say that the firm isn’t losing incredibly talented attorneys, but feeding that many mouths requires a lot of far-flung work for a firm that doesn’t have a transactional arm generating a steady flow of cash. While it’s potentially the biggest and most consequential litigation of the next few years, the [fight for pandemic insurance coverage](https://www.law.com/dailybusinessreview/2020/04/21/more-suits-to-come-podhurst-orseck-boies-schiller-unite-to-sue-insurer-denying-covid-19-coverage/) isn’t going to support everyone on the BSF roster, but it’s the fight the firm wants to be in. That’s the brand.

It feels as if attorneys with more routine business litigation portfolios that fit within the confines of traditional Biglaw firms are seizing the opportunity to decamp for there, while the attorneys focused on — no-pun intended — David and Goliath insurance fights with far-reaching repercussions for the economy are staying. In fact, if this is what’s happening, we shouldn’t be shocked to hear of more departures before all is said and done. Everyone’s just flowing to where their books are best served, which isn’t cause for concern on anyone’s part.

Considering the alternative interpretations of these moves getting tossed around, this makes the most sense. “Financial trouble brewing at the firm”? We can’t go 10 minutes without another report of a layoff or pay cut, meanwhile Boies Schiller is still running its summer program, hasn’t laid people off, and hasn’t cut compensation. [UPDATE: Likely tied to the fact that these departures are coming mostly from California, BSF has apparently started laying off people in the Los Angeles office. It doesn’t appear to be COVID-related so that remains accurate, but it does seem to underscore the idea that the firm isn’t experiencing “defections” as much as withdrawing from these locations.]

“Calculated lateral raid”? It’s not like when Morgan Lewis swiped 75 percent of Bingham’s partners. The folks leaving BSF are going to a wide variety of firms. “Rejection of David Boies”? This is the weirdest theory being bandied about. The American Lawyer story tosses in a non-sequitur about a New York Times article about Boies’s work going after Jeffrey Epstein as if that’s why the firm has new managing partners and suggests the California lawyers — who reportedly had issues meshing their business with BSF’s rates — were unhappy with the firm having represented Harvey Weinstein in the past, which seems a gratuitous jab since the Weinstein stuff came to light almost three years ago at this point. Theranos has been defunct for two.

Look, Boies Schiller has lost a lot of attorneys. But instead of trying to read some deep meaning into individual lateral moves, maybe consider that what’s happening is “that thing they said was going to happen.”

# Former Biglaw Attorney Suspended From Practice For Insider Trading
## He was also permanently barred from practicing before the SEC.

Trading on insider information never, ever ends well — especially if you’re an attorney.

William Gericke, 61, a longtime lawyer at Cozen O’Connor before this incident, was recently suspended from practice for one year’s time in Pennsylvania following his buying of stock in a firm client’s company before a merger was announced. [Law360](https://www.law360.com/legalethics/articles/1587747/ex-cozen-atty-gets-1-year-suspension-for-insider-trading) (sub. req.) has additional details:

The underlying case began in October 2019, when another partner at Cozen O’Connor asked Gericke to run a conflict check on a potential merger between Liberty Property Trust, a client, and Prologis Inc., a real estate investment trust. News of a possible merger had not been made public at the time.

Gericke purchased [1,000] shares of stock at $51 per share in Liberty Property Trust the next day and did not inform Cozen O’Connor management of the transaction, the report says. About 20 days later, the merger between Prologis and Liberty Property Trust was formally announced, and Liberty Property Trust’s stock price rose on the announcement. Gericke sold his shares for $61 per share and made a $10,000 profit, according to the disciplinary board’s report.

For the next several months, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority investigated trading activity surrounding the merger announcement. The inquiry soon reached the SEC, which then subpoenaed Gericke in July 2021. A few weeks later, Gericke resigned from Cozen O’Connor and admitted in August 2021 that his purchase of Liberty Property Trust stock was illegal insider trading.

Gericke co-founded Cozen’s conflicts department in 2018 and its legal profession services group in 2020, which, per the disciplinary board, made him “especially qualified” when it came to recognizing potential ethics violations and conflicts of interest. Too bad he didn’t recognize them in his own actions.

The Securities and Exchange Commission permanently barred Gericke from practicing before it and ordered him to pay a $20,000 fine. Although he is now employed at Dugan Brinkmann Maginnis & Pace, per the [ABA Journal](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/former-biglaw-attorney-gets-one-year-suspension-for-trading-on-information-learned-as-conflicts-counsel), he is not listed on the firm’s website. His suspension from practice takes effect April 19.

# HUGE LAYOFF REPORT: Biglaw Firm Lays Off Associates, Staff, And Partners
## Reportedly around 40 attorneys are being laid off.

Law firms may be giving off a sense of “cautious optimism,” even as demand remains sluggish overall. But the more we dig into the [gulf developing](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/top-firms-build-bigger-gap-over-the-field-like-they-do-every-quarter/) between the elite firms and the rest of the pack, this overarching mood tends more toward “caution” than “optimism.” It’s just not fair to keep dragging up the rest of the Am Law 200 with the positive results we’re seeing from the top-tier firms — there are some [very troubling signs out there](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/the-2017-am-law-100-a-turning-point-for-biglaw/) for the rest of the pack.

Sadly, one firm just outside of the Am Law 50 has reportedly taken action, with a mass layoff of associates, staff, and even a few partners:

Seyfarth to lay off 40 attorneys and several staff today. Includes income partners and senior staff. Bad Q1. Big debt.

These numbers have not been confirmed, but a secondsource echos that the layoffs are “huge” and involve all levels of the firm. Well, all levels except equity partners, of course.

An email to the firm’s public relations team was not returned by press time — we will update if and when we hear more.

[UPDATE (7:16 p.m.): We have now received a statement from managing partner [Pete Miller](http://www.seyfarth.com/PeterMiller):

Amid a shifting market for legal services, we have an obligation to continue managing our business as effectively as possible, while being responsive to the needs of our clients and the market at large. We’ve recently completed a careful review of our business to maximize performance and best serve our clients, while continuing to execute our growth plans.

To meet these objectives, we have made the difficult yet necessary decision that some individuals, both lawyers and staff, will be leaving the firm. We are grateful for the contributions of those impacted, appreciate their service and are working to ensure their transitions are as smooth as possible.

Looking ahead, the firm remains strong, focused, and growth-oriented as we approach the midpoint of the year.

So there you go.]

In retrospect, we probably should have seen this coming. Seyfarth Shaw was one of the few firms that tried to [push back](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/one-firm-decides-to-pump-the-brakes-on-this-whole-raise-thing/) on last year’s round of associate raises. And let’s be clear, the firm didn’t just hold out on raises, it “pushed back,” with its chair emeritus Stephen Poor authoring an article [questioning the wisdom](https://bol.bna.com/the-cravath-pay-raise-challenges-and-opportunities-for-law-firms-perspective/) of the whole idea of raising salaries. Seyfarth tried to build a critical mass of colleagues willing to stem the tide and, I guess, create a “trimodal” salary distribution curve. Alas, [Seyfarth failed](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/holdout-firm-flip-flops-on-salary/).

Perhaps there was more lurking in the firm’s books than a heartfelt desire to maximize partner profits. We warned last year that [layoffs could follow](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/dear-biglaw-firms-please-dont-raise-salaries/) the wave of salary increases as firms that really had no business raising salaries started to deal with the effects. Looks like Seyfarth — which did [raise salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/holdout-firm-flip-flops-on-salary/), although not to the Cravath scale — is the first big domino to fall.

Hopefully it’s also the last.

If you have more information about the layoffs, please let us know by [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Seyfarth), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)), and we’ll update this story.

# Biglaw Partner Tries To Be Too Cute During Deposition, Gets Benchslapped For Antics
## Now plaintiffs get a deposition do-over.

Lawyers are much more used to taking or defending depositions than they are actually sitting for them. And the distinct roles of attorney and witness were highlighted when BakerHostetler partner [Lee Rosebush](https://www.bakerlaw.com/LeeHRosebush) was deposed in a case brought by Roche Diagnostics Corp. against Rosebush (and others) as a former director of Alliance Medical Holdings LLC over an alleged diabetes test strip insurance fraud scheme.

Special master Dennis Cavanaugh was… not impressed with Rosebush’s behavior during the depo, [saying](https://www.law360.com/articles/1597295/attachments/0) Rosebush was an “extraordinarily difficult and evasive” witness who “indeed spoke words, but did not provide answers.” That’s… a helluva burn.

Plaintiffs sought a re-do of the deposition and, Cavanaugh[ thought](https://www.law360.com/health/articles/1597295/deposition-do-over-ordered-in-diabetes-strip-fraud-suit-) the evasiveness was even worse than the examples plaintiffs cited.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“In their moving papers, plaintiffs cite three or four examples of [Rosebush’s] evasiveness, but in the special master’s view, these examples do not fully encompass the extent of the deponent’s unwillingness to respond to counsel’s questions,” Cavanaugh wrote in his order on Friday, going on to describe parts of Rosebush’s testimony as “incomplete” and “answering a question that had not been asked.”

As [reported by](https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/bakerhostetler-partner-spoke-words-but-did-not-provide-answers-in-deposition-special-master-says) ABA Journal, the special master pointed out all the ways Rosebush’s deposition was problematic, despite the Biglaw partner’s protestations that he was harassed by repetitive questions:

Often, Cavanaugh said, Rosebush “interjected statements and asides which had no bearing on what was asked. He regularly maintained that a question had been ‘asked and answered’ and requested that the court reporter read back his answer, rather than actually providing a direct response.”

Throughout the deposition, Cavanaugh said, Rosebush was asked questions that “by any rational analysis, called for a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no,’ ‘I don’t know,’ or ‘I don’t recall’ response—or a reasonable variation thereof.” But Rosebush instead provided what the plaintiffs termed a “rote” response or answered a question that had not been asked.

Ultimately Cavanaugh decided Rosebush has to sit for another four-hour deposition to “provide responsive and concise answers to the questions presented.” And, just in case there are any shenanigans, Cavanaugh will be available during the deposition telephonically to adjudicate any disputes.

# Ex-Skadden Partner Avoids Jail, But Gets Disbarred Over Child Porn Conviction
## He had approximately 600 sexually explicit images of minors.

Edmund Duffy had an illustrious legal career as a corporate and international trade expert. He was once the head of the China practice at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, and helped the firm achieve its status at the top of the Biglaw food chain. But on Thursday, two years after retiring from Skadden, he was [disbarred](http://www.nycourts.gov/reporter/3dseries/2018/2018_00929.htm) after he pleaded guilty to child pornography charges.

Duffy was arrested in July 2016 — only a few months after he’d left Biglaw — after a sting operation in which FBI agents infiltrated a P2P file-sharing network. According to the prosecution, Duffy — who went by the username “Daddisc” — had ~600 sexually explicit images of minors in his possession. During the execution of a search warrant, the government also says Duffy told agents he liked to “view images and videos of adults and children between the ages of 10 and 14 being spanked.”

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/sites/americanlawyer/2018/02/10/child-porn-conviction-leads-to-ex-skadden-partners-disbarment/) the New York Law Journal, Duffy’s attorney, John “Rusty” Wing of Lankler Siffert & Wohl, argued for leniency in sentencing. Wing used Duffy’s age, poor health, nonprofit work, and um well, the fact that it wasn’t the most horrific forms of child pornography to argue against jail time:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Court records show that Wing unsuccessfully sought to seal the transcript of a sentencing hearing on June 27, 2017, before U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest of the Southern District of New York that delved into the circumstances of the charges against Duffy. The ex-Skadden partner’s defense lawyers, while acknowledging their client’s guilty, had in a footnote to a brief seeking leniency from the court stated that many of the offending images downloaded by Duffy were on the less extreme of the pornography spectrum and essentially child nudes that could be considered art in some places.

Forrest, a former partner at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, reacted negatively to that contention, noting that “these are not just pictures of children naked floating in a pool like the Nirvana album cover,” a reference to the grunge band’s iconic and controversial 1991 classic “Nevermind.” In Duffy’s favor at his sentencing was the fact that he had no prior criminal record, no personal sexual contact with children and did not sell images that he obtained online.

Though Forrest may not have like the insinuation that somehow Duffy’s collection was an okay or at least less awful form of child pornography, she did, ultimately, take pity on Duffy, saying:

“I will tell you that I believe in every other crime, child pornography crime like this that I had, even for possession, I have incarcerated every single other defendant,” Forrest said. “I will tell you that I find the description of the images that you were reviewing extremely disturbing … I am disturbed by this, but I am also not prepared to impose a sentence which I think might kill you.”

Duffy avoided prison but must serve five years’ probation, pay $9,000 in restitution to victims, forfeit $256,000, perform 1,800 hours of community service, participate in a computer internet monitoring program, and register as a sex offender.

# Biglaw Firm Faces Allegations Of A ‘Sexually Hostile Work Environment’
## Plaintiff alleges she was the recipient of inappropriate comments after her marriage to a same-sex partner.

CKR Law LLP is facing a new lawsuit, filed in New York state court yesterday, that alleges the firm allowed a “sexually hostile” environment in its New York office. Plaintiff Catherine Acosta was the former marketing director based in the firm’s New York office, and alleges she was subjected to repeated inappropriate comments that the firm was unwilling to do anything about.

According to the complaint, one attorney reached out to Acosta after work hours for a “chat” and asked “if she had any less professional pictures to share.” Additionally, Acosta alleges she was the recipient of inappropriate comments after her marriage to a same-sex partner. In one particularly galling alleged incident, an attorney commented on Acosta’s marriage asking “if she was done with men forever or if he could do anything to change her mind.”

As [reported by](https://www.law360.com/articles/1173388) Law360, as a result of these allegedly inappropriate interactions, Acosta sought permission to work remotely from the managing partner, Jeffery Rinde. Though that request was initially granted, the complaint alleges it was rescinded when it was revealed Acosta was aware of compromising information about Rinde:

Acosta, who says she suffers from anxiety, got permission from CKR managing partner Jeffrey A. Rinde to work from home after these purported incidents, her suit says. However, she says the firm’s and Rinde’s attitudes toward her abruptly changed after she told her assistant that security cameras had recorded Rinde and the assistant kissing in an elevator.

Ultimately, Acosta was let go from the firm, “allegedly due to her inability to work in the New York City office.” But as the complaint goes on to allege, her assistant, who took over Acosta’s position when she was fired, was allowed to work from home.

You can read the full complaint on the next page.

UPDATE [6/28/19]: Yesterday Kally Savvas, Global Operations Manager of the firm, send around an internal email (sent to Above the Law by tipsters) denying the allegations and seeking support for the partners mentioned in the complaint:

We are writing to let you know that this morning, Catherine Acosta, our former marketing director, commence a civil action against CKR and Jeff [Rinde] alleging a hostile work environment and a failure to accommodate. Law360 wrote a short piece on the complaints and, therefore, you may receive inquiries about the case. The firm strongly disputes Catherine’s allegations against the firm and Jeff and is evaluating an appropriate legal response to this action. On a more personal note, Catherine has asserted allegations about certain other current and former attorneys of this firm. Based on our investigation to date, Catherine’s allegations are false and we hope that you will support the partners that Catherine has wrongly maligned in her pleading. Please remember that all media inquires should be directed to Rosanne Felicello. No partner is authorized to speak on behalf of the Firm without the prior written consent of the Executive Committee.

Bill Voge via Latham & Watkins website

Some day, the official history of the #MeToo era will be written. When it is, I hope it will include — alongside the rightly taken scalps of Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer — the names of people who were unjustly caught up in its more hysterical expressions. One of the first names on that list should be William Voge.

As regular readers of Above the Law (or people who follow the legal profession) likely [know by now](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/latham-chiefs-undoing-began-by-offering-christian-reconciliation-help/), the married Mr. Voge was forced to resign as chairman of Latham & Watkins this past March after a sexting scandal with an also-married woman 18 years his junior.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
At the time, the reporting on his resignation was thin and, unsurprisingly, biased in favor of his accuser.

Enter the Wall Street Journal, whose paper version I still read every morning, because middle age is awesome. In the kind of sensitive, detailed reporting that is all too rare these days, reporter Sara Randazzo — who clearly didn’t get the memo that the man is always supposed to be the bad guy in these stories — [told the story](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-sexting-scandal-that-toppled-one-of-americas-most-powerful-lawyers-1531488579) of what actually happened here.

In short, Mr. Voge got screwed — and he never actually screwed anyone.

First, a little background. It all started when Mr. Voge, trying to be a good guy, agreed to mediate a dispute between one Andrea Vassell — who would later prompt his downfall — and someone she had accused of sexual misconduct from 20 years before, a man named James Lane. Mr. Voge and Mr. Lane were old friends, and Mr. Voge thought he might be able to broker some sort of reconciliation between them.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
To be clear — Mr. Voge never worked with Ms. Vassell. He had no personal or professional relationship with Ms. Vassell. He had never even, throughout this entire process, met her in person. Apparently, he was just trying to help an old friend.

But no good deed goes unpunished.

Last November, he was in Chicago for work and started emailing with Ms. Vassell. The emails turned to texts, and then snowballed into the following, which was the sum total of their relationship:

At first, the messages were innocent, discussing what he was doing that week in Chicago. The talk turned flirtatious, then sexual.

The steamy back-and-forth went on for more than an hour. Going to bed around 11 p.m., Mr. Voge said he recalled thinking, “What the heck did I just do?” Later in the week, he did it again by text. They also emailed and spoke briefly by phone. They talked about meeting in person but never did.

That, ladies and gentlemen, is Mr. Voge’s entire sex scandal. In less than a week, he appears to have engaged in a little bit of dirty talk over text and by phone with a woman he had never met in person. For that, he lost his career and his reputation.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
You may be wondering why, if that was all there was, things got as bad as they did.

For that, here are just a couple of excerpts from the Journal article about what Ms. Vassell did next:

-
“After Mr. Voge both called her and texted her to apologize for his actions and say that he did not want to be in touch with her anymore, she responded as follows in a text: ‘You are insane if you think I am not coming after you with everything I have,’ she wrote.”

-
“Ms. Vassell continued sending emails about Mr. Voge to New Canaan Society [a Christian businessmen’s group to which Mr. Voge and Mr. Lane belonged] members, Latham partners, the head of a competing law firm and, later, to a few media outlets. She also emailed Jami Voge, Mr. Voge’s wife. From December to April, Ms. Vassell sent more than 90 emails to Mr. Voge. In some, she said he had done nothing wrong and that she was upset she couldn’t be with him. In others, she lashed out at him. Many included sexual fantasies. In one, she said she had pleaded guilty to harassment in 1998.”

I know that these days, we’re not supposed to express sympathy for people like Bill Voge. After all, he’s a rich white man who held one of the most plum jobs in the entire BigLaw world. But that, of course, is nonsense — a sad commentary on our too-fractured age.

Imagine what it must have been to be like Mr. Voge. Because of what appears to have been a very brief lapse in judgment over the course of less than a week, a lapse in judgment that did not include sexual contact with anyone or even happen in the workplace, he lost his job and his reputation.

Latham’s response to this scandal was all too predictable in the #metoo era, which is all sin and no redemption. On March 20, it accepted his resignation and immediate retirement and issued a statement saying that his “lapses in personal judgment made continued service as chair untenable.” This, despite the fact that Ms. Vassell had even emailed Latham’s General Counsel at one point to say that she “wanted to be clear that I am not accusing Bill Voge of any kind of sexual misconduct from my perspective. We were consenting adults.”

In the current climate, maybe Latham didn’t have a choice. Maybe when your chairman is caught in a sexting scandal in 2018, you have to cut him loose — no matter how much good he’s done for the firm, no matter how good a man you believe he is.

And that’s a sad thing. What Mr. Voge did was stupid, but we all do stupid things sometimes. (If people didn’t do stupid things sometimes, no one would need defense attorneys.) He didn’t touch anyone, he didn’t threaten anyone, and he didn’t harm anyone. He just engaged in a foolish, consensual flirtation with another woman with whom he had zero professional relationship and it cost him his career.

For the Madame Defarges of the #MeToo era, that was enough.

# The 50 Best Law Firms For Women (2017)
## Congratulations to all of the law firms that made this important ranking!

Year in and year out, we watch law firm after law firm pay lip service to their commitment to diversity in the legal profession, with promises to put women attorneys on equal footing with their male counterparts, whether it be through hiring and retaining more women attorneys, promoting more women attorneys to equity partnership ranks, providing more leadership positions to women attorneys, or adopting more family-friendly policies to ensure that women attorneys are able to excel at their jobs while maintaining a stable work/life balance. Despite these assurances, and despite the fact that a number of firms have made great efforts to improve women’s stature in the law, there is still more to be done.

Today, Working Mother released its annual list of the 50 Best Law Firms for Women. These law firms are considered pioneers in the field when it comes to attracting, retaining, and promoting women lawyers. These law firms not only stand out as being family-friendly workplaces, but they also ensure that women shine in their equity partnership ranks.

With on-campus interview season coming up soon, these law firms are places you might want to work. Which firms made the cut for this year’s ranking?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
To earn themselves a spot on the Working Mother Best Law Firms list, self-selected applicant firms with 50 or more lawyers must complete an extensive application (usually around 300 questions long) with topics ranging from workforce profile, flexibility, and development and retention of women. Working Mother then selected the 50 best firms based on data provided by those firms from the year 2016. Subha Barry, senior vice president and managing director of Working Mother Media, told us that there were some changes made with regard to the 2017 rankings methodology. “This year, we gave additional weight to firms with great female equity partner numbers,” she said. “We also removed the questions regarding flex-time specifically because we found that as time went on, these questions resonated with fewer and fewer firms. We still ask many questions about other flexible work arrangements, including working remotely and working reduced hours.”

Here are some of the interesting results gleaned from Working Mother’s study:

• Over the last 10 years, the percentage of equity partners who are women has increased to 20% from 16%, and the percentage of nonequity partners who are women has grown to 30% from 22% at the Best Law Firms. This year, the Best Law Firms employ more female equity partners (20%) than the national average (18%).

• Among their Top 10 rainmakers, 83% of the top firms have at least one woman.

• Since last year, the number of paid weeks of maternity leave offered at the Best Law Firms increased one week, to an average of 16 weeks. Yet the average number of weeks of maternity leave taken by lawyer moms stayed the same, at 14. An average of 8 weeks of paid paternity leave was offered, with an average of 4 weeks taken.

• A majority (53%) of all lawyers at the top firms report working remotely. This makes remote work, which is offered by all of the winning firms, the most popular flex option among both male and female lawyers at every level.

Women have made great progress at Biglaw firms in recent years, but which firms have been most receptive to their advancement? Here’s the list of the 50 Best Law Firms for Women in 2017 (in alphabetical order):

Congratulations are in order for the 39 firms returning to the list this year: Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer; Baker McKenzie; Cooley; Crowell & Moring; Davis Wright Tremaine; DLA Piper; Dorsey & Whitney; Faegre Baker Daniels; Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett & Dunner; Foley & Lardner; Fox Rothschild; Fredrikson & Byron; Goodwin; Gray Plant Mooty; Hanson Bridgett; Hogan Lovells; Holland & Hart; Ice Miller; Katten Muchin Rosenman; King & Spalding; Kirkland & Ellis; Latham & Watkins; Littler Mendelson; Manatt, Phelps & Phillips; McDermott Will & Emery; McGuireWoods; Morrison & Foerster; Norton Rose Fulbright; O’Melveny & Myers; Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe; Perkins Coie; Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman; Quarles & Brady; Reed Smith; Schiff Hardin; Seyfarth Shaw; Shook, Hardy & Bacon; Sidley Austin; and WilmerHale. Way to represent your women attorneys!

For what it’s worth, some firms that placed on the Yale Law Women’s list of the [Top 10 Most Family-Friendly Firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/the-top-10-most-family-friendly-law-firms-2017/) (Cleary Gottlieb; Jenner & Block; Munger Tolles; Proskauer; and Simpson Thacher) were nowhere to be found on this year’s list. Similarly, 25 firms that received Gold Standard certification from the Women in Law Empowerment Forum, an achievement measuring benchmarks in women’s [power, pay, and prestige](http://wilef.com/cert2.html), were left off of this year’s list entirely. Last, but certainly not least, a handful of firms from [Law360’s Glass Ceiling Report](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/best-biglaw-firms-for-women-who-actually-want-to-make-partner/) — the firms with the with the highest ratio of female equity partners to male equity partners in the United States — were excluded from this year’s list.

As hard as it is to find a Biglaw firm that will promote a respectful number of women to partnership, pay them handsomely, and offer family-friendly benefits — all at the same time — it’s apparently even harder to find a list that will measure all of those important characteristics at once. Women are presented with financial rankings, family-friendly rankings, and one ranking that purports to cover both of those areas but fails to capture all of the data available.

We’ve made this suggestion a few times in the past, but it bears repeating: Please, please get together to compare notes with all of the women in law affinity groups that publish law firm rankings. Young women still in law school are using these lists for guidance when starting their Biglaw careers, and it can get very confusing. Please consider this before you roll out next year’s lists — because if you don’t come up with an optimal ranking system, someone else will.

Now we’ll turn this discussion over to our readers. If your firm didn’t make the cut, do you think it should have? If your firm did make the cut, was it deserved? What can be done to improve work/life balance for women and working mothers? If you’d like to let us know what you think, you can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com), text us at (646) 820-8477, or tweet us [@atlblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog). Congratulations to all of the law firms that made this important ranking! We hope to see your names again next year.

# Doc Review Attorney Demands To Be Seen In Biglaw Departure Email
## After 10 years, does anyone know who this even is?

Here’s a riddle for you: If an attorney works at a Biglaw office for 10 years, but no one knows who they are, are they really an attorney at all?

To be fair, this is a bit of a trick question since the attorney in question is actually a Discovery Attorney. Listen, [I spent my time](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/04/secret-life-of-atl-writer-revealed/) in the salt mine of document review, so I know what I’m talking about. How a certain segment of attorneys refuse to see you as a peer and look down at the admittedly essential work you do to keep their litigation afloat.

After working at WilmerHale as a Discovery Attorney in the Dayton office for almost 10 years, one lawyer we’ll call Discovery Dan decided to move on to greener pastures. But after almost a decade at the Biglaw firm, Dan wasn’t just going to fade to black or hope some supervisor brought a sheet cake from Costco to celebrate his last day. No, Dan wants to participate in the age old tradition of associates lateraling with a jaunty little farewell email sent to all U.S. attorneys.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
And if they don’t know Dan or were unaware WilmerHale hires Discovery Attorneys or even has a Dayton office, well, that’s not going to stop the cute email you have to read for yourself:

Dear Fellow WilmerHale Colleagues:

It is with a heavy heart that I have made the difficult decision to leave WilmerHale in my role as a Discovery Attorney. For those of you that do not know me, or don’t care, please mark Non-Responsive and move on to the next e-mail. If you do know me, know what a discovery attorney is, please mark responsive. Please reserve the “Needs Further Review” tag if you have additional questions on why you even got this email in the first place from a discovery attorney.


I know, some of you who have made it past the first paragraph of this document may now be asking yourselves “who are these discovery attorneys you reference?”

It is hard to believe that nearly 10 years ago, I started out as one of the first discovery attorneys in what was called “The Original Eight” at WilmerHale – Dayton. We operated covertly on behalf of our clients in our cubicles on the 1st Floor of the building. At the time, we were referred to as the “Doc-Ninjas” for our ability to review, analyze and issue code documents in a precise and efficient manner. From that time, until 9 years later when I became/[remained] a Discovery Attorney. . . I have grown so much. Thank you all for teaching and inspiring me, and allowing me to do the same for you in this wonderful atmosphere.

I’m headed off to begin the next chapter of my legal career in an AGC role at a large financial institution. While I am enthusiastic about my future there, I continue to be hopeful and excited about all the things you will continue to accomplish here at WilmerHale and specifically, Dayton.

If I could leave you all with just one thought:

“When it comes to life the critical thing is whether you take things for granted or take them with gratitude.” – G.K. Chesterton


Best of luck Dan. Hope everyone at your next job takes the time to figure out who you are.

Michael Zalay is vice chair of the business and finance group at Much Shelist. 

He has experience practicing corporate and transactional work for businesses of all sizes, including as an “outside general counsel” of sorts.

Here, he discusses being “the lawyer version of a primary care physician,” his path to broader corporate work, and some encouraging signs from the hospitality industry.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity. 

Why don’t you tell us a bit about your background?

After law school I started at a small general practice firm, doing a little bit of everything. Specifically, I did corporate, real estate, labor, litigation, and estate planning work. 

That firm was a great opportunity — I suppose I didn’t know it at the time, but I received practical exposure to so many different areas of law. A few years after working there, I realized I wanted to hone in on corporate transactional work. I enjoyed working with business owners — it was important for me to help them succeed.

So, I moved to a more transactional-based firm called Bronson & Kahn, where I refined my skills as a corporate transactional attorney. I worked on a variety of matters, but for the most part I was somewhat the outside general counsel for businesses of all sizes in basically every industry.

When you developed that specific interest in the corporate transactional work, was that based on really liking that work, or really disliking some of the other work you’d been doing, or was it a combination?

I really liked the business side of it, especially since I have a business background. I come from a family of entrepreneurs and always felt that working with businesses in different industries was interesting. A lot of people grow their businesses in different ways, and it’s fascinating to see that.

Great.

So, in 2018 the firm I was at merged with Much, which has been a successful marriage. I’ve been able to do everything I was doing at Bronson & Kahn,  a boutique transactional firm, but now with a much larger set of resources, and a much more diverse array of practice areas. I’ve been able to keep a lot of work “in-house.”

Now I serve as the vice chair of the firm’s business and finance group where I do a variety of corporate and transactional work. I like to say I am the lawyer version of  a primary care physician. I’m going to be your first point of contact because I have the background and exposure to all different types of law. I can help clients see the big picture in different areas. 

I like that analogy of the primary care physician. Are you sending people to specialists in your firm? Are you collaborating with in-house people at your clients’ offices? What does that relationship look like?

Absolutely, we’re definitely using specialists at our firm for areas I’m not as familiar with. But because I have that broad background though, I’m able to communicate with the clients and stay involved. 

I’m not passing off a client to someone they’ve never met before, I want to keep that relationship intact and stay involved. The more I can stay involved, the more I can help counsel clients.

I always also like to ask people what they like best about their current role, and what’s their biggest challenge.

Sure. I really like working with business owners and privately held businesses in trying to understand their business, learning about their business, and trying to help them solve problems, whatever those might be. I suppose it’s as simple as that. 

As far as things I don’t like, I don’t think anyone really likes it when business owners aren’t getting along. You have to get involved in helping solve those disputes with people you’ve worked with a long time, who you respect. It’s always a tough situation.

I deal with one of the business owners. I do litigation, so I kind of see one piece of that. That’s an interesting thought though. What do you do with that, if you’re representing a business in a transactional sense and then there is a conflict between the owners? Can you represent one of them in litigation if it goes that way, or do you have to refer them both out, how does that work?

That’s always a unique situation. It’s always pretty fact sensitive and depends on what your role has been. 

Sometimes if you’re representing a company with two individuals that are in business together, you have to take the position that you’re representing neither of them, you’re representing the company. But that’s always a tough situation.

Yeah, I guess that’s something you probably always just have to do on a case-by-case basis. Are you noticing any new trends in your practice areas?

I do a lot of work in the hospitality industry. Coming off one of the worst years ever for the hospitality industry, it’s been incredible to see the amount of opportunity that has sprung from that. 

We are seeing landlords, for example, provide tenants with all the money they need to open up their restaurants. Landlords want to see restaurants get up and running in time, and they can help get that to happen when restaurateurs don’t have to go out and find financing. 

We’re seeing a lot of getting along between landlords and tenants in that respect.

That sounds like a positive trend. Who doesn’t like good restaurants?

It is a positive trend. Very positive trend.

Any advice for recent law school graduates who’d someday like to be doing something similar to what you do?

I would say be curious. Try to learn about other areas of the law and learn about businesses and how they’re run. A lot of being a lawyer is talking with business owners, talking with people who are in decision-making roles. It helps if you can understand where they are coming from. It also helps if you can understand other areas of the law so you can have a fuller picture of the advice that you’re giving.

I hear that “be curious” thing a lot, so it must be good advice. Well, we better wrap this up. Do you have any parting thoughts?

Going back to what we were talking about before in moving to Much, it’s a great firm. It’s a full-service midsize firm, a lot of which have been leaving the city or being gobbled up by larger firms, so we’re one of the few midsize firms left in Chicago. 

It’s nice being at a midsize firm that can work with small businesses, medium businesses, and large businesses and have all the resources to do all of the above.

Welp, this has the beginning of a really… intriguing story, if only we knew the details. But so far, only the sparsest of information has been released.

So, here’s what we know.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Slaughter & May partner Oliver Storey has left the firm. Storey began work at the firm in 2006, made partner in 2016, and, according to a cached version of Slaughter & May’s website, his practice included “advising corporate, financial institution and public sector clients on a wide range of matters including bank lending, debt capital markets, acquisition financing, securitisation and restructuring and insolvency.”

But according to[ a statement](https://www.legalcheek.com/2020/11/slaughter-and-may-partner-leaves-firm-following-internal-probe/) by[ Senior Partner Steve Cooke](https://www.slaughterandmay.com/people/steve-cooke/), after an internal probe, “Oliver Storey has retired from the partnership with immediate effect.” Cooke went on to say:

“We expect the highest standards of behaviour from all our partners and staff. If these standards are called into question, we will not hesitate to investigate promptly and take whatever action is required.”

And what’s more is Cooke said that the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) has been notified. Very interesting indeed.

# Biglaw Firm Battling A Gender Discrimination Lawsuit Will Have To Fight On A New Front
## The complaint alleges the managing partner said, 'we’re not real good at practicing what we preach.'

IIt looks like the Biglaw firm of Ogletree Deakins — ironically noted for their employment litigation practice — will have to fight another battle over their alleged treatment of women at the firm. For those who may not recall, last year the firm was hit with a [$300 million class-action](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/am-law-100-firm-hit-with-300-million-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/) by nonequity shareholder Dawn Knepper, alleging gender discrimination and unequal pay. As that case[ winds its way](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/more-partners-join-300-million-biglaw-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/?rf=1) through federal court, the firm will also have to deal with a purported class action under the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 that was filed yesterday in California state court.

The named plaintiff in the case former Ogletree equity partner Tracy Warren, who has also opted into the federal action. Similar to the federal case, the complaint alleges Ogletree underpays female partners compared with their male counterparts. There are also allegations that the way in which the firm divvies up origination credits and provides opportunities for advancement and business development are discriminatory.

In additional to these now all too familiar allegations, the complaint alleges the firm ignored the grievances of women attorneys when they complained about their treatment by a male partner. The eye-popping quote on this issue is from the firm’s managing partner, Matt Keen, who is also a named defendant:

On information and belief, when a female shareholder asked the Managing Shareholder of the Firm, Defendant Matt Keen, about the Firm’s response to gender discrimination complaints made by female employees, he explained: “we’re not real good at practicing what we preach.”

Additionally, the complaint alleges the firm relied solely on in-house counsel during the investigation into these complaints, in opposition to the advice the firm would typically provide to their clients in similar situations.

UPDATE: The firm has responded it will “confidently defend” itself against the new lawsuit:

Equal opportunity has been a core principle of Ogletree Deakins since the firm’s founding, and we do not tolerate discrimination of any kind – gender or otherwise. We take the allegations very seriously. However, the decision-making process that governs our compensation system is both fair and equitable. In fact, we are proud of our “open compensation” system under which all shareholders in the firm know what every other shareholder earns – and the factors that support those determinations.   

Ms. Warren was terminated shortly after the firm received a client complaint that she had engaged in unprofessional and unethical conduct. Following an investigation and with the input of outside counsel, Ms. Warren was expelled on a vote of the equity shareholders.

We will confidently defend the firm against these claims as we remain steadfast in our commitment to equal opportunity for all. Women comprise more than half of the people in our firm and, over the last five years, the majority of attorneys promoted to shareholder in the firm have been women. Further, women are among our most successful lawyers, serving in leadership positions as members of our board of directors and compensation committee, office managing shareholders, and practice group chairs.

# The Am Law 200 Is Out -- What Does It Tell Us About The Legal Landscape?
## Sure the rich are getting richer, but what are the rest of the firms supposed to do about it?

Today, the American Lawyer [released the Am Law 200](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/05/22/the-2018-am-law-200/), which is to say they released the Am Law 101-200 after [releasing the Am Law 1-100 last month](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/am-law-100-released-a-lot-of-firms-made-a-lot-of-money/). While most of us are starstruck by the top 100 and pore over that data for weeks, especially now that the schism between the haves and the have-nots has gravitated up from the Am Law 100 vs. Am Law 200 toward the Am Law 50 vs. Everyone Else threshold, the second hundred data tell some fascinating stories about the real meat and potatoes of the legal landscape.

And those fascinating stories are mostly tragedies.

At first blush, it was a dismal year for the second hundred firms in Am Law’s rankings. As [Miriam Rozen points out](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/05/22/the-second-hundred-are-being-lapped-by-the-top-tier/), revenue growth is down. Revenue per lawyer is down. Profits per equity partner are down. It’s an across the board sob story, while the Am Law 100 — driven mostly by the top 25 — posted gains in each of those categories. But there’s some good buried in those numbers. American Lawyer’s editor-in-chief, Gina Passarella Cipriani, points out that the second hundred saw a bevy of mergers, closures, and acquisitions from 2017 to 2018, meaning smaller firms moved up into the top 200 this year and artificially dragged the numbers down. But compared with the accelerating growth of the very top, this may be cold comfort for most of this list.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Beyond the raw negative results, the Am Law numbers reveal that the same volatility inflicting the Am Law 100 is only amplified among the ranks of the second hundred. And while volatility can be either positive or negative, you can imagine which side of the coin turns up more often down here.

ALM Intelligence’s Nicholas Bruch points out that only 19 Am Law 100 firms shifted from growing to shrinking or vice versa last year, with more improving their station than not. Meanwhile, 36 firms of the second hundred flipped from growing to shrinking or vice versa last year… and the trend’s increasingly negative. The same can be said of PPeP, with 35 Am Law 100 firms seeing a flip, mostly positive, while a whopping 53 second hundred firms experienced a flip, mostly negative. Part of that might be that the second hundred firms were already running leaner to the bone such that any shift in fortunes was likely to flip their trend. But even if that’s true, it portends a deeper problem — that the second hundred don’t have the cushion needed to make the investments in business development and technology that the bigger firms are using to consolidate their advantages.

So what gives? Well, for one thing, the data show that costs per lawyer are up among the second hundred firms this year by the same amount as the first hundred. That wouldn’t be so bad, Bruch notes, until you remember that second hundred firms traditionally see cost per lawyer increases substantially slower than the Am Law 100. As you might suspect, the pressure to hike associate pay contributed mightily to this figure. Many of the second hundred firms jacked up salaries last year, with 17 fully matching the Cravath scale!

To some extent, this is the inevitable result of the Am Law 50’s invasion of the smaller markets that most of the second hundred consider their home turf. Yet the methodical encroachment of the elite firms into markets long left to the smaller firms (soon to be the subject of a full ALM report, we’re told) has left the second hundred in a talent bidding war with forces that have them largely outgunned. This has left them, generally, with dwindling headcount and higher costs per lawyer — not an enviable situation.

Where does that leave the second hundred firms? Largely divided between stumbling forward into the headwinds or scrambling to forge a new identity now that they’re no longer the biggest fish in the smallest of ponds. Expand scope to become the premier regional firm, servicing those areas outside the major metropolitan center that DLA Piper just colonized? Try to find an elite firm interested in a ready-made branch office to acquire? Attempt to merge with another firm? What’s a firm to do?

On the other hand, some markets may tell a different story. While a long-standing Houston firm may be left in a quandary — unable to compete with the elite firms moving in, but too large to capture truly niche work like a boutique can — a midsized firm in Minneapolis may be ideally set to outcompete large firms that are still (and may always remain) reluctant to devote the resources necessary to crowd out a competitor capable of undercutting the bigger firm’s price point. It may just be that there’s no universal solution to the second hundred’s woes.

But they should probably start devoting some time to figuring out what their specific solution is going to be before it’s too late.

# The 2017 Am Law 200: Keep Calm And Carry On
## Reports of Biglaw's death are greatly exaggerated.

I’m usually a pretty positive person — see, e.g., my recent [shiny happy profile of David Boies](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/at-lunch-with-david-boies-20-years-after-his-departure-from-cravath/) — but with your indulgence, I’m going to intrude on Mark Herrmann’s turf and be a bit of a [curmudgeon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590316762/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dealbreaker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1590316762) (affiliate link to Mark’s book, which I highly recommend).

Earlier this week, the American Lawyer released its [Am Law 200 rankings](http://www.americanlawyer.com/home/id=1202786574623/Exclusive-Report-The-2017-Am-Law-200?mcode=1202629935189&curindex=0). As you may recall, the eagerly anticipated [2017 Am Law 100 rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/the-2017-am-law-100-a-turning-point-for-biglaw/) came out last month, so the latest rankings feature the so-called “Second Hundred,” those firms ranked from #101 to #200 in terms of gross revenue.

Now, I enjoy law firm rankings as much as — indeed, probably more than — the next guy or gal. But I do question the significance of the Second Hundred as a classification. There’s a certain arbitrary quality to a firm’s total revenue, which is the product of revenue per lawyer (“RPL”) multiplied by the total number of lawyers. Some firms wind up in the Second Hundred rather than the Am Law 100 because they have lower RPL, but other firms wind up there because they’re just smaller in size. As a result of this arbitrariness, there are firms in the Second Hundred that really have more in common with Am Law 100 firms than with their peers in the Am Law 200.

Take, for example, a firm like Munger Tolles, in the Second Hundred at #127. In many ways — in terms of clients, cases, recruiting, and financial metrics — Munger is much more similar to Wachtell Lipton or Williams & Connolly, both Am Law 100 firms, than it is to McCarter & English, ranked #126, or Chadbourne & Parke, ranked #128 (and in the Am Law 200 for the last time, because of its [acquisition by Norton Rose Fulbright](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/biglaw-merger-means-the-end-of-chadbourne-parke/)).

This takes me to my next curmudgeonly point. The Am Law analysis of the Second Hundred focuses on the plight of firms in the [“hollow middle,”](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202786569987/The-Am-Law-200s-Hollow-Middle?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL) but “Second Hundred” and “hollow middle” are not the same thing.

The “hollow middle” is a term coined by law firm consultant Bruce MacEwen of [Adam Smith, Esq.](http://adamsmithesq.com/), one of the most astute observers of the legal industry out there. As MacEwen explained in our pages back in 2013, in his [law firm taxonomy](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/05/from-across-the-desk-a-law-firm-taxonomy-introduction/), “hollow middle” firms are “one-size-fits-all, not a special destination, generic law firms,” and as such, they are “endangered; at risk of marginalization, irrelevance.”

I agree with MacEwen that firms in the “hollow middle” don’t have promising long-term futures — they will lose high-end work to the Cravaths and Wachtells of the world, and they will lose low-end work to automation, other technological advances, and outsourcing — but “hollow middle” isn’t synonymous with “Second Hundred.” There are firms in the Second Hundred that are going to be fine (like Munger, I’d submit, despite its 10 percent drop in revenue last year). And there are firms in the Am Law 100 — I won’t name names — that do commodity work, just at such high volume that they are huge in terms of revenue.

And here’s my final quibble, which is actually happy news. Everyone loves predictions of doom, but many “hollow middle” firms will be able to keep on chugging for a long, long time — quite possibly into the retirements of many people reading this post — before they run into problems.

Even though both lawyers and cab drivers bill for their time, the practice of law is very different from driving a taxi. Biglaw cannot be disrupted as easily as the taxi and limousine industry got disrupted by Uber, Lyft, and other ride-sharing companies. We lawyers are very clever. We have come up with all sorts of rules and regulations, many of them supposedly grounded in legal ethics, that protect our profession from disruption. Think about the rules against unauthorized practice of law, non-lawyer ownership of law firms, and fee splitting with non-lawyers. These rules, and others, make it more difficult for some clever innovator with a cool technology to put everyone in Biglaw out of a job.

Will some technologies put some lawyers in the unemployment line? Sure; it’s already been happening. In eDiscovery, for example, technologies like predictive coding have reduced the number of Biglaw associates (and also contract attorneys) who are needed for document review and production. But it will be a long time before technology can do all the work that Am Law 200 law firms handle (even if parts of that work might get automated, so some firms might shrink — and some firms already have shrunk).

But predictions like “in 10 years, the Am Law 200 will be gone, except for 25 mega-firms” are ridiculous. I’m saying this on the record in 2017; check back with me in 2027, and I’ll tell you, “I told you so.” We will still have an Am Law 200 in 2027, and while some firms will be gone, and others will be smaller in terms of headcount, the fundamental Biglaw business model will not be that different. There will still be at least 200 major law firms, and each of those firms will have hundreds of lawyers and tens of millions in revenue. (This year’s #200 firm, Archer & Greiner, has 178 lawyers and $91 million in revenue.)

Please don’t get me wrong; I’m not saying that firms should be complacent, ignore technology, or otherwise fail to innovate, thinking that they’re safe no matter what. I’m all in favor of firms evolving with the times (and so is Above the Law; look at our robust coverage of [legal technology](https://abovethelaw.com/technology/)). But I just don’t think there’s any major cause for alarm. Some individual firms will shrink or even die — boy, Dewey know about that — but Biglaw as a whole isn’t folding anytime soon.

# Actionable Cost Data: What It Is And Why You Want It
## Actionable data can help law firms understand what matters cost and create accurate forecasts and well-scoped fixed fee arrangements.

Everyone has heard the saying, “Data is the new oil.”  But does that saying hold true in law, or is the promise of data-driven decision-making in our industry just more marketing hype?

To explore this question, I sat down with [Catherine Krow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherine-krow/), the Founder and CEO of [Digitory Legal](https://www.digitorylegal.com/).  Digitory is an award-winning cost analytics platform that brings data-driven pricing and cost management to law.  Catherine — a former Orrick litigation partner and self-professed data geek — founded Digitory because she believes “nothing moves the needle in our industry faster or more effectively than actionable data.”

What is “actionable” cost data?

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Actionable data is data that delivers decision-grade insight.  According to Catherine, in the billing context, that means cost data with four key attributes: (1) granular enough to reveal scope and unit costs for each task, (2) well-labeled, (3) accurately and consistently coded, and (4) connected to context. “It is the ‘why’ behind the numbers,” she says.

She explains, “Actionable cost data can reveal the value, or lack of it, within legal spend, pinpoint opportunities for process improvement, and improve communication around expectations and costs.  It also can help law firms and in-house counsel predict the price of complex work with an unprecedented level of precision.”

How do you get it?

Catherine explains, “Harnessing the power of data in law usually requires some process change because data management practices in the legal industry — particularly around billing data — historically have not been very rigorous.  This has created an industry-wide legacy of what I call data debt: we’ve got a lot of it, but it actually doesn’t tell you anything.”

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
That’s the bad news.  The good news is technology can transform dirty billing data into actionable insight if the appropriate foundation has been laid.  Catherine continues, “That foundation depends on the quality of the time narratives in the bills, not the accuracy of the attorney coding, which will always be wrong.” She continues, “Even if a legal department is not ready for a serious data initiative now, having bills with detailed time narratives will set the stage for success in the future. Legal departments can build this foundation by adding and enforcing vagueness rules in your outside counsel guidelines.”

Why do you want it? 

Catherine explains that the three primary reasons are money, cost predictability, and diversity.

According to Catherine “For corporate legal departments, actionable data can uncover 20-35 percent of unnecessary spend.  Conversely, it can help inside counsel identify and reward firms that run matters well.  Moreover, that which gets measured gets managed.”  This is a huge benefit for legal departments and for law firms working with fixed fee arrangements, which can become unprofitable very quickly if the cost data is not actively measured and managed.

She continues, “Budget-to-actual is the number one key performance indicator for legal operations, and accurate budgets and fixed fees provide the predictability they crave.  Actionable data can help law firms understand what matters cost and why to create accurate forecasts and well-scoped fixed fee arrangements.”

Most importantly for us as an industry, actionable data can take diversity initiatives to the next level.  “Because billing data is poorly coded and structured, it provides no meaningful information about what diverse attorneys are actually doing,” she says.  Catherine continues, “With actionable data, clients and law firms can see if the diverse lawyers are getting the same career-advancing opportunities as the non-diverse lawyers.  When you see it, you can fix it — preferably before those diverse attorneys walk out the door.”

What are your experiences with data? I would love to hear your insights and questions for Catherine. I enjoyed her insights and unique perspective as a former Biglaw partner and may interview her about other aspects of data and legal practice in the future. What would you like to learn?

# Layoffs Strike At Cravath As Firm Cuts U.S. Lawyers In London
## Associates in the firm's London office are bearing the brunt of a reported practice shift.

No Biglaw firm is immune from having to conduct layoffs — not the [wealthiest firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/stealth-layoffs-strike-once-again-at-worlds-wealthiest-biglaw-firm/) of them all, and not even the [most prestigious](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/vault-100-rankings-the-most-prestigious-law-firms-in-america-2023/) of them all.

News comes to us from across the pond that compensation leader Cravath has laid off an unspecified number of associates in its London office as the firm attempts to reconfigure its staffing. Cravath’s London office has employed a U.S. finance team since it first opened in 1973, but earlier this year, the firm decided to build out its practice by hiring England and Wales-qualified finance laterals from Shearman & Sterling. [RollOnFriday](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-mega-paying-cravath-axes-us-lawyers-london) has the scoop on the reported job cuts:

The repositioning has rebounded on the firm’s US lawyers in London, several of whom have been made redundant to make way for lawyers qualified in England & Wales.

According to one source, Cravath “fired the entire class of 2021 and many other associates in London”.

However, another source close to US management denied that an entire year had been terminated, and said that redundancies were made across associate levels.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
While Cravath declined to comment on the layoffs, RollOnFriday notes that a source close to management said there had been a “limited adjustment” to the firm’s associate ranks in London, and that “a select number of roles were eliminated.”

Best of luck to those who are being let go from Cravath.

# Top Biglaw Firm Plans To Bring Associates Back To The Office 1-2 Days Per Week, Starting In November
## The firm will continue to allow remote flexibility through the end of the year.

Biglaw firms’ thoughts on the return to the office in our “post”-pandemic world continue to evolve. While some firms have simply canceled previously scheduled reopenings without announcing a future target date, with the promise of offering 30 days’ notice if a new date should be chosen, others have canceled their plans for 2021 reopenings entirely. Others still seem to have settled on November as the time to invite employees back to the office.

The latest firm to do so is Ropes & Gray, a firm ranked at No. 11 on the most recent Am Law 100, with $2,192,810,000 gross revenue in 2020. Right now, Ropes is still within Phase 1 of its reopening plan (i.e., permissive office use), and had most recently planned to move to Phase 2, a broader reopening for all personnel, on October 18, a bit later than originally imagined. That was delayed, and now the firm is moving to its next return-to-office phase on November 8.

What does that mean for personnel at the firm? Here’s an excerpt from a memo sent earlier this week (emphasis added):

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
[I]n Phase 2 we would like lawyers to join us back in the office at least one or two days per week. We anticipate this phase to last through the end of the year. …

We want to be clear that lawyers coming in more frequently is our hope, with each lawyer’s presence determined by their comfort level. And while many of you have already begun to come in more often, we know that some of you face particular health and safety issues, whether for yourself or for people within your care. We also recognize the increased challenges of transitioning back to more time in the office — the added commute, the disruption to recent routines and new scheduling issues. As always, we will be understanding and supportive.

A source tells us that the firm has separately announced that the week of Thanksgiving and the last two weeks of December will be fully remote so that employees can celebrate the holidays with their friends and family. Also of note is the fact that the firm will continue to offer free food for all through the end of 2021.

Remember that Ropes & Gray was one of the first firms to [put an end](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/ropes-grays-reopening-plan-puts-an-end-to-the-5-day-in-office-workweek-for-associates/) to the five-day, in-office workweek with its plans for lawyers to spend three days per week in the office as part of its full reopening (which was originally slated for November when announced in May). Hopefully that’s still the plan going forward in 2022.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

# Boies Schiller Bonuses Appear To Underperform Market, But Not Everyone Notices

Make no mistake, working for Boies Schiller is not going to earn you [a $10 Starbucks card](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/associate-bonus-watch-10-starbucks-cards-for-top-billers/) for a year’s effort. In fact, the firm is still one of the best places to work for an associate looking for a big score, with massive bonuses available for associates lucky enough to contribute to big contingency-fee paydays. But most of the tipsters reaching out to Above the Law to discuss their 2017 bonuses report getting at or below the Cravath market scale this year.

Some even say the firm’s compensation model consistently undercompensates associates — it’s just associates are working too hard to notice. An interesting theory.

The compensation regime at BSF is notably complicated. Here’s a brief explanation [from our 2016 post](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/associate-bonus-watch-boies-schillers-bounty/):

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
As we’ve [explained in the past](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/12/associate-bonus-watch-a-300k-bonus-at-boies-schiller/), BSF employs a comp system in which an individual associate shares directly in the revenue her work produces for the firm. So if she bills insane hours or works on a lucrative contingency-fee case, she can [get a bonus as high as $350,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-boies-schiller-pays-up-to-350k-again/). But if not, it’s possible she might end up getting market-level comp (which is really not that bad, if it means working better hours).

In the past, Boies associates that reach out to us are generally happy with their bonuses, but stray dissenters started cropping up last year. This year, we’re hearing even more grumbling about the formula that appears to underperform the market starting at the fourth-year level or so. Because Boies pays individualized bonuses based on the revenue sharing model outlined above, we don’t have perfect information here, but we’ve gathered enough feedback to paint a broad sketch of the 2017 bonus situation.

Junior associates are still, by all accounts, doing great at BSF. Our sense is that associates in their first three years are outperforming the Cravath scale, earning thousands more than their peers at almost every billable target.

The problem starts for midlevels.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
A fourth-year associate at Cravath billing 2000 hours would stand to earn $300K in 2017 between their $235K base and a $65K bonus. Meanwhile, a BSF fourth-year associate billing 2000 hours on a normal case would earn on average, based on our tipsters, $290K. And that gap grows as the years go by, with fifth-years earning approximately $20K less than market and sixth-years making about $35K less.

Why is this not a greater source of frustration? Well, most Boies associates are working more than 2000 billables every year. At the 2200 hour level, Boies still exceeds the market scale until the sixth-year level when tipsters claim the firm mostly matches market. So for most BSF associates, this gap isn’t even noticeable.

But that compensation gap is still there even if lawyers aren’t feeling it. Associates billing what is generally considered the “good standing” baseline of 2000 hours are making less at BSF than they would at other Biglaw firms. That means Boies is technically underperforming the “market” bonus.

Now, associates are a self-assured bunch — especially at prestigious outfits like Boies that can afford to hire [only the most luxurious ex-Mossad spies for their clients](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/david-boies-takes-responsibility-for-enabling-harvey-weinstein/) — and they pride themselves for being the go-getters who will never bill less than 2200 hours. But it doesn’t always work that way. Some years the work just isn’t there. Sometimes you get randomly assigned to a dog of a case. Whatever the reason, there will be times when, through no fault of your own, you bill 2150. And when that happens, it’s worth knowing that you’ll likely be undercompensated relative to your peers.

On the other hand, if you’re reasonably sure that you’ll usually find yourself on the happy side of 2200 hours — “happy” as in better for your wallet, “unhappy” if we’re talking about your friends, family, estranged children, etc. — and that Boies will continue to be as busy as it’s been historically, then you may be more than willing to risk a down year here or there to know that you’ll be compensated better than your peers when you hit higher billing targets.

UPDATE: One point that a tipster made is that part of the issue is so MANY attorneys are billing in the higher register and earning the bigger bonuses that the firm simply can’t afford to be meeting market for those only billing 2000. It’s a fair point that speaks to knowing the nature of the firm you’re walking into — knowing that your bigger bonus for exceeding 2200 (or 2400) hours trades off with a market bonus for 2000 may be more than worth it.

This is all to say that this may well be a risk worth taking. It all comes down to what you want out of your annual paycheck and your career. Just arm yourself with full knowledge before you go in.

Remember, if you work at a firm with individualized bonuses it’s vitally important that you let us know your story or we’ll have no idea what’s going on inside the firm. Don’t be a freerider and hope that someone else will let us know! We work hard not to give away any information that would identify anyone, as the above story shows, so when you get your bonus, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”).

# Law Firms Can Save Tons Of Money By Continuing Virtual Work
## It may be difficult to persuade some lawyers to adopt a new way of thinking about real estate.

As discussed on this website at length recently, the legal industry is starting to return to normal as COVID-19 cases drop across the country. Many law firms have indicated that they will expect employees to return to the office soon in some fashion, and firms have adopted different policies surrounding how frequently attorneys and staff will need to be in their offices. For a variety of reasons, law firms should use all of the lessons they learned during the COVID-19 pandemic to promote remote work, and this can ultimately have a positive impact on the bottom lines of many law firms.

Most law firm managers would probably say that real estate costs are the biggest millstone impeding the financial success of a shop. Real estate costs are typically a large portion of the budgets of many law firms, depending on the cities in which the firm operates and other factors. In addition, real estate is ordinarily an inflexible expense for firms because it is not uncommon for law firms to sign leases for a decade or longer in certain instances. It is extremely difficult for firms to lower their real estate footprint to match headcount or rightsize financially if circumstances change, and this can have a negative impact on law firms.

In my own career, I have seen law firm managers struggle to deal with real estate costs. For instance, I once worked at a law firm that leased two floors of prime real estate in an expensive city. The firm eventually experienced changes, and they were unable to even fill one half of one floor of the space they had leased. The firm tried subletting some of the space, but the shop bled money unnecessarily because they could not get out of a long-term lease for those two floors. In addition, that firm would routinely open offices to handle a portfolio of work, but when the work dried up, they would be stuck with the remaining years on their lease.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
One solution to this inflexibility and expense is to keep real estate costs as low as possible by securing a minimal amount of space for a firm’s office. Of course, some attorneys and staff need physical offices to conduct work because of ethical walls and other issues, but most people do not need much workspace to be effective at their jobs. One of the ways that law firms can reduce their real estate footprint and costs is to promote work-from-home policies and encourage attorneys and staff to only come to the office a few days a week. Most people would gladly trade a smaller workspace for the flexibility afforded by work-from-home policies, and striking a middle balance ensures that firms reduce their overhead, maintain collaboration, and promote flexibility.

Nevertheless, some lawyers are unwilling to forgo traditional offices, either because they think clients want to be impressed by a physical space when they visit lawyers or because they think that in-person collaboration is best. In my experience, such lawyers tend to be more old-school attorneys who are used to a certain way of operating, and it may be difficult to persuade such lawyers to adopt a new way of thinking about real estate.

Before I started my own law firm (and years before the COVID-19 pandemic began) I worked at a shop that was spending a great deal of time and resources creating a new office space, what they called “the office of the future.” At the time, I told pretty much anyone who would listen that the “office of the future” was not to have an office, and that the firm would be better off reducing its real estate footprint and promoting remote work. Several years before the pandemic began, I based these opinions on the example of cheap communal workspaces that were blossoming in my area and policies of some employers that permitted employees to work from home a few days a week.

However, when I brought my opinions to the attention of a manager of that firm, my suggestions were summarily rejected, and I was told that virtual work kills collaboration. This administrator was not convinced by my assurances that attorneys these days collaborate by text, GChat, and other means and that there was little reason for everyone to see each other face-to-face every business day. This firm was one of the first shops to reopen last summer, possibly owing to the fact that the firm was paying for an expensive office. Of course, this shop created its new office space before the pandemic began and before administrators presumably learned insights about virtual work. However, if the firm promoted virtual work sooner, they could have been well-positioned for the transition to virtual work that has impacted the legal industry since the COVID-19 pandemic and the cost savings this can create.

In any event, I can discuss all of the benefits of remote work and how it reduces commuting times, affords employees the ability to better take care of family responsibilities, and other advantages. However, we all know that law firms are businesses, and they are far more likely to make decisions based on their bottom lines than any other factor. As such, it is important to discuss how promoting remote work can help law firms save money and afford them better flexibility in their operations. As law firms contemplate reopening offices and their real estate decisions in the future, they should consider the financial benefits of continuing virtual work.

# Former Federal Judge Reveals Why She Left The Bench For Biglaw

I was at the point where I had children who were approaching college, with a husband becoming an ex-husband who was just getting his feet on the ground at a law firm so he had not yet started to earn Big Law money. I frankly did not believe I could continue to perform as a judge because of the money.

— [Katherine Forrest](https://www.paulweiss.com/professionals/partners-and-counsel/katherine-b-forrest), formerly of the Southern District of New York, in comments given to the [National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/2023/02/03/a-double-edged-sword-why-young-judges-might-not-stick-around/), on why she decided leave the bench in favor of returning to Biglaw. She also noted that the high costs of living in New York City factored in to her decision to leave the judiciary. Forrest had served as a judge for seven years before she joined Cravath in 2018. She recently made a lateral partner move to Paul Weiss.

What lawyer is featured on this 39 cent U.S. postage stamp.

Hint: He’s the second name in one of the most famous early-20th Century (though now defunct) law firms, a firm that started the careers of the founders of multiple other global law firms including Marshall Skadden, Leslie Arps, George Cleary, Leo Gottlieb, Francis T.

# The Richest Firms That Still Haven't Announced Bonuses
## Profits per partner are over $1M, but the associates are still wondering about bonuses.

Bonus season is running a little slower than we’d expect, much to the chagrin of associates around the country. We have a running scorecard of the firms that have [moved so far](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/associate-compensation-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-bonuses-fall-2018/) but since one of the things [we’ve gleaned from this season so far](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/what-have-we-learned-from-biglaw-bonus-season-so-far/) is that firms aren’t matching as quickly as we generally expect, we thought it was time to put together a list of the firms holding out on us.

So, as far as we can tell as of this moment, the following are the U.S.-based law firms (or their U.S.-based verein outpost) with profits per equity partner exceeding $1 million that have yet to announce bonuses over two weeks after the fact. Some, like Boies Schiller, don’t announce bonuses per se because they buck the traditional format and offer something more akin to a revenue share for associates. It’s a known formula, so associates aren’t really sweating over there. We’re keeping them on this list of “non-announcers” for completeness. (UPDATE: Boies Schiller has now passed along the bonus numbers to their associates so they’re coming off.) Just take some of these names with that particular grain of salt.

Additionally, this list is limited to U.S. firms — not just firms operating in the U.S. Therefore holdouts like Linklaters aren’t included on this list.

Without further ado, here are the firms with $1M+ in profits per partner that have not yet announced bonuses to us. If you receive any information about these firms then let us know! Don’t just assume someone else told us. Please [email bonus news to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

A [helicopter made a crash landing](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2019/06/10/willkie-sidley-austin-offices-evacuated-after-manhattan-helicopter-crash/) atop a Manhattan high-rise this afternoon and the tragic event resulted in evacuations for a couple of Biglaw firms.

Willkie Farr and Sidley Austin are both quartered in 787 Seventh Avenue where the helicopter crashed, killing at least the pilot. Spokespeople from both firms told the NYLJ that all personnel from the firms were accounted for:

“It’s our understanding that the building has been successfully evacuated, along with all Sidley personnel. We executed our emergency protocols and are actively managing the situation,” according to a Sidley spokeswoman.

A Willkie spokeswoman confirmed “the entire building was evacuated.”

Reports from the building say the crash shook the building and started a minor fire. That said, folks might be back to work as soon as tomorrow.

# Comparing Your Client To The Mafia Isn't The Flex Biglaw Lawyer Thinks It Is

Madison Square Garden already enjoys the sort of public approval you’d expect from an organization that kicks a [mom escorting a Girl Scout troop out of a Christmas show](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/lawyer-mom-on-girl-scout-trip-gets-kicked-out-of-rockettes-christmas-show-due-to-law-firm-affiliation/). The woman worked at a law firm involved in a suit against a restaurant that MSG owns a stake in, and despite this having nothing to do with Radio City Music Hall, [MSG pays for advanced facial recognition software](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/the-latest-in-litigation-hotness-pure-pettiness/) to deliver some bush league bullying upon anyone on a firm website. After the Girl Scout story, most companies would launch a public relations campaign to salvage its reputation, but MSG is not most companies.

When a company doubles down on a policy that a judge already branded “[the stupidest thing I’ve ever read](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/madison-square-garden-doubles-down-plaintiffs-lawyer-ban-even-after-it-backfires-2022-11-15/),” you’re not dealing with a company interested in improving its reputation. Cartoonish (and often bumbling) supervillainy is a brand for nepo baby James Dolan. And that brand is so pervasive that MSG’s attorney, King & Spalding’s Randy Mastro, doesn’t balk at breezily comparing the company to… some [interesting characters](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/16/technology/madison-square-garden-ban-lawyers.html):

In court in October, a lawyer for the company, Randy Mastro, told the State Supreme Court judge, Lyle Frank, that “lawyers sometimes alienate people.” Mr. Mastro said he had experienced being on a banned list himself when he cracked down on the mafia as a federal prosecutor. “There are some Italian restaurants I couldn’t get a reservation at,” he said. “I didn’t sue them.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
You see, Your Honor, my client is simply running its business like an organized criminal racketeering operation with a legendary penchant for murder and intimidation.

Obviously, that’s not how Mastro intended to this comment to go over. But when you reach for a favorable comparison to your client’s behavior and the best you can come up with is “the mob” you should probably ask yourself if arguing by analogy might be more trouble than it’s worth.

Sometimes discretion is the better part of valor and “we’re a lot like the Gambino crime family” is one of those times.

A new piece by former Above the Law editor Kashmir Hill [tracks the history of a 1900s NY law designed to protect theater critics from the wrath of wealthy venues](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/16/technology/madison-square-garden-ban-lawyers.html) that lawyers are successfully citing to protect themselves against petty retaliation. And that’s where we are at this point: petty retaliation.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Because there’s a colorable argument that a specific venue should bar an attorney from going to the scene of a slip and fall and ex parte chatting with employees. That doesn’t extend to taking revenge on some Girl Scouts at Radio City over a lawsuit involving a completely different venue that happens to be another tentacle in Dolan’s failson empire.

It’s not even clear that MSG could fully turn its back on this petty lifestyle even if it wanted to. It might let one future Girl Scout into a show, but then another complaint will come in and Dolan won’t be able to stop himself from issuing another ban.

To borrow from a movie about a company like MSG, “Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!”

[[Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/greg-gianforte-assault_us_59261430e4b061d8f81f1253/)] * Here comes the ""Marc Kasowitz's ties to Russia"" stories. Newsflash: Russians have a lot of businesses that get sued. Let's not make an equivalence between representing a Russian bank and handing them classified intelligence. [[CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/24/politics/trump-attorney-kasowitz/)] * The D.C. Circuit seems like they might actually save the CFPB. At least until there's an appeal to some politically hostile higher court.

# Make That Two Fine Messes

People way smarter than I will continue to dissect the Supreme Court’s Harvard/UNC affirmative action decision and figure out how to play the hand that has now been dealt. Hockey legend [Wayne Gretzky’s words apply here](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/wayne_gretzky_383282#google_vignette): play to where the puck is going to be, not to where the puck has been.

With that admonition in mind, we knew — or should have known — where this affirmative action puck was going.

So, where is the puck going to go? Where are we headed in the legal world on DEI initiatives? We have made progress, but there is still far to go. We (and I am using the editorial “we” here) have worked to get as far as we have (not very far at all if you look at the most recent stats about women equity partners and leaders as well as women GCs) to make the profession look more like the clients we represent, the world we live in today.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
A 2018 Associated Press survey noted [disparities within our profession](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/jul/02/workplace-diversity-dei-supreme-court-affirmative-action). Its analysis found that “in the legal field, the ratio of white workers to Black workers was seven to one. In management, the ratio was 10 to one.” Anyone surprised? What happens to the [Mansfield Rule](https://www.diversitylab.com/mansfield-rule-4-0/), where participating law firms and corporate legal departments have pledged to consider women and minority candidates?

What happens to the push for diversity within firm ranks? (And I am not talking just about associate ranks, but rather equity partner ranks, firm leadership ranks.) What happens to the push for diversity in corporate legal departments? (Again, I am not talking just about staff attorney positions, but about leadership positions as well.) Do these initiatives go forward from this point? If so, how? Will there be continued support for them? And if they continue, how much litigation is on the horizon? Full employment for employment lawyers? What happens now to judicial selections where the goal has been to diversify the bench and progress has been made?

How to maintain a diversity pipeline without running afoul of the prohibition of affirmative action? How will law school admissions be impacted? If law firms and corporate legal departments are serious about DEI, would it be wise to start recruiting from other than the Tier 1 law schools? Would that give graduates from “lesser” schools opportunities that they haven’t had because elitism has ignored their value? What do you think? Granted, the case only discusses affirmative action in the context of college admissions, but you don’t need to be Evel Knievel to make the leap to the workplace.

What is hiring going to look like going forward? How will employers, law firms and legal departments try to continue to create diverse workforces? It wouldn’t be surprising to see [more reverse discrimination claims](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/affirmative-action-ruling-sets-up-clash-over-workplace-diversity) and the disbanding of workplace affinity groups.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Questions, questions, questions, and I have no answers, answers, answers. The only thing that I am sure of is that there will be more litigation, testing theories we thought were settled law.

One commentator in The Guardian noted that this case is just an “amuse bouche,” that the true target is racial equity in the workplace. Agreed, but I am not at all sure that the target will stop there. Religious and ethnic targets may well follow. We’ve seen this all before in law and society and, chillingly, it could be a playbook for the future.

And do you think that the court’s opinion in 303 Creative will end there? So, the website designer can legally discriminate against same-sex couples because she [doesn’t want to serve gay people](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/supreme-court-303-creative-anti-gay-opinion/?utm_campaign=Above%20the%20Law%20Daily&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=264734090&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_jWL24UaV-2Y444kJzVwCC-rZ6tXFeN3Df2FTTVrGBy_G-r6NRXGv-XLO4M6m-SpHLr2HBxjKCcbsnBqYl8-9m69j6MA&utm_content=264734090&utm_source=hs_email).

How about some hypotheticals here? (Remember those from law school?) Could the holding in 303 Creative extend to website designers (and others) who don’t want to serve people celebrating a religious event, such as a bar or bat mitzvah or a confirmation? What about a refusal to design a website for a couple whose religious beliefs don’t align with the website designer? What if the couple wants a religious symbol on the website or a saying or two that clearly defines the religion of the couple? Go ahead and fill in whatever religion you want. What about interracial couples who want photos of the happy couple on the website? What if the website designer objects to interracial marriage on religious grounds?

I doubt that limiting the holding to same-sex couples will be the case for very long, given the apparent predilection of this court’s majority to turn back the judicial clock (and this country) to a time that comports with philosophies that we had thought we consigned to the “dustbin of history.” We may have left them behind, but the majority of this court has not.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The Harvard/UNC opinion says that it’s wrong to discriminate based on race, which is an opinion that Chief Justice John Roberts has held for years. However, 303 Creative says it’s now OK to discriminate based on the free exercise of religion. So, ordinary citizens (e.g., not legal scholars) may well decide that while discriminating on the basis of race is not OK, it’s perfectly fine to discriminate while hiding behind the free exercise of religion clause of the First Amendment.

“[Another fine mess](https://idiomorigins.org/origin/heres-another-fine-mess-youve-gotten-me-into-stanley),” Oliver Hardy’s purported catchphrase to Stan Laurel, applies to both decisions.

We’re not headed back to the future, but back to the past. Apologies to Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd.

Earlier this week, Americans received a rather [stark warning](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/02/25/metro/cdc-says-people-should-start-preparing-coronavirus-spreading-us/) from federal health officials about the inevitable spread of coronavirus in the U.S. “[T]his could be bad,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during a press briefing. “It’s not so much of a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen.”

Biglaw firms across the country are taking the news seriously, echoing the actions of their colleagues abroad and imposing travel restrictions and canceling events.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
According to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2020/02/26/paul-weiss-restricts-travel-orrick-cancels-partner-retreat-over-coronavirus-fears/), the following firms have either postponed or outright canceled their partner meetings and retreats:

- Orrick – the firm’s partnership retreat in San Antonio, Texas, has reportedly been rescheduled over coronavirus concerns
- Norton Rose – partners from certain locations (e.g., China) were not permitted to travel to the firm’s partners meeting in Austin, Texas, due to coronavirus fears
- Duane Morris – the firm’s Asia partners meeting has been canceled, but a firmwide meeting is still planned to be held in Atlanta, Georgia, next month
- Baker Botts – partners from Asian offices will not be permitted to attend the firm’s partner conference in Scottsdale, Arizona
Other firms are prohibiting and limiting travel to and within countries that have been stricken by coronavirus outbreaks:

- Baker Botts – the firm is not permitting any employees to travel to mainland China and will limit travel to Hong Kong to trips made for “essential business purposes” only, and such trips must be approved by management
- Paul Weiss – the firm will not allow any “non-essential” business trips to and from Mainland China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, and Italy, and anyone who has traveled to or from those countries (or who was in close contact with someone traveling to or from them) must work from home for at least 14 days after traveling and may return to the office only if they are symptom-free

Work travel and meeting attendance come second when your health could be at stake.

“This is not something we came up with on our own. This is the advice we are giving to clients,” [Michael] Delikat, [an employment partner at Orrick,] said. “The focus has shifted to preventing transmission.”

He said clients, similarly, are canceling management retreats, banning all travel and rethinking other large gatherings of employees, except for mission-critical travel. Companies are no longer just limiting travel to China, he said, mentioning the possibility of employees, during a work trip, possibly coming in contact with travelers who may have been exposed to coronavirus in a number of countries.

The artist formerly known as Kanye West is [out there defending Hitler](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kanye-wests-love-of-hitler-and-nazis-allegedly-goes-back-20-years-1234647700/). Kyrie Irving is posting links to [films dabbling in Holocaust denialism](https://www.nytimes.com/article/kyrie-irving-antisemitic.html). Donald Trump is [dining with white nationalists](https://www.npr.org/2022/11/29/1139742844/republicans-denounce-trump-dinner-white-supremacist-nick-fuentes). States are banning history books for [acknowledging that segregation existed](https://www.chron.com/politics/article/Texas-book-ban-Ruby-Bridges-desegregation-17066921.php). Racism and antisemitism have never lived all that far from the core of American society, but it’s gotten a lot more in our face over the last year. Even the New York Times put out a [Swastika-themed Sunday Crossword](https://www.thedailybeast.com/nyt-readers-shocked-by-sunday-crossword-puzzle-that-resembles-swastika). (Happy Hanukkah from the Times!)

Of all those examples, the Times probably didn’t intend to endorse Nazis, but failing to check itself in the current climate amounts to “puzzle page malpractice.”

But, as an institution, Biglaw fancies itself shielded from these currents. Attorneys are, by design, more educated than the average person. Firms can be a hotbed of implicit bias and discrimination, but generally speaking the professional setting tamps down explicit displays of bigotry. Not that implicit intolerance is any more “innocent” than explicit intolerance. It’s just that explicit prejudice carries a lot of extra baggage — everything’s a lot more broken when someone is willing to say it out loud.

While this story is about the national wave of bigotry cropping up at one Biglaw firm, the moral of the story is that this isn’t unique to one Biglaw firm. This could come up at any firm and the proper takeaway from this incident is to recognize that no firm is immune and most firms aren’t doing enough to stay vigilant against this scourge.

In November, McDermott Will & Emery hosted an Associate Retreat. One of the events offered was a diversity and inclusion program. During the program, the presenter asked the audience of associates what they hide about themselves at work. Responses were displayed anonymously on the screen behind her. Two responses included “white pride” and “Nazism.”

Now, why would anyone set up a system to post unmoderated, anonymous messages on a screen in 2022? Didn’t we all learn this lesson in 2013? Internet Historian can explain what happened at the Agile Conference back then:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Are there really Nazis at MWE? Probably not. Does it really matter? Also probably not. Despite the above video’s more smirking take on “professionalism,” this is blatant harassment in any context. And posting bigotry on a diversity and inclusion presentation board is even worse because it conveys direct contempt for the subject.

Over at The Atlantic, Yair Rosenberg had a great essay on [why Dave Chappelle’s latest SNL monologue was so problematic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/11/why-its-become-harder-to-joke-about-anti-semitism/672120/). Chappelle touched on the rise in antisemitism with his now-standard “why can’t we make jokes about this anymore” angle. As Rosenberg points out, it is actually getting harder to joke about antisemitism — not because of the vague woke mob that exists in Chappelle’s head, but because this shit has gotten way too real:

When so many people have proved so susceptible to the conspiracism that animates anti-Semitism, it becomes harder and harder to laugh about it. Comedy cannot be divorced from its context. Jokes assume a shared set of presuppositions between the comedian and the audience, which are subverted for ironic effect. But when that collective context is called into question, and one no longer knows whether everyone in the room is operating from the same premises, what was once satire becomes suspect. After all, the best parody is often indistinguishable from the thing itself—the perfect impressionist is the one who sounds exactly like Donald Trump. But when the performance is anti-Semitism, and so much of society seems in thrall to its essential elements, it’s not clear whether the bit is setting up a punch line—or just a punch.

Which is all to say that white pride “jokes” during a diversity panel aren’t jokes. They’re racial attacks whether the troll subjectively thinks they are or not.

A McDermott representative shared details about the firm’s response:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
During an interactive diversity training, two anonymous comments constituting hate speech were posted to a word cloud on screen. The facilitator, a renowned diversity, inclusion and bias expert, immediately addressed one of the comments in real time using the example to encourage education and understanding of actions that perpetuate discrimination. The next morning during the general session, which was the next time that the entire group was gathered, chairman Ira Coleman detailed the incident and strongly condemned all forms of hate speech and discriminatory behavior and reaffirmed the firm’s dedication to a culture valuing diversity and inclusion. He reiterated that this behavior, even if made in jest, would not be tolerated.

The firm also explained that it “is moving forward with the group’s recommendations for annual mandatory bias training for all employees, as well as further training for leadership” and plans to “engage all employees in professionally moderated small group discussions aiming to help bridge differences through the sharing of personal experiences.”

That said, one tipster noted that a number of associates didn’t make it to the retreat and therefore never heard the message the next morning and that “no email was sent firmwide condemning the racist and antisemitic statements and still has not.” Which strikes me as a side effect of the lawyerly impulse to “do things” without recognizing the value of just communicating. Booking anti-bias training is critical, but just keeping the rest of the firm aware that leadership is on top of it at every step matters too.

And firms shouldn’t wait until something like this happens to keep spreading that message. Because this stuff thrives when trolls see diversity and inclusion as some sort of tertiary box that gets checked once a year — a compulsory session that they can shrug off as unimportant. Building a culture requires constant communication.

It’s unfortunate that McDermott had to be hit with this one first, but the rest of the profession should take heed that firms aren’t immune to the negative forces out there. Keep the conversation going and keep anti-discrimination efforts in the foreground.

# Biglaw Firm Announces Bonuses As Well As An Incredibly Flexible Reopening Plan
## Associates are happy about one part, kind of pissed about the other.

As we get closer and closer to the unofficial start of summer that is Memorial Day, more and more law firms are coming forward to announce their plans for making a return to the office in the wake of the pandemic. The majority of firms have recognized that flexibility is key when it comes to bringing lawyers and staff members back to the office, and we’ve now heard from an Am Law 100 firm with a plan that’s flexible as can be.

Last week, Venable — a firm that came in at No. 65 on the latest Am Law 100 ranking, having brought in $681,864,000 gross revenue in 2020 — notified all employees of its “gradual return to the office.” How gradual, you ask? Right now, the firm isn’t even providing a firm reopening date. Here are some additional details from a memo emailed on behalf of Stuart Ingis, Venable’s chairman:

The firm will not set a single reopening date but is planning a range of activities to allow all of us to ramp up over the summer and to populate our offices in greater numbers beginning in September.

The firm will continue to provide flexibility for remote work for most roles for the foreseeable future, balancing the needs of practice groups, departments, and job responsibilities. As we go through the summer, we will provide more specific guidance regarding policies, practices, and expectations for post-Labor Day. As we repopulate our offices, we will maintain COVID protocols and office health and safety measures and evolve them as appropriate to reflect changes in guidance from public health authorities and state and local governments. We strongly urge those of you who are able to be vaccinated to do so.

All Venable personnel are encouraged to go to the office sometime this summer, where a few happy hours, team meals, and other voluntary events will be taking place. On top of all of this flexibility, the firm announced “a modest but heartfelt thank you stipend” for all eligible employees. Here are the details:

Professional staff, paralegals, staff attorneys, policy advisors, trademark counsel, patent agents, and nurse consultants with annual salaries less than $120,000 will receive a $1,000 payment. Individuals in those roles earning $120,000 or more will receive $2,500. Associates and eligible counsel [those promoted in 2020 and 2021] will receive $5,000. These payments will be made on June 18 to those in good standing on the day of the payment to express the Partnership’s appreciation to you.

Granted, this is a far cry from the special bonuses that have made their way across Biglaw this spring, but on the bright side, unlike at some firms, there aren’t any billable requirements attached to the Venable’s stipend. According to one of our sources, “people are happy about the flexibility on return to office, but less happy about the COVID money (although grateful for something).”

Another source offered these thoughts:

Most associates are keenly aware of how far under market this falls. Everyone is grateful for something but senior associates especially feel miffed compared to rest of market.

Handing out bonuses that are woefully under market, as “heartfelt” as they may be, is perhaps inappropriate during a time when the lateral market is on fire, but who are we to tell a firm how to run its business. Nonetheless, kudos to Venable for its incredibly flexible reopening plan. Announcing that at the same time as these small stipends was likely enough to take some of the sting away.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

# Klobuchar Staffers Complain Like Whiny Biglaw Associates
## Some bosses are tough. Deal with it.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)

Washington, as a city, is soft. Everyone down there postures like they’re living out some Machiavellian fantasy camp, but it’s just a toxic melange of spoiled brats and rank incompetents. While the country relies upon its officials to keep the government open, these people can’t stop bitching about the “profound discrimination” they face [whenever they go to a Chili’s](https://wamu.org/story/18/06/25/d-c-bars-restaurants-refuse-service-trump-officials/) or lamenting that they can’t find anyone willing to [swipe right for a right-wing thug](https://www.spin.com/2018/06/trump-staffers-dating-dc-politico/). Even the lawyers in DC can’t help [but whine about everything](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/05/why-are-d-c-lawyers-such-frigging-babies/).

Which is why the tempest in a teapot brewing over [Senator Amy Klobuchar’s treatment of her staff](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/10/amy-klobuchar-2020-staff-horror-stories-1160780) is the height of ludicrous.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The run-up to Klobuchar’s expected presidential campaign launch on Sunday was sidetracked by former aides, speaking anonymously for fear of retribution, who described a toxic office environment including [demeaning emails](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amy-klobuchar-abuse-staff-2020_us_5c5a1cb1e4b0871047588649), [thrown office supplies](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/mollyhensleyclancy/amy-klobuchar-staff-2020-election) and requests for staff to [perform personal chores](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5c5db1ece4b03afe8d674530) for the senator. It’s a sharp departure from the public brand that Klobuchar has built to get to this moment: a pragmatic, aw-shucks Minnesotan who gets things done and wins her state by landslide margins.

I’m so sorry the job of running a country wasn’t the non-stop party the staff expected coming off their legacy Harvard appointments.

Klobuchar grew up as a lawyer practicing at Dorsey & Whitney and Gray Plant Mooty in Minnesota for almost a decade before running for public office. Big firms and big firms, folks. It’s the football of professional America — a culture of yelling and bravado that keeps passing itself on to the next generation, documented health crises be damned.

This isn’t to say the [culture of bullying in Biglaw](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/the-bullying-in-biglaw-is-off-the-charts-and-managing-partners-are-too-scared-to-stop-it/) is a good thing. Left unchecked it can demolish morale and there’s not a ton to suggest that fear actually brings the best out of workers — [free pizza seems does a better job](https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/study-says-pizza-works-better-than-cash-to-motivate-employees-but-one-thing-work.html). Plus, the[ fundamentally brotastic culture](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/the-screaming-in-law-firms-needs-to-end/) that Biglaw abuse engenders can easily spill over into sexual harassment — even if at the top the culture flows from a woman.

It’s just not something to pout about and the only aspect of this story that should be raising questions about her presidential aspirations is whether she can hire an Interior Secretary who won’t start crying under their desk.

It may be a tough culture, it may not be for everybody, but if it’s not something you can hack, then get out. People bail on Biglaw every day. Others stick around and try their hand at reforming the workplace or lending their support to the terrorized staff. Klobuchar should be a better boss. Hopefully someday that will change and she’ll learn to inspire with a little more carrot and a little less scathing indictment. [Harry Reid apparently privately intervened](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amy-klobuchar-mistreat-staff-harry-reid_us_5c5db1ece4b03afe8d674530) to help improve staff conditions in Klobuchar’s office, and that’s an entirely appropriate way of dealing with a situation like this.

But the only level of narcissism that tops someone who thinks they need to create a culture of fear to get the best from their staff is the narcissism that believes your work woes deserve to be aired in public on the weekend your old boss announces a presidential bid.

Diversity and inclusion in the legal profession are, as they say, “having a moment.” And let’s hope that it’s more than a moment, since there’s [so much work to be done](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/ball-dont-lie-what-percentage-of-biglaw-partners-are-white/).

Here at Above the Law, we have a columnist, [Renwei Chung](https://abovethelaw.com/author/renweichung/), who focuses on diversity and inclusion issues each Friday. If you have diversity-related news that might merit coverage, please feel free to [contact him](https://abovethelaw.com/author/renweichung/).

Other ATL writers and editors cover diversity issues as well, of course. Earlier this month, for example, I wrote a piece entitled [4 Ideas For Advancing Diversity And Inclusion In The Legal Profession](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/4-ideas-for-advancing-diversity-and-inclusion-in-the-legal-profession/?rf=1), based on a great [event](http://www.bna.com/Big-Law-Business-Diversity-and-Inclusion-Agenda/) I attended that was hosted by Big Law Business.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Today’s post is in some sense a follow-up on or continuation of my prior story. At the Big Law Business event, I chatted with [David Kinnear](https://www.doar.com/bio/?emp=davidkinnear-bio), director of corporate strategy at [DOAR](https://www.doar.com/about-us/), a leading litigation consulting firm that works with many top law firms (including my former employer, Wachtell Lipton). Kinnear invited me to a [diversity leadership breakfast](https://www.doar.com/company-news/event/diversity-inclusion-in-law-legal-services-breakfast-hosted-by-doar-citizens-bank-and-bernero-press/) that DOAR hosted last Friday in its spacious, loft-like Manhattan offices. The event was co-hosted by DOAR, [Citizens Bank](https://www.citizensbank.com/), and [Bernero & Press](http://berneropress.com/), the legal consulting firm.

Here are some key takeaways from the wide-ranging and insightful discussion:

1. Litigators: make sure you have diverse trial teams.

One of DOAR’s specialties is jury consulting, so it made sense to launch the panel with a presentation by jury consultant Ellen Brickman, Ph.D., who shared some research she conducted regarding gender in the courtroom. She pointed out some depressing realities:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
- A third or less of attorneys appearing in criminal and civil cases are women.
- Female litigators report discrimination by opposing counsel, judges, clients, and colleagues.
- Explicit bias is becoming less acceptable, but implicit bias is still a major problem.
Brickman and her colleagues conducted a survey of more than 1,300 mock jurors from large metropolitan areas. Survey participants read a two-page opening statement and then had to rate it. Half the respondents were told it was delivered by a man (“Patrick”) and half were told it was delivered by a woman (“Patricia”). Some findings:

- Although survey participants rated the lawyers as largely comparable overall, they did perceive the woman attorney’s opening to be angrier, more argumentative, less friendly, and less effective.
- In terms of persuasiveness, male respondents’ ratings of the female attorney were lower than the female respondents’ ratings of the male attorney, female respondents’ rating of the female attorney, and male respondents’ rating of the male attorney.
- Female jurors showed an implicit bias towards female attorneys.
What implications does this have for trial lawyers? Per Brickman:

- Diversify your trial team to take advantage of female jurors’ affinity for female attorneys (but avoid “tokenism” — having women at counsel table who don’t play any meaningful role).
- Attend to jurors’ gender-based perceptions; use emotion carefully in presentations.
- Build connections to jurors’ personal experiences.

In closing, Brickman did warn against placing too much reliance on gender considerations. Research shows that jurors rely most heavily on the evidence before them; that’s their key consideration. But when the evidence is weak or contradictory, then extra-evidentiary factors start to come into play.

2. Corporate America cares about diversity — so its law firms should too.

Kelly Tullier, executive vice president and general counsel at Visa, talked about her company’s commitment to diversity. Visa went public only in 2008, so it’s at an earlier stage of its diversity journey than some other companies, and the industries it belongs to — finance and technology — are not known as leaders in diversity and inclusion. But Visa already has a chief diversity officer and a committee within the company to focus on these issues, and its board is 55 percent diverse. Visa’s investors care about diversity, which [helps improve](http://www.acritas.com/news/american-lawyer-diversity-report) [financial performance](http://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/gender-diversity-investment-framework?cid=sm_corp_twt_may_13_2016), so Visa discusses its diversity progress in its securities filings.

When Visa hires outside counsel, it focuses on substantive expertise; as GC, Tullier must explain to the board why she hired X firm for Y matter. But it focuses on diversity as well; it wants its matters staffed by diverse teams. Staffing requires performing actual work on a case. Tullier’s pet peeve is “tokenization” — bringing a woman or lawyer of color to a meeting, but not letting that lawyer say anything.

3. Pay attention to the pipeline.

Joan McPhee, a longtime litigation partner at Ropes & Gray, noted this conundrum: women graduate from law school in roughly equal numbers to men, then excel academically and as young lawyers, but somehow fail to reach the leadership ranks in the profession. What’s going on?

Some say that women “opt out” — they voluntarily leave legal practice, for various reasons — but McPhee said she hasn’t really seen this at her firm. And if it is true, then why do women opt out? There’s no clear or easy answer as to why women leave large law firms or the legal profession, according to McPhee.

Part of the problem: we as a profession are not doing a good job of developing women lawyers, especially women trial lawyers. Practicing law, especially practicing law at a large law firm, is difficult. McPhee talked about the many times that she wanted to quit, especially when she was juggling the demands of her practice with raising three young children.

A key to retaining talent is making people feel they’re part of the team. “I’m crazy about my colleagues,” McPhee said. “That sense of belonging is what helped me make it through. Without it, law firms can be lonely and isolating places.”

4. Collect information and opinions about diversity issues, and customize your approaches accordingly.

We’ve talked before about the [importance of data](//abovethelaw.com/2016/05/4-ideas-for-advancing-diversity-and-inclusion-in-the-legal-profession/) (and so have others, such as former in-house lawyer [Casey Flaherty](https://twitter.com/DCaseyF/status/733664457306476544)). The point received reinforcement from panelist Milana Hogan, chief legal recruiting and professional development officer at Sullivan & Cromwell.

One example Hogan gave: mentorship programs. Based on talking to members of S&C’s affinity groups, the firm customized its programs based on what the group members felt most comfortable with — e.g., two associates mentoring one more-junior associate in one group, or one partner mentoring one associate in another group. A one-size-fits all approach should be avoided — and diversity programs should be revisited and updated to reflecting changing conditions.

5. Just do it.

If you go to enough diversity events, you can get what panel moderator Peter Wilson Jr., diversity and inclusion officer at Proskauer, referred to as “diversity fatigue.” One can get tired of hearing the same talking points raised again and again.

What’s the solution? It’s time to take action, according to former New Jersey attorney general and current Patterson Belknap partner Peter Harvey.

“Enough of this dialogue,” Harvey said. “Hire people. You can complete all these surveys and have all these surveys and have all these dialogues, but if there’s no sanction or incentive for anything, you’ll get the same results.”

One example he gave: who is the relationship partner for a given client? If diverse lawyers aren’t relationship partners, they won’t have power within their firms. “If you’re not the relationship partner and the work dries up,” Harvey warned, “it gets a little dramatic.”

Harvey urged in-house lawyers to demand diversity from their outside counsel. “When brains were doled out, they weren’t given just to a certain group of people or a certain gender,” he said.

Once you reach a certain level of law firm, everyone is capable of doing the work. So companies should prioritize diversity as well as skill when selecting counsel, according to Harvey. Speak up when you don’t see women or lawyers of color at meetings or on your matters.

And if your outside law firm refuses to work with you on diversity, Harvey told the in-house lawyers in the room, then you can take your business elsewhere. You can quote to them the words of Beyoncé, he said: “I can find another you in a minute.”

# Learning And Leverage: Modern Must-Haves
## With the advent of online learning platforms like Skillshare, Udemy, and Brilliant, upskilling has never been easier.

I have worked in Biglaw, in-house, and as the CEO of a legal tech business, and throughout these different environments, I have noticed some patterns. Patterns of success if you will. But they aren’t highly complicated. And, they do not include zigzagging between 18-hour workdays and three different jobs. They are simple — yet effective — patterns. Two of the most powerful of these factors for success are learning and leverage.

Learning — The King Of The Hill

We are in the later stages of the transition from a degree-based economy to a skills-based one. Your qualifications are gradually becoming worthless because businesses have begun valuing what you can do more than where you studied. Now more than ever, hirers are paying attuning to the small sections of your CV listing your skills and other abilities. Applicants who have taken some online programming courses may be hired over a person with an IT degree, simply because they are more proficient.

In some ways, this shows a greater initiative to build up several “micro-credentials” for yourself, suggesting that it would be highly valuable to learn a variety of new things. Employers increasingly seek out this level of initiative. With the advent of online learning platforms like Skillshare, Udemy, and Brilliant, upskilling has never been easier.

Learning is not just done online, however, it is done by building experience, as well. You can plan as much as you like, thinking about things from every conceivable angle, but I can guarantee that, when it comes down to making your plans happen, there will be factors that surprise you. Things that you did not expect would happen or even things that you did not know existed. Sometimes the fastest way to learn is just to dive head into it and wait for the mistakes to start teaching you.

The secret to being the King (or Queen!) of the Hill is to keep growing, to continue upskilling. Your knowledge should not just grow in terms of depth, but breadth, as well. You want to master your field but should be competent in other ones too. This doesn’t just give you job security; it gives you options.

Leverage — Accept The Augmentation

Then there is leverage, which is something of a hot topic in the corporate world. This is not new. The basic idea is that you utilize one thing to achieve something greater. If you have leverage, you’re an aerodynamic leaf with sails, and you won’t just be caught up in the wind, you’ll harness it.

Currently, the biggest form of leverage is technology. Developments such as the internet, AI, and blockchain have allowed you to do things you never would have been able to before. When it comes to technology, you cannot deny its impact. That is not to say that you must embrace all of it, nor that technology is always the answer.

Leo Cherne once said, “The computer is incredibly fast, accurate, and stupid. Man is unbelievably slow, inaccurate, and brilliant. The marriage of the two is a force beyond calculation.” Leverage is marrying skills and advantages. They make a power couple. Like AI and contract review, or musicians and apps like Spotify. As a lawyer or an employee, you leverage yourself by doing the things that machines can’t do, making yourself indispensable by taking on roles that can be neither automated nor eradicated.

Adding Value — The Pinnacle

The culmination of learning and leverage is found in the basic principle of adding value. Whether you are an employer, employee, or freelancer, at the end of the day, you are paid to add value. That may be through a service you offer, or the unique input and perspective you bring to a meeting. Whatever it is, you can add value by learning and then leveraging yourself and your abilities. Learning a new programming language could help you recognize flaws in your system or taking a course on public speaking could increase your sales. Even something like researching empathy could improve what you bring to the table.

For you, the modern lawyer –- or the modern employee in general –- upskilling, outworking, and expanding will put you a cut above the rest. Leveraging your unique selling points and technology will catapult you leagues above where you are now. Such is the power of the simplistic patterns of learning and leverage, the two main components in the framework of adding value.

# Struggling Biglaw Firm Begins The Process Of Dissolution
## Whatever lawyers are left at LeClairRyan are being encouraged to find new firms.

If you’ve been following along with the trials and tribulations of the Biglaw firm LeClairRyan, then news that the firm has begun the process of dissolution is not shocking at all. After all, [partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/the-partner-departures-at-this-biglaw-firm-are-really-piling-up/) have been[ deserting](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/biglaw-firm-that-just-lost-over-a-dozen-partner-loses-even-more/) the firm [en masse](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/biglaw-firm-loses-over-a-dozen-partners-as-more-firms-spread-to-boston/), including [name partner Gary LeClair](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/name-partner-bolts-from-struggling-biglaw-firm/); their lender has prevented the firm from returning [departing partners’ capital contributions](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/biglaw-firm-prohibited-by-lender-from-returning-former-partners-capital-contributions/); they gave staff [WARN Act notice ](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/is-this-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-this-biglaw-firm/)of coming mass layoffs; and[ they’re being sued](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/problems-pile-on-for-struggling-biglaw-firm/) for not paying rent on one of the firm’s office and for gender discrimination. So the writing has been on the wall.

Now comes a report that the wind-down process has begun and whatever lawyers are left at LeClairRyan are being encouraged to find new firms. As [reported by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/07/31/leclairryan-takes-steps-to-dissolve-as-its-lawyers-seek-new-homes/) Law.com:

Firm attorneys have been told a wind-down committee is in the works, sources said, and partners are eyeing a few different law firms where large groups might land. For instance, a group of attorneys is talking with Northeast regional firm Barclay Damon. That firm’s managing partner, John Langan, declined to comment.

The firm’s revenue has also been in decline, from $142 million in 2017 to $122 million in 2018. To stem some of the issues, the firm launched “[law firm 2.0](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/the-biglaw-firm-that-keep-losing-partners-is-revamping-their-leadership-structure/)” and embarked on a strategic partnership with UnitedLex, an alternative legal service provider. But that hasn’t stopped the onslaught of problems for the firm, and alumni of the firm say the problems go back even further:

Michael Volkov, a white-collar partner in Washington, D.C., who left in 2013, blamed leadership and compensation decisions that long predated the firm’s partnership with UnitedLex. As for what’s unfolding there now, he summed up, “What a disaster.”

LeClairRyan has yet to offer a comment of the firm’s status.

# Justin Kan Answers The Call: The Rise Of Atrium (Part II)
## Law firms are resisting the adoption of technology or because of the hourly model. Atrium is here to change that.

Justin Kan

By now, you have heard that [Atrium is seeking to solve The Paradox](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/competition-is-for-losers-the-rise-of-atrium-part-i/), leverage and develop legal technology, and become the largest multi-practice law firm in the United States.

Not surprising, given that Justin Kan, a serial entrepreneur with several successful startups, including [Twitch](https://go.twitch.tv/), brings the DNA of Silicon Valley to this venture. Justin has been at the heart of the Valley through multiple successful startups and sits as a partner in Y Combinator, which has helped fund almost 1,500 startups. When everyone in your neighborhood is trying to get to the moon, split genes to cure cancer, or invent the next cryptocurrency, solving the deep problems in the legal industry should be a cakewalk.

Right? Maybe?

Let’s find out. The alt.legal crew, Joe and Ed, are teaming up for this interview with Justin Kan to get inside the head of the [Atrium](https://www.atriumlts.com/) founder on his background, his reasons for starting Atrium, and his strategy to win.

Joe Borstein:  Justin, great to meet you.  Tell me about your background in tech (Y Combinator and Twitch).  Most importantly, I’d like to hear about the parade of horribles you experienced which led you to explode the status quo in legal!

Justin Kan: I’ve been an entrepreneur for the past 12 years, since I graduated from Yale undergrad with a degree in Physics and Philosophy, and realized I had no actual marketable job skills.

JB: Physics and philosophy? Not the typical Silicon Valley titan.

JK: I think you’d be surprised by how many entrepreneurs got there because they were basically unemployable (Physics and Philosophy is not the most practical of degrees).

But through a combination of hard work, luck, working with the right people, and a healthy dose of ignorance about how painful founding startups can be, I’ve had a few successes along the way. Most notably, against all odds (and professional advice we received), we turned our live video platform, [justin.tv](https://archive.org/details/justintv), into a platform for watching other people stream video games called Twitch, which was [acquired by Amazon in 2014](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-twitch/amazon-snaps-up-live-video-startup-twitch-for-970-million-idUSKBN0GP1N820140825) for $970mm.

In the past few years, I’ve also been an investor here in Silicon Valley as a partner at [Y Combinator](http://www.ycombinator.com/). The unifying factor in my career across investing and entrepreneurship was that the whole time I’ve basically been an involuntary power user of legal services. No matter what I’ve wanted to accomplish, whether it was raising capital, investing in a startup, or selling a company, legal has always been a cost and a roadblock to the ultimate goal.

Ed Sohn: You may have had more than your share of bad experiences. I apologize on behalf of lawyers everywhere.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
JK: That’s not to say that my experiences were all bad. In fact, I’ve had many lawyers who I felt provided excellent advice and service during important decisions or difficult times. That being said, I always wondered why the law firms that serve the most innovative technology companies in the world rarely adopt innovative software or try to improve their business operations. As a client, I wanted legal services to be more transparent, less often a blocker to accomplishing a business goal, and I wanted to know what I was going to pay for them up front. Why couldn’t any firm make those things happen for me?

JB: Let’s dig on the legal experiences. I know you say they weren’t all bad, but you must have seen a gaping hole in the system before you went out and raised $10.5m. What made you decide to pull the trigger and start Atrium?

JK: Actually my LTS cofounder and Atrium LLP managing partner [Augie Rakow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/augierakow/) was the one who convinced me the idea was viable. I had initially had the idea of building a technology company to improve the delivery of legal services in December of last year, and then spent the next several months talking to lawyers, founders and investors to try to convince myself that it wasn’t a great idea. Lots of lawyers told me it was impossible to change the industry.

Augie, who I had met because he represented my brother’s startup, Cruise Automation, actually was incredibly bullish on the idea. We had a series of long conversations about technology you could use to improve legal for startups. Eventually Augie mentioned that if I didn’t start this company, he would on his own — which really was what convinced me to jump all in.

JB: We attorneys can be persuasive! You must have considered the Legal Innovation Paradox (a billable hour system punishes efficiency) that I introduced in [Part One](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/competition-is-for-losers-the-rise-of-atrium-part-i/?rf=1). How do you see The Atriums overcoming this problem?

JK: The Legal Innovation Paradox came up constantly when I observed a few companies that I had funded at YC attempt to sell productivity software to law firms. The constant feedback was always, “it’s useful, but it doesn’t fit into our workflow.” Lawyers rarely want to change their workflow, and even when they are willing, they don’t want to pay for it. I recall talking to a partner at a very good firm who oversaw the technology committee (decisions are made by a technology committee?!) who told me he wanted to innovate, but he was lucky if he could find hundreds of thousands of dollars for new software a year.

The truth is there is an intrinsic resistance to adopting technology or process improvements, which is because of the hourly model: the gains from any improvements mean law firms will make less money. So why would anyone want to innovate?

Atrium LLP is trying to solve this by charging fixed pricing for work. It plans on doing this by building models to predict how much work will be needed for different types of projects. Even if the models aren’t perfect at first, it doesn’t really matter: regardless of whether it is higher or lower margin initially, the point is that when are have a fixed price for service, it is your internal incentive to reduce cost over time. That is how the market drives lower cost for customers. When you have buyers who pay suppliers based on cost plus, you get high prices that don’t trend down over time (think government contractors). When you have fixed pricing, costs generally come down over time.

ES:  Our colleague at Above The Law, Bob Ambrogi, implied in his [latest article regarding Atrium](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/is-revolutionary-law-firm-atrium-a-case-of-clearspire-deja-vu/) that this has been attempted before (in Clearspire). He mentioned several reasons why Clearspire was unsuccessful, including a failure to prove value, an inability for general counsel to change from incumbent law firms, and simply being ahead of its time.  Why do you think Atrium will be different?

JK: I think for Atrium LLP to be successful as a business it will have to do the same things other top-tier law firms do: provide excellent client service from top attorneys who can do great work. Technology will never be a substitute for that. When we were selling Twitch to Amazon, we didn’t want Uber for lawyers. We didn’t want an AI lawyer. We didn’t want a marketplace for lawyers. We wanted a lawyer with experience on billion-dollar M&A transactions to make us feel like everything was being considered and handled excellently.

Augie and BeBe’s goal is to build Atrium LLP into a top-tier law firm. There’s no hack to get around the hard work of hiring great attorneys and informing clients of how Atrium can help them. The technology from LTS that they utilize will only determine whether it is a better, more efficient and more profitable business in the long run.

JB:  Any other advice for all the legal entrepreneurs out there?

JK: Selling software to law firms seems like a huge pain in the ass. Most legal innovation is being driven by enterprises. If you want to create legal software, skip a step (and years of pain) and start with the enterprise. Godspeed!

ES: Godspeed to you as well!

# Even After COVID, This Biglaw Firm Is Expanding Their Work From Home Policy
## Working from home won't end with a vaccine.

It’s become cliche to say that COVID-19 has radically altered the way that Biglaw does business. But, you know,[ COVID-19 has radically altered](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/covid-cast-podcast/) the way that Biglaw does business. One of the most obvious ways this is true has been the largely successful deployment of work from home policies.

There’s always been a value placed on face time in Biglaw firms. But the forced work from home set up spurred by the pandemic showed that, for law firms, everything pretty much works fine from home. As a result of this, Herbert Smith Freehills has announced a new policy allowing additional remote work.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2020/09/11/hsf-allows-partners-all-staff-to-work-remotely-40-of-time-397-38433/) Law.com, the international firm will allow all employees the option to work remotely up to 40 percent of the time. The firm said that policy “can be adjusted to suit each individual, team and situation” and will only apply when offices are reopened and “physical distancing rules have been greatly relaxed or removed.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The firm says they’re trying to balance the benefits of flexibility that working from home provides with the connection of office life:

“Despite the pressure and worries of the pandemic, we know that many of our people have greatly valued the flexibility of how, where and when we work, gaining more time for their families, health and other commitments,” said CEO Justin D’Agostino in a statement.

“We also recognise that the office will remain an important place for connection, collaboration and learning, with clients and with each other,” he added.

Firms like HSF are realizing they can’t put the remote work genie back in the bottle, and hopefully programs like this will serve the needs of both the firm and the individuals that work there.

# Kasowitz Benson Gets Two New Co-Managing Partners After A Year Of Insanity
## Could this be related to all of the negative press the firm has received lately?

Since taking on President Trump’s defense in the Russia probe — which exposed Marc Kasowitz of Kasowitz Benson to an [ethics complaint](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/and-now-the-inevitable-ethics-complaint-against-trumps-lawyer/), a [scathing investigative report](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/marc-kasowitz-is-waking-up-to-a-bad-morning/),[[1]](#f1) and an [embarrassing public squabble with a critic](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/marc-kasowitz-writes-angry-emails-and-everyone-completely-overreacts/) — to later [leaving the defense team](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/kasowitz-checking-out-of-russiagate/), Kasowitz Benson has had quite the interesting year. Amid all of this lunacy, a former name partner [left the firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/kasowitz-benson-loses-name-partner-lots-of-money/) to become a U.S. ambassador, and another top partner [moved to a rival firm](https://bol.bna.com/top-kasowitz-partner-is-joining-kirkland-ellis/). That all said, the firm decided that it was due time to make some changes to its management team.

Marc Kasowitz isn’t going anywhere, but he’s getting some assistance in the form of two co-managing partners. Cindy Caranella Kelly, who focuses on civil litigation, and Wallace Schwartz, head of the firm’s real estate transactional group, have been appointed to oversee the administration of the firm. They will handle recruiting, lateral hiring, personel matters, business development plans, firm spending, and the summer associate program. Kelly and Schwartz will report directly to Kasowitz to “get[] him the information that he needs.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Kelly and Schwartz claim their appointment is completely unrelated to the negative scrutiny the firm has been under since the beginning of the year. Here’s more information from the [New York Law Journal](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202798477406/Kasowitz-Benson-Adjusts-Management-Team-Amid-Tumultuous-Year?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL):

“All decisions are ultimately Marc’s decisions, but with help and advice of the management committee,” Schwartz said, when asked how the appointments were made.

Still, the changes for Kasowitz Benson—where Kasowitz has been referred to as a benevolent dictator—suggest a shift toward the kind of management infrastructure that has long been routine at other Am Law 200 firms.

“The concept of institutionalizing some of these management tasks and positions I think is the goal here,” Schwartz said.

For what it’s worth, this is what Marc Kasowitz had to say about his two co-managing partners in a statement: “We are delighted that they have agreed to assume a greater leadership role within the firm, and we are all looking forward to their positive influence going forward.”

Congratulations to Cindy Caranella Kelly and Wallace Schwartz on their new roles at the firm — and good luck.

# Is NY To $180K Hurting The New York Market?
## The latest associate pay raise could actually make New York less appealing as a place to practice law compared to other markets.

Michael Allen

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors. [Michael Allen](http://www.laterallink.com/about/team/1) is Managing Principal at Lateral Link, focusing exclusively on partner placements with Am Law 200 clients and placements for in-house attorneys.

By now you’ve undoubtedly heard the news that Cravath raised associate base salaries to a new [$180K scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) on Monday. Shortly thereafter, we learned that Milbank Tweed became the [first major match](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/ny-to-180k-the-first-major-match/), followed by Paul Weiss, Cahill, Weil Gotshal, and Hueston Hennigan, in just a matter of hours. On our end, the questions came pouring in as to whether or not we could expect to see a major lateral shift as associates learn that better compensation opportunities exist elsewhere.

While Biglaw associates continue to celebrate the increase of salaries for the first time in nearly ten years, it must be pointed out that these base salaries are actually below the standard Simpson Thatcher set in early 2007 when adjusted for inflation. In fact, “real” base salaries are down — $160,000 in 2007 is actually equivalent to [more than $185,000 today](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/stat-of-the-week-actually-180k-is-a-mediocre-raise/).

Because the spread of bonuses was much smaller in 2006/7, only associates with 7+ years of experience have realized real growth in their total compensation packages. The standard set in 2007 saw bonuses ranging from $30,000 for first-year associates (prorated) to $60,000 for senior associates, while the current bonus model typically ranges from $15,000 to $100,000+. These differences can likely be attributed to clients’ increased resistance to paying for work produced by first- and second-year associates. Though every other year lags in comparison to 2006/7 when adjusted for inflation, the gap shrinks with experience (click on the graphic to enlarge):

[](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lateral-Link-1-1.png)

Inflation isn’t the only sticking point for recent graduates. While the number of students paying full tuition has decreased, average indebtedness has not. Law school debt in 2015 averaged $140,000 per student – 86 percent greater than it was in 2004. In 2006, Congress extended the Federal Direct Plus Loan Program to fully cover graduate and professional students. This allowed them to borrow the entirety of their tuition and cost of living allowances, resulting in the unintended consequences of law schools taking advantage and increasing tuition. It is now 25 percent more expensive to go to law school today than in 2006.

There is good news to be found. By kickstarting the expansion of salaries to non-New York markets, Weil (joined by others) has likely incited a radical shift in the compensation of Biglaw associates. While New York associates are typically compensated at the top of the market due to living in one of the most prohibitively expensive metro areas in the world, associates across the country are reaping the benefits.

City	Median Starting Salary	Salary Required To Yield NYC Buying Power
Dallas, TX	160,000	67,615
Houston, TX	160,000	69,095
Charlotte, NC	130,000	67,830
Chicago, IL	140,000	81,760
Atlanta, GA	115,000	70,290
Los Angeles, CA	160,000	98,715
Boston. MA	160,000	101,530
Washington, DC	160,000	103,290
Costa Mesa, CA	160,000	104,555
New Orleans, LA	95,000	66,350
Denver, CO	110,000	77,115
Austin, TX	96,000	67,545
San Antonio, TX	80,000	61,425
Redwood City, CA	160,000	124,115
San Francisco, CA	160,000	124,115
Philadelphia, PA	107,500	84,080
Newport Beach, CA	130,000	104,555
Seattle, WA	110,000	98,715
Even before the proliferation of New York firms to other major and minor markets, most of these markets approach parity through their comparatively low costs of living. For example, from [NALP’s survey of associate salaries](http://www.nalp.org/buying_power_index_class_of_2014?print=Y), the median starting salary for an associate in Dallas, Texas, was $160,000. While New York associates usually garner larger bonuses at the end of the year compared to other major markets, the cost of living differences mitigate these premiums. If firms continue to match Weil and Milbank’s ubiquitous increase, we could see movement from New York to less costly cities in the very near future. As of right now, it seems New York to $180K could soften the market as starting salaries are pushed up in other major markets, making New York’s compensation comparatively weaker when adjusted for inflation.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

As regular Above the Law readers should know, firms have been using [raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/big-money-awaits-lawyers-who-lateral-in-hot-2022-market/), [varied forms of bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/biglaw-bonus-tracker-2021/), and even [non-comp-related perks](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/not-all-law-firms-think-they-need-to-hand-out-big-raises-and-bonuses-to-attract-the-best-talent/) in the fight to compete in a hot lateral associate market. 

But just how many laterals have there been?

According to a Thursday [ABA Journal report](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/lateral-associate-moves-increased-51-compared-to-prior-four-years-according-to-due-diligence-firm) detailing new data from the lateral hiring due diligence company Decipher, it’s a lot. 

Through the third quarter of 2021, there were 13,987 associates who changed firms, according to the report. This marks a 51% increase over the previous four-year average for this time period.

As Decipher’s founder and CEO Michael Ellenhorn emailed the publication: “The nature of associate work and their connection to their firms has fundamentally changed, and the market is reflecting this new reality.”

# World's Richest Biglaw Firm Announces Another GIGANTIC Partnership Class
## With almost 200 new partners, how many of them will enter the firm’s equity ranks?

There’s no denying that Kirkland & Ellis is one the nation’s greatest law firms. Not only does the firm offer a compelling combination of prestige, profitability, and pay, but now it’s once again shattering the market on partners — in a HUGE way.

Bigger continues to better at Kirkland, because the firm just announced its largest-ever partner class. We’re not exaggerating when we say this class is absolutely gigantic — 28% larger than last year’s class, in fact. This year, the firm welcomed a partner class of 193, up from 2021’s then-record class of 151, 2020’s then-record class of 145, 2019’s then-record class of 141, and 2018’s then-record class of 122. Noticing a trend here? Kirkland’s partnership classes have been growing larger every year.

The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/10/03/kirkland-promotes-record-class-of-lawyers-to-partner/) casts the firm’s latest and largest partner class against this time of economic turmoil for other firms:

The new partnership class at the No. 1 ranked Am Law 100 firm is even more significant, considering 2022 has seen a large drop in M&A deal value and volume. Global M&A value is down about 34% year-over-year and deal volume is down 17.4%, according to the [initial data from Refinitiv.](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/10/03/deal-watch-cravath-latham-lead-6-8-billion-clean-energy-deal-q3-deal-activity-down/)

It also comes as law firms across the Am Law 200 and others are making a series of personnel moves to adjust to economic headwinds, including [hiring freezes, layoffs timed to performance reviews](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/09/08/hiring-pauses-stealth-layoffs-at-top-50-law-firms-signal-industry-austerity/) and [delayed associate start dates](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/09/29/as-gunderson-defers-associate-class-will-other-follow-suit/) and as rumors of associate layoffs are circulating amid high inflation and interest rates.

But how many of these new partners will enter the firm’s equity ranks? Last year, Kirkland had 490 equity partners and 763 nonequity partners. The firm recently made it easier for [nonequity partners to become equity partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/kirkland-shortens-partnership-track-will-anyone-else-follow/) (down from four years as a salaried partner to three), but it’s still quite difficult to make equity at the firm.

As far as diversity is concerned, Kirkland opted once again [not to show photos](https://www.kirkland.com/news/press-release/2022/10/kirkland-and-ellis-announces-new-partners) of its new partnership class. In the past, the firm’s new partners were looking mighty male and mighty white. It’s important for firms to know that these subjects won’t go unnoticed. Diversity and inclusion matter — to a firm’s current lawyers, to potential recruits, and perhaps most importantly, to clients.

Movers, Shakers & Rainmakers, hosted by David Lat and Lateral Link Managing Director, Zach Sandberg, is a podcast focused on the Biglaw lateral market. Each week, our hosts dissect some of the most significant recent lateral partner and associate moves, discuss important trends in the legal market, interview prominent legal industry leaders, and provide listeners with the news they need to know about the ever-changing ecosystem of the legal world.

Recent episodes:

Lindsay discusses how being herself has helped her achieve success in her legal career, what she looks for when building her team at Greenberg, the challenges that she faces with the ever-changing employment laws of California, and what advice she would give younger associates that are trying to come up in the ranks. For their notable moves, David and Zach highlight litigation additions by Boies Schiller Flexner and King & Spalding.

Our hosts dissect the 2022 legal market, discuss how firms are reacting to economic uncertainty, what to expect on end-of-year bonuses, and why there is still optimism that the lateral market will be able to withstand a potential recession. For their moves of the week, David and Zach highlight high-profile hires by Perkins Coie in New York and Venable in Miami. [Listen Here](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-30-2022-legal-market-roundup-2023-preview/id1604244555?i=1000585799572)

Laura discusses trends in the energy- and environmental-law spaces and the trajectory of her own career, including how she entered energy law and how she took on the role of Office Managing Partner. She and our hosts then talk about what Biglaw is doing wrong when it comes to diversity, equity, and inclusion—and how it can do better—along with strategies that have worked for Perkins Coie. For their moves of the week, Zach stays in the energy space and discusses a notable hire by O’Melveny in D.C., while David highlights a white-collar addition by Weil Gotshal in New York.

Chris also discusses what he believes the future will hold for corporate deal flow and why the team at Proskauer will remain a force to be reckoned with in the Los Angeles market. In keeping with tradition, Zach breaks down Loeb & Loeb’s addition of Christopher Ott, a Cybersecurity and Privacy Litigation partner, to their D.C. office.

# A Peek Inside Sullivan & Cromwell Partner Pay
## A financial disclosure form gives us hints about the wealth of S&C partners.

Unlike several of its peer firms, like [Cravath and Cleary Gottlieb](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/09/biglaw-its-not-all-about-the-benjamins/), Sullivan & Cromwell does not use a lockstep or even quasi-lockstep scheme for compensating its partners. Instead, the firm takes a more individualized approach to partner pay — meaning that there’s greater variability, and less transparency, when it come to how much S&C partners earn.

Every now and then, we get individual data points. For example, back in 2012, we learned that former Sullivan & Cromwell partner John J. O’Brien [earned $2.3 million](http://nylawyer.nylj.com/adgifs/decisions/011212gov.pdf) in his last year at the firm. (O’Brien [left the firm under mysterious circumstances](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/04/another-sullivan-cromwell-partner-has-left-the-building/) in the spring of 2009, and he subsequently [pleaded guilty](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/01/former-sc-partner-gets-sentenced-for-tax-offenses/) to federal tax offenses.)

Today’s peek inside S&C partner pay arises out of much happier circumstances. Veteran dealmaker [Jay Clayton](https://www.sullcrom.com/lawyers/Jay-Clayton) has been nominated by President Donald Trump [to serve as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/trump-nominates-sullivan-cromwell-partner-to-lead-sec/). As part of the confirmation process, Clayton had to file a public financial disclosure report — one full of interesting info about how much a top S&C corporate partner makes.

What’s the bottom line? Per Benjamin Bain and Elizabeth Dexheimer of [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-08/trump-sec-pick-made-millions-representing-banks-and-hedge-funds):

President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission has earned $7.62 million since 2015 representing some of Wall Street’s biggest firms, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management, according to a federal disclosure form.

Jay Clayton, the Sullivan & Cromwell partner tapped by Trump, outlined his clients — and his potential conflicts — in a filing to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics that he signed in January. The breadth of Clayton’s legal work is likely to provide fodder for Democratic lawmakers, who have already criticized the SEC chairman nominee over his ties to the financial industry.


Jay Clayton

If confirmed, Clayton will have to recuse himself for a year from matters involving S&C and companies he represented while at the firm — which has led some critics to complain that he’ll basically have to [take off for his first year on the job](http://dealbreaker.com/2017/03/jay-clayton-sec-passive/). But in fairness to Clayton, this is [not a new issue](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/01/08/insider-status-for-sec-nominee-nothing-new/BXPdFVfiTLshCgiN6OvokJ/story.html) for incoming SEC chairs. For example, Mary Jo White, President Obama’s pick for SEC chair, faced similar [complications](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/01/obama-throws-down-the-gauntlet-with-new-pick-to-head-the-sec/) and [controversies](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/watch-the-secs-mary-jo-white-get-publicly-shamed/) relating to her work defending companies while at Debevoise & Plimpton, plus her husband’s work for corporate America while at Cravath. Conflicts are just the trade-off for picking an SEC chair with deep industry knowledge and experience.

Now, a caveat about that $7.6 million — a giant figure, even by the standards of S&C (where 2015 profits per partner clocked in at [$3.87 million](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/2/)). According to the endnotes in Jay Clayton’s financial disclosure form (which we’ve posted in full [on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/a-peek-inside-sullivan-cromwell-partner-pay/2/)), the $7.6 million reflects his “partnership share for 2016 and 2017 received up to the date of filing.” We were chatting about this with a partner at a rival firm, and as this source pointed out, “The issue is when bonuses are credited as income. The distribution isn’t flat across all 12 months.”

So it’s possible, then, that this $7.6 million could overstate Clayton’s typical annual income. Let’s say Clayton received a bonus for 2015 work at some point in calendar year 2016, and then received a bonus for 2016 work early in calendar year 2017, before he filed his disclosure form (on January 24, 2017). That would generate a figure significantly higher than what Clayton makes in a single year; one of the bonus distributions should be backed out of the total.

But don’t feel too bad for Jay Clayton. The $7.6 million isn’t all his income; the report reveals that he expects an additional $500,000 to $1,000,000 in “estimated undistributed partnership share for 2016 and 2017.” And the $7.6 million doesn’t include income generated by a number of special S&C investment vehicles that, as explained in the endnotes, “are not sponsored by Sullivan & Cromwell LLP but are available to partners of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP and administered by the Firm.” (You can find these funds in the report by looking for the words “125 Broad Street Fund.”)

If — or really when, given the Republican majority in the Senate — Clayton wins confirmation as SEC chair, his annual income will plunge into the [low six figures](http://www.bondbuyer.com/issues/122_170/sec-chairs-salary-far-below-firm-executives-overseen-regulated-1055210-1.html). And his wife, Gretchen Clayton, will leave her employment as a [financial advisor at Goldman Sachs](http://financial-advisors.credio.com/l/191489/Gretchen-Clayton), ending that income stream.

But again, there’s no need to shed tears for the Claytons; they have a nice nest egg put away. According to Ben Protess and Matthew Goldstein of the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/business/dealbook/sec-nominee-jay-clayton-client-list-conflicts-interest.html), who crunched the numbers on his financial disclosure (recall that asset values are [reported as ranges](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/judge-neil-gorsuch-whats-his-net-worth/) rather than exact amounts), the Claytons’ assets are worth at least $50 million. Wow!

At the time of Mary Jo White’s nomination to lead the SEC, she and her husband John had amassed assets with a potential maximum value of [$41 million](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/02/just-how-rich-is-mary-jo-white-debevoise-partner-and-likely-future-sec-chair/). But the minimum value of Jay Clayton’s assets, at $50 million, handily beats out Mary Jo and John White — who were longtime partners at Debevoise and Cravath, respectively.

Have we heard of Biglaw partners with bigger net worths? Sure — like the late Joe Flom, who had a fortune estimated in the [low nine figures](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/04/how-much-was-joe-flom-worth-some-clues-from-his-will/). But Flom was a name partner at Skadden Arps — Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher, & Flom — and he passed away at the age of 87, giving him nine decades to amass all that wealth. Jay Clayton, who’s just 50, is a spring chicken by comparison.

Congratulations to Jay Clayton on his distinguished career and robust net worth, good luck to him in the confirmation process, and thanks for his willingness to serve the nation. Leaving S&C for the SEC will involve a financial sacrifice, but one that Clayton is more than able to bear.

Raises may be making their way through Biglaw, but that doesn’t mean that mega firms are the only ones giving out big money. Elite boutiques have proven time and again that they have what it takes to offer the same generous salaries as Biglaw.

Take Holwell Shuster & Goldberg. The firm, founded in 2012 by former SDNY judge Richard J.

And, while it may seem like trying to launch a solo personal injury practice is a pretty lonely world, and maybe also represents an impossible task, with all of the big players out there, that’s not necessarily the case. With the right amount of pluck, and the right tech, you can crush it.

That’s why we invited Brooks Derrick, of [Derrick Law Office](https://www.derricklawoffice.com/), onto the Non-Eventcast. Brooks tells you why he started a solo personal injury law firm (2:58), before addressing why he made technology investments in his firm at various stages of its development (5:27).

# Just Because Associates Are Working From Home Doesn't Mean They Should Always Be On Call

‘Let me have a life!’

I am expected to be on 24/7. I get calls and emails all night and over the weekend, and late night and weekend deadlines have become the norm. It is starting to ruin my personal relationships. Pre-COVID, similar concerns applied, but it wasn’t as bad. The root of it is client expectations.

— a respondent to [ALM’s 2021 Mental Health and Substance Abuse Survey](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/05/03/the-legal-industrys-mental-health-problem-grew-in-2020-our-survey-shows/), commenting on the [unrealistic expectation](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/05/03/lawyers-were-already-struggling-with-stress-and-isolation-and-the-pandemic-has-made-things-much-worse/) that associates constantly be on call while working from home due to COVID-19. “My firm is generally a good place to work. COVID really threw things off, and I’ve felt pretty isolated working from home,” another respondent said. “If anything, I’d describe the experience of the past year as total isolation with no boundaries between work and personal life. No amount of Zoom ‘happy hours’ or ‘coffee chats’ can overcome that.”

# Partners Making More Money Than Ever, But Gender, Diversity Gaps Stubbornly Remain

On the cusp of a potential economic downturn, attorneys are still riding the high of besting the last economic threat. While the pandemic threatened the very core of the economy, law firms came out more profitable than ever. Will lawyers weather the next storm as well? Signs [aren’t exactly positive](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/gunderson-deferred-associate-start-dates/).

But that’s tomorrow’s problem. Today, [Law360](https://www.law360.com/) and [Major, Lindsey & Africa](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en) released their [2022 Partner Compensation Survey](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/insights/research/2022-partner-compensation-survey) compiling responses from 1,815 respondents across the country. And the last year was very good to lawyers.

The top line takeaway is that partners averaged $1.12 million in compensation. This is the highest average ever and amounts to the biggest year over year increase since 2016.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
That said, male partners averaged $1.21 million while female partners clocked in at $905,000. This amounts to a 34 percent discrepancy. Astoundingly this is relatively encouraging based on the history of this broken industry because the gap was 53 percent as recently as 2018. So… hurray for 34 percent? I guess?

Can this gap continue to narrow? Sure, but it’s unlikely to keep closing at this pace. The fact that around 75 percent of the variation stems from gaps in originations (and, to a much lesser extent, billing rates) amounts to a long-term worry. Originations are the pyramid scheme of law firms with established partners tending to take legacy credit on relationships, essentially baking in the discrimination of yesteryear. Male partners reported average originations of $3.045 million, while female partners reported $2.022 million. That will close as the seniority of firm partnerships tilts toward the modern era, but it’s going to require clearing out a lot of offices.

On the subject of Biglaw’s diversity efforts…

The average total compensation for those identifying with a non-White ethnicity is 10% lower than that of White partners ($1,030,000 vs. $1,133,000). Hispanic partners reported a 56% increase in compensation, followed by a 33% increase for Asian Pacific partners and a 17% increase for White partners. Black partners were the only category to report a decline (-9%).

Not to besmirch the gains among some ethnic groups, I’d be interested to see these figures broken down by practice, because I suspect they reflect less an advance in egalitarian compensation and more the Biglaw expansion into booming markets. How much of this leap is attributable to a growing Latin American transactional practice or a spike in export control business with clients in China? It doesn’t diminish the importance of these gains just because they might correspond with growth in markets where lawyers with specific backgrounds may have linguistic or experiential advantages, but it means these gains won’t be evenly applied. That Black partners saw decline tends to reinforce this.

Beyond the representation issues, the report offers insights into the War Of The Cubicles. Pronounced generational gaps remain when it comes to remote work:

Over two-thirds of all partners said they value their ability to work remotely, with the more junior partners indicating a greater importance of working from home (80%) compared to more senior partners (57%).

But given that this push is coming from the younger generation, it’s going to have a profound impact on the next few years as the talent carousel might punish entrenched office interests.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Ten percent is a hell of a lot of talent ready to walk out the door over remote work. As we continue to hear reports from within firms grappling with the right balance, the prospect of losing 10 percent — or more — of their partnership for failing to get it right will be a big factor.

That said, most firms seem to be erring on the side of caution.



There’s a lot more in the report to check out, but to close let’s tie these two concepts together:

Black partners were most likely to place importance on working from home (84%) but least likely to say they would change jobs because of it (5%), while White partners were least likely to place importance on working from home (69%) but were more than twice as likely to say they would change jobs because of it (11%).

If you’re looking for a perfectly distilled example of white privilege in action, behold!

# The Biglaw Elite Are Running Around Like Their Hair's On Fire More Than You Might Think

It’s Am Law 100 Week, meaning it’s time to remember just [how much money Biglaw brings down](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/am-law-100-released-a-lot-of-firms-made-a-lot-of-money/), especially in [New York](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/am-law-100-news-elite-new-york-dominate-in-profits-and-revenue/) and [DC](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/billion-dollar-firms-highlight-dcs-am-law-100-presence/). But it’s also time to try and read the industry trends and figure out what, if anything, we can divine from gaudy PPP numbers.

One of the most glaring trends out there is the relative stability of the Am Law 100. Only one firm fell off of last year’s Am Law 100. One. And with the exception of a few easily explained major events — contingency fees that artificially inflated numbers in 2016 dropping off or a blockbuster merger — most firms landed right about where they did the year before. It’s enough to make one conclude that the era of volatility is over.

But that would be a mistake. Because roiling beneath that apparent calm, America’s elite law firms are experiencing more volatility than ever.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
American Lawyer editor-in-chief Gina Passarella Cipriani discusses the [hidden volatility of America’s top firms](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/04/24/volatility-is-now-a-fact-of-life-for-americas-biggest-firms/) in a piece surrounding the release of the rankings:

Gretta Rusanow, head of advisory services for the Law Firm Group, says 45 percent of the 143 firms Citi surveyed experienced volatility between their 2016 and 2017 results, up from 42 percent that said the same between 2015 and 2016.

Ever since 2010, that variation has been a usual and growing part of law firm life, Rusanow says. And it’s not something that would get the bank concerned about a firm’s financial health.

But how can nearly half the market endure volatility and still find themselves performing at a consistent level year over year?

One leader of an Am Law 50 firm who didn’t want to be named says there is no question volatility is impacting every firm in the market. It’s just a matter of how those firms are managing it.

“None of us are getting a huge percentage of our revenue from repeat institutional clients the way we all did 20 years ago or even 10 years ago,” he says. “That is a form of volatility in itself because you have to replace work every year, every six months, every two years.”

This is the real nut of it. The traditional Biglaw model of relying on a consistent stream of work from large institutional clients beholden to their outside counsel relationship is falling by the wayside as clients grow more and more active in shopping around their legal work. This doesn’t mean the firm can’t replace that work, just that firms have to exercise a lot more frantic effort to keep ahead. One of the luxuries of Biglaw practice back in the day was the ability to focus more energy on actual practice while the small firms had to devote far more time to business development. Leveraging support staff and the goodwill of the firm’s long-standing clients can’t carry partners as far as they used to. It’s a testament to modern Biglaw partners that they keep that many plates spinning at once. A few plates may shatter along the way, but the show goes on.

And hey, if billables take a hit, there’s always another rate hike to slip in there. The clients won’t mind.

# Weil Matches Market Bonuses, But When Will They Get Paid?

We have another firm ponying up the bucks to meet the market standard for year-end bonuses. Today, Weil, Gotshal & Manges announced they are going to pay their associates top-of-the-market compensation, which according to a source at the firm was “as expected.” Though another noted it was, “Happy news in any case.”

For those that have missed the market standard for 2016 bonuses, [set by Cravath yesterday](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2016-associate-bonuses/), it is as follows:

Class of 2016 — $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2015 — $15,000
Class of 2014 — $25,000
Class of 2013 — $50,000
Class of 2012 — $65,000
Class of 2011 — $80,000
Class of 2010 — $90,000
Class of 2009 — $100,000
Class of 2008 — $100,000

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
One difference for Weil is when associates will get paid. Cravath, and a few other firms, are making the payment in December, which I’m sure will come in handy for [last-minute gift buying](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/the-lawyer-holiday-gift-guide-the-best-gifts-for-the-attorney-in-your-life/). Weil associates will have to wait until January 31, 2017 to see their money. I guess that’s why god invented credit cards.

So, Weil attorneys, how do you feel about the bonuses (or when you’ll actually see the money)? Feel free to sound off [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Biglaw Firm Appoints New Managing Partner In The Wake Of Mass Defection Of Attorneys

There’s a new partner in charge over at Lewis Brisbois in the wake of the [mass departure of more than 130 attorneys](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/becker-ranen-partners-defection-lewis-brisbois/) from the firm’s employment practice.

[Gregory Katz](https://lewisbrisbois.com/attorneys/katz-gregory-s) — who currently serves as the firm’s vice chair, managing partner of its New York office, and co-chair of its general liability and transportation practices — was unanimously elected by the management committee to lead Lewis Brisbois as firmwide managing partner.

Katz landed his new role at Lewis Brisbois following not just the disbandment and later expansion of the firm’s executive committee, but a decision made by Bob Lewis, the firm’s co-founder and longtime chair, to [step away from leading the firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/lewis-brisbois-chair-steps-down/).

As noted by the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/05/16/lewis-brisbois-new-york-office-leader-tapped-to-serve-as-firmwide-managing-partner/), Lewis offered Katz his praise in a statement released by the firm: “Greg has proven himself to be an outstanding leader since he joined us 13 years ago and is clearly the right choice for this role. I believe Greg and our expanded management committee will do great things to carry on the traditions of this firm.”

Congratulations to Greg Katz on his new leadership position, and best of luck leading Lewis Brisbois into the future.

This week, I continue my written interview with Albert Tawil, the founder of [Lateral Hub](https://lateralhub.com/), an “online job board for lateral candidates and top-tier law firms” interested in lateral associate hiring. Last week, Albert [shared](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/3-questions-for-an-ip-associate-turned-legal-matchmaker-part-i/) his thoughts about the benefits of Lateral Hub for both candidates and law firms. This week, I will get into a little more detail with Albert on how his experience as a Biglaw associate who made a lateral move helped inform Lateral Hub’s structure and product offerings, as well his thoughts on why Lateral Hub should pose little risk to firms that recruiter relationships will be impacted by posting jobs on Lateral Hub’s job board.

Now to the remainder of my interview with Albert. As usual, I have added some brief commentary to the answers below but have otherwise presented his answers to my questions as he provided them.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Gaston Kroub: How did your experience as a Biglaw associate who made a lateral move inform your building out of Lateral Hub’s feature set?

Albert Tawil: Throughout every step of the process, I focused on the user experience to address common frustrations that candidates have in the lateral process and to keep it simple and easy. I remember how time-consuming it was for me doing research as a busy junior associate and how I felt there were no easy-to-use tools to help me with that process.

One example is the application flow: when a candidate clicks the button to apply for a job on the Lateral Hub site, a simple popup appears where the candidate can input just their name, email, resume, and maybe one or two additional pieces of info (if required by the firm), and then submit. By contrast, firm websites often redirect the candidate to clunky off-the-shelf job submission software, which can require the candidate to create an account, resubmit all of the information on the candidate’s resume even though the resume is already uploaded, or perform other time-consuming tasks.

Another example is access to the site. The job board is available free of charge, without any requirement to create an account or candidate profile. This makes it easy for candidates to access the information without any roadblocks.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
GK: While I never lateraled as an associate, I am familiar by hearing from former colleagues just how hard it was to find out about potential opportunities. For specialized practice areas, like IP, the world of opportunities for associates can seem small to begin with in a given geographic area, so having a discrete way of keeping tabs on potential openings can be extremely helpful. Likewise, associates can be reluctant to discuss the fact that they are considering lateral opportunities with their colleagues, which is understandable, but can also foreclose the possibility of hearing of potential opportunities from those colleagues as well. While recruiters do great work at keeping candidates informed of what opportunities may exist in an associate’s given practice area, there is an element of variability in terms of when a recruiter and a potential candidate are actually speaking to each other — and whether those conversations are happening when the associate is keen to move. A dynamically updated job board like the one offered by Lateral Hub, especially one that is easy to access, can thus be very helpful for busy associates looking to take the pulse of what opportunities may exist in the market.

GK: How do you respond to firms that would benefit from listing openings on Lateral Hub but may not want to disturb their relationships with recruiters?

AT: Lateral Hub is an additional resource to help firms find lateral candidates and for lateral candidates to discover and apply to firms. Most of our member firms list job postings on their website with the hope of sourcing direct applications in addition to recruiter submissions. These firms use Lateral Hub to amplify the job postings that are already out there to reach candidates who may not be taking the time to visit the firm website.

Firms have told me they are excited about joining Lateral Hub as an additional source of applications. Based on the feedback I’ve received from firms and candidates, the decision to work with a recruiter versus hire or apply directly depends on the situation. Each has its benefits based on the needs of the law firm or candidate. In some cases, it may be beneficial to a firm to use a recruiter to find candidates, and in some cases, a firm prefers to hire candidates directly. Same applies to candidates, in some cases, it may be beneficial to a candidate to use a recruiter, and in some cases it is beneficial to the candidate to apply directly. Having several hiring options empowers law firms and candidates to better control their unique hiring and job search process.

GK: Given the dynamic nature of hiring needs, it is not surprising that firms would embrace additional avenues to attract worthy candidates, even as they continue to value their existing recruiter relationships. The same is true for candidates, whether or not those candidates have had experience working with recruiters themselves. Anything that bridges the gap and provides more opportunities for associates to land at firms that need their services is a good thing in my book. When I was in Biglaw, I was fortunate to grow up in a firm that really cared about associate morale – which meant understanding that lateral movement can be a good thing for associates and firms. Over time, I imagine that firms will continue to get comfortable with the idea of soliciting direct applications from candidates, while continuing to lean heavily on recruiters to deliver candidates for positions where it makes sense for the firm to invest in the additional cost it takes to attract the right candidate. In short, I foresee an associate hiring ecosystem that gets healthier over time, helped along by the alternative presented by Lateral Hub.

My thanks to Albert for the insights and cooperation, especially for his willingness to discuss Lateral Hub so close to its impressive market launch. (Again, you can follow Albert on LinkedIn[ here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/albert-tawil/) for thoughts on law firm life and legal recruiting and subscribe to the Lateral Hub Newsletter[ here](https://lateralhub.com/newsletter/) for legal career content and updates.  You can visit the Lateral Hub Job Board at [www.lateralhub.com](http://www.lateralhub.com).) I see great promise in Lateral Hub, particularly for IP associates looking to take ownership over their careers and maximize their opportunities to work at firms which have the interesting and challenging IP work in hand.  I wish Albert the best of luck in all of his ongoing endeavors and am pleased to see someone with Biglaw IP experience branching out into an entrepreneurial endeavor — especially one with the potential to improve the lateral associate hiring process for both firms and candidates.

I am always open to conducting interviews of this type with other IP thought leaders, so feel free to reach out if you have a compelling perspective to offer.

# Are Lawyers Perpetuating A Culture Of Silence Surrounding Sexual Assault?

Harvey Weinstein (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)

Zelda Perkins, a former personal assistant to Harvey Weinstein, has broken her contractual obligations under a non-disclosure agreement to tell [the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/1dc8a8ae-b7e0-11e7-8c12-5661783e5589) the details of what she witnessed and experienced while in his employ. This isn’t some accidental or inadvertent breach of a complex document. It is an extraordinarily deliberate decision made by a self-possessed and motivated woman. As she says in the FT interview:

I want to publicly break my non-disclosure agreement. Unless somebody does this there won’t be a debate about how egregious these agreements are and the amount of duress that victims are put under. My entire world fell in because I thought the law was there to protect those who abided by it. I discovered that it had nothing to do with right and wrong and everything to do with money and power.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Perkins reveals that, as Weinstein’s assistant she dealt with a boss that exposed himself to her, asked her to watch him bathe and give him massages. And it wasn’t an isolated instance:

This was his behavior on every occasion I was alone with him. I often had to wake him up in the hotel in the mornings and he would try to pull me into bed.

But that wasn’t enough to get Perkins to pursue action against Weinstein. She alleges in the interview that it was the assault of a co-worker in Venice that pushed her to take action:

She was white as a sheet and shaking and in a very bad emotional state. She told me something terrible had happened. She was in shock and crying and finding it very hard to talk. I was furious, deeply upset and very shocked. I said: ‘We need to go to the police’ but she was too distressed. Neither of us knew what to do in a foreign environment.

A representative of Weinstein denied this specific allegation:

The FT did not provide the identity of any individuals making these assertions. Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr Weinstein. Mr Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.

From there, Perkins and her colleague got a lawyer from the U.K. firm [Simons Muirhead & Burton](https://smab.co.uk). They entered into a negotiation with Weinstein’s attorney, [Mark Mansell](http://www.allenovery.com/people/en-gb/Pages/Mark-Mansell.aspx) of [Allen & Overy](http://www.allenovery.com/pages/default.aspx). They reached an agreement whereby the women would split £250,000, if they agreed to the NDA and to limit their participation in any investigation into Weinstein. FT also reports they were required to contact Mansell should they be compelled to provide evidence in “any criminal legal process” involving Weinstein or his company, Miramax.

Now, lawyers are quite used to being unpopular figures. Some of the noblest work of the profession involves defending true criminals in a court of law.  And ensuring that the system treats the accused — as well as the guilty — by the standards enshrined in the Constitution is important work. But in this case, Weinstein was trying to avoid all public discussion about his behavior, and the NDA served as legal glue to ensure the status quo — one where he expected assistants to watch him bathe — continued with only a minor (for him) monetary penalty.

And what about the lawyers at A&O or any number of other solid, reputable law firms that could have been tasked with doing this job? They didn’t do anything we don’t expect all good, competent lawyers to do. They acted well within the confines of the law to generate a result in the best interests of their client. We can’t all be Gloria Allred, who has the luxury of her own practice that she’s used to pursue her own vision of social justice — hell, even her daughter, Lisa Bloom had a [hard time living up to that standard](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/mother-knows-best-gloria-allred-disses-daughters-decision-to-rep-harvey-weinstein/) (though she quickly corrected course). But what happens when the tools we are trained to deploy are used to further a societal harm?

Of course that isn’t to say there are no good uses for NDAs. Celebrities have a right to know the nanny they hire isn’t going to sell unflattering pictures of them or their children to the highest bidder. And companies use them to get closure over nuisance claims, which is a reasonable way to deploy the agreements. But let’s learn something from Harvey Weinstein, and Bill Cosby, and Bill O’Reilly, and Roger Ailes, and the proliferation of #metoo stories. Predators use silence to their advantage, they depend on the only weapon against them to be whispers to get their next victim. And good lawyers have been an accessory to creating this culture by exploiting legal tools to cultivate a cone of silence around powerful figures.

It’s a tricky predicament the legal profession finds itself in. There is certainly no rule that was broken in procuring an NDA on behalf of Miramax and Weinstein. But perhaps, if we finally see that something is broken in society, the legal community can be a part of fixing it.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Don't Announce Your Bonuses On A Friday
## This is for your own good, we promise.

Somewhere along the way it got into people’s heads that major firm news should come out on Fridays. Over the past several weeks, a number of Biglaw firms have followed this questionable conventional wisdom and waited until the close of business to put out their announcements.

This is a terrible idea.

The consultants from Office Space taught us all that it’s best to fire people on Fridays (“studies have statistically shown that there’s less chance of an incident if you do it at the end of the week), but how did that get tied up with bonus announcements? There’s no reason to delay good news.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Does an announcement create a brief drop in productivity as associates celebrate (and send emails to Above the Law)? Sure. But, for better or worse, this is a round-the-clock industry and whether you take the celebration hit Monday or Friday doesn’t really matter.

Is the worry that associates might go out for happy hour after hearing the news and be useless the next morning? Even if that were a valid concern during ordinary times — and it’s probably not — it definitely isn’t a concern when no one is physically in the office to get together.

And absolutely, positively don’t announce at the end of business on Friday. We had West Coast firms announce after close of business on the East Coast which just means that those of us in the media might not get to it until Monday — when it is buried by Monday announcements — and guarantees in any event that no one is going to read about it.

Which gets to the whole point of bonuses. Yes, the firm is showing its appreciation for all the hard work, blah, blah, blah. But really this is all about signaling to the market that the firm is financially ready to play in the big leagues and signaling to attorneys that they’ll be compensated at top dollar if they join. Much like the Doomsday Device from Dr. Strangelove, a bonus announcement is useless if no one finds out about it.

If I’m giving Biglaw firms advice, I’d say announce mid-week. Aim to make sure it’s out there so the story is blasted out during peak working hours when people are at their desks checking their email. The whole point is to be noticed, so go when the audience is assembled!

# The Rising Wave Of Associate Salaries: Analyzing The Impact On The Legal Industry In 2023

An insightful recent examination of associate remuneration has unveiled a striking surge in first-year associate pay packets since 2021. As of the onset of 2023, the median base salary for a first-year associate touched the landmark of $200,000, a noteworthy escalation of $35,000 (+21.2%) from 2021. The figures also underscore the diverse effects of these raises across various firm sizes, geographical regions, and legal markets. This swell in associate remuneration carries wide-ranging ramifications for the legal industry, encompassing issues related to talent retention and acquisition, fiscal strains on smaller firms, and potential changes in client billing rates.

Escalating Salaries Across the Spectrum

The 2023 Associate Salary Survey has indicated a rise in first-year salaries across all firm sizes since 2021. Intriguingly, smaller firms, housing 100 or fewer lawyers, recorded the steepest growth in median first-year salaries, showing a 29.2% increase from $120,000 in 2021 to $155,000 in 2023. This trend suggests that even compact firms are feeling the heat to augment salaries to remain competitive in the race for legal talent.

Firms employing between 251-500 lawyers saw their median first-year salaries climb by 21.9%, from $160,000 in 2021 to $195,000 in 2023. Likewise, firms housing 701-1,000 lawyers witnessed a 20.6% increment, with median first-year salaries growing from $170,000 in 2021 to $205,000 in 2023.

The most substantial dollar rise was observed in firms with 501-700 lawyers, with median first-year salaries soaring from $155,000 in 2021 to $200,000 in 2023 (+$45,000), a 29.0% augmentation. This data points out that mid-sized firms are also making noteworthy adjustments to their salary structures to keep pace with the dynamic legal market.

In the case of the most sizable firms, those hosting more than 1,000 lawyers, the median first-year salary touched $215,000 in 2023, a 23.3% rise from $174,000 in 2021. While these firms were the sole entities to report such elevated median salaries, their sway over the rest of the market is substantial, as they account for 75.0% of all first-year salaries in this firm size category.

Overall, the salary augmentations in large firms, paired with rising inflation, have exerted pressure on smaller and mid-sized firms to amplify their salaries as well. This pattern illustrates the extensive effect of the “talent wars” and the market’s reaction to the escalating demand for proficient legal professionals.

Geographical Influence on Salaries

Geography continues to significantly influence salary variations across regions, cities, and states. The 2023 Associate Salary Survey provides analyses for 26 individual cities and additional states and regions, revealing a wide spectrum of law firm compensation. Median first-year salaries by city oscillate between $145,000 and $215,000.

Eleven cities now boast a median starting salary of $215,000: Austin, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles/Orange County, New York City, San Diego, San Francisco, Silicon Valley, and the Washington, DC area. These cities are spread across different regions, reflecting the flourishing legal markets in these areas.

In locations outside of the 26 major cities featured in the report, the $215,000 starting salaries are found less frequently. The highest median first-year associate base salary in these smaller U.S. cities and towns was in the Northeast ($170,000), trailed by the Midwest and West, both at $165,000. The South reported the lowest salaries, with a median first-year salary of $135,000. This regional disparity underscores the necessity of considering local market dynamics when setting salaries.

Moreover, the most commonly reported first-year associate base salary across all firm sizes was $215,000, accounting for 42.7% of all salaries. This further underlines the influence of major legal markets and large firms on salary trends throughout the industry.

The Ripple Effect on Summer Associates

The escalation in associate salaries also cast a significant impact on second-year summer associates. Their median weekly salary witnessed a robust growth of 13.4%, elevating from $3,075 in 2021 to $3,550 in 2023. This indicates that law firms are revising their compensation packages not only for full-time associates but also for summer associates to maintain a competitive edge in the legal talent market.

Furthermore, the rise in summer associate salaries could potentially sway law students’ decisions when choosing firms for their summer internships. Consequently, firms offering higher summer associate salaries may attract more high-achieving law students, further fueling the competition among law firms.

Beyond salary adjustments, some firms may also enhance the overall summer associate experience by offering unique professional development opportunities, networking events, and mentorship programs. These non-monetary benefits could serve as differentiating factors for firms in the eyes of law students, helping them attract and retain top talent amidst rising salary expectations.

Rippling Effects on the Legal Industry

Talent Retention and Acquisition: The rapid salary increases reflect the fierce competition for legal talent. Law firms must continue to offer competitive compensation packages to attract and retain the best talent.

Financial Strain on Smaller Firms: The salary increases in large firms and rising inflation have created financial pressure on smaller firms to boost their salaries. Smaller firms may need to explore alternative strategies, such as offering non-monetary benefits, to stay competitive in the talent market.

Regional Disparities: The geographical influence on salaries underscores the need for firms to consider regional cost of living and market factors when determining their compensation packages.

Impact on Clients and Legal Services: The increased salaries may lead to higher billing rates, which could affect the affordability of legal services for clients. Law firms may need to look for ways to improve efficiency and reduce costs to maintain client relationships.

The notable increase in associate salaries since 2021 underscores the fierce competition for legal talent and emphasizes the need for law firms to adapt swiftly. As the legal industry continues to evolve, firms must meticulously consider their compensation strategies and maintain flexibility to attract and retain top-notch professionals.

Over the weekend, the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fentanyl-cocaine-new-yorkers-drug-delivery-service-all-died-11666526726) published an expose on the dangers of cocaine laced with fentanyl. In that article, the WSJ highlighted three New York professionals who died in March 2021 after receiving their cocaine orders from a delivery service. One of them was a young Biglaw associate.

Cocaine use runs rampant throughout the legal community, and sometimes begins in law school. Now that cocaine is being mixed with fentanyl, the dangers associated with the drug have grown even worse.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Julia Ghahramani, 26, was a 2020 graduate of Columbia Law School. She was among the thousands of young lawyers who completed their law school journeys remotely and started their careers the same way. Ghahramani was a first-year associate at Akin Gump, and though she’d told her family and friends that her workload was “intense,” she loved the job.

On March 17, 2021, Ghahramani sent a text to Billy Ortega, an alleged dispatcher for a drug delivery service.

“Can u come thru?,” Ms. Ghahramani wrote.

“I’ll send them right now if you want.”

“That would be great thank you really appreciate it.”

“No worries we family.”

Within minutes, Kaylen Rainey, an alleged drug courier, arrived at Ghahramani’s apartment, cocaine delivery in tow. Hours later, she received two texts from Ortega’s number, followed by seven calls that night and the next morning. One of Ghahramani’s friends went to her apartment later that day and found her there, dead. Her phone was in her hand.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Ghahramani’s father told the Journal that his daughter was “a driven professional with everything to live for.” He continued, saying, “Never in a billion years would she have touched anything with fentanyl. This is like putting bullets in people’s brains.”

“She made a mistake,” Mr. Ghahramani said. “She had a hit of coke and unbeknownst to her it was loaded with fentanyl and it killed her.”

Prosecutors said the texts and calls to Ghahramani and another woman whose fentanyl-related death was detailed by the Journal “showed a consciousness of guilt that something was wrong with the drugs.”

Ortega has pleaded not guilty to distributing drugs and causing the three fentanyl deaths detailed by the WSJ. Rainey has also pleaded not guilty. Both men are currently awaiting trial.

We here at Above the Law extend our condolences to Julia Ghahramani’s family, friends, and colleagues in the wake of her death.

Karina Pulec

[Karina Pulec](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karinapulec), a young associate at Hogan Lovells with a promising future, was killed over the weekend in a hit-and-run crash.

Pulec was a 2013 graduate of Cornell Law School, and had clerked in the Northern District of California before joining the Palo Alto office of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati. She lateraled to the Denver office of HoLove in December of last year. The firm sent the following message out to its employees:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It is with great sadness that we let you know that Karina Pulec, an associate in our Denver office, was tragically killed on Saturday evening by a hit-and-run driver near her home. This is a tremendous loss and will be particularly hard for our colleagues in the Denver office.

Karina joined the firm in December and was a member of our IPMT practice. She was a talented lawyer, a great colleague and a wonderful presence in the Denver office. Karina was 28.

Karina’s death will be felt by all of us at the firm. Our thoughts are with her family and her boyfriend, who was also injured on Saturday evening and is recovering. We will let you know about funeral arrangements once we have confirmed them with her family.

As a mark of respect to Karina, we are keeping her details on our intranet page until her funeral.

Our thoughts go out to the family and friends of this young lawyer.

[T]he recession is over and disruption is far from an existential threat. It’s time for elite law to rediscover belief in the value it provides and start to raise rates as it did before the recession. Specifically, elite firms should:

1. Raise rates across the board.
2. Discount from the higher rates where necessary.
3. Increase rates more for partners.
4. Increase rates more for more distinct practices.
5. Exit, or leverage up, practices where realized rates (i.e. after discounting) don’t rise.

— Hugh A. Simons, former senior partner and executive committee member at The Boston Consulting Group and the former chief operating officer at Ropes & Gray, writing in [The American Lawyer ](https://www.law.com/sites/americanlawyer/2018/02/26/why-elite-law-should-raise-rates/)on what firms should do to deal with the new billing rate world order.

Winter is on Friday, and with Hanukkah behind us, Christmas nearly upon us, and everyone in the legal profession ready to ring in the New Year, it’s time to reveal the 10 finalists for our tenth annual holiday card contest. But first let’s give shout-outs to some honorable mentions (click on each firm’s name to see its card):

1. [Fish & Richardson](https://www.fr.com/holiday-2018/): From the nominator: “The card celebrates thinkers who turn their ideas into reality, which is the core of an intellectual property practice and sends a warm greeting for holiday wishes that come true.” Plus, it gives a shout-out to Space Camp, and over the course of the past 20 years, Fish & Richardson has sent over 500 students to Space Camp on full scholarships. Dare to dream, kids!

2. [Morse Barnes-Brown Pendleton](https://readymag.com/MBBP/2018Holiday/): How could you possibly go wrong with 12 dessert recipes on a holiday card? “Our whole team (from lawyers to staff to paralegals) loves sweet treats, so we challenged our employees to share their favorite holiday dessert recipes and the outcome was pretty delicious.” Hurry up and start baking and give your compliments to all of the chefs at MBBP!

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
3. [Troutman Sanders](http://www.holidaycardtroutmansanders.com/charity/): You may wonder how the holiday season as we know it today came to be, and this firm has you covered with this year’s holiday card featuring “innovation milestones in the form of holiday trends.” From rolling luggage to “Festivus,” this card’s got something for everyone.

And now, the 10 finalists, in alphabetical order. Again, click on each firm’s name to view its card. Please note that most of these cards have SOUND, so you might want to turn your sound off or down, or use headphones. Explanatory comments come from firm representatives unless otherwise indicated.

1. [Davis Wright Tremaine](https://www.dwtholiday.com/): The internet is obsessed with quick recipie videos, and this Biglaw firm took that to heart with its holiday card. They’ve gathered eight holiday recipes from lawyers and staff across all offices and created quickie how-to videos for each one. Thanks to DWT’s Practice Management Specialist in Bellevue, I know what I’ll be making for my family on Christmas morning.

2. [Goodman Allen Donnelly](https://www.webbycards.com/2018/goodman/holiday-ecard.html): This card features original artwork created by Michael Goodman, one of the firm’s founding partners, who says, “While we continue to look for the elusive peace on earth and goodwill toward women, we figure that the holiday spirit has to start with Santa, include a cohort of reindeer, an occasional elf, at least one spinning dreidel and a hint of current events.” And with Santa under investigation by the FBI for all sorts of crimes in this animated card, we know you’re going to love it.

3. [Grodsky & Olecki](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4mx611hynmgdr35/Grodsky%20and%20Olecki%20LLP%20-%202018%20Holiday%20Card.pdf?dl=0): Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dominated the headlines in 2018, and Her Honor also dominates this firm’s holiday card. Can you complete the RBG workout? The litigators at this firm can, and they hope you have a Remarkable, Bright, and Glorious new year! Very well done. A card the Notorious One could truly appreciate!

4. [Harness Dickey](https://vimeo.com/304459355): This firm received an [honorable mention](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/atl-holiday-card-contest-the-finalists-2017/?rf=1) in last year’s card contest, but they’ve really stepped up their game this time around. Toy production is behind at the North Pole because of infringement lawsuits and injunctions, but luckily, this IP firm is here to help out. “With a fistful of patents and his half-empty sack, Santa went to the lawyers who he knew had his back.” Luckily, IP comes alive at Harness Dickey, so the firm was able to save the day. Hooray!

5. [Lane Powell](https://vimeopro.com/lanepowell/holiday2018): This is a great card if only because it’s so sweet and sincere, and features so many lawyers from the firms telling the world exactly why they love the holiday season. Our nominator likes this card because it’s warm, it’s authentic, and it’s polished. I love this card because of the guy who interrupts all of the charming chatter to announce that his favorite thing about the holidays is whiskey.

6. [Larson King](http://www.larsonking.com/lk_holiday_card/): This is the fifth time that Larson King has been featured as a finalist in our holiday card contest. Maybe the fifth time will be the charm for this St. Paul-based litigation boutique? All the illustrations in this “Flake News” special report were hand-drawn and then animated. How could you not love a holiday card that features Robert Mueller as Special Investigator Claus who’s dealing with “North Pole collusion” in the reindeer games? Plus, we totally appreciated the firm’s dig at Biglaw: “Biglaw will staff cases efficiently and reduce their rates? Ugh, sorry, that’s fake news.”

7. [O’Melveny](https://www.omm.com/holidaycard/): Here’s another card from a Biglaw firm that really humanizes the lawyers who work there. “We wanted to give folks a sense of O’Melveny’s unique culture,” says the firm’s Director of Business Development. Featuring little clips of lawyers and partners talking about the holidays, you can tell that the firm’s culture really is “one that’s light-hearted, open, a little bit nerdy.” That being said, pie really is the most superior dessert, and everyone wants to eat a lot and not gain a lot of weight.

8. [Parry & Pfau](https://p2lawyers.com/blog/2018/12/03/christmas-video): If you can make it through all of the fake laughter in this video, then you’re the winner of this year’s contest, ha ha ha ha. Here’s a summary from Zach Parry, one of the partners at the firm: “Parry & Pfau’s video has seven shades of laughter, a stunt double, animal actors, a Morgan-Freeman soundalike voiceover, elf jokes, a clumsy Christmas tree, and lots of holiday cheer. But some people still vote for the same old boring holiday card every year. Those same people probably also like being in an elevator full of people who use cheap soap, dipping tortilla chips in salsa mass-produced in New York City, and eating peanut-butter sandwiches without milk. But for everyone else, there’s Parry & Pfau’s Christmas video card.”

9. [Schwabe, Williamson & Wyatt](https://schwabray.herokuapp.com/?f=Look1): Are you ready to take a holiday selfie? Because this law firm is totally here for the holiday cheer! From the nominator: “Click on the link and you’ll be prompted to activate your on-screen camera. But before you smile and say cheese, toggle through a fun carousel of virtual ‘props’ — a Santa hat, an elf hat, various wigs, beards, mustaches, masks, etc.”

10. [Wolf Greenfield](https://info.wolfgreenfield.com/happy-holidays-from-wolf-greenfield-2): Last year’s winner is back again with abother stop-motion video that features a snowman that seems to accidentally come to life. “This year, we wanted to remind people of a time when a frosty winter’s day held endless possibilities for fun—and that the magic is still there, even if it shows up differently than it did when we were kids.” Click [here](https://info.wolfgreenfield.com/behind-the-scenes-of-our-2018-holiday-card#how_it_was_made) to see how the video was made.

Now it’s time for our audience to vote. We’ll keep the polls open through TUESDAY, JANUARY 1, 2018, at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time). This gives you ample time to campaign for your pick over the holidays (but please, please, please don’t cheat).

Thanks to all the entrants and nominators, good luck to the finalists, and happy holidays to everyone! Above the Law is happy to celebrate holiday cheer with you!

# Attorneys Are Fleeing Norton Rose, So Telling Everyone They're 'Evaluating' Raises Doesn't Exactly Inspire Confidence
## A nod toward transparency may have only made things worse.

The [stream of departures from Norton Rose](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/norton-roses-problems-run-way-deeper-than-losing-abbe-lowell/) over the last few months are truly staggering when you take them together. From associates to partners, lawyers seem to be running from the UK giant. And while a firm with 4000 attorneys is more than big enough to deal with some defections, losing whole departments like this has some of us wondering if there are bedrock problems with how the firm handles its foray into the US market.

As one source put it, senior attorneys in the American offices have, “next to zero confidence in current management.”

This certainly isn’t going to help.

On the one hand, at least they’ve offered some transparency. Firms like Latham and Baker McKenzie are sitting out there having offered zilch to their worried associates. On the other hand, given so many large players still sitting on the sidelines, Norton Rose could have easily kept mum until they worked this out, rather than draw attention to the firm’s fecklessness in the face of mounting pressure.

As we’ve said, whatever the merits of the 2016 salary bump, any firm that adopted that scale has to follow the present cost-of-living adjustment or let the world know they overstepped two years ago and can’t hang with the big kids.

If Norton Rose lands in the latter camp, expect more departures sooner rather than later.

An associate in the New York office of McGuireWoods was arrested and charged with second degree murder last week. Andre Keels was in Virginia when police responded to a “mental health call” about a [naked man yelling outside a house](https://www.nbc12.com/2021/10/01/police-henrico-man-charged-mothers-murder/) at around 9:30 in the morning.

Authorities found the naked attorney in the driver’s seat of a Hyundai SUV and say that his mother was run over by the vehicle in what was some sort of domestic dispute.

Keels [graduated from Richmond Law](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:xEKzZ7B39dwJ:https://news.richmond.edu/features/article/-/14848/student-profiles-andre-keels-l18-a-career-path-from-deputy-sheriff-to-future-lawyer.html+&cd=11&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us) after leaving his career as a sheriff’s deputy, clerking for Justice Stephen McCullough of the Virginia Supreme Court along the way.

Details are very preliminary at this point, but this is heartbreaking news especially with the strong indicia that Keels was unwell at the time of his mom’s death.

# Global Law Firm Expansion Is All About Becoming More Local
## Dentons is growing in size, but its focus is on growing in local connections.

When we talk about giant law firms, we tend to describe them as amoeba-like behemoths expanding their will into every corner of the globe. There’s certainly something to that description, especially when you consider the way some of these firms expand into new markets by developing more outposts connected to a central hub or two. But there’s another way to look at expansion — if a firm’s doing it right — and while it may seem counter-intuitive it’s really possible to use expansion to get more local.

After adding another 300 lawyers this week, [Joe Andrew](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/joe-andrew/) went on a whirlwind tour of Indiana and Kentucky to meet with the clients who will benefit from the [latest Dentons tie-up](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/biglaw-firm-completes-massive-merger-acquisition-what-should-we-call-this/). The Dentons global chair took some time between his third client event in Indianapolis and his first in Louisville to chat about the Dentons strategy and how he sees it as critical to bringing law firms in line with client expectations.

Because where are clients? While law firms cling to their New York or Chicago headquarters, top tier clients in every industry are scattered across the country. “Think about the UK,” Andrew says, “70 percent of their top companies are located in London. Of the Russell 3000, only 7 percent are in New York.” When put that way, why wouldn’t law firms endeavor to meet clients where they are? It’s the model accounting firms follow. Consulting firms too. Even the major architecture firms are all over the place. Professional services are meant to be locally available and it’s frankly strange that Dentons seems to be pursuing this strategy all by itself among law firms.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
We already know that clients are trying to [scale back on the number of law firms they employ](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/in-house-counsel-are-both-unconcerned-about-new-privacy-laws-and-completely-unprepared-for-new-privacy-laws/). Andrew points out that this is for good reason — it’s expensive to keep a lot of law firms on the books. Hiring regional firms or local counsel all over the place requires more in-house staff to keep everything covered. One law firm capable of delivering everywhere is an instant cost-saving for clients.

Speaking of the Big 4, this model of offering access to global talent through local representatives is [the whole basis](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/twilight-of-the-law-firms-the-big-4-are-poised-to-conquer-the-legal-landscape/) of industry concerns about accounting firms upending the Biglaw model in the United States. The thinking goes that when the Big 4 finally enters the legal practice space in earnest, it will leverage its established local relationships as accountants and consultants with foreign entities doing business in the U.S., crowding out the Biglaw firms currently soaking up that business. Dentons, who counts the Big 4 among its best clients in the U.S. and best competitors abroad — particularly in Latin America where the accounting firms are already practicing — appears to be positioning itself to be ahead of the game when the practice bar falls.

Andrew acknowledges the Big 4 as inspirations behind this strategy — not out of fear but out of common sense. “What their global presence allows them to understand is process and relationships. They get that there is talent everywhere to assist clients.” This commitment to local talent was the subject of a recent essay where Andrew focused on [the traditional law firm model as colonialist](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/09/biglaw-chair-slams-the-traditional-law-firm-model/). It’s not a stretch: firms run Latin America practices out of New York, Africa offices out of Lisbon, Asia practices out of San Francisco… if there are physical locations in other countries, they can resemble glorified local counsel.

“The lawyers in these countries… they all went to Harvard and Yale. They all have the same smartphones and access to the same information as U.S.-based attorneys but they have even more because they know the community,” Andrew told me. “It’s great to have people in the U.S. with expertise but that’s not how you capture work. There’s talent in Bogota… people who live and work in that community.”

And that goes for the domestic practice as well. Local attorneys and potential clients belong to the same alumni groups and local charity boards and churches and clubs. That’s as true of Indianapolis as it is Bogota. Dentons doesn’t understand why a firm wouldn’t want to have as many attorneys with local insights, connections, and know-how as possible.

For Dentons, getting bigger is all about getting closer.

# What's It Like To Argue Before The Supreme Court -- For The 30th Time?
## Paul Weiss partner Kannon Shanmugam, a veteran high-court advocate, discusses arguing telephonically before SCOTUS in the midst of the pandemic.

I’m often asked whether I miss the practice of law. Generally my answer is no; I love my work of writing about law and the legal profession.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But as a former appellate attorney, if I could return to the world of practice for one experience, it would be to argue a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Having even just one argument before SCOTUS is the dream of many a lawyer.

For Kannon Shanmugam, it’s just another day in the office.

Okay, that’s an exaggeration; a high-court argument is still a noteworthy occasion, even for Shanmugam. But it’s not rare. It’s something that happens, on average, about twice a year for the veteran appellate advocate.

Yesterday, Shanmugam argued before the Supreme Court in [Henry Schein Inc. v. Archer and White Sales Inc.](https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/henry-schein-inc-v-archer-and-white-sales-inc-2/), which represented his 30th appearance before SCOTUS. Yesterday was also, in a nice coincidence, the 16th anniversary of his first Supreme Court argument, in [Muehler v. Mena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muehler_v._Mena#:~:text=Mena%2C%20544%20U.S.%2093%20(2005,have%20an%20independent%20reasonable%20suspicion).

I connected with Shanmugam by Zoom yesterday afternoon, a few hours after his argument. He took the call from his office at Paul Weiss, sitting at the same desk where he had argued before the Court that morning.

(And yes, in case you’re wondering, Shanmugam handled the argument sitting down, using a headset. Supreme Court advocacy — it’s just like telemarketing!)

I began by asking him: how did it feel to be making your 30th argument?

“I didn’t actually realize it was going to be my 30th until one of my colleagues pointed it out to me a couple of weeks ago,” he said. “I try not to pay much attention to the numbers. I hope to be remembered for the quality of my arguments rather than the quantity.”

And 30 arguments in, appearing before the Court hasn’t lost its magic for him. As Shanmugam told me, “It is every bit as special now as it was the first time I did it.”

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Does he get nervous after hearing the “oyez, oyez” that signifies the start of the session?

“I wouldn’t say that I get nervous, exactly, but the adrenalin is definitely pumping when the Chief Justice calls the case.”

For 15 of the years that he’s been arguing before the Supreme Court, a tradition-bound institution, the procedure, pomp and circumstance have remained the same. But this year has brought dramatic change.

For the safety of the justices and lawyers in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, the Court has been conducting oral arguments by telephone since May. That means no more trekking down to One First Street, entering the grand and glorious courtroom, and rising to one’s feet as the justices enter. I asked Shanmugam for his thoughts on the new process.

“We’re all new to this format, and it feels very different,” he said. “When the Court debuted this format, I said that it wasn’t as good as arguing in person, but better than nothing at all — and I’d stick to that view.”

“The Court is handling this as well as humanly possible,” he continued. “The clerk’s office is fantastic, giving the lawyers very specific instructions about the process. It’s very well organized, and it runs remarkably smoothly.”

To prevent chaos in a situation where the justices aren’t in the same room and can’t see one another — reflecting the Court’s aversion to cameras, the arguments are purely telephonic, with no video — the Court instituted a system in which the justices take turns asking questions, in order of seniority, with Chief Justice Roberts serving as moderator.

Back in May, I [wrote](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/the-supreme-courts-successful-new-approach-to-oral-argument/) that I liked the turn-taking approach, arguing that it gives every justice — not just the most aggressive or noisiest ones — the opportunity to ask questions. (It has been nice to have Justice Thomas participating, for example.) I also praised how the new format lets the advocates see what each member of the Court is thinking, so they can try to address each justice’s concerns — and perhaps garner the justice’s vote.

What does Shanmugam think of the system of seriatim questioning? He’s nothing if not diplomatic, but I got the sense that he’s not a huge fan.

“The pace of it feels very different,” he observed. “It’s not nearly as rapid fire. It also feels like nine three-minute arguments, as opposed to one argument.”

“This makes it harder for the Court to pin down the advocates and get to the nub of the case,” he continued. “In the traditional format, the justices’ questions would build on each other. Now, one justice might have one thing on his mind and focus his questions on that, but then the next justice might have something totally different on her mind, devoting her questioning to those topics.”

The new format presents challenges for advocates as well.

“In an in-person argument, you can see the Court’s decision-making take shape — that’s a lot harder now,” Shanmugam said. “A challenge of telephonic argument for the advocate is that you’re arguing into a void. You can’t tell whether your points are landing. You can’t see the justices talking to each other. You’re not getting any visual feedback.”

“These are really just observations, not pros and cons,” he added. “I think this format is the best the Court can do under the circumstances. It would be very hard to have telephonic arguments without some structure. You can’t have nine people who can’t see each other all trying to talk at once.”

Since the justices can’t see the advocates during telephonic arguments, I asked Shanmugam: what did you wear? Did you take advantage of the situation and make yourself comfortable by wearing, say, head-to-toe Lululemon (yes, they make [menswear](https://shop.lululemon.com/c/men/_/N-7tu) too)?

Alas, no. A stickler for tradition, Shanmugam wore a dark suit and the same silver necktie he has worn to every one of his 30 arguments before the Court, as well as his wedding. (This shouldn’t surprise anyone who knows him; as fellow Supreme Court advocate John P. Elwood once [tweeted](https://twitter.com/johnpelwood/status/1312034713037664257), Shanmugam probably wears a necktie in his sleep.)

At an in-person argument, Shanmugam would be sitting at counsel table with a few colleagues, who could pass him notes with their ideas and suggestions. Yesterday morning, he was the only person in his office when arguing. But he was in a messaging group with the two associates who worked with him on the case, [William Marks](https://www.paulweiss.com/professionals/associates/william-t-marks) and [Stacie Fahsel](https://www.paulweiss.com/professionals/associates/stacie-m-fahsel), and they could pass him virtual notes.

(An interesting aside: neither Marks nor Fahsel clerked for the Supreme Court, and Shanmugam, despite having clerked for the Court himself, does not believe a SCOTUS clerkship is a prerequisite to success as a Supreme Court and appellate advocate. “Of course you have to be smart, a hard worker, and a good writer and oral advocate,” he said. “But it isn’t the case that only the 36 people who clerk at the Court each year can do that. Many of the most talented associates I’ve worked with over the course of my career didn’t clerk for the Court.”)

So Supreme Court oral argument has changed quite a bit from pre- to post-pandemic. What about over the longer haul? How has argument changed during the 16 years that Shanmugam has been appearing before the Court?

He began by noting that the Court is almost totally different in terms of composition. Over the past 16 years, he has argued in front of a total of 15 different justices. Justice Thomas and Justice Breyer are the only two justices who were on the Court in 2004, when Shanmugam made his high court debut, and who are still on the Court today.

Despite the personnel changes, many things remain the same. The justices are still active and incisive questioners — and, if anything, they are even more active today than in 2004. The standard of advocacy remains exceptionally high — and, if anything, it’s even higher today than in 2004.

One development driving that: the rise of the specialized Supreme Court bar, an elite group of expert advocates who appear regularly before SCOTUS. They’re incredibly well-credentialed and well-connected, they’re intimately familiar with the Court and its workings, they know how to persuade the justices, and they don’t make rookie mistakes. (For a superb, in-depth look at the Supreme Court bar, check out [The Echo Chamber](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/scotus/), a special report by Joan Biskupic, Janet Roberts, and John Shiffman of Reuters, released back in 2014.)

“One can debate the pros and cons of a more specialized Supreme Court bar,” Shanmugam said, “but these days, it’s rare to have a first-time advocate appearing before the Court.” He noted that we did have a first-time advocate yesterday — but [Bryan Garner](https://www.lawprose.org/bryan-garner/), who made his SCOTUS debut in the other case argued yesterday, [Facebook Inc. v. Duguid](https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/facebook-inc-v-duguid/), is no ordinary bear.

(Indeed, Garner — the renowned scholar, grammarian, and lexicographer, longtime editor of [Black’s Law Dictionary](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/07/blacks-law-dictionary-an-interview-with-bryan-a-garner/) — left the justices a bit “starstruck,” according to Elura Nanos of [Law & Crime](https://lawandcrime.com/supreme-court/supreme-court-justices-appeared-dazzled-by-legal-celebrity-at-oral-arguments-in-robocall-case-against-facebook/).)

For a long time, the Supreme Court bar was stodgy and stagnant in terms of lateral movement. But in 2019, Shanmugam made waves by [moving](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/paul-weiss-launches-supreme-court-practice-as-press-spotlight-returns-to-partnership-diversity/) from Williams & Connolly, whose appellate and Supreme Court practice he had launched, to Paul Weiss, where he took on the dual roles of chair of the Supreme Court and appellate practice and managing partner of the D.C. office.

This gave rise to a game of [musical chairs within the Supreme Court bar](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/high-court-heavyweights-on-the-move-in-2019), with other SCOTUS superstars making moves of their own. Lisa Blatt left Arnold & Porter to head the appellate practice at Williams & Connolly, and John Elwood left Vinson & Elkins to head the appellate practice of Arnold & Porter (where he was soon joined by Allon Kedem, coming out of the Office of the Solicitor General).

I asked Shanmugam about how the move from Williams & Connolly, a legendary litigation powerhouse, to Paul Weiss, an elite full-service firm, has changed his practice.

“Paul Weiss is a much bigger firm, and a much bigger — yes, I hate this word, but I’ll use it — platform,” he said. “Paul Weiss is really unusual in that it has a top-flight litigation practice and top-flight corporate practices, and this does create opportunities. The clients that come to this firm by virtue of its corporate practice are a who’s who of the corporate world — and it’s wonderful to have access to such a remarkable client base, which has allowed for a lot of cross-referral work.”

The value of a world-class M&A practice like that of Paul Weiss is obvious, given the gigantic fees associated with billion-dollar deals. I teasingly asked Shanmugam: what do you bring to the table? More specifically, I asked him to comment on the traditional knock on appellate work: it’s prestigious but not that profitable, since it’s not as “leveraged” as other practice areas (i.e., you can’t throw a ton of associates on projects and have them bill until the cows come home, since an appellate team might be just a partner and an associate, or a partner and two associates).

“Appellate practices have tremendous value, and the demand for appellate practitioners reflects that,” Shanmugam said, taking note not just of Lisa Blatt’s and John Elwood’s moves, but also of how [Skadden Arps recently hired Shay Dvoretzky](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2020/11/23/skadden-snags-shay-dvoretzky-from-jones-day-to-lead-new-scotus-practice/) away from Jones Day. “When a matter goes up on appeal, it offers an increasingly rare opportunity for a firm to get access to new clients, because that’s often a point at which clients are looking for new lawyers.”

“Appellate and Supreme Court work is a very visible area of practice,” he continued. “It draws a lot of attention to a firm’s broader litigation practice, and to the firm more generally.”

“It’s also important for recruiting. Even if they don’t want to be appellate practitioners, law students are often drawn to firms that are prominent because of their Supreme Court and appellate practices. So appellate practices have enormous value to firms, even if they’re not as ‘leveraged’ in the narrow sense of the term.”

Fair enough, counselor. And given the gossip about the prodigious pay package that Paul Weiss used to woo Shanmugam (which he declined to comment on), his points are well taken. Despite his firm’s industry-leading commitment to pro bono work, longtime chair Brad Karp isn’t running a charity over at Paul Weiss; he presumably hired Shanmugam because he thought it was good business.

And it looks like Paul Weiss will be able to enjoy the benefit of Shanmugam’s services for the foreseeable future. As one might expect from a longtime member of the Federalist Society and former law clerk to the late Justice Antonin Scalia, Shanmugam hails from the right side of the aisle, and he was talked about as a [possible Solicitor General](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/who-will-be-the-next-u-s-solicitor-general/) or [judicial nominee](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/circuit-court-nominees-in-the-trump-administration-the-latest-news-and-rumor-part-1/) in the Trump Administration. But in light of Joe Biden’s recent win in the presidential election, Shanmugam probably isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. And he’s okay with that.

“I’m really enjoying what I’m doing now,” he said. “In many ways, this was a career-defining decision for me. And I’m really excited about leading the D.C. office of Paul Weiss, at least as excited about it as about growing my own practice. We have a tremendous opportunity to build on our position as a major player in the market.”

Since his arrival, the D.C. office has hired such marquee names as Jeannie Rhee, who served on special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, and a trio of prominent partners from Boies Schiller Flexner — [Karen Dunn](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/02/boies-schiller-expands-in-d-c-by-hiring-young-legal-superstars/), Bill Isaacson, and Jessica Phillips. With almost 100 lawyers, the D.C. office of Paul Weiss is now the firm’s second largest, with around 10 percent of the firm’s total headcount and 20 percent of the firm’s litigators.

I asked Shanmugam how many hours he spends a year on firm management. He declined to give a number — just as he also declined to tell me how many hours he bills in a year, or what his current billable rate is — but he noted that the time he spends on management has increased dramatically since the pandemic hit.

“I never would have foreseen this challenge when I took on the managing partner role last year,” he said. “Firm leadership and culture are so important during this time, when we are all working remotely. Brad [Karp] has been an incredible leader during this period — an extraordinary law firm leader, the best in the country in my opinion.”

Under Karp’s leadership, Paul Weiss has focused first and foremost on the health and safety of its employees. The firm is strongly encouraging everyone to work remotely, and it has announced no date for a return to requiring people to work in the office, instead taking its cues from public health experts.

At the same time, firm leaders have been doing what they can to maintain connectedness and camaraderie among lawyers and staff during this time. Traditions like weekly lunches and Friday happy hours continue, albeit virtually, and Shanmugam has also been having one-on-one conversations with each of the office’s associates to see how they are doing.

“I’m really proud of our office, both the lawyers and the operations team, for their incredible ability to keep our work going in this challenging time,” he said. “It hasn’t been easy with all the personal challenges people have been facing, like caring for relatives with COVID-19 or dealing with kids not being in school. It’s a testament to this firm and the community we’ve built here that we have been able to continue in the way that we have.”

And not all the changes brought about by the pandemic have been bad.

“It has been nice not to travel as much as I used to,” Shanmugam said. “Much as I enjoy going to new places, it can be a real burden, especially when things are very busy.”

“You can now get hired for major matters via Zoom, which is mind-boggling. In the past, we would visit prospective clients, meet them in person, and make the pitch. Meeting them virtually is a huge time saver.”

“And I’ve gotten to spend more time with my kids, who are 12, 11, and 3. That’s been a weird bonus of what has been a really challenging time.”

As our conversation concluded, I congratulated Shanmugam on his 30th Supreme Court argument and asked him if he had any exciting plans to celebrate.

“I’m going to go home and watch my Kansas Jayhawks. And drink a beer.”
