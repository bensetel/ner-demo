# How You Like Them Apples? The First Boston Firm Decides To Raise Associate Salaries

“Where is Ropes???”

“Ropes hasn’t matched yet — in fact, none of the big three Boston firms have moved.”

“Where is Ropes & Gray on the Cravath match?”

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“Ropes has been silent on salary increases.”

“Where is Ropes? Come on.”

“WHERE IS ROPES?!?!?!?!? SAVE US, ATL.”

Calm down, associates, for what was once apparently lost has now been found. Ropes & Gray is now the first Boston-based law firm to have spoken in the great salary wars of 2016. In an email sent from managing partner [David Chapin](https://www.ropesgray.com/biographies/c/david-c-chapin.aspx) and [R. Bradford Malt](https://www.ropesgray.com/biographies/m/r-bradford-malt.aspx), chair of the firm’s policy committee, the pair say that salaries for all partner-track U.S. associates will be “adjusted … in line with recent market changes.” No salary scale is given, but we assume that Ropes is making a full Cravath match.

In addition to nationwide raises for associates, Ropes will be offering associates the chance to refinance their debt, and they’ll receive a “$500 dollar reduction” (i.e., a negligible drop in the bucket) to their principal loan balance if they apply for the program through a dedicated Ropes & Gray website. Last, but certainly not least, beginning in 2017, Ropes associates will be eligible to receive up to $500 to reimburse them for the technology of their choice for home use, every three years.

Congratulations to all Ropes & Gray associates! Like a Masshole driving a banged-up Minivan 10 miles per hour under the speed limit in the left lane on the Pike, your firm was slow to move, but at least you can be proud of the great package you’re receiving.

(WilmerHale and Goodwin Procter, it’s your turn. Hurry up and make a move, because all of your associates are impatiently waiting, and Above the Law is watching.)

Remember, we are covering this trend extensively, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

Ryan Beckwith

A partner in the London office of the Magic Circle firm of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, Ryan Beckwith, is facing a tribunal by the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal (SDT) over allegations he engaged in sexual activity with a junior colleague without her consent. In addition to the disciplinary board, the Solicitors Regulation Authority has referred the matter to police and Freshfields is conducting its own internal investigation. Beckwith is on indefinite leave from the firm.

When Beckwith was placed on[ indefinite leave by the firm](https://www.legalcheek.com/2019/04/freshfields-partner-placed-on-indefinite-leave-ahead-of-disciplinary-hearing/), Freshfields made the following statement:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“We are aware of the publication regarding a hearing before the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal involving a partner at the firm, who is on indefinite leave. The matter is subject to proceedings and we are unable to comment further.”

As [reported by](https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/practice/youre-my-married-boss-its-so-cliche-freshfields-partner-faces-sdt-misconduct-claim-/5070097.article) the Law Society Gazette, while the full list of charges against Beckwith has not been released, the SRA alleges Beckwith’s conduct was unbecoming a solicitor and a misuse of his power. The SRA alleges that the sexual contact between the junior colleague, referred to as “Person A” in the case materials, took place when “complainant was not in a position to consent.” The incident allegedly took place after an event where Beckwith had been buying drinks for coworkers. According to a witness statement, Person A had six or seven glasses of wine as well as Jagerbombs that evening.

On Friday there was a case management hearing in the SDT case. As [reported](https://www.legalcheek.com/2019/04/freshfields-partner-on-indefinite-leave-accused-of-sexual-misconduct/) by Legal Cheek, Beckwith’s barrister, Alisdair Williamson QC of Three Raymond Buildings, argued the case was outside of the SRA’s authority and should be placed on hold until the police investigation is concluded. Additionally, Williamson [challenged the credibility](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/detail-allegations-against-freshfields-partner-082544237.html) of Person A’s statements and the way the investigation was handled by former SRA investigations lead, Hazel Padmore.

The case management hearing will continue in June, and the substantive hearing is scheduled for September.

# Biglaw Gender Discrimination Case Gets To Name Calling Phase
## This legal battle is getting personal.

Traci Ribeiro

When a partner sues her Biglaw firm, things are bound to get messy. Traci Ribeiro, an insurance partner in Sedgwick’s Chicago office, [filed a lawsuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/biglaw-partner-files-class-action-lawsuit-over-male-dominated-culture/?rf=1) against the firm alleging that female partners and associates were not compensated at the same levels as their male counterparts and that there was a gender-biased and paternalistic environment at the firm.

This week, Sedgwick filed a motion to compel arbitration, and the filing — well, what hasn’t been redacted — teems with anger calling the plaintiff and the lawsuit “self-serving,” “quisling,” and “disingenuous.” Now, can we just talk for a second about the word [quisling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quisling)? They could have used the word traitor or the more common “Benedict Arnold,” but no. Like an unlikable nerd that can’t help but awkwardly insert the SAT words he spent all summer learning into conversation, the firm went with the nickel word that originates with a Norwegian Nazi collaborator.

Ribeiro’s lawyers have swung back at the attacks:

“Sedgwick’s personal attacks characterizing Ribeiro as ‘traitorous’ or deceitful confirm the retaliatory motives that she alleges,” said [J. Bryan Wood](http://www.jbryanwoodlaw.com/experience/), Ribeiro’s attorney from The Wood Law Office, LLC in Chicago. “Sedgwick is fighting, mischaracterizing, and slurring a successful attorney at its firm who chose to exercise her right to challenge pay discrimination. Labelling Ribeiro a ‘quisling’ or traitor shows Sedgwick does not value women’s voices in their Equity Partnership or at the firm or care about the issue of pay equity,” he added.

And this classic line gets deployed with aplomb:

“Lawyers who resort to personal attacks usually lack better arguments,” added Sharon Vinick of Oakland’s Levy Vinick Burrell Hyams LLP. “That’s true here.”

Sounds like there is a lot of vitriol on both sides, so that’ll make for fascinating filings.

President Donald Trump’s recently released budget proposal includes ending the [Public Service Loan Forgiveness](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service) (PSLF) program. I predicted that something like this would happen in a [previous column](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/the-nonprofit-law-firm-providing-access-to-justice-for-the-poor-and-early-student-loan-forgiveness-for-indebted-lawyers/?rf=1).

For those who don’t know about PSLF, it allows people working for qualified organizations to pay their federal student loans based on a portion of their monthly income. After making 120 monthly payments, the remaining federal student loans are forgiven, with no cancellation-of-debt income tax consequences. Private loans are not eligible for PSLF.

But thankfully to those already in the program, any loans taken [before July 1, 2018](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2017/05/23/trump_s_budget_would_kill_the_public_service_loan_forgiveness_program_for.html) will still be eligible for forgivness.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
PSLF was enacted in 2007 with the intent of minimizing student loan burdens to those who wanted to pursue a career in public service. At the time, the U.S. economy was at its zenith. As most people preferred to work and live in the city, it became harder to recruit people to work in rural areas. The pay is generally lower, practicing farm law doesn’t sound too appealing, and there’s not a lot of local pickings on eHarmony and Tinder.

But when the Great Recession came in 2008 and the lucrative jobs dried up, it sparked interest in government and public service work.

There are stories of how PSLF is being abused by graduate students. They have mostly focused on the “Doctor’s Loophole.” This is where new physicians – particularly the surgical specialists – can potentially have hundreds of thousands of dollars of student loans forgiven. They do this by completing their seven- to eight-year, low-paid residencies, then practicing for two years at a 501(c)(3) hospital. I’m sure this has created a lot of work for lawyers who specialize in deferred compensation contracts.

A comparable “Lawyer’s Loophole” might work like this: a newly admitted lawyer can work for the government or legal aid. After working for 10 years, they can lateral to a highly paid position at a brand-name law firm. However, I think only a very small number of lawyers can take advantage of this.

There have been proposals to modify PSLF. President Obama proposed capping loan forgiveness at $57,000. However, for the reasons below, I think the time has come to end PSLF and replace it with something different.

First of all, it seems almost too easy to qualify for PSLF. To be eligible for PSLF, applicants must work full-time for an approved 501(c)(3) organization. But as I noted in my previous column, getting 501(c)(3) status does not seem that hard with the right plan and preparation. As it currently stands, so long as the non-profit law firm provides public interest legal services, the IRS cannot revoke 501(c)(3) status just because the lawyers are mainly motivated by loan forgiveness.

Another way to qualify for PSLF is to work for the government. But not all government jobs are created equal, especially when comparing salaries in urban areas versus rural ones. Over the years, I noticed that the pay gap between government and private practice jobs in certain cities has been narrowing. And some prestigious government jobs open doors to lucrative positions in private practice. Is it fair to give these people PSLF benefits? I get that the public sector benefits by employing the best and the brightest. But some of these positions – particularly assistant U.S. attorneys in places like the S.D.N.Y. – will always attract these type of people.

I have also read about various incidents where complying with PSLF requirements has been confusing. Some were unaware that they had to sign up for an income-based repayment program to qualify for PSLF treatment. And failing to take the proper steps will disqualify your payments from forgiveness even if you worked for a qualifying organization. It’s almost as though the government wants people to screw this up.

More schools are starting to abuse PSLF. It incentivizes them to increase tuition and discourage in-school discounts. Students are under the impression that borrowing to pay full tuition does not matter because the loans will be forgiven so long as they meet the PSLF requirements. Ending PSLF will hopefully force prospective students to think at least twice before paying full tuition.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Another problem I have with PSLF is that it promotes labor inefficiency. Let’s keep it real – many law students thought of government and public service work as fourth-tier safety picks in case they struck out at Biglaw OCI. Something is seriously wrong when people are choosing their careers based on the amount of loan forgiveness when they should instead be choosing careers that will help them pay those loans off.

Finally, PSLF has not solved the rural lawyer problem. There continues to be constant coverage of [lawyer shortages in rural areas](http://www.npr.org/2016/12/26/506971630/nebraska-and-other-states-combat-rural-lawyer-shortage). Instead of PSLF, there should be a more generous income-based repayment program for solo practitioners and small-firm lawyers who practice in rural areas. I propose forgiveness after 12 years with no cancellation-of-debt income.

I have my fair share of disagreements with President Trump, but I am in favor of his proposal to end PSLF. In its current form, it is not increasing the number of lawyers in rural areas, and it is being abused by both schools and borrowers, and for the most part subsidizing the [Privileged Pierces](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/07/entering-the-race-go-to-law-school-seriously-just-do-a-few-things-first/) of this world.

I get that ending PSLF will result in butthurt backlash. But I am hoping that such backlash will be the impetus to replace PSLF with a system with stricter oversight that will not incentive schools to increase tuition.

But if you are still on the fence about PSLF, apply for it now while supplies last.

# If You Want To Be A Trial Lawyer...

Lunching with two fellow dinosaurs, we naturally chatted about how the profession has changed in the almost 50 (not a typo) years since we were all admitted to practice here in California. One of the many topics discussed (none of us had anything stronger than water to drink) was the pitiful condition of our state bar and how it had gone down the tubes, especially in the past decade or so. It used to be an organization that we were proud to be members of, and now, we are not even members, we are licensees. It used to be an organization whose governing board was mainly composed of lawyers, and now lawyers on the board of trustees are in the minority. There used to be a majority of lawyers in the California legislature. Bye-bye. The only thing that really hasn’t changed is the bar’s discipline process continuing to nail solos and small firm lawyers for what are often de minimis violations while giving a pass to those lawyers who have whatever clout make them Teflon for purposes of bar discipline.

We also chatted about how courtroom experience, be it arguing a motion, let alone trying a case, seems to be a thing of the past for the newbies. And please don’t say that handling an arbitration is the same as trying a case. Until you have announced “ready,” and the prospective jury panel troops in, pissed off because they are obligated to serve, it’s not.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
You look at the panel, the panel looks at you, and then the “fun,” if you can call it that, begins. After the first 12 jurors are called, seated in the jury box, sworn in, and stare at you, that’s usually when your stomach starts to churn, and you wonder why you didn’t go to the restroom beforehand. Anyone who says that voir dire is a piece of cake, that it doesn’t prompt any nerves, or that you can sail through the process without a hitch is just wrong.

Even though jury instructions clearly say that the jury is to weigh the evidence and not consider any extraneous evidence, nor evidence stricken by the court for any reason, jurors are human — at least right now, as artificial intelligence has not yet made it to the jury box. So, prospective jurors will look at you just as much as you look at them. They will look at the way you dress, the way you walk around the courtroom, if allowed to do so, the way you interact with the court and with opposing counsel, how organized you are, how you treat and handle witnesses. And they will pass judgment silently on all those things. You never know what a juror might say or do or think.

Why am I telling you all this? While transactional work keeps the world going, and advice hopefully keeps companies going, there was for me, and for my dinosaur friends at lunch, nothing quite like trying a case. And the reality is that unless you are in a government office or in an area of practice where going to trial is the rule rather than the exception, you will miss out on one of the fundamental experiences of being a lawyer, what is what most of us, if not all of us, got into the profession to do. Even [though this post is more than a decade old](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/07/buying-in-trying-for-more-trials/), it’s still true.

So, it is your job, newbies, to get as much courtroom experience as possible. Get to argue that motion, without a jury present, get to handle a court trial, and then push, push, push to get a jury trial, even if second chair or third chair. The only way to become a trial lawyer is to become a trial lawyer. There are tons of litigators, but not all that many trial lawyers. They are a breed unto themselves, facing possible extinction as courts want cases settled, rather than tried. We all understand the logic of that, but it deprives us of that opportunity.

Learning how to be a trial lawyer is brick by brick or “bird by bird,” [as Anne Lamott labels it](https://www.amazon.com/Bird-Some-Instructions-Writing-Life-ebook/dp/B000SEGI8Q/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2V4VRO3VIWCRB&keywords=bird+by+bird+anne+lamott&qid=1675827081&sprefix=bird++by+bir%2Caps%2C160&sr=8-1). The more trials you can watch as examples the better — and not the ones on TV, which are scripted for dramatic moments. Trial can be excruciatingly slow, especially if one lawyer or another is inexperienced. But learn from that inexperience.

Watching trials is a great way to “Monday morning quarterback.” You can ask yourself why that objection was made, why was that evidence not introduced for lack of foundation, and what exactly is a “foundation?” The more you educate yourself, including taking as many courses as possible (some bar associations offer trial experiences in collaboration with courts), the better trial lawyer you can become (assuming you are given the opportunity to do so). You just need to grab such opportunities when they arise.

When considering where to go after law school, consider that a smaller firm may well provide more opportunities for trial work than the mega Biglaw firm. You may not see the inside of a courtroom in Biglaw for years, which is why there is a push by federal judges to persuade Biglaw partners to let junior associates take the lead in arguing motions and conducting hearings. [Judges are unhappy](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/judge-goes-out-of-his-way-for-junior-associates/) over the lack of opportunities for them to get courtroom experience. It’s time to share the wealth of billable hours.

She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

# Eleventh Circuit Benchslaps Biglaw Partner And District Court For Not Following Order
## They made the panel MAD.

When the Eleventh Circuit makes a ruling and remands the case for application of said decision, the judges pretty much expect that ruling to be followed. And if the holding is ignored, as it was in Winn-Dixie Stores Inc. et al. v. Dolgencorp LLC et al., well, they’re gonna get pissed.

The dispute dates back to 2011, when Winn-Dixie (that’s a grocery store, for our fellow Northerners) sued over 100 dollar stores for violating exclusivity provisions in their lease agreements which limit the amount of groceries neighboring stores can sell. In the original Eleventh Circuit decision, the court found the definitions of “groceries” and “sales area” from a separate case should be applied and sent the case back to the district court for application.

But that isn’t what happened.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Attorneys for Big Lots and Dollar General somehow convinced District Court Judge Donald M. Middlebrooks to *not* apply the ruling to 14 of the stores in question. And… yeah… they’re mad.

“Needless to say (or maybe not), a district court cannot amend, alter or refuse to apply an appellate court’s mandate simply because an attorney persuades the court that the decision giving rise to the mandate is wrong, misguided or unjust,” the panel said. “A district court can, of course, wax eloquent about how wrong the appellate court is, but after the waxing wanes the mandate must be followed.”

As [reported](https://www.law360.com/articles/1007696/11th-circ-scolds-winn-dixie-rivals-attys-in-exclusivity-row) by Law360, the panel also specifically called out Troutman Sanders partner [Brian Watt](https://www.troutman.com/brian_watt/) for convincing the district court not to follow their ruling:

The judges called out Brian P. Watt of Troutman Sanders LLP specifically for statements urging the lower court not to follow the Eleventh Circuit’s mandate, saying they “do not want an unfair inference to be drawn that any of those statements and misstatements were made by other attorneys who represented Big Lots and Dollar General in the district court.”

Yikes. Hope he doesn’t have any other cases before the Eleventh Circuit any time soon.

Let’s hope the district court properly applies the caselaw this time around, because their decision makes it clear — the Eleventh Circuit is not playing:

We don’t know what else we could have said other than, perhaps, ‘and we really mean it.’

Well, we really did mean it. And we still do.

Best to not make the panel any madder than they already are.

# Kasowitz P.R. Guy Describes Himself As Mob Fixer In Official Bio

Michael Sitrick (via Sitrick and Company website)

When you search the online bios of public relations professionals, you usually read about their serious “commitment to reputation management” or their “corporate positioning strategy.” All the routine stuffy words that appeal to clients who want paid spin but don’t want anyone to realize they’ve hired a professional bullshit artist.

When Donald Trump’s personal lawyer Marc Kasowitz started getting hammered with reports that he was [about to get fired and may have a drinking problem](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/marc-kasowitz-is-waking-up-to-a-bad-morning/), he called upon [Michael Sitrick](http://sitrick.com/about/michael-s-sitrick), the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Sitrick And Company to come to his aid. Sitrick’s name is all over that [Pro Publica story](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-russia-lawyer-marc-kasowitz-alcohol-security-clearance), explaining how the unnamed accounts gathered by the organization were untrue and providing statements from other Kasowitz Benson employees attesting to Kasowitz’s character and denying the claims that the boss went overboard at a holiday party (and denying the even more salacious suggestions of the piece). In short, Sitrick is doing his job as a spokesperson for a lawyer facing unflattering news stories. Frankly, he seems pretty good at it.

Like in this morning’s [quote of the day](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/marc-kasowitz-is-not-a-drunk/) from Sitrick:

…he never had a drink during the day at the Palm outside of lunch and dinner and never handled firm business while at the restaurant.

“Outside of lunch and dinner” seems to stand out like a flag in that statement, but whatever.

However, it’s just a little hard to take seriously a public relations flack who [opens his firm bio with](http://sitrick.com/about/michael-s-sitrick):

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Fortune magazine called him “one of the most accomplished practitioners of the dark arts of public relations” and “The Winston Wolf of Public Relations.” “Wolf,” Fortune explained, was the fixer in Pulp Fiction. Played by Harvey Keitel, he washed away assassins’ splatter and gore. Sitrick cleans up the messes of companies, celebrities and others and he’s a strategist who isn’t averse to treating PR as combat.”

For the record, Sitrick just informed the world that he feels comfortable being compared to a mob fixer. It’s obviously flattering to be linked to one of the greatest portrayals of competence porn in film history, but it also forces the average observer to wonder why Kasowitz needed to go all the way to a guy who compares his job to covering up dead guys. Ideally, the public relations professional should fade into the background, not be a distraction himself.

It’s not just that he’s announcing that he’s akin to a charismatic villain — as opposed to “working hard to present both sides of complex stories” or some other business safe fluff — it’s that he’s citing media accounts of his work. So he’s telling you that the media have already decided he represents the shady guys and routinely portray him that way. I’m entirely confused as to how bringing that baggage into every engagement isn’t a problem for his business.

Or maybe this is the whole point. Because now I’m writing a story about him instead of his client. Touché.

Los Angeles Magazine wrote: “Sitrick is a pure product of the 24-hour news cycle, of a culture dominated and defined by newspapers, magazines, TV, radio, the Internet, of the never-ending noise streaming into our lives. Beyond his aggressiveness, beyond his toughness, what distinguishes Sitrick is his ability to play the media to his clients’ advantage.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As frightening as it might be to admit, maybe we really are past the point of no return on this fake news stuff. We’ve got guys announcing on their official firm bios “if you see my name on a story, I’m ‘playing the media,'” and somehow that’s not immediately disqualifying.

Not that any of this suggests Sitrick isn’t great at the specific task of spinning for clients. It’s just that, you know, at some point public relations is about appearances.

UPDATE: Sitrick emailed a clarification. In the interest of completeness I provide his main point here:

Your headline that I describe myself as a “mob fixer” is not accurate. It is accurate to say that I cite a Fortune Magazine article which so describes me in this manner. This is a distinction with a difference.

In response I note that the post itself clarifies this with an exact quote from the bio. In any event, it is true that his bio is curated by him — the Fortune article is given prominence by his choice. To my mind that’s a descriptive act.

It’s why my bio doesn’t point out all the things the various readers have called me over the years.

# Biglaw Salary War Is Really Heating Up With Top 50 Firm's Announcement
## Big money is making its way through Biglaw.

Wow, Davis Polk really knows how to get a compensation party started. A month after Milbank announced their 2022 raises, DPW came over the top — at least for midlevel and senior associates — and now Biglaw firms are falling over themselves matching this new standard.

The latest firm to announce raises is Willkie Farr, a firm that made $986,000,000 in gross revenue in 2020, making it #44 on the Am Law 100. As expected, they’ve matched the compensation grid set by DPW yesterday.

In case you haven’t yet memorized it, here it is:



These raises will be retroactive to January 1 — the same [effective date as the Milbank bump ](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/)— and will will hit bank accounts on March 15th. You can read the full memo [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/willkie-raises-22/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Power Niche Marketing: The First Power Niche Marketing Lesson
## What can lawyers learn from pizza purveyors? Managing partner Bruce Stachenfeld explains.

Let me start this article with a [short story](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/31/nyregion/in-manhattan-pizza-war-price-of-slice-keeps-dropping.html), which I read in the New York Times about five years ago. It was about two warring pizza parlors. They were almost next door to each other in New York City and as far as I know they were both doing very well. I think they were each selling pizza slices for over $1.50 per slice. In New York at that time that apparently was a perfectly satisfactory price, which gave the seller a reasonable profit, and customers were quite willing to pay that price. All was well with the world.

Then one day, one of the pizza parlors lowered its price to $1!!!

The other one matched this lower price and then, in perhaps a fit of pique, lowered  his price to $.75.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The price war quickly resulted in the price almost dropping further to $.50, which is apparently break-even. This meant that neither pizza parlor was making anything at all. They were working for free. Their customers were getting all the upside of the pizza.

I don’t know how it ultimately ended, but one of the owners was defiantly quoted in the article as saying that if the other guy dropped his price further he would go even lower.

It was a sad and foolish story that resulted in a race to the bottom and, if it continued further, would logically have resulted in the bankruptcy of both pizza purveyors.

Well, when I teach marketing to my young lawyers, I tell them very simply: We don’t ever ever ever want to be like those pizza guys. That is the first lesson.

Ultimately, if you are selling the same thing as someone else, then you are in a very weak position. You have to rely on being likable or other clever strategies to market commodities, which really consist of trying to convince the customer your product really isn’t the same, or tying your “same” product to “non-same” services. Otherwise your customer has an easy ability to just say that the other guy is cheaper than you and you have no choice but to match the price, and away goes your profit. If you are reading carefully here, the (ironic) point is that if your product is the same as everyone else’s, the goal is to make it appear that it is not really the same.

So now we come to a very important insight about Power Niche marketing, so please read carefully here, as this is critical.

The concept of marketing in a niche is counterintuitive but very powerful. It means that instead of trying to be “all things to all people,” you instead pick a smaller subset of whatever industry you are in and learn every single thing possible about that smaller subset and dominate it. Basically instead of a small fish in a big pond, you become a small fish in a smaller pond, but since the smaller pond is so much smaller, you now look like a big fish!

Let’s go back to our poor pizza players and illustrate what I would have done in that situation. Let’s say that one of the guys had recognized that he was of Indian background (which was true based on the article). What if he decided to market Indian Pizza, which would be pizza that had interesting Indian toppings on it. Instinctively, this sounds like a losing strategy to many since you would be kind of giving up all the customers who like regular old pizza. So you might say instinctively that this is not a good idea.

However, the key fact that makes the Power Niche work so well is that you don’t need every customer to want you. You just need a tiny little bit of the market to want you in the worst way.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Please keep the foregoing thought not just for a minute but for the rest of your life. If you get nothing else out of my articles, this thought alone is of incredible value.

When someone tells you that they want to start a business and only one percent of a ten billion dollar market will make the product a success, your first question should be, how will she stand out in that market?  How will she be different?  If there is no answer to that question, then she will either completely fail or, if by some lucky break she succeeds, she will not make any profit from her success.

To continue here, a Power Niche for the pizza seller of Indian background could have been Dalal’s Indian Pizza Kitchen, “which creates mouth-watering Indian dishes fused with American pizza. After you have tried this incredible cuisine just once, you will never want plain old pizza again!”

This would have transformed this pizza seller from a pathetic player dropping his price lower and lower to beg any customer to come in, into someone with ownership of a very narrow niche that appealed to a much smaller subset of customers. How much could he have charged for a pizza slice in the center of New York City?  $3.00?  $4.00?  $5.00?  Or maybe $11.00 for the Tandoori Chicken Pizza Supreme?

Would this have worked?  Of course I don’t know that without trying — and part of marketing is trying new ideas and failing with some and succeeding with others; however, one thing is crystal clear, and that is that the Dalal’s Indian Pizza Kitchen idea has a greater chance of success than does selling plain old pizza next to someone else perceived to be doing the same thing.

Did you note that here I am proposing to innovate, as well as market?  And did you note that I am “creating” customers too – since I am suggesting a new cuisine that customers didn’t really know they wanted until they tried it?

This would be a perfect example of a Power Niche in action, since by being the “only” Indian Pizza purveyor he would have ultimate bargaining power over a very small subset of customers who would learn that this is the pizza they really want. So instead of being in a weak spot with no bargaining power, our pizza purveyor would now be sought after eagerly.
If you are smart, you will realize that this monopoly bargaining power position lasts only as long as no one else also decides to sell Indian Pizza. I will talk about this later, which is the fact that it is rare that a Power Niche will last forever.

The bottom line is that if you are just a salesperson selling a commodity and begging your customers, employees, bosses, and everyone around you, just to talk to you, buy your product, keep your job, etc., it is kind of a pathetic existence.

However, if you can truly build, develop and “own” a “Power Niche” you become someone who everyone wants to do business with inside your niche. In that niche, instead of you begging others to do business with you, they are genuinely interested in what you have to offer and hopefully begging you for your product or service and, of greatest importance, willing to pay top dollar for it.

[I was surprised by] how little interaction there was with me, excluding giving me assignments. Also, I did not notice many in-person meetings between lawyers and was not aware of much collaboration.

— An anonymous summer associate at an Am Law 100 firm, in [comments](https://www.law.com/2023/09/25/the-2023-summer-associates-satisfaction-ranking/) given in response to the American Lawyer’s 2023 Summer Associates Satisfaction Ranking. Biglaw firms attempted to put associate attendance mandates in place to appease incoming summer associates, but it seems like that might not have worked out so well at this particular firm. Click [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/the-best-biglaw-firms-ranked-by-summer-associates-2023/) to see which Biglaw firms made the Top 10 in this year’s ranking.

# Biglaw Associates Holding Public Health Hostage In Bid To Keep Working From Home

We all — like as a society — have to pull together to get COVID behind us. I know, you know. But with rampant disinformation and conspiracy theories just as contagious as the Delta variant, well, it feels like an uphill battle. The full[ FDA approval for the Pfizer](https://medcitynews.com/2021/08/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-is-awarded-full-fda-approval/) vaccine helps, and Biglaw is even doing its part. We have a growing list of [over 50 elite firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/law-office-reopening-tracker-2021/) that are requiring proof of vaccination to get into their offices, a move designed to encourage the hesitant to get the shot.

But that doesn’t mean some people aren’t trying to make this all about them. As [reported by](https://www.law.com/therecorder/2021/08/23/the-few-lawyers-who-oppose-vaccine-mandates-want-a-voice-a-choice-in-firmwide-policies/) Jessie Yount at Law.com, now some associates are getting all bent out of shape over this VERY OBVIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH move:

Associates aren’t fond of mandates in general, despite the fact that a vast majority of the group appears to be vaccinated, according to Lorraine Connally, a Los Angeles-based recruiter at Swan Legal Search.

These young lawyers want “a voice and a choice,” Connally said, noting that law firms that make their associates feel like stakeholders by actively involving them in such decisions are likely to have a more cohesive culture.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Sure, I getting wanting a “voice,” but this isn’t which computers the firm is going to buy, this is a literal matter of life and death. The only relevant choice should be which arm you get your shot in. Get with the damn program and apply this faux-rage somewhere actually productive.

And some are apparently using it as a negotiation chip in advocating for flexible work arrangements:

“There is some interplay of younger lawyers being able to identify that we can work from home and have flexibility if we don’t get vaccinated,” said Jennifer Henderson, a Southern California-based recruiter at Major, Lindsey & Africa. “It all ties into being able to remain in a flexible situation.”

That is some BULLSHIT. Holding public health hostage because you don’t want to commute to the office four days a week is a terrible idea. And frankly, shows awful judgment that reflects poorly on your ability to lawyer. None of which is to say employers shouldn’t implement flexible work arrangements for all employees. We now know that Biglaw churns hours just as well with the flexibility to work from home, so professionals should be able to avail themselves of that within their discretion. But to use vaccination as part of a bargaining ploy? Especially when children, who cannot get vaccinated yet, and the immunocompromised, for whom the vaccine is less effective, are depending on everyone to get the vaccine? That is just incredibly problematic.

At least some firms already see through this horseshit:

Some firms have already made clear this attitude will not be tolerated. For example, Goodwin specified in an internal memo this month that “non-vaccination status will [not be considered a legitimate reason](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-will-require-employees-to-be-vaccinated-some-push-back-reopening-dates/?rf=1) to support 100% remote work.”

Let’s hope Biglaw coalesces around that idea, and the vaccination policies continue to spread. Because we really need everyone to make it to a post-COVID world.

# Biglaw Associates Victimized By Anti-Semitic Attack On Bus
## Part of the rising wave of anti-Semitism.

Last week, a married couple — both Biglaw associates (one at Morrison & Foerster and the other at Slaughter and May) in London — were victimized by what they describe as “a distressing anti-Semitic attack.” They were taking the bus on their way home from a play (Wicked), and discussing the quality of McDonald’s french fries when they were accosted by a fellow passenger. The rant began with a bizarre, and wildly inaccurate salvo: “only Jews eat McDonald’s.”

From there, [as reported by](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/slaughter-and-may-and-mofo-associates-subjected-antisemitic-abuse) RollOnFriday, the incident — which was captured on camera by the Slaughter associate — escalated:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Her footage depicts a woman asking another passenger, “Are you a Jew?” before smacking the Slaughter and May solicitor’s phone and lunging towards her.

When her husband blocks the woman’s path, she asks him, “Why are you touching me fam? I’ll smash your glasses into your eyes bro”.

After strolling up and down the aisle the woman tells the Slaughters associate to stop recording her, to which the lawyer replies, “I think you should get off the bus”.

“Get me off the bus, bro”, the women responds before sitting down and mockingly waving at the camera.


In a social media post immediately after the incident, the Slaughter associate contextualized her experience into the larger anti-Semitic landscape:

“It is not safe to be a Jew in London right now. We are experiencing everything that we were warned about as children”, wrote the Slaughters lawyer.

“This weekend in London, Jewish homes have been graffitied, people had to be escorted by police whilst leaving Synagogue and posters have been waved that would have been proudly held up in 1930s Germany.”

“Each bus or train journey becomes increasingly intimidating, making us question if this is a place we can continue to call home. As the granddaughter of two Holocaust survivors, I am appalled (but sadly, not completely surprised) that this is something I have to face in my lifetime”.

In a plea to her non-Jewish friends and Slaughter and May colleagues, she said, “Please do not look away. Please do not stay silent. Please reach out to your Jewish friends, talk to them, listen to them. And if and when you witness incidents like this – please, please, speak up. Because despite there being lots of other people on the bus, only one other person confronted her. And I was scared.”

And she included this poignant reminder about the consequences of this hateful thinking:

“This reductive thinking has real life consequences – it demonises an entire people. Because the woman on the bus didn’t ask me if I support Palestinian civilians – I do – or if I take issue with Netanyahu’s government – I do – or if I condemn the settlements on the West Bank – I do – or if I desperately want this tragic war to end – I do.”

“The woman on the bus didn’t ask any of that. All she asked was: Are you a Jew?’”

The MoFo associate wrote of the experience, “What struck me the most were the actions of the one bystander…who stood up against this woman in the face of her verbally attacking him. His courage is a testament to the power of solidarity against hate.” Concluding, “In response to her question: ‘Are you a Jew?’ Yes. #IAmAJew. I cherish my heritage, community, and identity.”

Both Biglaw firms came out in support of their associates. Slaughter and May Managing Partner Deborah Finkler said, “We are appalled and saddened that one of our colleagues was the victim of an antisemitic attack this weekend. This incident is deeply troubling, and something that no-one should have to go through, on account of religion, race or any other characteristic.”

“We condemn antisemitism and any other form of hatred and we are focused on supporting our colleague and others affected at this time.”

While a spokesperson for MoFo said:

“We are extremely saddened and distressed that one of our London colleagues and his wife were the victims of an antisemitic attack over the weekend. Our thoughts are with him, his wife, and family at this difficult time.”

“We are deeply concerned by the disturbing rise in antisemitism globally and in many of our own communities, and recognize the pain and concern of the Jewish community and our Jewish colleagues here at MoFo.”

“As our colleague poignantly expressed, ‘no one should ever feel unsafe due to their ethnicity, religion, or identity.’ We condemn antisemitism, Islamophobia, bigotry, xenophobia, and hatred in all its forms and stand in solidarity with everyone affected by hate or xenophobia around the world.”

The incident is being investigated by local authorities.

# Which Am Law Firms Have Grown (And Which Have Decayed) In 2017?
## A quick review of the lateral attorney market in 2017.

Michael Allen

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://www.laterallink.com) team of expert contributors. [Michael Allen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelallen/) is the CEO of Mainspring Legal. He is based in the Los Angeles office and focuses exclusively on Partner and General Counsel placements for top firms and companies. Prior to founding Lateral Link in 2006, he worked as an attorney at both Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and Irell & Manella LLP. Michael graduated summa cum laude from the University of California, San Diego before earning his JD, cum laude, from Harvard Law School.

Lateral Link’s team of experienced legal recruiters have followed the lateral attorney market over the past decade, like legendary MLB scout George Genovese followed baseball prospects for a handful of decades. Genovese had an eye for identifying the raw talent that an unheralded high school or college player might develop. Genovese signed some 40 players who made the major leagues, including such Southern California standouts as George Foster, Jack Clark, Bobby Bonds, Chili Davis, Gary Matthews, Matt Williams, and Royce Clayton.

Like with many up-and-coming ball players, oftentimes someone else will see partner-track all-stars’ latent talent before said standouts recognize it themselves. Usually self-awareness kicks in on Monday morning, after the results (or lack thereof) have fully materialized. At Lateral Link, we use a host of sophisticated databases, such as Leopard Solutions, LinkedIn Recruiter, and our proprietary system (we call it “The Mainspring Exchange”) to spot trends allowing us to forecast the market.

As a quick review of the lateral attorney market in 2017, I’d like to share an interesting report, courtesy of Leopard Solutions, called the Growth Decline Report.


By way of example, over the past 12 months, Kobre & Kim added 21 attorneys, lost 6, and of the 21 added, 20 were laterals. That’s a 23% increase in attorney headcount. On the other hand, Stroock shrunk by around 14%. As for the analysis behind the numbers, we could draw many conclusions, and this is where we channel our inner Genovese. If you cut out the fat (and keep the muscle) a firm is probably better off despite shrinking, i.e., by keeping profitable attorneys, increasing hours and utilization, decreasing payroll, and the like. However, if a firm’s losses include profitable partners, then revenue follows and a firm may spiral out of control in decline. I will leave out names, but a few stand out in the report. I am very interested in the reasons behind the numbers for some of these firms on this Growth Decay chart. If you are as well, please reach out to our team of recruiters to help navigate the story behind the numbers.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

Welcome to The Jabot podcast!

The podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Let’s be real — it can suck out there. So we want to create a space where our community can come together share stories, find support and devise strategies.

Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wears when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that — even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

In the inaugural episode of The Jabot podcast. I sit down with my good friend and all-around amazing woman [Kat Griffin](https://corporette.com/about-corporette/about-kat-griffin/), a former Biglaw attorney who is the founder, publisher, and editor-in-chief of the website [Corporette](https://corporette.com). (If you haven’t checked out Corporette — you really should! It’s the “[go-to source](http://www.forbes.com/2010/10/29/fashion-blogs-professional-women-forbes-woman-style-working-wardrobe.html)” for professional but fashionable women.)

We chat about everything you need to know regarding clothes in the workplace from taking fashion risks in Biglaw, to tips for dressing professionally in the heat of the summer, and why fashion is a feminist issue.

Enjoy!

# Norton's Salary Increases Are Missing Something Very Important
## Where is my additional money?!

There are two things lawyers do not play with: their money and [double spacing, apparently](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/heated-litigation-fight-over-double-spacing-ends-in-judge-telling-everyone-to-shut-up/). Norton Rose Fulbright is a Biglaw firm that does a great job of minding its Ps and Qs, but it seems like a little is missing from their employees’ paychecks. You see, Norton just increased their salaries!



But… that’s about it. Now, I know what follows is obviously inappropriate and hearkens back to a less-enlightened era… but it’s too spot on to not ask the question:


Did no one in Norton’s corner offices catch that — I don’t know — [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/cravath-announces-raises-comes-over-the-top-of-milbank-scale-for-some-associates/), [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/milbank-raises-associate-salaries-and-announces-year-end-bonuses/), [Skadden](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/skadden-matches-cravath-on-raises-and-bonuses/), and most of the other major players are bumping up salaries and bonuses? You’d think a law firm would do a better job of paying attention to detail. And it isn’t like they can’t afford it; the firm cleared a whopping $6,514,300,000 in gross revenue last year. It’s also worth mentioning that the firms seems to have left their St. Louis and Minneapolis attorneys out. Don’t be a miser and spread the wealth, would you?

Chris Williams became a social media manager and assistant editor for Above the Law in June 2021. Prior to joining the staff, he moonlighted as a minor Memelord™ in the Facebook group [Law School Memes for Edgy T14s](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10222912314148913&set=p.10222912314148913&opaqueCursor=AboVBPzRKh4loie1LupyI7ltSvsaUWxURlMk_338xXb_BPhzMNPHbWfVDUsOyUH1mfvHQ4Bsipef989J-V0OyqhMZzHPafTw49vttxDh_no8xymRSSUssmh47qTzHAc13R0wzk8nPhgSylnSAYcBNbHjYDqZDqy5r0f7PwzCZw9T-0cakKMIin3XI0O8R5H5OJGAu4kJjGPAoZpgL6woU9lwoHiAjxAwAlpmdlyt6vHLJ1TVn2srkC3G4qBW5ANthJ_YNT3BUPCu2vu1ZIxiqYwXGLfMIxQR4cllUaB0Cja74ln1FHs3n-xyHe6MDtxln0-F4QJchox9nCaivB_xmSxw3FduERhPebhWj1MKJ20jeucGZ64jY6DdUn2d87dVgNlFE5qHvNEtfMpoEKx1096oFfqbZ9s71YVsbXxLIsRiiW54eLp4R7z3WHAKu8v8xeLIZt86UVU1iOaSlJ0n5tT3_VonQT6n2F0sIUSLY272cI-yjWxaUIr0Qj-1NQDFFcn9dkq8pYV2-o0M3LK2Qhr9LKt-Bk4MTGUZCkb4Kw6mgDmRCux3nhJqd2hdLd8LgTA).  He endured Missouri long enough to graduate from Washington University in St. Louis School of Law. He is a former boatbuilder who cannot swim, [a published author on critical race theory, philosophy, and humor](https://www.academia.edu/33296970/Lets_Be_Frank_Parrhesia_and_the_Black_Comedic_Tradition), and has a love for cycling that occasionally annoys his peers.

# Decisions, Decisions
## Money? Geography? Practice area? What matters when deciding what firm to work at?

Despite the fact that the calendar has just flipped to September, for many law students, the Fall Recruiting Cycle — we really need to find a more seasonally appropriate term for this and I am open to suggestions — is coming to an end.  For those fortunate students, the extensive interview process has resulted in an offer for summer employment, and likely, a subsequent position after graduation.  A smaller cadre of students finds themselves in the even more enviable circumstance of having multiple options from which to choose one, or more positions.  Last year, I went through the [nature of the offer stage](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-fall-recruiting-season-part-iv-offers/) and while that piece was long on logistics — those two paragraphs on how the NALP Guidelines address multiple offers now read as if they were written in an alternate dimension, which they may well have been— but short on advice.  So how should students sort through multiple offers?

While [late capitalism](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/05/late-capitalism/524943/) might be the best term to describe the current American era, the latter part of that phrase is still applicable in the present day.  As such, in most industries, when multiple employers are trying to woo the same candidate, they will simply try to offer more money than their competitors.  But as [mentioned previously in this space](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/the-most-important-chart-in-the-legal-industry-and-it-has-nothing-to-do-with-the-law/), the legal industry is far from a textbook example of the intersection between economics and employment.  As even casual Above the Law readers know, with law firms wary of seeming cheap to their own attorneys, law students, and possibly even clients, base Biglaw salaries are typically at a particular market rate to which all firms in a geographic area adhere.  Such uniformity often trickles down to the bonuses as well.  This is not to say that exceptions do not exist and that some firms will go [above](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/salary-increases-at-elite-litigation-firm-say-associates/) [market](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/01/associate-bonus-watch-wachtell-lipton-2011-2012/), but typically speaking, salary is not going to be the deciding factor for most law students because there is no gradation amongst the firms — this similarly melts away when comparing Biglaw to more mid-size or boutique firms.

If money will not help you make a decision, consider geography.  Where do you want to spend the next several years of your life, if not longer?  Do you want to stay in the same city as your law school?  Return to your childhood hometown?  Live somewhere completely new?  Be honest with yourself during this process.  If you know that you do not like the cold weather, factor that into your analysis of whether you should accept and offer in Chicago versus Miami.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

This is not to say that geographic location should be the only consideration, but it should be part of your evaluative process.

Also, think about what sort of law you want to practice.  The vast majority of firms that make up Biglaw are all-purpose firms, providing a young lawyer with an array of practice areas from which to choose — though there can be some exceptions with certain firms having more of a boutique practice, but with Biglaw revenues.  However, there are some obstacles that can arise, preventing one from being able to practice the type of law they prefer.  First, just because a firm has a particular practice area does not mean they will have a need for new attorneys in that area when you graduate from law school.  There are instances in which there is not enough work in a particular practice area to support the attorneys currently in that group, let alone to bring in a new crop of attorneys.  Furthermore, certain practice areas are more prominent in some offices than others.  If your goal is to be an appellate litigator, the Washington, DC office is likely going to have more opportunities than the firm’s Boston office.  Intellectual Property work is more prevalent in Northern California than in Milwaukee.  Not only should you consider where you want to work, but also think about how that will impact the type of practice you can build.

Working at a law firm, regardless of the size, can be an overwhelming experience.  While law school can provide you with the intellectual foundation needed to complete your work, it cannot teach you the intricacies of each firm and the dynamics at play within.  That is where mentoring programs can be greatly beneficial.  Typically, new attorneys are provided with senior mentors (typically partners) who can make sure enough work is coming the first year’s way as well as more junior mentors who help navigate the firm.  However, not all firm mentorship programs are the same.  First, make sure that the firms you are considering actually have a formal mentorship program.  While smaller firms might have more of an ad hoc program, you want to make sure there are at least some people at the firm who will support you.  Assuming all the firms under consideration have a mentoring program, get to know some of the details.  How are mentors assigned?  How many?  Are they drawn from your practice area or elsewhere?  Can you get different mentors if issues arise, e.g., a personality clash?  What sort of budget is afforded for mentoring activities?

Finally, consider what you might want to do after the firm.  Even if you head into a summer program with the expectation that you will get a post-graduation offer, accept it, and spend the next thirty years at the firm, such a scenario is not always realistic.  Firms that have summer associate classes in the triple digits are not going to make 100 partners in ten years’ time.  Almost everyone in your summer associate and/or first-year associate class are going to leave the firm at some point before they would come up for partnership.  For those who leave the law entirely or go into academia — not to mention those of us who are academia adjacent — there might not be much of a connection between the new opportunity and their firm job.  However, for a great many more fleeing Biglaw, the landing point may well be a former client.  In-house opportunities rarely go to law school graduates as corporations would much rather let law firms train young lawyers and then pluck them once their skill set has developed.  But said plucking typically takes place from outside counsel.  Think about what sort of entity you might want to work for later in your career and see if any of your firm options happen to represent them.  It is much easier to land in-house at Pfizer if you spent the previous several years impressing them with your work product. 

Similarly, oftentimes certain government offices will have a significant number of former Biglaw attorneys from a particular firm who are always looking to add to their refugee ranks.  Do your diligence and see if a particular U.S. Attorney’s or Federal Public Defenders office you might be interested in down the line has a number of attorneys who used to work at one of the firms you are considering.  If so, that potential interview years down the road can be far friendlier than anticipated.

Having multiple law firm offers is an objectively fantastic situation, but one that can quickly paralyze even the savviest law student by [overwhelming them with choices](https://www.harpercollins.com/9780061748998/the-paradox-of-choice/).[[1]](#f1) However, if you think about the various aspects of the firm and your career, you can come up with a wholly satisfying choice.

[ [1]](#reff1) Consider what would happen if you wanted to buy some cereal and went to two stores, the first having one brand and another having fifty, which store are you leaving first with a box of cereal?

Are you ready for the next bit of COVID austerity news? Yes, these stories are coming fast and furious, but in the rapidly changing environment that’s necessary to get a full picture of what’s really happening out there in Biglaw.

All employees at Venable received an email this afternoon from chairman [Stuart Ingis](https://www.venable.com/professionals/i/stuart-p-ingis), laying out the “Proactive Financial Measures to Respond to Disruption Caused by the Coronavirus.” The email laid out the steps that the firm is taking to tighten their belts during this tumultuous time. That includes a sliding scale of pay cuts across the firm– those making over $190,000 will see a 20 percent decrease, and those under $60,000 will see 0– as well a furloughing some staff members that primarily support the firm’s physical locations.

Here’re the details:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The firm will:

Reduce Compensation for Lawyers and Staff.  The firm will implement the following salary reductions based on compensation level, with greater reductions associated with higher compensation:

Salary Level	Percent Reduction
Above $400,000	20% on all compensation plus 10% of compensation above $400,000
$190,000-$400,000	20%
$120,000-$189,999	15%
$75,000-$119,999	10%
$60,000-$74,999	5%
$59,999 and below	No Reduction
For lawyers and exempt professional staff, those staff on a fixed salary, these reductions are effective beginning tomorrow, April 4, and will be reflected in full in the April 17 payroll payment.  For non-exempt professional staff, those staff that are paid on an hourly basis, the reductions are effective beginning one week from tomorrow, April 11, and will be reflected in full in the May 1 payroll payment.  The firm has previously communicated to equity partners actions that affect their compensation in similar ways.

Furlough Certain Professional Staff.  We will furlough certain professional staff, primarily those involved in positions that support facilities and in-person operations when our offices are fully open, until Friday May 29, 2020.  The firm will pay for medical and dental benefits for furloughed individuals during this period and they will be eligible to apply for the expanded unemployment benefits enacted last week by Congress.  We also have prepared materials to assist those that are furloughed and will have staff and lawyers available to help with applying for benefits available during the furlough period.

We will be regularly assessing events and will update these decisions and our firm’s response as appropriate.  Thank you for your understanding and your ongoing commitment to Venable.  We have and will continue to have a great firm.

When reached for comment, the firm had the following statement:

“Venable entered this period of economic and societal disruption caused by COVID-19 with a solid start to the year that continued through the first quarter. The diversity of our practices, the quality of our attorneys and professionals, and our relationships with our clients are very strong.

Because the extent and duration of the disruption and its impact remains uncertain, we have taken steps to tailor staffing needs to the current environment and prudently prepare the firm for the future. Our actions include postponing certain distributions to equity partners, implementing tiered compensation reductions for attorneys and staff, and temporary furloughing certain staff in roles that primarily support office operations.”

Hopefully this will prove the only cost-cutting measures the firm needs to take and everyone really is back at work, as the firm anticipates, by May 29th. Fingers crossed on that one.

# Historic Firm Opens Up Its Wallet For Associates
## Historic, high PPP firm offers full raises for lawyers.

The home of the venerable Chief Justice Hughes has finally joined the growing masses of Biglaw in offering the Cravath payscale to its associates. Hughes Hubbard — one of the top firms in terms of PPP [that still hadn’t matched](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/profits-per-partner-at-am-law-100-firms-that-have-not-raised-salaries-for-associates/2/), boasting profits per partner in excess of $1.9 million — has finally announced its raises.

In [a memo](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/historic-firm-opens-up-its-wallet-for-associates/2/) from managing partner [Ted Mayer](http://www.hugheshubbard.com/Theodore-V-H-Mayer/Attorney.aspx), the firm matched the Cravath scale, all the way up to the Class of ’07 making $315K and including the summers.

This match has extra significance for the firm’s senior attorneys, because lost in all the matching news is the fact that some firms, like Hughes Hubbard, previously skimped a bit as lawyers got higher and higher up that ladder. A source said:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
This is actually huge for some people here because it matches all the way up (to some of the scales) — before, senior associates were making slightly below market.

Yes, Hughes Hubbard previously paid the market base only through fifth-year associates. After that, associate salaries lagged $10K to $15K behind the market. Not true anymore though.

Perhaps the firm realized it was making far too much money to appear to be shortchanging anyone.

In any event, congrats to the Hughes Hubbard associates… especially you seniors.

# Biglaw Firm Introduces New Hours Requirement -- For Partners
## Which firm is threatening to pull the plug on partners' quarterly profit drawings?

When we speak about hours requirements here at Above the Law, we’re generally shining a light on associates’ gripes about the sheer number of billable hours required to maintain good standing with their firms and the possibility of losing out on bonuses at the end of the year due to their delinquent timekeeping. We rarely delve into partner-related hours issues, due in part to the fact that such matters are largely kept hush-hush.

Today, that changes.

We’ve received word that DLA Piper has instituted a new daily hours requirement for its equity partners. It’s referred to as the “red card” system, and partners stand to be severely penalized if they don’t follow the rules. [The Lawyer](https://www.thelawyer.com/dla-introduces-red-card-system-partners/) (sub. req.) has the scoop:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Partners who fail to fill in a timesheet showing they have completed a minimum seven-and-a-half hours of work could have their quarterly profit drawings withheld.

In extreme cases where “delinquent behaviour” continues partners could also see their monthly drawings reduced, according to DLA chief operating officer Andrew Darwin.

Those seven-and-a-half hours need not be all billing, but rather, work generally, which includes but isn’t limited to training, mentoring, supervising, and client development.

What could have brought about a policy like this? Are DLA Piper’s partners getting lazy? [Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/work-your-hours-at-dla-piper-or-else/) had the same question, but their requests for comment from the firm went unanswered. Instead, they turned to legal recruiter [Dan Binstock](http://g-s.com/dc-legal-recruiters/dan-binstock.php), co-chair of Garrison & Sisson’s Partner and Practice Group Division, to see what he had to say:

[A] policy like this is usually brought on due to unproductive behavior that needs to be addressed. While this is unusual, if there are segments of partners who are not carrying their own weight and coasting, this policy is definitively a firm kick in the rear.

Considering that profits per partner at DLA Piper in the most recent [Am Law 100 ranking](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202755653273) came in at $1.57 million, threatening to withhold partners’ quarterly profit draws — and in extreme cases, reducing their monthly draws — is most certainly “a firm kick in the rear.” We hope that DLA Piper partners will heed the firm’s warning and put in (almost) a full day of work each day… or they’ll suffer the financial consequences.

In light of this parade of Ls, it is easy to fall prey to anything that looks like a win. Law firms are sharing words of support for diversity initiatives, but be wary of confusing lip service for direct action. From [Bloomberg](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/law-firms-boost-diversity-defenses-after-conservative-backlash):

Law firms are actively defending diversity efforts after conservative attacks and a slowing economy threaten gains.

Davis Wright Tremaine is boosting diversity, equity and inclusion education through panels, LinkedIn posts and opinion pieces. “There’s more of a call to explain it,” Yusuf Zakir, the firm’s DEI chief, said in an interview.

… Actively defending diversity efforts with posts and panels? I’m gonna be honest with you — that just reads like the suit-and-tie version of this:

To the firms making concrete moves to develop DEI, that’s great. That said, diversity discussions have been ongoing for years now. At this point, you should lead with concrete actions and strategies being deployed, not by centering LinkedIn lessons and pro DEI articles.

They aren’t the only ones whose active defense needs more work:

Foley & Lardner is spending more time clarifying that DEI at the firm means inclusion and support for all, not just ethnic or gender minorities. “The semantics of DEI are more important than ever,” said Alexis Robertson, the firm’s DEI director.

Right. I actually agree with the point on semantics. Diversity isn’t just about ethnic or gender minorities. Nor is it just about the economically disadvantaged or people with disabilities. But DEI has to be about [something](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/02/aba-committee-decides-to-diversify-diversity-it-should-come-with-a-clear-reason-why-thats-important/), right? The ABA released some recent thoughts and prayers on the importance of diversity, but these efforts fall apart without a strong why.

This isn’t some time of peace where you can wax poetic about diversity apophatically. It isn’t enough to just rehearse the positive merits of diversity either. We need action. The lines have been drawn and the battle is being fought; an active defense of DEI would look like committing funds to keep diverse employees on board after you hire them rather than deciding they’re the first ones to go when things get “hard.” Despite all of the big talk about the importance of diversity and hiring, retention rates have been falling:

[E]ntry-level diverse hires at the 200 largest firms fell to 2,049 from 2,371 in 2022, a Leopard Solutions report this month showed. While lateral hiring fell 23% in 2023, the recruitment of diverse hires from rival firms dropped even more—31%, Leopard found.

The data should be a wake-up call for Big Law, said Laura Leopard, co-founder of the legal database. “Not only did they change their verbiage, but they stepped back from hiring diverse individuals,” she said.

If firms are going to start making trends of posting how important their diversity advocacy is, it better be tied to some concrete action. Make a post about some diverse hires. Name some diverse partners — actual partners, and not the glass ceiling that gets dressed up as non-equity partner. And for the love of all that is billable, throw some scholarships out there that match what you preach.

# More Lawyers Should Take Vacations
## After experiencing the benefits of vacations, you may regret not taking them earlier in your career.

Work-life balance in the legal industry has been decimated in recent years, mostly because of increased work-from-home policies and burdensome expectations from managers. Although many law firms have vacation policies which afford attorneys and staff generous vacation periods, few may feel empowered to take full advantage of time off for fear of upsetting bosses. However, vacation is important to charging the batteries of everyone who works, and all lawyers and staff who are able should take as much time off as they possibly can.

Throughout my legal career, I have not really taken a proper vacation. Earlier in my career, I used to take the last few weeks of the year off, but I never traveled anywhere, and this period was merely a staycation at best. I took long weekends to travel to places, but I never took off for around a week or longer and traveled somewhere to see some sights and relax away from work. This was mainly because I tried to save as much money as possible earlier in my career to pay off student loans and because vacations are difficult for self-employed lawyers since this reduces the amount of money you can earn.

This past week, I took a seven-day, six-night vacation to the United Kingdom and Ireland, and the trip was amazing! After experiencing the benefits, I regret not taking vacations earlier, and I plan on taking them as much as practical moving forward. Upon arriving back home, it took some time to rest and recover from traveling abroad, but after that, I feel more invigorated and focused at work.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
People should take vacations for many reasons. Perhaps most importantly, people should work to live and not live to work. Some lawyers are so committed to their jobs that they do not want to do much that can take them away from those tasks. Moreover, people might fear that being away from work might make it difficult for lawyers to earn promotions and be seen favorably in the eyes of managers.

However, many bosses are fine with lawyers taking a reasonable amount of time off for vacation. Managers that actually care about their workers understand that lawyers who take time off may be more dedicated to their jobs when they return to work so it actually makes good business sense to let employees do so. I was also surprised by how much clients respect the vacation time of their lawyers. Sure, some clients wished to communicate during my time abroad, and it was easy to facilitate this depending on what I was doing that moment. But far more clients understood that most matters could wait until I returned from vacation, and this possibly humanized me more in the eyes of my clients and solidified the bonds that I have with those clients.

If your employer offers paid vacation time, you should take it. Don’t leave benefits from your employer on the table. I am perpetually surprised with how often workers do not use the benefits offered by their employers. Indeed, earlier in my career, I did not participate in a 401(k) match offered by my employer since I did not understand this benefit, and some workers did not use commuter benefits since there were some administrative tasks associated with this benefit. Perhaps the biggest perk that employers offer that employees do not use is vacation time, and many law firms offer two to four weeks off for workers. Sure, if your employer reimburses attorneys for unused vacation time after they depart the firm, it might make sense to not go on vacation in certain contexts. However, if vacation time is a use it or lose it proposition, then workers should use this benefit as much as possible.

People have different work experiences and may not be able to take vacation for a variety of reasons. However, as the old saying goes, no one ever regrets how little time they spent in an office, and people are far more likely to regret not taking time off. Lawyers can take a stand against the degradation of the work-life balance and recharge their batteries more by taking a proper vacation.

# Will We See A Wave Of White-Collar Litigation?
## And what implications might that have for lateral hiring in the white-collar world?

When we talk about practice areas that might actually benefit from the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout, bankruptcy tops the list. And this makes sense, given the big-name bankruptcies that have been filed in recent weeks, including J. Crew and Neiman Marcus.

Here’s another practice that might benefit from current events: white-collar work, both criminal and civil. The space has been a little sleepy in the past few years, as the more robust enforcement agenda of the Obama Administration gave way to a more pro-business, less aggressive approach by the Trump Administration. Just last year, Jack Newsham wrote in the New York Law Journal about a [“white-collar slowdown,”](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2019/07/25/white-collar-slowdown-forces-law-firms-ex-prosecutors-to-adapt/) fueled by a dip in white-collar criminal prosecutions to their [lowest level in 33 years](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-collar-crime-prosecutions-have-hit-lowest-level-in-33-years/).

(Note: although pundits [love to blame](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/opinion/trump-pardons.html) President Trump for what they view as an overly lax pursuit of white-collar criminals, it should be noted that the downward trend in white-collar prosecutions began under the Obama Administration. Federal white-collar cases [peaked in 2011](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-collar-crime-prosecutions-have-hit-lowest-level-in-33-years/) under President Obama, and they’ve been declining ever since.)

In the wake of the pandemic, is white-collar work poised for a boom, or at least an increase? From a piece by Tom McParland for the [New York Law Journal](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2020/05/08/lawyers-see-coming-surge-in-white-collar-criminal-civil-cases-stemming-from-pandemic/):

New York lawyers are bracing for a surge of white-collar criminal and civil cases stemming from market volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, former prosecutors told the New York Law Journal this week….

[David Miller](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/professionals/m/miller-david-i), a partner at Greenberg Traurig and former assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York, said investigations of pandemic-related misconduct were likely already underway, but additional cases also would arise from prior acts that are just now being brought to light.

“I think you’re going to see a combination of both criminal and civil law-enforcement actions,” Miller said. “Either way, I think you’re going to see an uptick in civil and criminal enforcement work later this year.”

Growth areas could include prosecutions of False Claims Act and fraud cases related to government aid programs launched in response to the pandemic, insider trading stemming from bigger swings in the stock market, hoarding and price-gouging of personal protective equipment (PPE) under the Defense Production Act (DPA), and Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) cases resulting from attempts to procure PPE in foreign markets.

We are already seeing increased activity on these fronts. As reported by [Law 360](https://www.law360.com/articles/1271105/covid-crimes-white-collar-cases-to-expect-from-the-crisis):

U.S. Attorney General William Barr in March directed the creation of a task force to focus on COVID-19-related market manipulation, hoarding and price-gouging, to be staffed by an experienced attorney from each U.S. attorney’s office.

New York federal prosecutors made waves in recent weeks with a number of criminal cases brought against individuals as part of the nationwide crackdown, including the first-ever charges under the DPA since President Donald Trump signed an executive order invoking the law in response to the pandemic.

And it won’t be exclusively federal. State prosecutors play a significant role in pursuing white-collar crime, and defense lawyers told Law360 that they expect to see increased state prosecutions as well.

(A caveat, though: the pace of these new cases could be a bit slow. Prosecutors are working from home, agents aren’t making as many arrests as usual, and although grand juries are still meeting in some jurisdictions (like the [Southern District of New York](https://nysd.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/courthouseoperations.april115-6-2020.pdf)), jury trials and sentencings are generally on hold.)

What could a pickup in prosecutions mean for the market for white-collar lawyers, both firm-to-firm laterals and lawyers coming out of government, such as U.S. Attorney’s Offices and Main Justice? Once firms return to recruiting as usual, the market should be better than it has been. That might not be saying much — in 2019, the market was so challenging that even assistant U.S. attorneys from the legendary S.D.N.Y. had a tough time of it — but any improvement would be welcome.

But white-collar lawyers should keep their expectations modest, and not pop open the champagne just yet. To borrow a term from the [real estate market](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/13/realestate/new-development-new-york.html), there’s a lot of “shadow inventory” in white collar — lawyers who aren’t on the market right now, largely because it hasn’t been a great market, but who will put themselves on the market once it improves. I predict it will still be a buyer’s market, at least for a while.

Which white-collar litigators will be best positioned to get hired? For partners looking to switch firms, the two top factors will be book of business and [actual trial experience](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/how-litigators-evade-the-question-of-trial-experience/). For prosecutors looking to enter private practice, trial experience is also critical; it’s a big part of why firms hire former prosecutors, who tend to get far more trial experience than Biglaw attorneys.

Other important factors include a supervisory title and experience, since this helps in garnering clients and press coverage; expertise in the right areas, such as securities, FCA, or FCPA work (more valuable than, say, drug or gang experience); and diversity, which firms are, to their credit, focusing more on in hiring. Having worked on a famous case also helps a lot. See, e.g., the lawyers who worked on Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, who landed at such firms as [Gibson Dunn](https://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyer/ahmad-zainab-n/) (Zainab Ahmad), [Paul Weiss](https://www.paulweiss.com/professionals/partners-and-counsel/jeannie-s-rhee) (Jeannie Rhee), [Cooley](https://www.cooley.com/news/coverage/2020/2020-01-03-preeminent-supreme-court-and-appellate-litigator-elizabeth-prelogar-joins-cooley) (Andrew Goldstein and Elizabeth Prelogar), [Jenner & Block](https://jenner.com/library/press_releases/19879) (Andrew Weissmann), and [WilmerHale](https://www.wilmerhale.com/en/insights/news/20191001-robert-s-mueller-iii-and-other-special-counsels-office-members-rejoin-wilmerhale) (Bob Mueller, James Quarles, and Aaron Zebley).

If you’re a white-collar lawyer at a firm who’s thinking of a move or a government lawyer thinking of entering (or returning to) private practice, please feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:dlat@laterallink.com?subject=White%20Collar%20Litigation). I’m happy to chat with you about the market in general and what you can do to position yourself best for a move once hiring returns to normal and the white-collar market (hopefully) picks up.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

Anyone who is a fan of “The Office,” or who has been involved in corporate America for some time, should have a solid understanding of what an exit interview is. Essentially, an exit interview is a conversation between an employer and an outgoing employee about a number of topics, including ways that an employer can improve itself moving forward. Perhaps the main reason why exit interviews are helpful is because outgoing employees are far more likely to be forthcoming with frank feedback than people who still work at a shop and who might be fearful of repercussions. However, in my experience, many law firms do not conduct traditional exit interviews. Even though no one likes to be criticized, exit interviews can be an invaluable resource, and more law firms should adopt this practice.

Before starting my own law firm several years ago, I worked at a series of bigger and smaller law firms. None of them conducted a thorough exit interview for me or any of the other associates who left the shop for other opportunities. The first time I left a firm, I was laid off in a massive reduction in force. I do not blame that firm for not asking for feedback since the brass needed to terminate dozens of people the day I was laid off, and they could not possibly take the time to solicit feedback from each and every person they let go.

The second time I left a firm to work at a different shop, the firm never asked to conduct an exit interview of me. I am not sure why the firm did not complete exit interviews of me and other associates who left the firm. The firm was generally welcome to suggestions and had an open-door policy with associates and staff. I think the brass at that shop just didn’t want to be criticized by the exit interview process, which I can empathize with. Nevertheless, that firm should have conducted more exit interviews. I learned that, after I left that firm, some of the partners asked associates who remained why there was so much turnover at the firm. If the shop had conducted exit interviews earlier, partners could have discovered and addressed issues at the firm sooner before they led to people departing.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Another firm I worked at before starting my own practice had perhaps the worst approach to exit interviews. That firm had the office manager conduct the exit interview, likely so they could check some box in their minds that they conducted exit interviews of the outgoing associates. However, it was pretty clear that nothing discussed at the exit interview would impact operations of the firm. The office manager read the broadest questions possible from a list along the lines of “were you satisfied with your rate of pay” and “when did you decide to leave” and nothing of substance was really discussed at the interview.

Exit interviews should be conducted with actual decision-makers at a firm and should not be rigid conversations. Rather, they should be fluid discussions of ways a firm can improve itself. I tried having such a conversation at one of my employers at which genuine exit interviews were not held, but management did not seem willing to have such discussions. Shortly before I left the firm, a partner came by my office to wish me well on my future pursuits, and I suggested that we set up a time to do an exit interview. The partner suggested that we just speak about matters related to the firm then, and I quickly went into some things I thought the firm could improve upon.

I could sense that the partner was not too thrilled about receiving constructive criticism about operations of the firm, and he launched into defending the way things were handled at the firm instead of accepting suggestions about how the firm could improve. The partner definitely looked like he did not want to spend more than a few minutes discussing things, which I get if he was in a hurry, but we could have scheduled a longer time to talk. Some of the things I suggested involved promoting remote work and lowering our real estate footprint well before the COVID-19 pandemic forced firms to think about these issues seriously. In any event, the firm would have benefited from a constructive talk about how the shop could have improved.

All told, law firms have regular evaluations and reviews so that they can keep track of associates and suggest methods of improvement. It is therefore unusual that many law firms do not have built-in processes for soliciting feedback and constructive criticism. Regular exit interviews are an amazing way to receive less filtered and more frank suggestions about a firm since outgoing employees are far more likely to be honest with management. Although it is sometimes uncomfortable to receive criticism, managers provide feedback to associates all the time, and those managers should be more open to receiving constructive criticism during exit interviews with outgoing employees.

Last month, Stroock’s merger talks with Nixon Peabody [fell apart](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/biglaw-merger-effort-crumbles/), and since that time, a steady stream of lawyers and legal professionals have [headed for the exits](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/partners-associates-staff-flee-biglaw-firm-after-merger-efforts-crumble/). Now, the firm is getting serious about finding a new merger partner, and the first thing that’s got to go is its pension plan.

Back in February, when Stroock was still on the market, the firm acknowledged that its [outstanding pension obligations](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/this-biglaw-firm-has-the-urge-to-merge-but-cant-find-a-willing-partner/) may need to be addressed. At the time, we noted that the firm’s pension plan is tied to its revenue, which at one point was about $40 million annually. These days, the firm’s annual pension liability reportedly sits at about $4 million.

While Stroock was still attempting to combine with Nixon Peabody, the firm contacted its retirees to ask them to consider a reduction in benefits, but now that the firm is desperately seeking another merger partner, it’s taking drastic steps to remove a “major obstacle”: pension buyouts are on the table. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/08/04/stroock-partnership-seeking-to-remove-a-major-obstacle-to-merger-authorizes-pension-buyout/) has the details:

From Pilot and Above The Law  
While details are still emerging, sources say the firm partnership has now authorized a buyout of the pension fund and has put that decision to a vote with the pensioners, with the deadline for casting the vote on Aug. 8. A firm leader said the authorization was for a complete buyout, which would remove the firm’s pension obligations. …

As for why the law firm didn’t do this before entering any earlier merger talks, [firm co-chair Alan] Klinger said Stroock “looked at several different ways to reduce our pension program before arriving at our current approach.”

Klinger offered the following statement on the firm’s pension problems: “The partnership authorized a buyout of the pension. A vote of the retired partners is in progress. We are optimistic about its success. This will remove a major obstacle to us accomplishing a desired combination. We are grateful to our retiree community, who understands the need and is stepping up to support the firm.”

Best of luck to Stroock as it tries to lighten its liability load to find its perfect merger match.

# 3 Predictions For 2017
## In-house columnist Mark Herrmann predicts that 2017 will be a surprisingly good year -- but all bets are off for 2018.

Three years ago, I started my own personal tradition of making predictions for the coming year in my first column in January.

[In 2014](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/01/predictions-based-on-empirical-evidence-for-2014/), I made a few predictions about what would happen with law firms in the coming year — more lateral moves, more mergers, and the like. Those predictions generally came true, and I was feeling good about myself.

[In 2015](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/01/predictions-3-for-3-in-14-15-here-i-come/), I renewed all of my predictions about law firms, and I added a couple of guesses about what would happen to bankruptcy and intellectual property practices in the coming year. It’s hard to tell if those predictions came true, but I generally think I wasn’t too far off the mark.

[In 2016](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/2-no-6-predictions-for-2016/?rf=1), I again renewed my predictions about law firms, and I also predicted (among other things) that we’d see a lot of bankruptcies among distressed energy companies. That may not have been particularly hard to foresee, but I said it publicly, and it seems to have happened. (I hear from several firms that bankruptcies in the distressed energy space have been quite important to the bottom line in 2016.)

And now it’s 2017. Time for more predictions.

Oy.

I started thinking in late October about my predictions for the coming year. I assumed, as did everyone else, that the Democrats would win the presidency, and I wouldn’t have to think about big macroeconomic changes. The first Tuesday after the first Monday in November changed all that. So what might the future now hold?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
First, it’s time for me to stop making general predictions about law firms. The practice of law has changed permanently. Every year, we’re going to see many lateral partner moves, many law firm mergers, more de-equitized partners, more client pressure on fees, and the like. None of that’s worth repeating any more.

But here’s one thing that may be worth saying: Big law firms will start thinking more about what they pay for real estate. Corporations did this long ago: They moved to cheaper space, put people in cubicles, began insisting that people who travel frequently share offices, and so on. As law firms feel more pressure to maintain their profitability, firms are going to follow suit. Perhaps not in 2017 (because leases come up for renewal infrequently), but relatively quickly, you will see law firms begin trying to save money by making more creative uses of space.

That’s it for law firms’ business practices. How about the law generally? My second prediction is for a surprisingly strong 2017 for big firms. I know that revenue growth is stalling and clients are resisting rate increases, but I think that larger economic trends will spur economic growth — and thus law firm profitability — in 2017.

The Republicans will shortly hold the presidency and both houses of Congress. Republicans are saying that they’ll reduce corporate and personal income taxes, encourage the repatriation of income to the United States, spend a ton of dough (government or private, or some combination) on infrastructure projects, and deregulate corporations. The stock market has loved those proposals in the last two months. And the stock market is right, at least in the short term: Corporations will have money to spend in 2017, and law firms will prosper.

That prediction has a couple of hedges built into it. First, no extraordinary events — large terrorist attacks, massive escalation of wars, etc. — will occur that could throw the global economy off-kilter. Second, this prediction is for one year only — 2017. My crystal ball doesn’t see into 2018. (I bought a cheap crystal ball.) Our current economic expansion has been going on for quite a while now, and it feels like it’s getting long in the tooth. We’re due for another recession — I’m just saying it won’t hit in 2017. And Republicans may find themselves divided over issues like free trade and deficit reduction at some point. Depending on who wins those battles, we may see some policies enacted that will slow growth over time. But again, not in 2017. I’m predicting that 2017 will be a surprisingly good year. All bets are off for 2018 and beyond.

Finally, a very law-specific prediction: We’ll see in 2017 the first product liability case involving 3D printing. [3D printing](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/pwc-study-reveals-3d-printing-growth-78323/) is becoming a mainstream way of producing parts, particularly in the aerospace industry. That trend is going to continue. Eventually, some 3D-printed part is going to fail, and we’re going to see a case about it; the only question is when. I’m not sure that I have the timing right on this — perhaps the first case won’t be filed until 2018 or 2019 — but I’ll go out on a limb here. (Why do I go out on a limb? Because I love my readers; I risk it all for you. And, besides, who cares if I’m wrong? It’s not like we’re keeping score or anything.) I’ll guess that the first product liability case involving 3D printing gets filed in 2017.

Those are my predictions for the year. To my predictions, I add just one hope: That you have a happy and healthy 2017!

The coronavirus crisis has taken a calamitous toll on the legal profession as we know it, and over time, we’ve seen more and more firms take cost-cutting measures — ranging from [salary reductions](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/biglaw-firm-announces-up-to-20-percent-pay-cuts-to-avoid-layoffs/) to [furloughs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/law-firm-conducts-firmwide-layoffs-furloughs-citing-coronavirus-concerns/) to [layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/law-firms-conduct-layoffs-slash-salaries-in-response-to-pandemic/) — in an effort to proactively manage their finances ahead of the difficult months to come. Sometimes, even Biglaw firms that are known for their kindness and generosity must tighten their belts in order to brace for the tough times that are ahread.

Sources tell us that Orrick, which is currently ranked [No. 32](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=227&name=Orrick-Herrington-Sutcliffe) in the Am Law 100 and [No. 34](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/orrick-herrington-sutcliffe-llp) in the Vault 100, has announced a handful of initiatives meant to save cash on hand now to spare jobs and benefits in the future, should it come to that. For the remainder of 2020, the firm will be reducing salaries for all employees on a graduated scale. We’ve been told that these are the specifics for lawyers:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
- Career associates: 5 percent salary cut
- Associates: 10 percent salary cut
- Managing/senior associates and most of counsel: 15 percent salary cut
- Partners, of counsel, executive staff: “deeper” cuts
On the staff side of things, we’ve heard that more junior employees will see a salary cut of just 1 percent, while more senior staff members could see up to a 15 percent salary cut. Starting on May 1, some staff members at the firm whose roles depend on more in-office activity will be asked to work on reduced schedules. On top of that, the firm’s secretaries will be asked to work four-day schedules. In all, the annual salary reduction for these staff members will range from 7 percent to 17 percent.

We reached out to Orrick for confirmation of these measures and received this statement from [Mitch Zuklie](https://www.orrick.com/en/People/8/5/E/Mitchell-Zuklie), Orrick’s chairman and chief executive officer:

We are navigating a hundred year event that is putting extraordinary stress on our clients, our communities, our people, and our profession. We have not yet felt the full impact of this crisis, nor do we know how soon the global economy will recover. So, it is prudent to take actions now designed to give our firm the flexibility to protect jobs and provide our people with health benefits for themselves and their families. Our program is structured to retain our extraordinary team so we can serve our clients and innovate — now and in the future. And, as a demonstration that we are in this together as one team, our most senior team members will make the greatest sacrifices. Of course, we sincerely hope that this global health crisis ends soon and the economy rebounds, and we will continue to monitor and adjust the program as necessary.

As we noted earlier, this firm is known for its kindness, so of course, they’re trying to match the bad with some good. Sources say that Orrick will be offering special “make whole” awards to top contributors, no matter their role, and that this money will be separate from the firm’s annual bonuses. To our knowledge, Orrick is the only firm that is doing something like this. In addition, Orrick, which has consistently been recognized as a [family-friendly firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/the-top-10-law-firms-for-gender-equity-family-friendly-policies-2019/), is offering all lawyers and staff the ability to work a reduced full-time equivalent schedule if need be to tackle the responsibilities of work and family during the pandemic. Last, but certainly not least, anyone at the firm who earned an [“Unplug on Us” $15,000 vacation bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/orrick-bonus-2019/) in 2019 will be able to defer their trips to 2021 due to the current unavailability of vacation and travel options.

As for Orrick’s summer associates, in an effort to limit travel during the coronavirus crisis, the entire program will be virtual and will be shortened to five weeks in time. In exchange, all 1L summer associates will receive offers to return to the firm next year, and all 2L summer associates will receive offers to return to the firm as associates after graduation. That’s certainly something worth celebrating. To ensure the dangers associated with COVID-19 have passed and to work around delayed bar exams, the firm will postpone the start of its 2020 associate class to January 2021.

We wish all those affected by the salary cuts at Orrick the best of luck as the firm attempts to weather the coronavirus storm.

According to a study by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, being a lawyer is among the professions with the highest rates of depression? A whopping 28% of lawyers suffer from depression at some point in their careers. On top of that, lawyers also exhibit high rates of anxiety, stress, and substance abuse.

What’s behind these statistics? One of the biggest factors is the high amount of pressure and stress that comes with being a lawyer, but another important point to consider is the way that lawyers process information — specifically, their understanding (or lack thereof) of perception.

What Is Perception?

Perception is basically the way we interpret the world around us. It’s how we make sense of the things we see, hear, and feel. Our perception can be influenced by a variety of factors, including past experiences, biases, and even moods.

How Lawyers Can Benefit From Understanding Perception

As you can probably imagine, perception is extremely important for lawyers. After all, they need to be able to read people and understand how they may react to certain evidence or arguments. It’s also crucial for lawyers to be aware of their own biases and how those biases may impact their judgment.

Some of the ways lawyers can benefit from understanding perception include:

1. Improved communication with clients. When you understand how people perceive information, you can tailor your communication to better meet their needs. For example, if you know that your client tends to be a visual learner, you can provide them with charts and graphs to help them understand the information you’re trying to communicate.

2. Better results in negotiations. You’ll also be better equipped to negotiate with people when you have a sense of how their minds work. For example, opponents that tend to be more risk-averse can be addressed by framing your arguments in ways that will appeal to their need for security.

3. Improved mental health. Last, but not least, understanding perception can also help improve lawyers’ mental health. When lawyers are aware of the ways their own biases can impact their judgment, they can make efforts to counter those biases. Additionally, by understanding the ways people perceive information, they will find that communication with clients is much more effective and much less stressful.

Conclusion

Perception is a crucial part of being a lawyer, and it’s something that all lawyers should strive to understand. For more information on how lawyers can benefit from understanding perception, watch the [“Perception IS Reality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgHYqqy2fw)” episode of the Notes with My (Legal) Self, where Carolyn Herzog discusses how lawyers can use perception to their advantage.

Over the past year, there has been a lot of talk about Gen AI and how and whether it should be used. It’s been a wild ride, unlike anything I have seen in my 35+ years (who’s counting!) of practice. It’s like we have all — lawyers, law firms, and legal vendors — stumbled upon an exotic tequila — irresistible and exhilarating — that we can’t put down.

But how do we navigate through all the hype? What should be our true north in making decisions about how to use Gen AI, or any technology for that matter?

As we step into a new year it’s a good time for some reflection. A recent keynote address here at the massive CES electronics show in Las Vegas helped me focus on what should be important to the legal community when thinking about Gen AI. 

We need to examine what we do and determine what we, as lawyers and legal professionals, are uniquely qualified to do. Based on our training and experience, what are we good at? What are we experts in? If we can identify those things, we can then ask: What work for which we offer no specific expertise can tech in general and Gen AI do for us?

A Fresh Perspective From CES

Now, about that Keynote. I have attended CES for close to a decade now. I go primarily for those outside-the-box ideas from those not in law that could revolutionize our legal landscape.

Keep in mind how CES keynotes go. There is a high-level official, often a CEO, who comes on and typically says here is what my company is doing for humanity (i.e., shareholders). The CEO then typically introduces other folks in the company to talk about new producers and apps. The CEO announces partnerships or “collaborations” with other well-known companies. They then bring out some vice presidents or directors from those companies to wave the flag. The keynotes are often predictable and, frankly, a little boring. 

But every once in a while, you get a gem. An insight that is instructive on multiple levels that even us lawyers can take with us and apply. And this time, it was all about how we, as legal professionals, might better harness and use Gen AI.

So, given all this, when I was sitting in the Walmart CEO keynote recently, I was only half listening as he started talking about Walmart’s collaboration with Microsoft. I mean, every CEO keynote speaker talks about the wonderful partnership they have with Microsoft. (So do most legal tech vendors, by the way.)

But, damn. When he said: Here to talk about Walmart’s collaboration with Microsoft is the CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, I about fell out of my chair. I guess when you are Walmart, you can get that kind of attention, even from Microsoft.

The Wisdom of Satya Nadella

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Nadella shared some real insights into Gen AI and its uses. Nadella likened Gen AI tools (well, he actually said Microsoft Copilot, but I will throw in the others) to having a seasoned expert right by your side at all times to help you. To save you time and allow you to devote your time and attention to things you are uniquely qualified for.

Nadella gave examples. Gen AI allows doctors to spend more time with their patients instead of drowning in paperwork. Students can get personalized tutors to help them understand details so they can advance. And on and on.

My Take on Lawyering

This got me thinking: What are the things for which lawyers are the experts? What are we lawyers really good at? What does our training and experience uniquely qualify us to do? If we can pinpoint these things, we can then figure out what parts of our job Gen AI can take over so we can do what we do best. 

In my 35 years in the trenches, I’ve realized I was uniquely uniquely qualified to do a few things that, for the most part, I was good at. Here’s my list:

- The ability to identify potential issues and exposure for my clients (aka, look for trouble).
- An ability to identify ways to navigate the problems, issues and troubles.
- Exercising sound judgment in advising clients given their unique problems and circumstances.
- Understanding and empathizing with my clients’ problems — both business and legal.
- A commitment to never say no without figuring out and offering workarounds.
- The ability to develop overall and long-term strategies for success given client needs and desires.
- And perhaps most importantly, recognizing that it’s not just about the law or the lawyer. In most cases, legal problems are just a component of business problems and issues.
Notice I didn’t say “knowing the law.” I handled all kinds of matters and issues over the years that involved different legal issues. Often, I didn’t know the law in detail. But I knew when to look it up.  I knew the applicable fundamental legal principles and their purpose. I appreciated the broad societal reasons for those applicable legal concepts.

From there, I could always research the details and find the citations. (Yes, it pays to read the cases you cite.) The expert at my side for the details in the early days was the law library and later associates.

Embracing Gen AI in Legal 

So in all the Gen AI smoke and handwringing, lets first identify what we excel at as lawyers. What only we as lawyers are qualified to do. Then, when it comes to technology and the flavor of the day, Gen AI, let’s look relentlessly at how we can eliminate the time we spend on anything else. Let technology free us up for the work only we can do.

That’s Satya Nadella’s advice. And Microsoft has done pretty well under his leadership.

# What Summer Associates Are Saying About The 2021 Program
## Law360 Pulse unveils its Summer Associate Survey.

With exam grades trickling out, it’s about time for law students to start heading into the office for the summer. Well, maybe not the office in these still slightly dicey pandemic times, but they’ll be heading into work in any event. But how are summer associates feeling about this — hopefully — final hybrid summer? Where do they see themselves going and how do they see COVID changing the course of their careers?

Law360 Pulse just released the results of its [Summer Associate Survey](///Users/Joe/Desktop/Law360%20Pulse%20Summer%20Associates%20Survey%20(1).pdf) and its a gold mine of information about the summer associate experience. Here are some highlights from the report.

If you could choose to do your summer associateship program at any law firm, which would be your top three firms?

1 Latham
2 Kirkland
3 Skadden
4 Gibson Dunn

Of the five firms most mentioned in associate “top 3” lists, Latham and Kirkland end up on top as young lawyers chase the money at these highly profitable firms. But check out California-based Gibson Dunn and Cooley LLP showing up as desirable locations. Looks like it does matter to be [the first mover on bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/cooley-spring-bonus-2021/). Check out the whole list of over 50 at the Pulse.

While we’re at it, which law schools did the best in the recruiting process, evaluated by average interviews landed?

Stanford
NYU
Harvard
Michigan
Berkeley

Stanford had a very small sample size of 10 respondents compared to NYU’s 47, so take their top result with the appropriate grain of salt, but the Palo Alto school reported an average of 20.2 interviews landed. I can’t imagine having the stamina to tell the same anecdotes that many times.

The report also excerpts some feedback from law students about why they chose the firms they chose:

Mandated a personality test, which showed serious attention to culture fit.

That actually sounds like a cult, but to each their own. Firm culture was a key factor for a lot of law students according to the survey, with 72 percent identifying it as either a 4 or 5 out of 5 on a scale of most important factors to consider. Only practice areas, geography, and firm reputation performed better. Geography makes sense — you have to go where you want to practice — but the other factors seem overblown. Firm reputation matters at a certain point, but given the easily identifiable tiers out there it shouldn’t be as big of a concern. And practice areas? Are you really worried that a top firm at your OCI just doesn’t offer “general litigation”?

Seriously:

At this point in your law school career, what practice area do you see yourself going into?

Corporate 16%
General Litigation 13%

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
That’s 29 percent of students seeing themselves going into incredibly up the gut practices that every firm has. When you add in the numbers for stuff like M&A and Bankruptcy that every full-service firm already boasts, most students are looking for practice areas everyone has. So why is that a bigger factor in choosing a firm? At least at this stage of one’s career.

The most stunning revelations of the survey involve the impact of COVID on the process:



Imagine “not getting a job offer” being number 2! Over half of respondents were most worried about remote working. It’s this fear of missing out on solid mentorship that must be fueling this stat too:



I did not see that one coming. People seem ready for human interaction again. Too bad the full-time attorneys they’re looking to work with are trying to stay remote as long as possible themselves. But it’s true: as firms begin the transition to a future leveraging the remote work infrastructure they’ve built over the last year, there will have to be changes to the training model.

And how those changes pan out will become something we’ll track in summer associate surveys long after the pandemic ends.

# Former Biglaw Partner Who Spent 20 Years As A Fugitive Loses His Retirement Account Too
## After 20 years on the run, his retirement account is the least of his concerns...

The hits just keep on coming for Scott Wolas, and well, after living 20 years as a fugitive, perhaps that’s to be expected. The former litigation partner at Hunton & Williams (legacy firm of Hunton Andrews Kurth) [pleaded guilty](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/ex-biglaw-partner-pleads-guilty-after-20-years-as-a-fugitive/?rf=1) to a variety of financial crimes back in 2018, and was sentenced to 81 months in prison. Now, a federal judge has ruled the balance of his Biglaw retirement account should go to the federal government.

But before we delved into this latest turn, a primer on Wolas. He was convicted on charges related to a scheme where he convinced at least 19 people to give him $1.7 million as part of an investment scheme to buy a bar in Quincy, Massachusetts. But a week before the deal was set to close, Wolas pulled a vanishing act, disappearing with the money. Law enforcement tracked Wolas down in Florida and he was arrested in 2017.

But, that wasn’t Wolas’s only brush with financial crimes — nope, that history goes all the way back to the late 1990s and it’s also when he first became a fugitive.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In 1995, Wolas was kicked out of his position in the Hunton partnership amid a scandal alleging overbilling and an outside investment scheme that swindled millions of dollars from investors. In 1997, he was indicted on 119 counts of fraud and grand larceny in New York over an alleged Ponzi scheme, revolving around liquor exporting. That’s right around when he first went on the run, using a series of false identities to elude authorities over the years. By 1999, his financial antics led to his disbarment, and his now-former firm was left to clean up his mess. Hunton[ paid at least $6 million](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB914375187940915500) to investors over his liquor-exporting scheme. Plus the firm settled with a former associate who [alleged they were wrongfully fired](http://www.leagle.com/decision/19971181245AD2d936_1241/GEARY%20v.%20HUNTON%20&%20WILLIAMS) after pressing for an inquiry into Wolas’s billing practices.

As part of his plea deal with prosecutors, Wolas agreed to forfeit the money in his retirement accounts. However, his ex-wife, Cecily Sturge, tried to have the account transferred to her. According to a decision by District Judge Dennis Saylor of the District of Massachusetts, Sturge had been in contact with Wolas while he was on the lam. She obtained a divorce in 2001 in a Florida court, and Wolas was declared dead in 2011.

As[ reported by](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/judge-refuses-to-block-forfeiture-of-retirement-account-of-former-hunton-partner) ABA Journal:

Initially, the retirement account was not brought to the attention of the divorce court. Later, with Wolas’ help, Sturge sought to petition the Florida court to transfer the account to her, falsely stating that she did not know Wolas’ whereabouts, and she had no contact with him since 1995, Saylor said.

The Florida court transferred the account to Sturge a month after Wolas was arrested in April 2017, but a restraining order by the Boston court prevented the transfer of the assets.

# Don’t Make These Mistakes: The 3 Biggest Impediments To Associate Career Growth
## Don't let these hold you back.

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://bit.ly/2KxFPa6) team of expert contributors. Eamon Welch is based in Massachusetts where he oversees attorney placements and client services in the Boston and New York markets. Prior to joining Lateral Link, Eamon practiced law in Goodwin Procter’s Boston office and Greenberg Traurig’s Miami office. Eamon earned his J.D. magna cum laude and Order of the Coif from the University of Miami School of Law, and he also holds an M.A. from Duke University and a B.A. from Trinity College.

The start of the new year is an appropriate time to reflect on your career development. Take stock of what you’ve learned and accomplished over the past 12 months; deliberate about what you would like to achieve over the coming year. Decide what actions you will need to take to get there, and what pitfalls you will need to avoid to do so.

Biglaw associates faced an arduous road to get where they are today. Admission to a top law school, strong grades 1L year, navigating OCI and landing a 2L summer position, a successful 2L summer and receiving a permanent offer from your firm, and the oh-so-delightful bar examination. But the race hasn’t been fully run, and your work is far from done. You can’t sit idly by and blindly hope that the currents of your present situation will propel you to your professional goal. Career development is an ongoing process that you must proactively address every day. However, sometimes the mistakes that you don’t make are the most important factor for your professionally trajectory.

As a Biglaw associate, the three biggest impediments to your career growth are lack of knowledge, complacency, and fear. Avoid these roadblocks, and you are well on your way to maximizing your professional trajectory.

Lack of Knowledge

Lack of knowledge is the first biggest impediment to associate career growth. There’s an old truism that “you don’t know what you don’t know.” Simple enough, right? Well, it’s amazing the number of associates who fail to grasp this concept in an essential area. Don’t be one of them.

Undeniably, it’s important that you master your subject matter and hone your technical skillset. But that’s not enough. It’s critical that you understand the legal talent marketplace in order to position yourself for optimal career growth.

Like the medical residency matching program, the OCI and 2L Summer process is not an infallible process for pairing the right employees with the right employers. Firms and law students do an admirable job endeavoring to identify mutual fit. But the reality is, a couple of Fall weeks and a subsequent Summer is too short a period of time to get it right in every instance, particularly, if we’re talking about a permanent match. Moreover, even if you selected the right firm for your 2L Summer, what might have been the right firm at that stage of your (pre-)career is by no means necessarily still the right firm after practicing for a few years. For maybe 10% of you, yes, circumstances align and you happen upon the firm when you begin practicing that offers the right mix of ingredients for your unique skills, characteristics, and goals so as to warrant spending your entire career there. But for the remaining 90% of you, this just isn’t the case.

Much of the apathy demonstrated by some Biglaw associates toward educating themselves about the legal talent marketplace is likely attributable to the lock-step, market compensation structure for Biglaw Associates. If everyone is getting paid the same in a particular geographic area, cultural differences among firms couldn’t possibly be enough to justify investigating other options, right? But what about [cost of living arbitrage](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/shipping-up-to-boston-why-biglaw-associates-should-seriously-consider-lateraling-to-boston-law-firms/)? And is it true that everyone is getting paid the same? Take a 4th-Year associate in NYC/Boston/SF/LA who is on the Cravath-scale as an example. The all-in “market” compensation for this associate is $320K. But what if this associate is at a firm where it’s the norm to bill 3,000 hours in a year? Conversely, what if this associate is at a firm where it’s the norm to bill 2,000 hours in a year? At the 3,000-hour firm, the associate earns a billable hourly wage of $107; at the 2,000-hour firm, the associate earns a billable hourly wage of $160 per hour. This delta amounts to $53 per billable hour, a sum greater than many Americans make in total on an hourly basis! 

Beyond the relative pay differences, there are actual, material differences in compensation among firms (and also depending on whether you stay put or take advantage of the other possibilities that are out there). Firms have gotten creative in their incentive packages such that a “market” base salary and year-end bonus is not the Biglaw compensation ceiling, but merely the floor. Many top firms are now offering [very sizeable signing bonuses](https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2018/06/20/kirkland-ellis-looking-to-expand-to-dallas.html) to talented associates working in in-demand practice areas. What about [above-market bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/big-firm-announces-big-bonuses/)? How about Spring and [Summer bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises-2018/)? [Retention bonuses](https://www.choate.com/careers/laterals.html)? Does your firm provide you with [paid vacation](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/12/21/need-a-vacation-orrick-will-foot-the-bill/)? What about a [technology stipend](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/biglaw-firm-blows-competition-out-of-the-water-with-tech-spending-stipend-for-associates/)? When you tally the various bonuses and perks associated with moving to a firm that more aggressively incentivizes top associate talent, you could be talking about a $200-250K difference over just a few year period. That’s a meaningful sum: enough to pay off your student loans, finance a down payment on a residence, or fund your child’s college savings account. How about letting that $250K ride in investments? Over a 30-year period compounding at 7% per annum, that $250K turns into $1.9MM. Enough to retire by many people’s standards – all as a result of making the right lateral move!

And compensation isn’t the only differentiator. Does your firm or practice group have a formal training program, or are you left to your own devices to sink or swim? Is frequent, constructive feedback prioritized at your firm, or are you clueless about your performance until your year-end review? What’s the staffing system like? Do you receive consistent deal/case flow that allows you to progressively enhance your skillset, or are you pigeonholed in limiting roles on sporadic assignments? Are weekends, holidays, and vacations generally respected at your firm, or are they just another workday? Does your firm make it easy to find a mentor and/or sponsor, or do you lack more senior guidance? As you look down the road, how about your brand equity? Is your firm giving you the right platform to market yourself and develop client relationships and originate business? How is the culture at your firm – is it the right environment for you to [succeed politically](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/office-politics-are-you-safely-navigating-the-waters-of-your-firm/)?

As you can tell, even firms adhering to a “market” salary/bonus structure are far from the same, in terms of compensation, hours, growth potential, culture, and quality of life. It’s incumbent upon you to learn what’s out there in the marketplace and familiarize yourself with the distinctions…and determine how your current firm measures up.

Complacency

Somewhat entwined with the first impediment, complacency is the second biggest impediment to associate career growth. Often, complacency is what causes lack of knowledge in the first place. You say to yourself: I’ve survived this long at my present firm with some of my hair still intact, the firm’s literature exalts our unparalleled culture, and my colleagues that I started with haven’t left yet, so this must be as good as it gets in Biglaw, right? Wrong. No matter how content that you think you are with your current situation, it’s imperative that you motivate yourself to learn about the marketplace.

Even associates who do educate themselves about other firms and learn that professional growth opportunities exist for them are still not immune to complacency in some sense. Despite recognizing that firm “x” offers you more compensation, reduced hours, increased partnership prospects, expanded in-house exit options, improved culture, and/or better work/life balance, you still fail to act. Yes, when you bill 10-11 hours per day for a prolonged period of time, things are busy and there’s not much free time. But unless you’re pulling consecutive all-nighters ahead of a major deal closing or trial, you can carve out ten minutes to speak with someone knowledgeable about the marketplace, five minutes to track down your law school transcript, an hour to update your resume, and a few hours to go in for an interview. You simply have to prioritize it and, if you do, you’ll engineer a way to make it happen.

Fear

You’ve learned about growth opportunities and acted upon that knowledge. But you can’t allow the third impediment to career growth to hold you back: fear. Fear can sabotage your professional development, and almost always the basis is unfounded.

Sometimes associates are afraid to pursue growth opportunities because of more general fears. Fear of the unknown, fear of change. Embrace these aspects of your transition and treat it as a positive. You’ve started fresh in law school, at your current firm, and on many other occasions in life. The process is the same. It also furnishes you with the ability to erase weaknesses or shortcomings in your current situation and build your internal profile anew with the benefit of hindsight. Moreover, existing associates are accustomed to new faces joining their practice group periodically, and it’s likely that other associates will be lateraling into your new firm within the same period so there’s a natural support group. Finally, your new firm has expended considerable resources on attracting you there; the firm has a vested interest in ensuring your success upon arrival. The firm will almost certainly employ both formal and informal integration measures to effectuate a smooth transition for you. 

Another dimension of fear that can affect associates is fear of how colleagues will react. You’re worried about how partners and other higher-ups at your firm will respond. Will they be disappointed? Angry? You’re worried about how your fellow associates will react. Will they feel rejected? Will they resent you for having to pick up the slack in your absence? First, you have to always remember that law is a business. As anyone who was around in 2009-10 can attest, the moment that you and your practice stop making financial sense on your firm’s balance sheet, there will no longer be a position for you. Partners might lament the fact, but don’t be mistaken, if there’s an economic downturn and you’re no longer profitable, the firm will let you go. Accordingly, you shouldn’t hold yourself to any different standard. If your current firm stops making sense for you financially or otherwise (i.e. there is a growth opportunity available to you), you can’t let considerations about your existing firm prevent you from moving on to a better situation. At the end of the day, if you give notice in a professional manner and transition out of the firm appropriately, no one—partners nor associates—should hold a grudge; if they do, then it’s telling about your current firm and it probably wasn’t the best environment to begin with.

Takeaway

You’ve done the hard work of gaining admission to Biglaw and mastering your craft. In 2019, don’t fall victim to the three biggest impediments to associate career growth. Wall Street bankers have long known that in order to maximize their professional trajectory in the finance landscape, they have to be prepared to switch positions every few years. As of late, Biglaw partners have [caught onto this trend](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/12/27/after-a-banner-year-for-law-firm-moves-whats-in-store-for-2019/) as well. As a Biglaw associate, you also have to be opportunistic about driving your career and willing to embrace periodic change; especially, if you’re part of the 90% of Biglaw associates who haven’t begun their careers at the ideal firm for maximizing their career development. For the 10% of you for whom the stars have aligned and you’ve started at your ideal firm – congratulations, and keep doing what you’re doing! But do you know what the biggest impediment of all to associate career growth is? Thinking you are part of that lucky 10% when you’re really a member of the remaining 90%.

# Paul Weiss Mobilizing Pro Bono Resources For Ukrainian Refugees
## There's a lot about world affairs that can make you feel helpless, but there's a lot firms can do.

Refugees at Slovakian border. (Photo by Zuzana Gogova/Getty Images)

As Ukraine continues to push back on the Russian advance, hundreds of thousands of refugees have [already sought refuge to neighboring countries](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/02/26/europe-welcomes-refugees-ukraine-russia/). Before this is over, the crisis may well get worse, with some estimates tagging the final refugee numbers in the millions. And many of these folks are going to need legal assistance.

Paul Weiss chairman Brad Karp sent a message to the firm last night laying out the work ahead and the role Paul Weiss attorneys can play in assisting organizations addressing the crisis.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Throughout our history, Paul, Weiss has helped refugees and vulnerable migrants fleeing war.  Our lawyers worked courageously to protect the Jews of Europe during World War II by changing American policy towards immigration and arranging for tens of thousands of European Jews to secure safe refuge in America.  Today, we are closely following the dire situation in Ukraine, and are mobilizing our pro bono resources to work with relief organizations and legal services providers to help those desperately in need.

In addition to its in-kind donation of pro bono assistance, the firm is donating to a number of organizations and will match staff and non-partner attorney donations up to $1500 annually.

For now, while we watch the horror unfolding hour by hour from afar, our financial support for these organizations will make an immediate difference on the ground and our legal support will facilitate the vital work being performed by these organizations to help the hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees secure safe refuge around the globe.

There’s a lot to be cynical about in the Biglaw world, but these institutions bring a tremendous amount of money and expertise under one roof — or one Zoom platform, as the case may be these days — and when the worst unfolds, firms can bring a lot of resources to bear for worthy causes.

# An Inside Look At Insider Threats (Part I)
## How can law firms help clients mitigate the risk of bad actors inside their own organizations?

Ed. note: In Part I of a two-part series on insider threats, Gabriel M. Ramsey (a partner in the San Francisco office of Crowell & Moring, where he focuses his practice on complex litigation involving intellectual property and cybersecurity) helps me explore how law firms can help clients proactively mitigate the risk of bad actors inside their own organizations, and how law firms themselves tackle the ever-present insider threat. In Part II, we will look at the issue from the viewpoint of a security professional.

First off, with [one out of four law firms a victim of a data breach](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/cybersecurity-law-firm-data-breach-come-different-forms), are there particular security vulnerabilities in law firms which are unique to the industry?

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
GR: Lawyers already have the confidentiality clause to abide by, so the bar is already high.  Lawyers know they must conform with attorney-client privilege.  They know they have valuable information in their possession, so security and privacy conversations with employees are generally easier. But law firms are always going to be a target of many different types of digital adversaries because they have secrets on so many types of companies.  Firms have the type of information that sophisticated actors will invest time and resources to obtain.  For example, in recent years we’ve seen more examples of calculated breaches where organized crime groups are hacking into the networks of law firms to steal high-value data and then trade on it.

With insider attacks on the rise, there is a need for increased vigilance which seems at odds with creating an open and trusting culture.  What’s your take?

GR: It’s important to understand who your company engages with, whether those are employees or supply-chain partners.  The saying, “know your customer” applies here.  Know your employee base.  Employees have daily and pervasive access to more highly effective digital tools to do things that aren’t socially productive than ever before.  The average smartphone or work laptop is an excellent tool for stealing data.  The average mid-level employee has access to a lot of information, but they aren’t in a decision-making role so management isn’t looking at them.  I wouldn’t say that employers are ignoring the situation but, given how easy it is to move digital data and the availability of tools to do so, there is almost an unavoidable need for more scrutiny and monitoring of people and activities.  But this might be perceived as working against an open and trusting culture.  Many firms now have data loss prevention technologies (DLP) and similar tools which help ensure that sensitive data is not exfiltrated, lost, misused, or accessed by unauthorized users.  Yet there’s uncertainty as to how much monitoring to do, even if it’s completely legal.

How can a firm strike a balance with monitoring?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
GR: Companies don’t avail themselves of technical monitoring as much as they could.  The way to resolve it is to bring employees along on the information protection mission and to be pretty up front about use of technical tools.  You can have a conversation with employees that doesn’t make them feel as if there’s a big brother problem and that everyone’s on same page. It’s pretty easy to keep tabs on a company’s digital domain in a way that’s never been possible before.  But companies often don’t deploy DLP or similar tools or they mis-deploy tools such that they aren’t as effective as they can be.

The main thing for the lawyers managing risk regarding sensitive data and IP is to have a dialogue with and align with the security and IT functions in the organization. For example, from a technical standpoint it is important to configure DLP so that it’s looking at traffic around high-value IP, which depending on the tool, may be through keyword or heuristic-based techniques.  You don’t need to monitor all web-browsing activity but at least all packets leaving the network from ports and devices which contain the highest-value content in the company.  In a pharmaceutical company, for instance, lab notebooks might be such an example.  Embedding watermarks or tracking technology in those documents can provide a great ROI as well. In law firms, client documents containing internal trade secrets would be another example of IP you need to protect with DLP.  What’s important is that the legal risk managers, in law firms or otherwise, fully understand the options and integrate them thoughtfully into a risk management strategy.

We hear a lot these days about state-sponsored actors and nation-states hacking into our government offices and large corporations.  Is that threat also a problem in the legal industry?

GR: These definitely happen and they are often very hard to detect.  In terms of volume, I believe that the most severe examples of this type of thing are edge cases which occur when the IP is extremely valuable.  But they are unfortunately high injury and high-risk cases. Lawyers must absolutely plan for them.  What I see mostly is good old-fashioned angry employees or commercial motivation to steal ideas and profit from them.  The problem with state-sponsored actors is that it’s a much more sophisticated type of attack.  It’s harder to see what’s going on because the bad actors have a specific agenda and resources to hide their tracks.  They also have patience.  It’s not just a matter of looking at employee accounts and devices for obvious indicators of theft when they leave the company.  To combat sophisticated state-sponsored actors, you’ve got to compile a lot of little details over a lengthy period of time and across contexts to see the patterns.  This brings us back to the hard question of how much monitoring of people and activities you need.

Let’s talk about BYOD, which is endemic in most industries.  How do you guide clients on setting policies for security in this environment?

GR: You need to have good contracts and policies in place, which employees must sign or agree to.  There are a lot of nuances technically.  If you’re talking about an employee-owned device remotely accessing accounts over an unsecured network, you can just cut off access.  What about an employee bringing home a USB device loaded with documents?  Do you need some form of legal order to obtain that device from the home?  It’s important to think through all these scenarios thoroughly, considering the borders for employee rights and where the company is going to draw the line.  But, good clear contracts with employees, detailing rights and obligations, can make this easier when issues arise.

Does the court system support these types of contracts?

GR: I think U.S. courts would respond favorably and enforce contracts that draw clear lines regarding BYOD issues.  I’m not sure about the cross-border situation in every country but I am aware that in Europe there are more stringent employee protection regulations. So, options may be limited outside the U.S.  Even here in the U.S., some states started enacting legislation that places limits on employer access to computing facilities.  For example, California has a specific statutory limitation on employers requesting employee credentials for their social media accounts.  We might see more states start to limit what employers can do through contract, in terms of technical access or monitoring.  That could make a problematic situation more problematic.

What do you advise organizations in light of increasing security threats from actors inside their networks?

GR: The technology piece of monitoring is one aspect, but it’s also about educating the workforce and reinforcing a culture that says we are all in this together.  It’s not about being autocratic. It’s about staying alert and realizing that the capabilities of bad actors are entirely dictated by the technical tools they are using to attack or steal.

Technology can even catch even innocuous behavior that poses risk to IP.  I had a client which had systems containing very sensitive, highly regulated information.  A couple of employees had installed a browser plugin to perform innocuous spell-checking, using a cloud-based service. The plugin somehow got around the technical defenses that prohibited installing outside applications, but because the company was doing so much monitoring, the security team could see, in real time, sensitive internal documents going out to this odd server on the Internet.  The security folks caught it right as information was being exfiltrated out of the company and were able to find the employees and shut it down immediately.  While in this case nothing nefarious was going on, if it had been a bad actor, the ability to see this type of suspicious behavior quickly gives a company lots of options so they can begin investigating and mitigating risk before a ton of information has been leaked.

In short, get the lawyers and the technologists on the same page, procure the right technologies for protecting your systems and data, apply it to the most important areas, and get your team on board to understand the importance of protecting client data and intellectual property — the lifeblood of the business.

# The Biglaw Firm Cracking An Impressive $4 Billion In Revenue
## That's a crap-ton of revenue!

Well, we may not know what 2020 will bring for the economics of Biglaw, but we are getting the 2019 results right about now. While not every firm has yet reported their financials, we do know what Kirkland & Ellis — the [reigning top revenue pile in Biglaw](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/09/biglaws-billion-dollar-club-keeps-growing/) — did in 2019. And, you guys, they had a banger of a year.

That’s right, in 2019, Kirkland saw their revenue rise by an impressive 10.6 percent, bringing them to a crazy $4.154 billion in revenue. Wow. And profits per equity partner were also up — 3.13 percent to $5.195 million.

The firm is also busy getting bigger.  In 2019, Kirkland’s headcount went up 12.6 percent, with the London office leading the way with a 3.3 percent headcount increase, bring that office to ~307 lawyers. However, all the headcount growth does have a downside, with revenue per lawyer dipping 1.8 percent to $1.59 million.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2020/03/18/kirklands-reign-continues-as-firm-hits-4-billion-in-revenue/) Law.com, a big part of the firm’s growth — in both headcount and money — has been their mergers and acquisitions practice:

Among the deals Kirkland lawyers worked on last year was the $90 billion acquisition of Celgene Corp., a Summit, New Jersey-based pharmaceutical company, by Bristol-Myers Squibb, in one of the largest pharma industry acquisitions ever.

The firm’s 2019 lateral hires reflected its continued focus on M&A and private equity work. Among the 20 lawyers Kirkland poached from Proskauer Rose in March 2019 were several partners whose work centered around private equity. The firm also added Adrian Maguire from Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer; corporate lawyers Vincent Ponsonnaille and Laurent Victor-Michel; Latham’s Debbie Yee; and David Klein of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison to its ranks over the past year.

They also had some big-ticket litigation victories on behalf Boeing and Facebook. Plus the restructuring practice also had a great year. They worked on the [Toys “R” Us restructuring](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/kirkland-ellis-successfully-profits-off-our-crumbling-childhood-memories/) as well as the bankruptcies of FullBeauty Brands, Things Remembered, Forever 21, Destination Maternity, Pier One, Acosta, McDermott International, Vanguard Natural Resources, Jones Energy, and Murray Energy.

Congrats to Kirkland on a great 2019.

Every year, we compile a list of the [top law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/top-outside-counsel-rankings-2023/) in the country, and we are now collecting data for 2024.

As always, to build our rankings of the Top Outside Counsel, we turn to those whose perspectives matter most to law firms — the clients who hire them.

We invite all in-house attorneys to tell us about the law firms you work with. Whom do you hire most often for routine matters? Which firms do you call when the stakes are highest?

# Informed Advice (Part II): Lessons For Lawyers From The Tax And Accounting Industry

In my article [last month](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/informed-advice-a-law-firm-strategy-to-maximize-value-for-clients/), I explored the value that legal professionals can offer by understanding their clients’ business to provide more informed advice. This month, we’ll go a step further to delve into lessons that lawyers can learn from their counterparts in the tax and accounting industry to help their clients take action on the advice they provide to them — another excellent pathway to increase your value and deepen your client relationships.

In the finance world, material weaknesses — or instances when a company doesn’t have control over its financial reporting — are a bad problem to have. For publicly listed companies, it means that an independent firm has concluded an audit and must include commentary on the “lack of control” in their audit report about the company. This can cause the company’s stock price to go down, and it is not uncommon for someone to lose their job.

During my time working with corporations on tax and accounting problems, I was in a unique position to study the root cause of a number of material weakness situations. While many of these issues were simply caused by manual processes or spreadsheet errors that got out of hand, there were several situations where a tax advisor proposed a way to save taxes or to restructure the organization to be more tax efficient. While the outcome of the engagement was almost always positive, operational considerations weren’t always factored in at the conclusion of the engagement. As a result, a lack of consideration for change management was often the beginning of a control issue that could lead to the material weakness. Here is a quick example.

A cost segregation study is an engagement where a skyscraper, a manufacturing plant, or other very expensive assets are broken down into individual components. To illustrate, a company that owns a $100 million building might isolate various components of the building into different buckets for accounting purposes. Rather than track one building that is worth $100 million, the corporation might choose to “segregate” costs like elevators, air conditioning systems, security systems, doors, and bathroom fixtures into different buckets, grouping assets so the company can take a larger tax deduction and save money.

At the end of the engagement, the advisor shares a spreadsheet with thousands of lines in it, representing the components of the skyscraper broken down into thousands of parts. The corporation books the tax deduction and then submits a request to their IT department to “split” the one asset into many assets in the back office systems — but the IT department tells the tax department that it will take 18 months before they can even look at the request, so the tax department starts managing these assets in spreadsheets. Someone takes another job, a calculation error is introduced, and before you know it, the spreadsheet is giving inaccurate answers. For a corporation that is capital-intensive, there may be billions of dollars of fixed assets on the balance sheet, and mistakes made in calculations can rise to the level of creating a material weakness. How big can the errors be? For large corporations, the errors can be measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

In this example, advisors can dispense the sound advice, but without connecting dots and seeing the full picture, it’s possible for these kinds of issues to occur. Lawyers can learn some lessons from the tax and accounting industry that may help better advise clients, and empower clients to take action on advice in ways that bring more benefit.

Have an appreciation of what your client may need to do implement advice. Many law firms tout their expertise in specific industries and practice areas. It goes without saying that knowing and advising on the law is table stakes. Helping craft a policy or guiding a client through scenarios to get to a decision is important to help contextualize the advice and make informed decisions — but having an appreciation of what it takes to actually implement advice is a worthwhile knowledge base for a firm to have.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Ask your client if they have considered how to operationalize the advice. It is not the law firm’s responsibility to implement advice, but it is certainly wise to prompt a client about the operational considerations. That might be a casual discussion or simply encouraging a conversation between your client and the affected groups within the organization to ensure expectations are managed. Over time, a law firm might understand how some clients implement more common advice and share those learnings as part of the advice or as a checklist of sorts for future clients to consider.

Understand the big picture for your clients. In the case of the material weaknesses example, it is not uncommon to see the exact same firm identify the material weakness under audit without realizing that it was another part of their own firm that may have contributed to the issue in the first place. Likewise, it may be rather important to ensure there is visibility across practice areas when multiple practice areas are advising the same client. Any issues that are surfaced may not rise to the level of the accounting issue discussed in this article, but the ability to collaborate with other involved parties or consultants and help connect the dots for a client could be impactful. More often than not, a firm can struggle with this when there aren’t shared incentives for doing so.

Clients are looking for more from their law firms, and the pressure is on to serve clients more effectively. Regardless of profession, nobody would ever want to advise a client in a way that could potentially have unintended consequences — so it’s up to the advisor to do the work to understand the situation from their client’s perspective to provide the right insights and counsel. Doing so has the potential to demonstrate deeper value, and set you up for stronger, longer-term relationships with your clients.

Judge Alex Kozinski, who has been accused of sexual harassment [by 15 women](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/more-yes-more-allegations-against-judge-kozinski-reading-them-will-make-you-feel-gross/), has announced he is retiring. In a statement [obtained by the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/12/18/federal-appeals-judge-announces-immediate-retirement-amid-investigation-prompted-by-multiple-accusations-of-sexual-misconduct/?utm_term=.9f60ab093456), he indicated his retirement would be immediate and was for the benefit of his “beloved federal judiciary”:

“It grieves me to learn that I caused any of my clerks to feel uncomfortable; this was never my intent.” But he said he would retire because “I cannot be an effective judge and simultaneously fight this battle. Nor would such a battle be good for my beloved federal judiciary.”

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The Washington Post goes on to report Kozinski apologized for his behavior, but blamed his actions on his sense of humor:

In a statement provided by his lawyer, Kozinski apologized, saying that he “had a broad sense of humor and a candid way of speaking to both male and female law clerks alike,” and that “in doing so, I may not have been mindful enough of the special challenges and pressures that women face in the workplace.”

The judge’s retirement comes [just over a week ](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/judge-kozinski-accused-of-sexual-misconduct/)after the first allegations over his inappropriate behavior came to light. Many see this move as surprising, with only 10 percent of Above the Law readers [in a recent poll](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/what-will-it-take-to-get-alex-kozinski-off-the-ninth-circuit/) predicting the judge would retire — though 41 percent of readers said he should. The decision also means Kozinski is likely eligible for his pension as he meets the “rule of 80” which says federal judges may receive full benefits if they retire at age 65 or older, when their combined age and years of experience totals 80.

Kozinski’s ability to work was also coming into question, as few people — particularly of the caliber the judge is accustomed to commanding — were likely willing to clerk for him. As [Above the Law first reported](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/sources-report-3-kozinski-clerks-are-out/), three of his current clerks quit abruptly when the “[open secret](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/more-women-acknowledge-judge-kozinskis-behavior-was-an-open-secret/)” of Kozinski’s behavior became public. As a result of these sudden vacancies, AtL tipsters report Kozinski was making calls to his former clerks to see if they’d be willing to fill the gap in his staff. Additionally, sources report people lined up for a 2018 clerkship with the judge were withdrawing or intending to withdraw. A federal judge without their clerks is really limited in their ability to do their job, particularly with a judge like Kozinski who is known to work his clerks hard.

Year in and year out, we watch law firm after law firm pay lip service to their commitment to diversity in the legal profession, with promises to put women attorneys on equal footing with their male counterparts, whether it be through hiring and retaining more women attorneys, promoting more women attorneys to equity partnership ranks, providing more leadership positions to women attorneys, or adopting more family-friendly policies to ensure that women attorneys are able to excel at their jobs while maintaining a stable work/life balance. Despite these continued assurances, and despite the fact that a number of firms have made great efforts to improve women’s stature in the law, there is still much more to be done.

Today, Working Mother released its twelfth annual list of the 60 Best Law Firms for Women. These law firms are considered pioneers in the field when it comes to attracting, retaining, and promoting women lawyers. These law firms not only stand out as being family-friendly workplaces, but they also ensure that women shine in their equity partnership ranks.

With on-campus interview season coming up soon, these law firms are places you might want to work. Which firms made the cut for this year’s ranking?

To earn themselves a spot on the Working Mother Best Law Firms list, self-selected applicant firms with 50 or more lawyers must complete an extensive application (more than 300 questions long) with topics ranging from attorney representation, schedule flexibility, paid time off and parental leaves, and development and retention of women. Working Mother then selected the 60 best firms based on data provided by those firms from the year 2018. According to Meredith Bodgas, editor-in-chief of Working Mother, “It’s heartening to see the progress women lawyers are making at firms committed to fully utilizing these attorneys’ abilities. The war for talent is increasing incentives for law firms to invest in retaining women lawyers, which is why we’re seeing more women’s initiatives and parental-support groups. By highlighting what our top firms are doing, we hope others in the legal community will follow.”

Here are some of the interesting results gleaned from Working Mother’s study:

[T]hese firms offer more extended parental-leave benefits, encourage more lawyers to work remotely and use flexible hours, and are increasingly offering reimbursements for egg freezing and other fertility procedures. A few key parental-leave, work-life balance and career-advancement initiatives taking place at firms featured on the list include:

- 15 weeks of paid parental leave is the average minimum;
- One firm on the list, which strives to set reduced schedules that enable both professional growth and work-life balance, reported that attorneys on reduced schedules comprised 33 percent of those promoted to partnerships as of the start of 2019;
- Several firms offer parent-resource groups, which support moms and dads;
- Many firms have expanded their women’s initiatives and programs dedicated to the mentoring, sponsorship and promotion of female lawyers, as well as diversity and inclusion programs.

# How To Survive An Economic Downturn
## Making the conservative assumption that conditions will get worse before they get better, now is the time to assess your situation and take steps to position yourself to survive a downturn.

With talk of recession now impossible to avoid, many lawyers have started to wonder about their job security. It’s worth emphasizing that actual hiring data still looks healthy by historical standards. Nationwide, lateral moves in Q3 2022 were down more than 20% from the Q3 2021 level, but keep in mind that the 2021 market was unbelievably active. If we use Q3 2019 as a more normal base case, we find an almost 10% increase in lateral moves in Q3 2022. But even if widespread pain is not yet evident, there is much anecdotal discussion of so-called [stealth layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-dreaded-stealth-layoff-rears-its-ugly-head/). Additionally, at least one firm has [deferred start dates](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/gunderson-deferred-associate-start-dates/) for its incoming first-year associates, reviving an approach that was widespread in the Great Recession.

Making the conservative assumption that conditions will get worse before they get better, now is the time to assess your situation and take steps to position yourself to survive a downturn. Here are some things to consider.

- Are you a restructuring lawyer? Can you become one?
There’s nothing like a countercyclical practice to help you ride out a recession. If you do happen to be a restructuring lawyer, you should be worried more about a coming deluge of work than about job security. But assuming you haven’t worked in bankruptcy, now may be the moment to wedge your way in. In the old days, corporate lawyers tended to have broader skill sets, with bankruptcy being one component of a more diversified transactional practice. Even though modern law firms tend to be all about specialization, this historical legacy can still serve as an inspiration. If you’re already in a corporate or finance practice, call up a restructuring partner and ask if the group needs help. With the next wave of restructurings presumably on the horizon, if you can get in the door now, you might find yourself in the enviable position of having plenty of work.

More broadly, you may want to think about retooling, if not to restructuring then to another more recession-resistant practice. This is especially worth considering if you are a junior corporate associate who never particularly liked your work. The best time to retool is when your group is not busy — a slowdown in deals might present an opportunity to escape.

- Assess your firm: is it well-positioned for a downturn?
In thinking about your firm’s relative strength, it’s helpful to consider the past, present, and future. As the disclaimer goes, past performance is no guarantee of future results. But if your firm is known to have conducted stealth (or outright) layoffs in the last recession, that’s probably a relevant consideration.

The present is relatively easy to assess. Are you busy? Is your group busy? What about your friends in other groups?

The future is inevitably murkier, but you can still make some educated guesses. Is your firm unusually reliant on corporate M&A and capital markets work? Bad sign. Is it well-diversified, with strong offerings in litigation and restructuring? Good sign.

- Consider your alternatives
Keenly observing conditions at your current firm is an important first step, but you also need to contextualize against the rest of the industry. Talking to friends at other firms is a good idea. But for deeper insights informed by data, having a [relationship with a trusted legal recruiter](https://laterallink.com/why-you-should-build-a-relationship-with-a-recruiter-now/) can be invaluable. We spend all day talking to people at various firms, so we’re always informed about how the market is trending. And we have access to extensive proprietary data specific to individual markets and practices. We know which firms are growing and which are losing people to the competition. As stealth layoffs pick up, you can be sure that seasoned recruiters will be among the first to know the real story.

If you learn that your firm is underperforming relative to peers, or that it’s perceived to be at greater risk in a downturn scenario, you’d be well advised to investigate whether firms in a stronger position may be seeking someone with your skill set. Naturally, a trusted recruiter can help with that diligence as well.

- Watch the partners
Even in a good economy, most partners are open to hearing offers from rival firms. But with conditions deteriorating, it’s especially safe to assume that your partner is taking calls. Many partners feel the ground shifting under their feet, and they are just as worried as associates about potentially being pushed out. To the extent there may be concerns about the health of the firm overall, partners will be especially eager to flee: nobody wants to be the last person on a sinking ship. If you notice an uptick of partner turnover at your firm, it could be a sign that you too should look elsewhere.

# Typos Can Be A Huge Hassle For Lawyers

As many people within the legal profession know from personal experience, to err is to be a lawyer, and lawyers can slip up just like any other kind of professionals. Perhaps the main way that lawyers make mistakes in their everyday work is with typos, either by spelling something incorrectly or by making grammatical errors in a document being drafting. Most of the time, typos are harmless, and this website and other legal news outlets have poked fun at some of the glaring and hilarious typos that lawyers have infamously made over the years. I readily admit that I routinely make typos in my articles, and I rarely think twice about them since they are a natural part of any kind of writing. However, sometimes typos can have serious consequences, and lawyers should do all they can to avoid typos in many types of situations.

Typos can make someone look less professional, which can impact an attorney’s ability to originate clients and pursue certain employment opportunities. Individuals want to work with lawyers who are detail-oriented and who do not make mistakes. Making a typo might convey to someone that an attorney is not the type of person who will take their matter seriously.

I was once working on a team trying to originate a given book of business. Someone from our firm made a typo in an email on an email chain that included people from our firm and people from the business we were trying to sign as a client. The client pointed out the typo to the lawyer who made the mistake and it felt super embarrassing to have made that mistake in an email to the prospective client.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Sometimes, typos can be just plain embarrassing and can travel with a lawyer for years to come. When I was working in Biglaw, an associate was tasked with drafting a research email and sending it to a bunch of people from our firm and the client company in an email chain. The associate wanted to write “privileged and confidential” in the email, which is a common practice of lawyers attempting to conjure the attorney-client privilege and the work-product protection to cover their exchanges. However, the associate somehow wrote “privileged and congenital” in the email. Since “congenital” is kind of close to “confidential” maybe this was an auto-correct situation, but I am not sure why the typo was made.

However, pretty much everyone at our firm and the client team thought that this was a pretty funny mistake. Numerous lawyers and staff brought up the story of this typo in conversations around the office, and people poked fun at the associate who made the mistake for a long time. Lawyers do not want to be on the receiving end of such ridicule, and by reviewing their work product a little more carefully they can lessen the chances that they will make a mistake that will be talked about around an office.

Typos can also have a tangible impact on the representation of a client. We have all heard of infamous scrivener’s error cases in which a misplaced comma or some other small detail can massively impact a client. If I’m not mistaken this own website has covered a few such instances over the years. Of course, there are legal doctrines that can be relied upon to blunt the impact of a typo to a representation, but lawyers cannot always depend on the flexibility of courts and the kindness of certain legal doctrines when trying to countermand the effects of a typo.

Earlier in my career, I was sitting in court waiting to argue a motion when I heard a typo being used as the basis for one of the boldest summary judgment oppositions I had ever heard. The case involved two plaintiffs who were related, but the lawyer filing the summary judgment has only asked that “plaintiff’s” complaint be dismissed and used the word “plaintiff’s” instead of “plaintiffs’” in his motion papers. Of course, this is not uncommon, and lawyers usually copy and paste legal papers without regard to the singular or plural or other details that make each case unique.

In any event, the lawyer opposing the motion said that the motion only involved one of the plaintiffs and not both of them. He conveyed that at most, the summary judgment motion should be granted against only one of his clients. The attorney filing the motion attempted to make an oral motion to correct the record to state that he meant both plaintiffs when filing the summary judgment papers, but the judge said that she would take this typo argument under advisement. I never learned if the summary judgment motion was successfully opposed because of the typo, but that typo might have provided the other attorney the best argument for avoiding summary judgment in his case.

All told, typos are usually not a big deal in the legal profession, but sometimes they can lead to ridicule and negative inferences. As a result, attorneys should do all they can to ensure that their papers are free from typos.

# Why The Easiest Job -- Reporting What’s Happening -- Is Hard

Suppose you’re handling a mass tort involving 200 cases.  Or the general counsel is overseeing a legal department that includes 200 people.  In any event, there are a whole bunch of moving parts, and there’s a whole bunch of on-going activity.

The partner overseeing the mass tort, or the general counsel, makes an easy request.  If it’s the partner, the request sounds like this:  “Keep me abreast of everything that’s happening in the cases.  If the client calls, I can’t look like an idiot.  I have to know what’s going on.  So make sure I know everything that’s happening in the cases.”

If it’s the general counsel talking, the request sounds like this:  “Keep me abreast of everything that’s going on in the Law Department.  If the CEO mentions an issue to me, I can’t look like an idiot.  I have to know what’s going on in the department.  So make sure I know everything that’s happening.”

Easy, right?  That’s pretty straightforward.

Actually, no.

Because the boss isn’t really saying what the boss means.

Suppose you take the boss literally and tell the boss everything that’s happening in the cases:  “We got an extension of 30 days to answer in the Smith case.  We moved the deposition in the Jones case from Houston to Dallas.  We produced some documents in the Doe case.”

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Of course that’s not what the boss wanted to know.  And the boss will tell you so:

“What the heck’s wrong with you?!  I don’t want to know every penny-ante thing that’s happening in the cases!  Who cares if the deposition is in Houston or Dallas?  I want to know the stuff that matters!  Don’t be an idiot.  Report the important things to me!  Don’t bother me with trivia!”

Exactly.

All of a sudden the easy task just got much harder.   Because the job isn’t –- and never really was — to “report everything that’s happening”; you have to decide what’s important and what’s not.  You’re going to choose not to tell the boss about some things.  That poses a problem, because you can’t predict the future.

You’re a pretty smart person.  You know what counts and what doesn’t.  So you tell the boss only the important stuff.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Then the client calls the boss:  “The deposition in the Jones case is moving from Houston to Dallas.  That creates a problem.  The deponent isn’t able to travel, so we really can’t have the deposition taken in Dallas.”

Oh!

A triviality just got important.  Who’d a thunk it?

The boss naturally marches down the hall:  “Why didn’t you tell me that the deposition was moving from Houston to Dallas?!  I gave you a simple instruction — tell me everything that’s happening in the cases!  Now, the client called, and I didn’t even know that there was a deposition, let alone that it was moving.  I looked like an idiot!  I told you not to let that happen!  What’s wrong with you?”

The truth is that even a relatively easy thing — “tell me everything that’s happening” —  requires both judgment calls (which many people can do) and seeing the future (which is a little trickier).  Things that seem trivial become important for unexpected reasons, and no one can know, with 100 percent accuracy, what will become important in the future.

What’s the lesson?

First, even some easy jobs are harder than they look.

Second, bosses must be reasonable.  They shouldn’t think that requests that sound simple are always as easy as they seem.

# Former Biglaw Attorney Accused Of Injecting Blood Into Supermarket Food
## The attorney is facing some wild allegations.

If that headline isn’t enough to make your jaw drop open as you wonder, “what in the the actual shit,” then congratulations(?), you have achieved truly jaded lawyer status.

An attorney who previously worked at a trio of Biglaw firms — Allen & Overy, Herbert Smith Freehills, and Milbank — has been charged with contaminating or interfering with goods after allegedly injecting a syringe of blood into various food items at three different supermarkets in London. Leoaai Elghareeb, 37, currently runs his own legal consultancy business and appeared in court last week on charges related to the bizarre incident, [as reported by](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/ex-ao-and-milbank-lawyer-accused-injecting-blood-supermarket-food) Roll on Friday:

The solicitor appeared in court last week. The prosecution said Elghareeb entered the Waitrose store on Fulham Palace road on Wednesday 25th August at 7.30pm where he proceeded to use syringes “to inject food items with blood.” He then went on to inject food in a Tesco and Sainsbury’s store on the same road, said the prosecution, and threw eggs in the Sainsbury’s store. He was subsequently arrested.

The prosecution said the precise contents of the blood were not known at this stage, and food packages are being sent off for chemical testing.

According to a local “emergency alert” by police, “The food items affected are believed to be processed meat and microwaveable products.” And consumers were advised they throw away food purchased at the stores on the date of incident.

Elghareeb was remanded to custody, and a plea hearing was scheduled for later this month.

# The Depressing Reality Of 'Lawyer Math'

By now we know all about “girl math” — load up that Starbucks card today for a [“free” drink tomorrow](https://www.tiktok.com/@lifeftliv/video/7280743206474779909)! Return something you previously purchased and [profit](https://www.tiktok.com/@isabellapieroni/video/7267985284011134209)! Lay down your card for a friend who then Venmos you? [You’ve made money](https://www.tiktok.com/@chicks/video/7264953786513296686).

Is it a cutesy way to justify overspending in a capitalist hellscape? Maybe! But it’s nice to feel seen by the countless videos. But like any good social media trend, it has spin-offs!

“Boy math” has gotten a lot of play.

Boy math is paying $44 billion for a $25 billion company and, through business smarts and entrepreneurial know how, turning it into an $8.8 billion company

Boy math is being afraid of gold diggers when you only have 3 pairs of socks to your name.

But the one that really gets to me is “lawyer math.”

Lawyer math is being in the office for 12 hours and somehow only having 8.6 billable hours at the end of the day

— something something, esq. (@_adrxante) [September 27, 2023](https://twitter.com/_adrxante/status/1707029462255054931?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Oof. I don’t even bill my time anymore and I felt that one in my soul. Time wasted in the office that does not count toward your billable target is just pure sadness.

But there are other depressing examples of “lawyer math” floating out there.

Lawyer math is actually: ""the average life expectancy is 73, if I can work until I'm 65, pay off my student loan at 55, then fix the health issues from sitting and staring at a screen for 10-16 hours a day since I was 26, then I COULD enjoy 8 years of retirement before I die!""

Maybe this is why lawyers insist they’re [so bad at math](https://x.com/BarExamTutor/status/1707372820492071234?s=20) — the reality is just too damn depressing.

# Biglaw Is Losing Out On Legal Work
## Biglaw's share of the pie is shrinking.

Corporations just keep on moving more and more of their legal work in-house, and it doesn’t look like that trend will stop any time soon. According to a[ survey by](https://cloc.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-State-of-the-Industry-FINAL.pdf) the Corporate Legal Operations Consortium (CLOC), only 46 cents of every dollar went to external legal costs — like law firms — in 2018, compared with external costs taking 62 cents per dollar in 2017. That’s a big swing in only a year.

For the survey, CLOC spoke with 213 companies of various sizes in 32 industries and it showed internal legal operations, technology, and alternate legal service providers are increasingly filling in the gaps. As [reported by](https://www.law360.com/articles/1180061) Law360, legal departments are quickly finding new ways to improve their performance:

“This year’s data shows that the role and function of legal operations continues to grow,” said CLOC President Mary O’Carroll, who also holds the role of director of legal operations at Google. “Technology is changing quickly and more legal operations departments are embracing solutions to improve productivity and results.”

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Of the survey respondents, 41 percent said they’ve increased the number of full-time attorneys on staff, and 39 percent of companies said they’re increasing their legal ops staff. And the percentage of companies spending more than $750,000 on technology is now at 37 percent.

Even though the overall external legal spend is decreasing, more and more companies are spending that money on alternative legal service providers rather than traditional law firms. In this year’s survey, 53 percent of respondents said they are using alternative legal service providers a significant jump from the 36 percent from last year’s survey.

Legal problems aren’t getting smaller, but companies are getting smarter (and more frugal) about how they deal with them.

We asked, and you answered.

To get at the root of what truly makes a “modern lawyer” today, Above the Law and Litera recently surveyed more than 500 lawyers in a wide range of roles to uncover current views on technology, mobile devices, artificial intelligence, and more.

The resulting data, which is explored in detail in Litera’s forthcoming “Modern Lawyer” report, produced a number of interesting results – including some that might surprise you.

Join us for a webinar on May 5th at 1 p.m. ET, in which we take a deep dive into the findings.

 The panel will also explore what the data reveals about the makings of a truly “modern lawyer,” including:

- Current attitudes toward technology
- The concrete tasks technology is transforming
- Mobile device integration with practice management systems
- How AI is (and isn’t) a part of it all


If you are not able to join at that time, please register now and a replay will be made available on demand.

# Coercing Congress Into Raising The Debt Limit
## Almost no one is running for high office for the right reasons.

People see funny things in the Constitution, as the fight over the supposed constitutional right not to wear a mask makes clear. My eyes aren’t sufficiently good to see masks mentioned in the Constitution, but I do see these words in the Fourteenth Amendment:

The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned.

The Constitution thus requires that the United States government pay its debts.

And the United States defaulting on its debt would be a catastrophe, both to those who rely on the government for money and to the world’s financial system.

Somehow, despite this, members of the Senate are fighting over repaying the debt, and there’s a chance, once again, that the United States will default, this time in December.

Here’s my personal pledge to you, and I encourage you to join me:

If the United States ever defaults on its debt, then I will vote against the incumbent senators from my state who were in office at the time of the default.

See? Threatening Democrats might not work. Threatening Republicans might not work. But threatening incumbents? That’s the right target.

I have only my little megaphone at Above the Law to present my proposal, but I urge folks with bigger megaphones to spread the word. Let’s have a majority of voters in every state promise publicly to vote against their respective incumbents if the United States ever defaults on its debt. That will cause the children in the Senate to behave correctly.

Naturally, we should carry through on our threat. If the U.S. defaults, throw the bums out. They couldn’t perform the minimum obligation of elected representatives; we can do better with any alternative. So that’s who we’re voting for.

I realize that it would be impossible to convince many Democrats to vote for Republicans or Republicans to vote for Democrats, so I’m not asking for that.  Your obligation after default is to vote against the incumbent; I’m not specifying who you should vote for. You’re free to vote for the candidate from the opposing major party; you’re free to vote for any third-party candidate; you’re free to write in the name of Bozo the Clown for all I care. But I care deeply that you share my concern: If the Senate can’t perform its Constitutional duty and prevent a national catastrophe, then whoever is in office deserves to lose. You will vote against your incumbent senators at the time of the default. Period.

I realize that all of the senators will say the default is not their fault. Sen. Chuck Schumer will say that Sen. Mitch McConnell was unreasonable, so it’s not Chuck’s fault. McConnell will say that Schumer was unreasonable, so it’s not Mitch’s fault. If you don’t live in New York or Kentucky, your senators will say that they’re not in leadership, so default couldn’t possibly be their fault.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
I don’t want to hear it.

I can tell you this: Default is certainly not my fault or your fault because we’re not in the Senate. The senators get a vote; we don’t. I have to blame someone; those of you in the neighborhood at the time of the massive screw up seem like a good choice. If I blame all of you collectively, and I can bring another 200 million Americans to join my pledge, then the children in the Senate will be induced to act responsibly. If they threaten not to act responsibly without our assistance, then we should assist them. They do, after all, work for us.

The more I watch the children in Congress at play, the more I have two thoughts:  First, why do any of these folks think we need them? There are surely hundreds of thousands of people in this country who could serve in office as well as the incumbents; it’s no loss if we throw the incumbents out.

Second — and sadly — I fear that if you desire to run for high office, then you are unfit to serve in high office. (Running for “low office” might be a different story. I can imagine someone running for the local school board, for example, who wants nothing more than to improve the local schools. But by the time you’re running for the United States Senate, you’re almost by definition insane.) The desire to run for high office means that you think you’re better able to do the job than any of the alternatives to you; that idea is obviously deranged. And you almost surely don’t desire to run because you’d be skilled at writing laws. No one has run for office with the campaign slogan: “Vote for me! I’m reasonable, great at negotiating compromises, and draft unambiguous bills!” No, no, no. People desire to run for office for the money (whether while in office or after leaving), the power (which must be a strong magnet), and the public adulation. Almost no one is running for high office for the right reasons. And, if there are one or two people in the Senate who ran for the right reason, too bad: We’re sacrificing you, along with the rest of the bunch, if you default on the debt.

So join with me, and become a single-issue voter: If the United States defaults on its debt, I’m voting against the senators in office at the time of the default.  Defaulting on the debt would be absolute proof that it’s time for a change.

# Halfway Through 2020
## Notes from the Left Coast.

Is anyone else freaking out about the fact that half of the year is over? While we would all like to see 2020 in our rearview mirrors, we are only halfway there. The legal world still spins.

The Washington State Supreme Court has decided to ditch its pilot program of limited license legal technicians. Although the program was initiated in 2013 to provide access to justice in family law matters, this noble experiment has bit the dust. The court found that [the juice was not worth the squeeze](https://www.wsba.org/docs/default-source/licensing/lllt/lllt-letter-6-9-20.pdf?sfvrsn=ad6b09f1_8), given the program costs and the small number of “interested individuals.” The program will sunset next year.

The court’s decision was not unanimous. Justice Barbara Madsen wrote a scathing dissent, stating that the court’s decision ended a “completely viable licensing category that the public can draw on.” Not done, she made it clear that courts have an obligation to end racial disparity and that the court’s sua sponte decision to end the project, an effort to address access to justice in race and income, [was a step backward](https://www.wsba.org/docs/default-source/licensing/lllt/lllt-sunset-supreme-court-dissent-letter-june-5-2020.pdf?sfvrsn=ba6b09f1_4).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Is the court’s decision an example of not walking the walk? What about the fate of other, similar projects across the country? What does this decision mean for California, which is taking its first [tentative baby steps](http://www.calbar.ca.gov/Portals/0/documents/factSheets/California-Paraprofessional-Program-Working-Group-Fact-Sheet.pdf) toward a similar project? To be determined.

Remember the [furor several years ago](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/06/us/politics/judge-persky-brock-turner-recall.html) when a judge in Northern California sentenced a young male defendant to a six-month sentence for sexual assault? Outraged county voters recalled Judge Aaron Persky in June 2018. Judges should be free to decide without fear or favor, which was what he did and with which the citizenry disagreed.

The Canon of Judicial Ethics precluded Persky from defending his sentencing as judges have long been prohibited from speaking publicly about pending cases. After Persky’s recall, the California Supreme Court solicited public comment as to whether judges should be able to comment upon pending cases if they are criticized about their decision in a case and they are up for re-election or recall. Given the proliferation of social media and the increasing level of vitriol in public forums, incumbent judges have had no way to defend themselves, and bar associations, which have tried to play a part in defending judges, have had little to no impact. Who cares what bar associations think? Precisely.

So, effective today, the California Code of Judicial Ethics has been amended to provide, among other things, that judges can speak publicly about a pending case if they are criticized for a ruling during a recall or re-election campaign but only if the public comment would not reasonably be expected to affect the outcome or impair the proceeding’s fairness. Would that have made a difference in the outcome of Persky’s recall? Your thoughts?

From Pilot and Above The Law  
To appear or not to appear? That is the question (sorry, Hamlet). It’s the question troubling lawyers these days as they decide whether to go to court to argue a motion of one sort or another. The Italian American Bar Association here in Los Angeles recently had a Zoom presentation with both the presiding judge and assistant presiding judge of the Los Angeles Superior Court.

While neither of them would come right out and say so, my sense is that they would much prefer that [attorneys appear remotely](http://www.lacourt.org/newsmedia/uploads/142020641356371ExpandedRemoteAppearanceTechnology.pdf).

We all grew up as lawyers being told that appearing in person was critical. The court would see you; you would see the court and whether the judge was frowning, smiling, smirking, or eyes glazing over while you argued. If you decide to go to court these days, the only thing to be seen will be the eyes, as being masked in court is mandated, at least here in Los Angeles County. So, how much body language do you glean from eyes only? What if the court doesn’t make eye contact and is reading a file (not necessarily yours)? What’s the message?

We were also told that if we didn’t physically appear and just submit it on the pleadings filed in the case that showed we didn’t really care about the outcome (au contraire), and thus we forfeited our chance to make the compelling argument that wins the motion. How many times have we all heard “Counsel, do you have anything to add that is not in the papers?” Gulp.

Times sure have changed from those days. The angst that lawyers feel about what to do is perfectly understandable: what will the client think if you don’t appear in person? What will the court think? Will opposing counsel think that she has you on the ropes? Both the presiding judge and the assistant presiding judge made it clear that the number of times in which they changed their tentatives was negligible compared to the number of motions that they have heard on the bench. Do you pick up any clues here?

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
How about this clue? In its [most recent news release](http://www.lacourt.org/newsmedia/uploads/14202061213184920NRGeneralOrderOutliningPhasedReopeningwithGeneralOrder.pdf), the court said its “remote technology options promote social distancing by reducing the number of people appearing in person.”

Consider how high the stakes are in looking at [making the physical courtroom appearance](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/agonizing-over-low-stakes-decisions/): the ruling on the issue as it affects the case, your health, your client’s health, and the safety and well-being of the court and staff. High-stakes decision or low? Not an easy call.

# Lawyer Quits Job At Biglaw Firm To Publish Cubs Blog
## A law blog based on passion works, and too many lawyers are living proof. If you build, they will come.

I am always telling lawyers who are beginning to blog to follow their passion.

“If you had a magic wand and could wave it and ask for anything you wanted, what type of work would you want to do and what type of clients would you want to do that work for? Now make it happen through blogging.”

Ohio lawyer, [Brett Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bretttaylor3), took it to a new level.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
As [reported](http://herald-review.com/lawyer-quits-firm-to-run-cubs-blog/article_f903cb6a-28ab-5866-94fb-3fa7213ccded.html?utm_content=buffer8426c&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) by Chicago Tribune business columnist, Robert Reed ([@reedtribbiz](http://twitter.com/reedtribbiz)), Taylor quit his job at Jones Day in Columbus to blog full time about the Chicago Cubs.

That’s right. After working in the firm’s litigation group for four years, in 2011, Taylor ([@bleachernation](http://twitter.com/bleachernation)) left a secure, but unsatisfying, position to publish his [Bleacher Nation](http://www.bleachernation.com/) blog full time.

Taylor’s not unlike the lawyers I’ve met and worked with at LexBlog who decided to chase their dream through blogging. Though the men and women I know did stay in the law.

Taylor told Reed he saved a bit from practicing, they lived modestly, and that his wife, Gretchen, made it possible with a regular paycheck and health insurance.

Like me, Taylor became a Cubs fan by watching WGN on cable TV, as opposed to sitting in the bleachers at Wrigley field. He grew up in Ohio and went to Ohio State University for law school.

Taylor’s not a journalist nor doing regular reporting. He speaks to readers as a fan, adding a little legal assessment along the way.

It’s working. In addition to Bleacher Nation readers, he has 158,000 Facebook followers and 58,000 Twitter followers.

Taylor’s the real deal in engaging his followers. When I gave him a shout out on Twitter for the move he made during the Cubs’ game on Saturday, which we lost 7-2, he immediately responded.

Bleacher Nation’s not solely a labor of love.

While declining to give financial results, the site is increasingly running ads from retailers, travel firms, even a recent online advertisement for McCormick spices. Periodically, Taylor seeks to tap into his followers’ collective goodwill by imploring them not to block those ads and reduce the click count.

Taylor is not alone in following his dream today. [Harold Welsch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harold-welsch-3919b53), founder of [DePaul University’s Coleman Entrepreneurship Center](http://colemanent.org/), told Reed:

We find more people leaving professional jobs and giving it a try. Do what you love and you’ll never work a day in your life.

So many lawyers are struggling with the type of work they are doing. In Taylor’s case, the killer instinct clients wanted in litigation wasn’t for him. Some lawyers are struggling getting a job or work altogether.

A law blog based on passion works, and too many lawyers are living proof. If you build, they will come.

# Proskauer Files Lawsuit Against Fired Chief Operating Officer -- What You Need To Know
## He's accused of downloading a veritable treasure trove of internal firm documents.

The week between Christmas and New Years is notoriously slow — it’s only the most wild news… or urgent client deadlines, that break through the cocoon of bowl games, sugar cookies, and cozy pajamas. But this story is unlike anything I’ve seen in years of covering Biglaw, and is worth your brain space, even during this week.

On Tuesday, top 50 Biglaw firm Proskauer filed a lawsuit — pro se — in the Southern District of New York against Jonathan O’Brien, who held the position of Chief Operating Officer from 2017 until he was fired earlier this month, as [reported by ](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/12/28/proskauer-sues-coo-claiming-theft-of-trade-secrets/)Law.com. The complaint alleges O’Brien stole 34 gigabytes of internal data before announcing he was leaving the firm for a competitor. It’s alleged O’Brien made the downloads on two occasions, Dec. 5 and 16. The complaint characterizes the downloads as so “brazen and malicious that it rises to a criminal law violation.”

The firm’s forensic analysis indicates the sensitive data was downloaded to an external hard drive. As the complaint says, “Mr. O’Brien knew this information would be highly useful to Proskauer’s competitors, as it would enable them to effectively target and recruit Proskauer’s partners, practice groups and clients.”

And the complaint puts together the argument that O’Brien was pulling this data together to benefit his future employer.

In sworn statements filed in the case this week, Proskauer leaders said they discovered O’Brien’s alleged misconduct shortly after he informed them on Dec. 20 of his plans to depart on Jan. 6. Leaders said this revelation triggered a routine, 30-day report by the firm’s information security team to check for suspicious computer activity, revealing O’Brien had copied 115 files to a USB drive.

When questioned by the firm’s chair and managing partner, O’Brien reportedly refused to divulge the identity of his new employer, the complaint states. But on Dec. 21, O’Brien told chief professional resources officer Christopher Gardephe that firm leaders would be “mad” when they learned where he would be working next, according to a signed declaration by Gardephe.

Based on this, the complaint alleges,“It is a fair inference that Mr. O’Brien will join a competing law firm, or work as a consultant to law firms that compete with Proskauer.” “The huge, vital trove of proprietary information that Mr. O’Brien misappropriated would be highly useful to Proskauer’s competitors, which would make Mr. O’Brien more valuable—whether as an employee or a consultant.”

The data downloaded alleged includes client data, firm financials, strategic planning documents, compensation models, and proprietary software. And the partner compensation models are particularly proprietary, as the complaint notes, “The methods by which partners are compensated and the processes for doing so are highly confidential and would be of great value to a competitor.” It continues, “They also are deeply personal and the threat to disclose such information could be used to pressure, intimidate, and extort partners and the firm.”

The complaint also alleges O’Brien attempted to delete approximately 66 gigabytes of emails plus another 2,000 emails that were subject to a litigation hold. The attempted circumvention of the litigation hold allegedly occurred on December 5th, after O’Brien’s first download of internal documents.

The complaint seeks an ex parte temporary restraining order to preventing O’Brien from disseminating the internal documents he downloaded, an injunction requiring the return of the internal documents, and a temporary restraining order barring O’Brien from working with anyone who may be privy to the material he allegedly copied from the firm’s systems.

# Biglaw Firm Adjusts Bonus Policy To Hand Out Big Bucks -- But Only To Its Biggest Billers
## Want more bonus money at this firm? Better get to work!

Biglaw firms are celebrating spring by showing associates additional greenery — in cash, that is.

Which is the latest firm to put more money on the table for associates? That would be McGuireWoods, a firm that brought in $1,020,023,000 gross revenue in 2023, putting it at No. 52 in the latest Am Law 100.

Sources tell us that McGuireWoods recently issued a new bonus policy that’s “better” than in prior years. While the policy doesn’t kick in until next year, it looks like the firm is making sure that associates’ savings accounts will be pretty flush with bonus bucks… if they’re able to bill their behinds off.

These are the new McGuireWoods bonuses that are on the table:



Note that standard market bonuses range from $15,000 to $115,000 for first-year through seventh-year associates. The McGuireWoods bonus scale for 1950 hours doesn’t come close to meeting market, while its bonus scale for 2050 hours inches toward meeting market for first- through third-years (and actually comes over the top by $10K for third-years), but then dramatically slopes away. The real way to get a big bonus at the firm is to bill, bill, bill — MGW’s 2150-hour scale comes in over market for all class years.

Congratulations to all McGuireWoods associates who are able to meet the hours minimum required to get big bonuses at the firm next year!

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of compensation updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus/Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus/Matches”).

# Transactional Writing Tips For Lawyers
## PLI offers two courses of interest to those looking to refine their writing in transactional practice, including contract drafting.

No matter what your practice area is, mastering clear written communication is an essential skill. PLI offers two courses of interest to those looking to refine their writing in transactional practice, including contract drafting. 

The first is [Writing for Transactional Lawyers 2022](https://www.pli.edu/programs/writing-for-transactional-lawyers?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2), a half-day program that will teach attendees how to apply the principles of effective writing and drafting to transactional legal practice. The program will emphasize the perspectives of your intended audience, including clients and those who litigate and adjudicate commercial disputes.

Other topics to be covered include:

- How to apply clear drafting techniques, including the use of “Plain English”
- How to tailor your writing to suit different purposes and circumstances, including making words and numbers work, capturing all foreseeable future events, and addressing unforeseeable events
- What your clients want to see their counsel do differently
- Best practices for working with your litigation colleagues at the drafting stage to identify potential litigation issues, draft to achieve better outcomes, and reflect a changing legal landscape
- How to handle specific contract provisions
The program is ideal for any transactional attorney who wants to improve their writing and drafting skills. [Register](https://www.pli.edu/programs/writing-for-transactional-lawyers?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2) today.

Another PLI writing course focuses on contracts. The half-day program, [Fundamental Concepts in Drafting Contracts 2022](https://www.pli.edu/programs/select-concepts-in-drafting-contracts-analyzing-ambiguities-and-contract-boilerplate?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2), will highlight the fundamental—but often unconsidered—drafting principles that will assist both newly admitted and seasoned attorneys with drafting, analyzing, and interpreting contracts. 

Unlike many other contract-drafting courses that focus on the substance of particular provisions or contracts, this course focuses on the manner in which concepts are expressed in a contract, including:

- The importance of language in contracts
- The different categories of contract language (including language of accomplishment, covenants, discretionary language, representations and warranties, acknowledgments, and administrative language)
- The distinction between shall, will, and must
- What is conditional language
- The language of exception and subordination
- The concept of deemed
- References to time (and how to use them)
- Ambiguities associated with and and or
- Legal archaisms (and how to avoid them)
Solid contract-drafting skills are essential tools for any professional who deals with transactions or business relationships. Anyone looking to improve their writing and drafting skills and gain a better understanding of how concepts are and should be expressed in contracts will benefit from this program. [Register](https://www.pli.edu/programs/select-concepts-in-drafting-contracts-analyzing-ambiguities-and-contract-boilerplate?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2) today.

# The First African-American Am Law 200 Chairperson Was A Lot More Recent Than You Think
## The life and career of a Biglaw first.

Nobody looks at the persistently woeful numbers [when it comes to diversity amongst the partnership](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/law-firm-partnership-is-not-as-diverse-as-it-should-be/) and thinks that the first Black leader of a big firm dates back all that long. But if put on the spot, you’d probably guess it was more recent than it really was.

Even the first African-American chair of a Biglaw firm was a little surprised to learn he was the first.

Bloomberg Law News put together a bio on the life and career of [Quarles & Brady](https://www.quarles.com/) chair emeritus [John W. Daniels Jr](https://www.quarles.com/people/john-daniels), who led the firm from 2006 to 2015.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  

That’s halfway into the aughts. Of the 21st century.

Granted there are still overtly racist actors trying to block Black attorneys from building a portfolio of business as of [less than a year ago](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/coca-cola-shook-up-diversity-efforts-racist-shareholders-gushed-out/), so it’s not necessarily surprising. But I’d wager a lot of folks were as surprised as Daniels to learn that he was the first.

# Biglaw Firm Hit With $500 Million Malpractice Suit
## Did this Biglaw firm botch the statute of limitations?

This week, the Biglaw firm of Reed Smith was slapped with a $500 million malpractice lawsuit. The claim was filed by two defunct Bear Stearns investment feeder funds that Reed Smith represented in RMBS-related litigation. The lawsuit claims that the Biglaw firm failed to bring a case against the rating agencies —  Standard & Poors, Moody’s, and Fitch Ratings —  in a timely manner, resulting in those claims being dismissed.

“Reed Smith’s negligent failure to understand New York’s statute of limitations cost the Bear Stearns Funds what Reed Smith identified as a billion-dollar claim against various rating agencies,” the complaint said.

The liquidators of the feeder funds were represented by Reed Smith in a case against JPMorgan Chase (which acquired Bear Stearns), Deloitte & Touche, and individual investment managers at Bear Stearns alleging they were aware of the risks associates with the RMBS purchases. That case settled in 2013. Also in 2013, Reed Smith filed a lawsuit against the rating agencies on behalf of the feeder funds. Though the securities in question were purchased by a Bear Stearns master fund (not directly by the feeder funds) in 2006 and 2007, with the relevant statute of limitations being six years, Reed Smith argued the time to file suit should be extended under a “continuing harm” doctrine. That argument was ultimately unsuccessful, and the case was dismissed in 2015.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
As [reported](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2019/01/23/bear-stearns-funds-slap-reed-smith-with-500m-malpractice-claim/) by Law.com, the complaint alleges Reed Smith conducted an analysis of a potential claim against the rating agencies in 2011, before the SOL would have run, and never informed the client:

The feeder funds’ malpractice suit alleges that Reed Smith had conducted an early analysis of a possible rating agency suit in 2011—at a point when the relevant six-year statute of limitations would not yet have run out.

The analysis ultimately concluded that the feeder funds would have to purchase claims from the master funds in order to pursue litigation against the rating agencies, and noted questions about the statute of limitations. But Reed Smith failed to inform its feeder fund clients about that analysis until 2013. By that point, the complaint said, the rating agency case was “doomed” before it began.

In a statement by their attorney, Kevin Rosen of Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, Reed Smith denied any wrongdoing, saying the client instructed them not to pursue the case against the rating agencies until the settlement in the related case was approved:

“Reed Smith obtained an extraordinary litigation victory for these Cayman hedge funds in complex litigation against their investment managers. Now the hedge funds want even more, claiming Reed Smith should have concurrently sued others for the same damages,” Rosen said. “But the hedge funds couldn’t bring those claims at that time and told Reed Smith not to do so. Reed Smith always acted properly; the hedge fund claims are meritless and riddled with false allegations; and we look forward to establishing all of that in court.”

While a botched statute of limitations reads like textbook malpractice, there seems to be more here than meets the eye. It will be fascinating to follow the proceedings.

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://www.laterallink.com) team of expert contributors. [Michael Allen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelallen/) is the CEO of Lateral Link. He is based in the Los Angeles office and focuses exclusively on Partner and General Counsel placements for top firms and companies.

In the prior rolling 12 months, we have seen over 7,000 attorney GAINS at the major Am Law 100 firms and over 12,000 attorney LOSSES at the major Am Law 100 firms.  Some folks outside the legal industry may find this number hard to believe given how sticky attorneys appear in their jobs.

Here is a quick snapshot of the attorney gains made by the major Am Law 100 firms courtesy of Leopard Solutions (Laterals into Firms – September 8, 2016 to September 8, 2017).

Some of the reasons are obvious and expected, such as retiring, relocating, going in-house, or just getting out of the lawyer business altogether.  Given Lateral Link’s day-to-day routine of assisting attorneys to make lateral moves, I’d like to focus on the lateral attorney market.  Below are some general observations.

Net partner gain probably indicates accretive revenue growth (to the extent we are talking about equity partners).  Net associate gain is less indicative of firm health.  An interesting analogy with associate movement is similar to that of CBOE’s Volatility Index, known by its ticker symbol VIX, which according to Wikipedia is a popular measure of the implied volatility of S&P 500 index options.  We are oftentimes a bit more suspect of firms with a relatively higher lateral associate VIX, meaning high gains accompanied with high losses, i.e., a revolving door.  Although associates coming and going is common place, the degree of volatility affects the firm’s stability (less so in terms of profits because associates are grinding out the hours and not bringing in new business and more so in terms of culture).

In short, we can generally expect more and more partner-, associate-, and counsel-level lateral movement from firms with relatively higher lateral volatility.  That isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but is something that we analyze and try to understand when assisting our candidates to make informed decisions about their next job.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Biglaw Firm Gives Back To The Boys & Girls Club

In this episode, I welcome [Linda Benfield,](https://www.foley.com/en/people/b/benfield-linda-e) an environmental lawyer, and partner from Foley & Lardner LLP, to talk about how she became wanting to be a problem solver in law school to be on top of the profession. Linda also recalls the different programs created in partnership between Foley and the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, as well as how other organizations can help. Additionally, she shares how Biglaw firms can get their lawyers more engaged in helping and giving more opportunities to others.



The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!


Kathryn Rubino is a Senior Editor at Above the Law, host of [The Jabot podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/1XC11QhFCWxWr4NQrk2sEA), and co-host of [Thinking Like A Lawyer](https://legaltalknetwork.com/podcasts/thinking-like-a-lawyer/).

Not a huge surprise, but we always break out the Drudge siren for this.

If you were among the 40 percent of our readers who [predicted](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associates-billing-their-butts-off-until-biglaw-bonus-season-begins/?rf=1) that bonus news would drop this week and the 72 percent who predicted that bonus amounts would be the same as last year, pat yourselves on the back.

Biglaw’s compensation leader, [Cravath Swaine & Moore](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/cravath/), just announced its 2016 year-end bonuses — on a Monday afternoon, keeping with tradition. Here is the CSM bonus scale, which should look familiar to you:

Class of 2016 — $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2015 — $15,000
Class of 2014 — $25,000
Class of 2013 — $50,000
Class of 2012 — $65,000
Class of 2011 — $80,000
Class of 2010 — $90,000
Class of 2009 — $100,000
Class of 2008 — $100,000

Yes, this is the same bonus scheme we saw in [2015](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2015-associate-bonuses/) (from Cravath) and in [2014](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/associate-bonus-watch-davis-polk-beats-simpson/) (from Davis Polk). But there is, of course, one huge difference: back in June, Cravath [raised base salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) for its associates, a move that led dozens of firms around the country to hike associate pay.

Cravath announced the pay raise in June, and it took effect on July 1. So this year, an associate finishing her first full year at Cravath will earn around $185,000 in total compensation ($160,000 for the first half of the year, $180,000 for the second half of the year, and $15,000 in bonus money), up from $175,000 last year. At the top of the scale, an eighth-year associate will earn almost $400,000 in total compensation ($280,000 for the first half of the year, $315,000 for the second half of the year, and $100,000 in bonus money), up from $380,000. If these compensation levels hold for 2017, first-years will earn $195,000 and eighth-years will earn $415,000 for the full year.

We have posted Cravath’s complete 2016 bonus memo [on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2016-associate-bonuses/2/). As you’ll see, its language is very similar to the [2015 bonus memo](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2015-associate-bonuses/2/). Bonuses will be paid on Friday, December 16. The memo once again explains Cravath’s lockstep, non-hours-driven approach to bonuses: “The Firm does not apply any billable hour or similar criteria in determining eligibility for associate bonuses.” It also contains the usual fine print about pro-rated bonuses for part-time work and individualized bonuses for lawyers who aren’t standard partnership-track associates.

What to make of these bonuses? I agree with my colleague Staci Zaretsky, who last week [wrote](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associates-billing-their-butts-off-until-biglaw-bonus-season-begins/), “Be thankful that your salary is larger than it ever was before and that you’re receiving very generous bonuses on top of it.”

At Cravath and its peer firms, M&A work plays a major role in profitability. According to [Thomson Reuters](http://lipperalpha.financial.thomsonreuters.com/2016/10/global-ma-drops-in-3rd-quarter-companies-wary-of-overpaying/), for the first three quarters of 2016, worldwide M&A activity was down by 22 percent from the comparable period in 2015. Furthermore, per [Citi Private Bank](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/biglaw-strikes-back-the-rich-firms-get-richer-this-quarter/), demand for Biglaw work is stagnant, while expenses are growing (driven in part by the Great Associate Pay Raise of 2016).

Given these realities, and given the pay raises awarded earlier this year, firms would have been entirely justified in trimming bonuses (as some firms [threatened to do](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/firm-offers-raises-retroactive-to-july-1/) when announcing raises). But Cravath has not reduced bonuses, meaning that its peer firms won’t either. From the associate’s point of view, this strikes me as very good news indeed.

Is it possible that some rival firm might come along and beat the Cravath scale? It seems highly unlikely, but I won’t say impossible. Recall how Davis Polk [trumped the Simpson Thacher scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/associate-bonus-watch-davis-polk-beats-simpson/?rf=1) back in 2014, unleashing a slew of retroactive raises to Biglaw bonus scales. So stay tuned.

That’s our take on the Cravath bonuses. What do you think? Feel free to let us know how you feel [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)).

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. You can also text us if you prefer, at 646-820-8477. Thanks for your help.

If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

Happy bonus season!

UPDATE (3:04 p.m.): Early reactions from our Cravath sources are positive:

- “Pleased to see that the scale looks like last year’s (and they didn’t use the salary increase to justify slashing bonuses).”
- “Same as last year. Most people here expected this and are OK with it, considering the bump in comp this year.”
What do you think? Take our poll below.

UPDATE (3:29 p.m.): FWIW, we predicted these bonuses back in June, when we broke the news of [Cravath’s pay raise](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/). At the time we wrote, “What does this mean for bonuses? The memo says nothing about bonuses. We’re guessing that Cravath will at least keep bonuses the same as last year.”

UPDATE (5:45 p.m.): Less than three hours later, we have our [first two Cravath matches](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-the-first-cravath-matches/).

UPDATE (11/29/2016, 10:00 a.m.): Simpson Thacher, one of the firms that might have topped Cravath, just [matched](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/simpson-thacher-announces-bonuses/).

UPDATE (11/29/2016, 10:49 a.m.): I discussed the Cravath bonuses [with Casey Sullivan of Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/cravath-announces-bonuses-after-big-salary-jump/). And here’s additional coverage of the Cravath bonuses, from the [ABA Journal](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/bonus_season_begins_with_cravath_announcement), the [American Lawyer](http://www.americanlawyer.com/home/id=1202773320517/Cravath-Kicks-Off-Associate-Bonus-Season-Other-Firms-Follow?mcode=1202617075486&curindex=1&slreturn=20161029104445), the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/28/business/dealbook/cravath-bonuses-for-law-firm-associates-remain-unchanged.html?_r=0), and the [Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/cravath-law-firm-keeps-year-end-bonuses-unchanged-1480370476).

My reaction to the Cravath bonus announcement is:

- Very pleased
- Pleased
- Neither pleased nor displeased
- Displeased

# Even When They Try To Do Good, Jones Day Screws It Up
## Donald Trump's law firm of choice can't even get pro bono representation right.

Jones Day has come under a lot of well-deserved scrutiny during the Trump administration. They have become [the legal farm team](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/03/04/where-have-all-the-jones-day-trump-lawyers-gone/) for the Trump administration, and given the Trump administration’s actually embarrassing record in court, that is not a compliment. We all knew that some Biglaw firm would sacrifice its reputation for the racist, sexist, authoritarian President. However, if you had polled lawyers in 2015 and asked them “which one” Jones Day would have easily been in the top-three, which means their current role as Trump stooges has the added effect of being totally “on brand” for the firm.

A normal firm would look to mitigate its increasingly evil reputation by loudly promoting the [“good works”](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/doing-good-while-doing-law/) done by its lawyers. Jones Day somehow got the National Law Journal to put it on their [“pro bono hot list” for 2019](https://www.jonesday.com/en/news/2019/05/pro-bono-hot-list). Among other things, the publication touted the firm’s victory in an asylum case. That’s a little bit like lauding the arsonist for calling the fire department, but whatever.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Luckily this is Jones Day we’re talking about. Even when it tries to get good press, the firm’s true colors shine though. [From the ABA Journal](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/jones-day-sued-for-alleged-malpractice-by-pro-bono-clients-who-say-eviction-deal-left-them-homeless):

Two former mobile home owners have filed a malpractice suit against Jones Day that claims that the law firm’s work on their eviction case was a “fiasco.”

Zona Bernier and Gary Hill of Orange County, California, allege that Jones Day pressured them to accept a “burdensome settlement” without asserting legitimate defenses and then dropped them as clients a few weeks after the deal was signed. Bernier and Hill said they couldn’t navigate the deal themselves, and they became “permanently homeless” after being evicted.

Defendants are Jones Day and four attorneys.

Again, so on-brand for the firm. The allegation is that they forced a bad settlement, something that they could probably lodge as a quick pro-bono “win” for people who make hot lists, then dropped their clients who ended up actually homeless. The only way to make this more of a Jones Day representation would have been if it ignored an attempted rape allegation somewhere along the way.

On-campus recruiting starts soon and I’m sure some bright young law students will get offers from Jones Day and try to figure out if all the bad press they receive is justified. It is. Adjust your interview lottery requests accordingly.

# Willkie Farr Gets Into The Biglaw Bonus Season Groove With Announcement
## Don't be blasé about Biglaw bonuses -- there's a lot of money at stake!

It’s easy to become jaded during Biglaw bonus season. Yes, there are so many firms giving out huge bonuses, but Biglaw likes to play follow the leader. So, it tends to be the same numbers (which, were also the same scale as last year — and well, every year since 2014) over and over. But it represents a lot of hard work — and billable hours. And the industry-wide transparency created by sharing each bonus announcement (and any stipulations that accompany it) helps law students looking to start their careers in Biglaw and those that find themselves on the lateral market.

Now Willkie has announced year-end bonuses, and yes, because of course, they are matching the prevailing market rate. The bonus scale is as follows ([you can read the full memo on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/willkie-bonuses/2/)):

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Class of 2019: $15,000
Class of 2018: $25,000
Class of 2017: $50,000
Class of 2016: $65,000
Class of 2015: $80,000
Class of 2014: $90,000
Class of 2013+: $100,000

Year-end bonuses will be paid on December 18th.

Back in October, Willkie was [among the Biglaw firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-fall-special-bonus-tracker-which-biglaw-firms-are-handing-out-cash-for-associates-hard-work-during-the-pandemic/?rf=1) blowing off[ Cravath’s decision to wait](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/cravath-bonuses/) on special fall bonuses (though Cravath eventually made their associates whole) and they went ahead and[ handed out COVID appreciation bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/willkie-announces-fall-bonuses-blowing-off-cravath-followers/). Those special bonuses range from $7,500 to $40,000, depending on class year, and are in addition to the year-end bonus numbers. So yeah, Biglaw associates have a lot to be thankful for!

As always, we depend on you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

When looking back upon the year that was, associates at some firms will easily acknowledge that 2020 was one hell of a year. From salary cuts to furloughs to layoffs, they really saw it all, and when bonus time came, they perhaps had reason to worry about whether their firm would match the going market rate, and if their year-end haul would include special bonuses on top.

At Katten Muchin — an Am Law 100 firm whose COVID-19 austerity measures ran the full gamut, with [salary cuts ending](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/biglaw-firm-lays-off-attorneys-to-ensure-the-firms-continued-success/) just last month — associates were positively “thrilled” about their bonuses, which were announced just before Christmas.

Why’s that?

Not only did the firm match the market and hand out special bonuses, but even more money is being offered to associates with high billable hours. Big billers start raking in more cash at just 2100 hours. Depending on class year, those who billed 2100 hours or more will receive up to $6,000 more than market, while those who billed 2500 hours or more will receive up to $30,000 more than market. Plus, discretionary “superstar” bonuses will come into play in addition to all of the firm’s generous bonuses.

Check out the firm’s 2020 bonus scale, below:



Congratulations to everyone at Katten for finishing the year off strongly.

# Napping Can Make Lawyers More Productive
## Napping is a great way to give yourself a boost of energy and stay refreshed to better complete tasks during the day.

During the work-from-home revolution that took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, many attorneys changed the way they approach work as they dealt with the virtual environment that many lawyers and law firms operated within during the past few years. Numerous lawyers employed Zoom and other similar applications to collaborate with coworkers, and attorneys changed the pace of their work cycles due to the flexibility afforded by working from home. Many lawyers told me that while working from home, they were able to set time aside to take naps throughout the workday, and that such naps were helpful in keeping them productive and rested. Since many law firms are ordering lawyers back to the office as of late, numerous attorneys are unable to enjoy the naps that they took during workdays earlier in the pandemic. This is a shame since napping can help people be more productive, and employers should consider embracing napping more often to increase the productivity of employees.

I am a big fan of napping, and I come from a long line of nappers. My old man was big on naps, and sometimes, we would nap in our living room as a family on weekend days, usually while watching golf on TV. When I worked as a counselor at a day camp one summer in high school, I loved nap time, and I would usually doze off at the same time as the kids! Throughout college and law school, I made sure to take a nap pretty much every day, and even before the pandemic, I would take a nap most days I worked from home to recharge the batteries and make myself more able to attack my work tasks when I woke up.

I am not a sleep expert, but napping is a great way to give yourself a boost of energy and stay refreshed to better complete tasks during the day. There is a perception among some that napping is for lazy people and that people should be disciplined enough to avoid napping. It should be noted that this is a uniquely American notion, [and not all cultures look down upon napping](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/16/world/what-in-the-world/japan-inemuri-public-sleeping.html). In any event, it could just as easily be argued that napping shows discipline because a regimented lifestyle may include scheduling some time for a nap. In fact, the United States Army recently implemented a policy of “[strategic and aggressive napping](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/us/army-naps.html)” presumably because military leaders understand all of the benefits that napping can have on keeping soldiers rested and ready for action.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Napping is easy enough to do while working from home, as many attorneys can attest to from firsthand experience. It is usually relatively simple for lawyers to pick a time of day to nap when they expect not to be bothered for a while from calls and emails. Even if an attorney is called or emailed while they are taking a nap, a 30-minute delay in returning calls and emails is rarely an issue. Since lawyers are assessed more on the hours they bill more than any other metric, lawyers can make up any time so that they meet a firm’s expectations around billing even if they do nap. Although everyone may need different amounts of sleep during a nap, the 30 minutes or so most people need to sleep while napping shouldn’t be too disruptive to a firm.

Of course, napping in an office is a completely different ballgame, although characters like [George Costanza have tried to nap at work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W__qCFWi1KA) to hilarious effect! If I am being completely honest, I have napped in an office on a few occasions at two different law firms at the beginning of my career. Both times were when I was tired either from traveling or something I did the night before, and at both firms, I had a private office that made napping a pretty easy thing to get away with. Since people do not have comfortable setups at work to take naps, and employees may be under scrutiny from bosses who may not believe that napping is appropriate during the workday, it might be more difficult for people to get away with napping at an office.

Management might consider being more open to napping in an office. So long as attorneys meet their billable hour requirements, why should management care what attorneys do while they are in an office? Of course, sometimes lawyers need to be on call about matters, but attorneys are good at knowing when they need to be ready to accept work and can decide whether they have the liberty to take a nap at a given time.

All told, it is unfortunate that napping is not a more acceptable practice in the American workplace, since napping clearly has a number of benefits. Employees may be more productive from napping, and employers should do more to encourage napping if it helps attorneys and staff be more efficient at completing their tasks.

# Biglaw Firms Take Their Summer Associate Programs Online For Second Year In A Row
## Will the summer associate experience of being wined and dined ever make a comeback?

Hey, law students, did you think you were going to be able to attend your Biglaw summer associate program in person thanks to the rise of vaccination protocols across the country? Think again.

Many large law firms have finally made decisions on what their summer programs will look like, and the trend seems to be leaning toward virtual programs for the second year in a row thanks to COVID-19. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2021/03/15/big-firms-prepare-for-another-year-of-virtual-summer-programs/) has the details on which firms have made their plans known:

Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, Goodwin Procter and Ropes & Gray will have completely virtual programs, with the first two opting for a full 10-week summer associate schedule.

Summer programs at Latham & Watkins; Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer; Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher; Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton; and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati will be virtual and full-length as well, though the firms have said that there may be in-person events toward the end of the program.

If you recall, last summer, Biglaw firms cut their programs to just six weeks in length (with some cutting salaries as well). Because of the success of the prior virtual summer program, most firms will be going the full 10 weeks in 2021.

Has your firm announced plans for its 2021 summer associate class yet? Please text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Summer%202021) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Summer 2021”) us with any details you have. We’ll keep a tally on what Biglaw firms have in store for their summers when we have enough information.

# Am Law 100 Firm Jumps Into Fall 2021 Special Bonus War -- This Time With A Scale To Match!
## Special bonuses of up to $40K? We'll take it! Will your firm consider matching?

With bonus season around the corner, Biglaw associates are now watching and waiting to see if their firms will be doling out special bonuses. While more than 55% of respondents to our [annual bonus survey](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/biglaw-associates-expecting-bigger-better-bonuses-after-wild-year-of-billables/) reported that they did not believe any additional special bonuses would be offered, that’s exactly what seems to be happening now. It’s just a matter of which firms will offer up extra cash to their attorneys, and on what terms.

Paul Weiss started the trend last week, offering [discretionary special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/paul-weiss-special-bonus-discretional/) to certain associates and counsel who “exhibited exceptional commitment” to the firm during the first half of 2021, with a second bonus of the same type to come in early 2022 for the second half of 2021. The next firm to board the special bonus train is Mintz, and this time, we’ve got an actual scale as well as an hourly requirement. (For the executive committee members who are reading, this seems like it could be a great example to work off of if your firm is considering offering special bonuses.)

Mintz — a firm that brought in $502,100,000 gross revenue in 2020, ranking it at No. 79 in the most recent Am Law 100 — made its special bonus announcement right after Paul Weiss’s bonus news spread like wildfire (but completely independent of Paul Weiss, of course). Here’s what Mintz is offering:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  


That’s not a bad haul! In fact, this is reminiscent of the [Willkie special bonus scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/willkie-spring-bonuses-2021/) (before the firm was one-upped by [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/)) in that it tops out at $40,000, but the Mintz scale is much more generous for junior associates.

As noted by the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2021/10/29/more-bonuses-in-store-for-big-laws-top-performers-after-paul-weiss-move/), the firm will also be offering special bonuses to special counsel, practice group associates, patent agents, and technical advisors, but their bonuses will be discretionary, “informed by seniority, quality of work, and billable hours” as of Februrary 28, 2022.

Not to worry, Mintzers, because according to managing partner [Robert Bodian](https://www.mintz.com/our-people/robert-i-bodian), these special bonuses are “solely additive and will not be considered part of, or credited against, any other bonus.” Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

Another day, another ranking for lawyers to ogle in a search for meaning as they attempt to get through the day’s billables in this summer of layoffs we’re living in. Despite all the economic uncertainty that’s been plaguing the profession, this is still the life of a Biglaw attorney, always on the hunt for confirmation that their firm is the best firm, the one that’s hitting all of its essential metrics year after year. If that sounds like you (and you might as well admit it, it probably does), then you should check out the latest offering from the American Lawyer, the annual A-List ranking.

Are you unfamiliar with this ranking? Here are all of the metrics that it measures to determine which Biglaw firms are the best of the best:

The A-List recognizes firms based on a combination of factors, both financial and cultural: revenue per lawyer, pro bono commitment, associate satisfaction, racial diversity and gender diversity (the percentage of equity partners who are women), with RPL and pro bono given double weight. Each metric measures Am Law 200 firms’ relative performance—a firm’s score in a given category is based on its ranking among all 200 firms. Each category, as well as the overall score, is based on a 100-point scale.

# Women In Law Are Driving An Entirely New Practice Model
## The traditional path for women in the legal profession remains riddled with inequities. Entrepreneurial attorneys like Heather Cantua, Amy Duvanich, and Jamie Wells are driving an entirely new way to practice -- exercising greater autonomy over how they work, finding more compensation and more time for their passions, ultimately achieving their own meaning of success.

Heather Cantua, Amy Duvanich, and Jamie Wells.

Imagine: You wake up on a regular weekday, and rather than already feeling behind, you feel positive, even excited about the day ahead of you. Your first order of business is to do something you love – whether that’s walking your kids to school and taking a moment to greet the other parents, engaging in the exercise or meditation routine that makes you feel like your best self without rushing through it, or taking your dog on a favorite nearby hike. Following a wonderful start to your day, you look forward to your work, because you have full autonomy over what that work is and how much of it you do. On top of that, you feel valued and supported by your colleagues.

Where oh where, you ask, might you find this mythical workplace environment that offers flexibility, agency, and genuinely encourages your success? Surely not in law, you guess, knowing all too well based on experience that law firm and in-house counsel life are a grind that eventually spits you out, particularly for women. Perhaps your experience is confirmed by the [Law360 2022 Glass Ceiling Report](https://www.law360.com/articles/1518090) on women in law which reports that major firms have made almost no progress on bringing women into the top leadership and partner levels. Or perhaps, you’re one of the scores of in-house lawyers who, despite working tirelessly and especially during the pandemic, was recently [laid off](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/16/tech-industry-layoffs/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKV1sk44J6Da5eQO8ZfjzZIw9_nBm0GP95AUHX5-c_zF_dTbxNVNM--2BdvgZ--ZfAe-lJTsp_mLOR0g9n5TtzkFQlGR-JTL81HDa7YAjXtc9my4lX48m7UWLhVRzD5vIlSvoC9ulf86yg2eUhUgeDvsaR_pJDTD-Bh2mOSZ6bW9), or might be in the near future.

Indeed, the landscape for women lawyers on traditional paths – Biglaw, and in-house jobs in particular – remains riddled with inequities. We start our law careers thinking that we’re on equal footing with our male counterparts. After all, women make up at least 50% of law school graduates, as they have for a generation, and comprise around 50% of the associates at major firms, according to the Law360 Report. But over the years, those numbers dwindle. Across the board in Biglaw, women make up roughly 20% of equity partners and 30% of non-equity partners. [2020 Survey Report on the Promotion and Retention of Women In Law Firms](https://www.nawl.org/p/cm/ld/fid=2019), published by the National Association of Women Lawyers (NAWL). In 2020, women held only a small percentage of law firm leadership jobs: They were 12% of managing partners, 28% of governance committee members, and 27% of practice group leaders, according to NAWL.

The in-house numbers aren’t much better. Across the country, the number of women in top legal positions (particularly CLO/GC) is roughly 30%, according to the [2020 Inclusion Index Survey Report](https://www.mcca.com/resources/reports/2020-inclusion-index-survey-report/) published by The Minority Corporate Counsel Association.

Law firm pay also tracks inequities among men and women. The ABA published disheartening statistics in 2022 about [Women in the Legal Profession](https://www.abalegalprofile.com/women.php#anchor4), noting that “[l]aw firm pay for women almost caught up to pay for men among associates and non-equity partners in 2020, but a sizable gap still existed at the highest levels. In 2020, female associates and female non-equity partners received, on average, 95% of the compensation of their male counterparts. But among equity partners, women received just 78% of the compensation of men, on average. There were virtually no women among the very highest-compensated law firm attorneys in 2020. Only 2% of law firms said their highest-paid attorney is female – and that number actually dropped from 8% in 2005.”

Perhaps most telling about the prospects of advancement for women in Biglaw is that male and female lawyers “strongly disagree on how well their law firms foster long-term careers for women.” That was one conclusion from a [2019 study](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/women/walkoutdoor_online_042320.pdf) published by the ABA and ALM Intelligence, which explored why experienced female lawyers are leaving law firms. The report includes results from a survey of more than 1,200 senior lawyers at the nation’s largest law firms. The survey showed that men generally thought their law firms treated women fairly, but women disagreed. For example, the vast majority of men (88%) said gender diversity is widely acknowledged as a firm priority, but barely half of women (54%) agreed. Also, nearly 3 out of 4 men (74%) said their law firms successfully retained experienced women but again, less than half of women (47%) agreed. As to why experienced female lawyers leave their firms, the women surveyed ranked caretaking commitments as the No. 1 reason (58%), followed by stress at work (54%) and emphasis on marketing or originating business (51%).

Some women have chosen to build a solo or boutique practice. That path can be rewarding insofar as it sidesteps glass ceilings, office politics, pay inequity, and other ills found in Biglaw and in-house legal jobs. But solo or boutique practices have their perils too. For one thing, they tend to be riddled with administrative work which falls to the lawyers (particularly the female ones) and eats time that would otherwise be spent on client work or free time. And as a solo, unless you have been good about building and maintaining a network of lawyers with whom you can collaborate, it can often feel lonely and lacking in oft-needed support.

Before you throw in the towel on your law degree or settle for another law job that undervalues and fails to serve you, think about this: There is an emerging model that enables women to build a practice that is more fulfilling, reflecting their own personal definition of success, rather than one that has been dictated by someone else, and enjoy the support of like-minded colleagues. The model found widespread adoption in the pandemic, which fundamentally changed workplace norms around daily attendance on a proscribed schedule in a physical office. Unlike Biglaw and many in-house legal departments which are ratcheting up the pressure to return to the office, distributed law firms like [Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c) have, instead, embraced these changes. This model – which doubles down on flexibility and encourages lawyers to structure their day in a way that makes sense for them – has a profound effect on the viability of sustaining a law practice over the long term, especially for women.

Heather Cantua, Deputy Managing Partner at Scale LLP.

“Scale is attractive to female attorneys because: (1) our lean structure passes a greater portion of fees through to attorneys, allowing the flexibility and work-life balance that’s structurally impossible at big law firms; and (2) we’re focused on building a culture of collegiality that’s supported by aligned financial incentives for us to collaborate,” says Heather Cantua, Deputy Managing Partner at Scale. “On my recruiting calls with female partners, it gives me pride to be able to answer all their questions authentically and with real solutions to their problems. The proof is in the numbers: Scale is 53% female partners,” she adds.

Cantua is a consumer finance attorney who began her career in Biglaw, and later went in-house in the fintech sector. She joined Scale in 2019 and hasn’t looked back: “Scale is different because I value my own time. I set my own rates. I decide which clients to work for and what work to take. I now don’t need to wait for someone else to give me a path. I create my own path. One of the best compliments is when I see former colleagues and friends and they comment on how I seem much happier now,” says Cantua. For her, Scale’s ethos and strategic vision has made all the difference. “I hope that other attorneys who want to challenge the assumptions of the entire legal industry can find a home. The past couple of years have taught me that the pace of change is not slowing down. And so now I’m trying to learn how to ride those waves of change and have a career that accommodates my life instead of a life that has to accommodate a career. Now, when I want to go hard at work, I can. And when I need to take a break, I can because I have control,” says Cantua.

Amy Duvanich, Counsel at Scale LLP.

In-house female attorneys have also found a home at Scale. Before joining Scale, Amy Duvanich was the rare breed of lawyer who went to work in-house shortly after graduating from law school, working for companies in industries ranging from education, retail, real estate, and software. Duvanich reached an “aha” moment, realizing she could combine her talents and passions and best serve clients by becoming a fractional general counsel to start-up companies, and then realized that the Scale model was a terrific fit for her vision. “The services and rates we are able to provide due to the structural differences between Scale and traditional law firms really benefits startups and small businesses,” says Duvanich. For Duvanich, the prospect of getting to bring value to multiple rather than just one organization was especially attractive, as is the fact that she has control over what work she chooses to do.

Duvanich also appreciates the fact that a large number of Scale’s attorneys have an in-house background. “Attorneys with significant experience in-house are well situated to provide practical and efficient guidance shoulder to shoulder with our business partners. Efficient guidance is important to all clients, but it is especially important to startups. I am able to handle most of what my clients need, and I have colleagues that are able to fill in any gaps,” says Duvanich.

Jamie Wells, Partner at Scale LLP.

Jamie Wells is a litigator hailing from Biglaw who joined Scale right in the middle of the pandemic. Her transition to Scale from a large law firm was “seamless and my days now feel like my days used to feel, with the exception that I have a lot more ease and time, and that allows me to actually be better at providing service to clients, building teams, networking, and expanding my own business.” For Wells, working in a team is critically important, and she has found that at Scale, in spades. “Culturally it’s a great fit because everybody is remote, so it’s very easy to actually connect in a way that I wasn’t expecting,” says Wells.

When Wells first started at Scale, she was constantly approached by other Scale attorneys with the question “What can we work on together? And that was so important to me because I like working on teams, I like building teams, I like sharing work, sharing credit. And across the board, everybody at Scale shares that mentality.” Wells recommends Scale for “somebody that is hungry, wants to take their career into their hands and do what they think is right for them.” As to her own decision to join Scale, Wells says “I’ve completely bet on myself and succeeded.”

Women in law like Heather Cantua, Amy Duvanich, and Jamie Wells are now driving an entirely new way to practice law. They are actively building successful practices at [Scale](https://bit.ly/3wu6flz) on their own terms: promoting themselves and building a stronger book of business; exercising autonomy to choose the “who / what / where / when” over their work; achieving self-defined meaning and purpose in their practices; and keeping more of the things they love while shedding the things they want to leave behind.

# Judge Shot In Her Driveway, Retaliation Suspected
## Was this judge shot in retaliation for a case before her?

As mentioned in [Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/morning-docket-11-09-15/) earlier today, Texas State District Judge Julie Kocurek was shot in her driveway on Friday night. As the details of the incident become clear, the reports paint a terrifying picture. Judge Kocurek was returning home after 10 p.m. on Friday and was in the company of others when she was shot in her driveway. No one else was injured.

Kocurek was rushed to the hospital, where her condition was initially listed as critical, before being upgraded to stable.

The Statesman is reporting that some suspect the violence is every judge’s worst nightmare — retaliation for a case before them:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Police haven’t released specific details about the shooting or Kocurek’s injuries, but law enforcement officials told the Statesman that Kocurek was likely targeted in retaliation for a case.

One wonders how long it will take before this “ripped from the headlines” incident becomes fodder for television.

The incident has shaken the legal community in Austin, where lawyers and judges have rallied around their colleague:

“She is a very strong judge,” said prosecutor Gary Cobb, the only declared candidate in next year’s race for Travis County district attorney. “She is very knowledgeable about the law, and more importantly is very fair in her treatment of everyone who comes in front of her.”

“If this was going to happen to anybody, it wouldn’t happen to her,” said retired Judge Bob Perkins. “This is totally illogical.”

# Good News For Associates As Goodwin Matches Salary Hike
## The train keeps rolling.

The Milbank salary increase — which is more accurately “the latest Milbank salary increase” because Milbank’s always the vanguard on associate compensation — continues to ripple through the ranks of Biglaw.

Now it’s Goodwin, which just announced a full match of what’s becoming the new normal for Biglaw salaries. As a refresher, here’s what Goodwin associates are now looking at:

Class	New Salary
Class of 2021	$215K
Class of 2020	$225K
Class of 2019	$250K
Class of 2018	$285K
Class of 2017	$325K
Class of 2016	$350K
Class of 2015	$370K
Class of 2014+	$385K
January pay will reflect the old scale, but February will see a retroactive bump to this new scale.

Bonuses, [announced back in December](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/the-good-times-roll-at-this-firm/), will hit direct deposit on January 25.

Congratulations, folks!

# The End May Be Near As Stroock Loses More Than Half Its Partners To Hogan Lovells
## The future does not seem bright for this firm.

Late last week, Pillsbury Winthrop [ended](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/yet-another-firm-ends-merger-talks-with-stroock/) its non-exclusive merger talks with Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, yet another law firm that seemed uneasy when it came to the “financial and other risks involved” with a Stroock combination. At the time, Stroock seemed to indicate that it had “options” — but unfortunately, it looks like those options may now include a possible closure, all thanks to the Hogan Lovells.

Late on Friday, Hogan Lovells revealed that it would be hiring 30+ partners away from Stroock in a mass lateral move, including the firm’s real estate team as well as its co-managing partner, Jeff Keitelman. More than half of Stroock’s partners are now headed to Hogan Lovells, which paints a rather bleak picture for Stroock. As noted by CEO Miguel Zaldivar, it was nothing personal. “We are on a mission to grow in the U.S., and this is an outstanding opportunity to deliver on our strategy to invest in premium practices and expand our client relationships,” he offered in a statement. “This is about growth in New York with a premiere team.”

The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/10/27/over-30-stroock-partners-to-join-hogan-lovells-as-ny-firms-prospects-appear-bleak/) has insights on what may be Stroock’s dismal future:

What comes next for Stroock after losing roughly half of its partnership in a single lateral departure is not known, but given its financial difficulties, lateral departures and inability to find a suitable combination, the prospects are bleak.

Stroock’s partnership currently numbers about 46 partners, according to its website on Friday. It’s unclear how many would be left after more than 30 partners leave for Hogan Lovells.

“It is sad when this happens to a firm,” Kent Zimmermann, a strategic consultant at Zeughauser Group who specializes in mergers, told Am Law. “But, there is an opportunity for other firms to benefit greatly from picking up high-quality teams. But I feel for the staff and others in a bad position.”

Stroock was founded almost 150 years ago. It would be a real shame if things were to end so disappointingly for the firm.

According to Law.com’s [2020 Midlevel Satisfaction Survey](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/where-in-biglaw-are-midlevel-associates-the-happiest-2020/), what percentage of midlevels say they’re on track for partnership?

Hint: Only 11.4 percent of respondents have a much more statistically realistic perspective and say they are not on track to make partner.

But one thing is for certain — you’ve gotta show up. You’d think that a big-time firm like Reed Smith would know that and pass the word along to the relevant parties. Thankfully, this judge’s court order should set things right. From the ABA Journal:

A Delaware judge has ordered Reed Smith to station two lawyers at the courthouse Tuesday with “Please See Me” signs, after the law firm failed to provide notice of a hearing, causing it to be rescheduled.

Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster said the lawyers should be available to answer questions for shareholders of the ODP Corp., formerly Office Depot Inc., who show up at the courthouse expecting to attend the now-rescheduled settlement hearing, [Law360](https://www.law360.com/legalethics/articles/1593008) reports… Laster said one lawyer should stand in the courthouse lobby and another by elevators on the 12th floor, where chancery courtrooms are located. The lobby sign should be printed in a large, readable font with the message: “Settlement Hearing for ODP Corporation: Please See Me.” The other sign should contain a similar message.

Some might see this as an embarrassing consequence of an internal communication gone awry, but this could be so much more. Imagine seeing this on the courthouse lobby:

Recently, Above the Law launched [On The Job](https://abovethelaw.com/on-the-job/), our new site focused on labor and employment law. On the Job is anchored by three new columnists — [Richard B. Cohen](https://abovethelaw.com/author/richardcohen/), [Evan Gibbs](https://abovethelaw.com/author/evangibbs/), and [Beth Robinson](https://abovethelaw.com/author/bethrobinson/) — all of whom are experienced employment lawyers. In addition to their expert commentary on substantive developments in labor and employment law, On The Job will also offer research, rankings, and other [features](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/should-you-be-a-labor-employment-lawyer-what-kind-let-us-help-you/) focusing on the practice area. Today we are presenting a new feature: a [round-up ](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/insider-survey-labor-employment-attorney-rankings)of findings from (primarily) the [ATL Insider Survey](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_7U5tOUuQwTAfSxS), with a focus on labor and employment law.

The [Insider Survey](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_7U5tOUuQwTAfSxS) provides an outlet for law students and lawyers to share insight and opinions regarding their schools and employers. To date, more than 22,000 respondents have taken the Insider Survey, including hundreds of labor and employment attorneys. When we compare L&E associates with law firm associates generally, one trend leaps out: we find that L&E associates rate their satisfaction significantly lower than their peers for every category we measure. Perhaps it’s not surprising that employment specialists are the most critical of their own employers? In a more upbeat finding, we also see that L&E departments are outperforming law firms generally when it comes to gender diversity in their ranks.

The [On The Job rankings round-up](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/insider-survey-labor-employment-attorney-rankings/) reveals which firms are rated the highest by their own attorneys on a range of “quality of life” subjects, including satisfaction with compensation, hours, firm morale, professional development, and firm culture. Finally, it shows the peer firms and practice groups that L&E practitioners consider to be under- and overrated.

# Top 25 Biglaw Firm Shares The Wealth With All U.S. Associates, Ignores Counsel
## Plus some offices are getting raises.

There’s good news — at least for some attorneys — at King & Spalding.

The firm, ranked 21st on the Am Law 100 with $1,338,607,000 in 2019 gross revenue, announced special bonuses for associates yesterday. As one would expect from a firm with over a billion dollars in gross revenue, they’ve matched the market standard for associates, set by Davis Polk.

And there’s more good news for associates in the memo, especially those in smaller market offices. The firm also announced that they are moving to a unified compensation and bonus structure for all U.S. associates, so those offices that were not previously on the $190,000 scale will see raises.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Special bonuses will be paid according to the following schedule:



To be eligible, associates must bill 1,950 hours annualized, with an opportunity for catch-up payments if they hit their hours later in the year. Full memo available[ on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/ks-special-bonuses/2/).

Noticeably absent from the memo is the fate of counsel bonuses. And according to tipsters at the firm, folks that fall in that category are PISSED. It’s understandably frustrating to be busting your butt during the pandemic and then ignored when it’s time for appreciation bonuses.

This isn’t the first time that counsel have been [left out in the cold when it comes to bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/remember-your-firms-special-counsel-this-time-of-year/). And we know that in Biglaw, even the nod of “counsel will get individualized bonuses,” often leaves counsel taking home less money than the associates they supervise.

Of course, as other insiders at K&S note, counsel may yet still get paid. There’s some past precedent that counsel will get their payment with the year-end bonuses. But as long as the firm lets counsel twist in the wind, wondering whether their hours matter to the firm as much as more junior attorneys’, the kind of resentment that feeds the lateral market will build.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Lawyerly Lairs: Biglaw Name Partner Lists Longtime Home -- For $4 Million

The elegant exterior of 850 Park Avenue — please ignore the annoying traffic barricades (via Google Street View).

Associates at Schulte Roth & Zabel who bill big hours [fare well](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/biglaw-firm-wows-with-market-bonuses-and-up-to-40k-extra-for-high-billers/). Partners at the Am Law 100 firm, known for its expertise in hedge funds, [do even better](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/03/15/record-profits-revenue-for-schulte-roth-in-2017/).

And [William Zabel](https://www.srz.com/lawyers/william-d-zabel.html), founding and name partner at SRZ, presumably does the best of all. So it should come as no surprise that he and his wife live in a luxurious, multimillion-dollar Manhattan co-op — which they just put on the market, for a shade over [$4 million](https://www.bhsusa.com/manhattan/upper-east-side/850-park-avenue-8c/coop/19378593).

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Here’s the news, as reported by [The Real Deal](https://therealdeal.com/2019/01/21/madoff-settlement-lawyer-lists-longtime-ues-co-op/):

Bow-tied super lawyer William Zabel is looking to upsize.

The attorney who was behind the massive Bernie Madoff settlement is leaving the Park Avenue apartment where he has lived with his wife for 38 years. The 850 Park Avenue unit is listed for [$4.2 million](https://www.bhsusa.com/manhattan/upper-east-side/850-park-avenue-8c/coop/19378593).

If you’ll allow me to quibble, it would be more precise to describe Bill Zabel as the lawyer behind the [Jeffry Picower settlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffry_Picower). There were many, many settlements of Madoff-related matters, which have kept Madoff trustee [Irving Picard](https://www.bakerlaw.com/IrvingHPicard) and his BakerHostetler colleagues busy for several years. Zabel’s client, Jeffry Picower, happened to be the biggest beneficiary from the Madoff scam — and the Picower estate settled the claims against it for a whopping $7.2 billion. (Picower himself died in 2009, apparently after experiencing a massive heart attack while swimming at his Palm Beach estate.)

That’s a bit depressing, isn’t it? Let’s move on to a happier subject: Bill Zabel’s remarkable legal career. The Princeton and Harvard Law School graduate has long been a leading light in the world of trusts and estates — but he’s most proud of his pro bono work, and justifiably so. From his [SRZ bio](https://www.srz.com/lawyers/william-d-zabel.html):

For more than 50 years, Bill has been an advocate for social justice in the United States and abroad. His civic and philanthropic activities have included, among many others, authoring the amicus brief on behalf of the ACLU in Loving v. Virginia, investigating the cases of those who disappeared in Chile during General Augusto Pinochet’s “Dirty War,” serving as chair of Human Rights First, chair of Immigrant Justice Corps, trustee or director of New York University, The New School, Mailman School of Public Health, The JPB Foundation (vice chairman), The Lymphoma Foundation, chair of the Princeton University Planned Giving Committee, Sakharov Archives, Lincoln Center Theater and The Academy of American Poets.

His involvement in the Loving case — which returned to prominence in the past few years, thanks to the Supreme Court’s 2015 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, followed a year later by the critically acclaimed [Loving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_(2016_film)) film — is a highlight. As Zabel told the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/85badca6-c8d8-11e4-b43b-00144feab7de):

[H]is proudest civil rights achievement was Loving v. Virginia. Years later, after a speech he made when accepting the Robert F Kennedy Prize for advancing racial and social justice, three women of mixed race approached him. “They said they wanted to thank me because they wouldn’t be alive today if their parents couldn’t have married,” he says. “That was priceless.”

Bill and Deborah Zabel’s apartment, though, does have a price: $4.2 million. It also comes with a sizable monthly maintenance bill — $5,653, bigger than most people’s mortgages — and because the building allows for no more than 30 percent financing, the buyer will have to put down almost $3 million, assuming it goes for list price (which isn’t guaranteed, given the [challenging market for high-end homes](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-yorks-wealthiest-cut-losses-as-manhattan-real-estate-falters-1543508960)). In exchange for all that, the new owner will enjoy three bedrooms (one of them currently used as a library), two-and-a-half bathrooms, and a tony Park Avenue address.

Let’s take a look around, shall we?

# First Monday Musings By Dean Vik Amar: Evaluating Legal Education's Vital Signs At The End Of The Academic Year

A lot of assessments are taking place this time of year. Analyses of the First 100 Days of the Trump Administration are among the most prominent examples, but each law school also uses this season take stock of the academic year. So in my space today I’d like to offer a few big-picture thoughts on the state of legal education generally these days, highlighting the (relatively) good, the (pretty) bad, and the (downright) ugly.

First, the (relatively) good: the employment picture. America’s ABA-accredited law schools just finished the process of collecting, submitting, and posting their job-outcome data for the Class of 2016 (the one that graduated last summer), and while the ABA has not yet compiled and publicly presented aggregate statistics for easy comprehensive analysis, my own review of the few dozen or so schools that I keep close track of suggests that – at least for schools considered in the top quartile of the nation’s 200 or so law schools – the overall percentage of recent graduates who were employed in full-time, long-term, non-university-funded law jobs (that is, jobs that either require a license or for which a JD is preferred) moved up a few percentage points this year. (I know that the creators of [Above the Law’s law school rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/2016-law-school-rankings/) – which are generally published in late May – have for plausible reasons decided to [exclude “JD preferred jobs”](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/06/atl-vs-law-dean-vs-common-sense/) and instead look at bar-license-required jobs only, but I lump both categories together for today’s purposes.) A big part of the reason for the progress at many schools this year may be that the size of graduating classes has shrunk, so that even if the number of new hires out there is staying roughly the same (or even shrinking a tad), the percentage of new graduates who are employed has increased. But there are also schools (and I know this because we are one of them) that saw the absolute number of graduates employed increase quite significantly in the Class of 2016 compared to the Class of 2015.

A related point is that Biglaw hiring seems to be holding its own; the percentage of recent graduates employed at firms with 100 or more lawyers seemed to go up this year at several law schools I looked at, even if only by small amounts. At Illinois, we saw the percentage of law grads from the Class of 2016 employed at firms of 100 or more lawyers move up significantly to about 34%, which is higher than it’s been in at least six years. And, again, while our numbers may not be representative of other types of schools that feed different markets, our experience is consistent with the finding that the National Association for Law Placement (NALP) made for the previous year (the Class of 2015) that the only sector in which the absolute number of new jobs increased from the previous year was very large law firms.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Once more, it’s important to note that the two trends I just observed are certainly not true for all law schools – and indeed many schools whose employment rates have been under the most severe stress in recent years probably experienced much more uneven progress or even further slippage in the Class of 2016 – but I feel pretty comfortable in saying that the employment landscape is generally somewhat more favorable than it was just two years ago.

Let’s move from the (relatively) good to the (pretty) bad: aggregate application volume. Even though the number of LSAT takers in the 2015-2016 cycle edged up (for the first time in several years), that increase hasn’t yet translated into an increase in the number of people applying to law school this year. In fact, as of April 21, 2017, the number of applicants to American law schools is off about half a percent from the April 2016 number (which itself was up just a bit from the previous year). Given the steep slide in application volume over the past half dozen years, perhaps flatness over the past two years is progress. But I must say I think today is an historically great time to apply to law school — if you are interested in law and competitive for the stronger institutions. It’s easier to get into a great law school than it has been in many decades – every school, even Yale, is taking some folks it wouldn’t have accepted five years ago — the financial aid packages are very attractive, and, given class size reduction and gradual improvement in some sectors of the marketplace, the number of aggregate jobs and recent grads are coming into good alignment (especially for graduates of the stronger schools). Given these factors, and the increased awareness among many young folks of the importance of the powers and limits of government, a number of analysts expect meaningful increases in application volume in the coming years. But for now, still pretty bad.

Now for the truly ugly: bar pass rates. As writers for this website have admirably reported, bar passage rates in many states and at many law schools have been abysmal over the past few years. There was a lot of press recently about the [likely closure of Whittier Law School](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/whittier-law-school-will-close-leaving-disaster-in-its-wake/) in California. While the prospect of a fully ABA-accredited law school closing its doors is quite extraordinary, consider that Whittier’s first-time bar pass success rate on the California bar exam, where most of its graduates sit for the bar, went from an already troublingly low 43 percent in July 2014 to 38 percent in July 2015, to an almost hard-to-believe rate of 22 percent in July 2016. While, as I have [written before](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/first-monday-musings-by-dean-vik-amar-tightening-bar-pass-standards-and-the-california-problem/), the California bar examiners may be setting their passing score threshold at too high a level, these shockingly low pass rates at Whittier go a long way to explaining the decision by university officials to wind the school down. Even with the prospect of better aggregate times for legal education ahead, all law schools must figure out how better to enable their graduating classes to pass the bar. The academic strength of the students coming in is of course a factor, but every school, even ones with pass rates three or four times higher than Whittier’s 2016 showing, must attend to this issue more now than ever before.

# Vault Ranks The Best Law Firms For Diversity (2020)
## Did your law firm make the cut this time around?

Over the past few weeks, Vault has rolled out a variety of law firm rankings — from the firms that are the [most prestigious](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/vault-100-rankings-the-most-prestigious-law-firms-in-america-2020/) to the firms that offer the [best quality of life](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/vault-quality-of-life-rankings-the-best-law-firms-to-work-for-in-america-2020/) to the firms with the [top-ranked practice areas in their region](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/vault-rankings-top-law-firms-by-practice-area-and-region-2020/) to the firms with the [highest-rated summer associate programs](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/vault-ranks-the-best-summer-associate-programs-2020/) — and there’s yet another important one that we’ll dive into today.

Money can buy prestige and can certainly improve your quality of life, but the diversity of your colleagues is worth more than what any salary scale can possibly pay.

In a companion ranking to the Vault 100, associates were asked to rank their own law firms based on categories most relevant to how the firm does at creating, maintaining, and fostering a diverse workforce, including diversity relating to racial minorities, women, LGBTQ individuals, and individuals with disabilities. To create the overall Best 30 Firms for Diversity ranking, Vault averages the scores from all four ratings.

There was a huge amount of movement in the Top 10 this year. Which firms made the cut? Without any further ado, here are the [Top 10 Best Law Firms for Diversity](https://www.vault.com/best-companies-to-work-for/law/best-law-firms-for-diversity) based on Vault’s Annual Associate Survey for 2020:

- [O’Melveny & Myers](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/omelveny-myers-llp) (+1)
- [Carlton Fields](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/carlton-fields) (+12)
- [Constangy Brooks Smith & Prophete](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/constangy-brooks-smith-prophete-llp) (-2)
- [Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/orrick-herrington-sutcliffe-llp) (+1)
- [Ropes & Gray](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/ropes-gray-llp) (+3)
- [White & Case](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/white-case-llp) (+1)
- [Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/cleary-gottlieb-steen-hamilton-llp) (+16)
- [Littler Mendelson](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/littler-mendelson-pc) (-2)
- [Schiff Hardin](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/schiff-hardin-llp) (+1)
- [Finnegan Henderson Farabow Garrett & Dunner](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/finnegan-henderson-farabow-garrett-dunner-llp) (+7)
It’s worth noting that O’Melveny swept almost the entirety of Vault’s 2020 diversity rankings, while Constangy Brooks remained on top for Best Law Firm for Diversity for Minorities. Here’s some [additional commentary](https://www.vault.com/blogs/vaults-law-blog-legal-careers-and-industry-news/vaults-2020-quality-of-life-diversity-and-summer-associate-program-rankings-are-here) on that:

The firm not only claimed the No. 1 spot for Overall Diversity—moving up from its spot at No. 2 in the 2019 rankings—but it also ranked No. 1 as the Best Law Firm for Diversity for Individuals with Disabilities, Diversity for LGBTQ Individuals, and Diversity for Women. As one O’Melveny associate indicated, “There are few firms who take diversity as seriously as OMM.” …

In addition to O’Melveny—which also ranked No. 3 for Diversity for Racial Minorities—three law firms ranked in the top 10 of all five of Vault’s diversity rankings: Carlton Fields; Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP; and Ropes & Gray LLP.

# Kasowitz Benson Wants You To Know They Could Beat Up Your Firm
## Kasowitz Benson Torres is looking into a little rebranding.

After a year that saw the [loss of a named partner](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/kasowitz-benson-loses-name-partner-lots-of-money/), the mercurial [rise](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/marc-kasowitz-will-you-accept-this-rose/) and [fall](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/kasowitz-checking-out-of-russiagate/) of its most visible partner as a played on the national stage, and a [management overhaul](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/kasowitz-benson-gets-two-new-co-managing-partners-after-a-year-of-insanity/), you can’t blame Kasowitz Benson Torres for looking into a little rebranding. Marc Kasowitz’s turn at the top of Trump’s ever twirling wheel of Russiagate attorneys — Russian Roulette, if you will — prompted observers to wonder if he was [destroying the firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/when-people-start-writing-about-you-destroying-your-firm-things-arent-going-well/) that bears his name. That’s not an image you want to leave with the public.

A whole new look is in order after that kind of year, so let’s [head over to the website](http://www.kasowitz.com)!

First off, the firm has dropped its “Superior Legal Minds” motto for “Creative. Aggressive. Relentless” which sounds much more like the tagline on a poster for a bad action movie about a humble watercolorist with a dark past drawn out of self-imposed retirement to hunt down the drug cartel that murdered his best friend — Bob Ross stars in “Happy Little Trees.”

Check out Dan Fetterman in that picture. Is he grimacing or smirking? Is Fetterman the Mona Lisa of our age? I’m haunted by that image.

Be sure to check out the video because it’s just a sea of artistic quick-cuts and camera jerks that’s so self-serious that Tommy Wiseau goes, “hey guys, I think people might laugh at you over this.”

I think that’s an epee rather than a foil, to be honest.



Aw s**t. They’re gonna Million Dollar Baby your firm!

Seriously, everyone wants a lawyer who “fights,” but Kasowitz is really going overboard with the implied violence. We’ve got swords on one page, fists on another, and the world’s least subtle Goodfellas homage on another.

# Why You Respect You
## Here's an insight from in-house columnist Mark Herrmann that you should put to use when you're seeking a job.

Five years ago (heaven help me), I explained in this space why [everyone wants to hire himself](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/02/inside-straight-i-want-to-hire-me/).

The guy who nearly flunked out of Yale Law School doesn’t think grades make any difference: “The whole question is where you went to law school. I don’t care how well you did in law school, as long as you went to a great one. When I’m interviewing candidates for jobs, I’m looking for people attending schools ranked in the top five.”

The guy who ripped the cover off the ball at Podunk State Law School views things differently: “I think the very top students at all law schools are basically equivalent. If you were the top student at a lower-ranked school, you probably would’ve been in the top few anywhere. Deeper in the class, maybe it makes a difference where you went to school, but the outstanding students are basically all really gifted. I’m looking for the top students in the class; I’m not an elitist about where they attended school.”

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
I’m not trying to be cynical here; I’m trying to be realistic. I’m trying to describe accurately things that I’ve witnessed over time.

The more I think about it, my thesis — that you respect, more than anything else, you — carries far beyond the hiring process. Ask a rainmaker at your firm what attribute matters most in a lawyer: “Any idiot can do decent legal work. We’ve got scores of service partners here who can handle our cases. But what keeps the lights on at this joint? Business! We should richly reward rainmakers, because, without them, there’s no law firm at all.”

Walk next door and ask the best technical lawyer at your firm (who’s not a rainmaker) to identify valuable attributes: “I don’t understand why clients aren’t smarter about hiring lawyers. Who do they think is doing the work, anyway? Clients think that the smooth-talking, glad-handing blowhard is the lawyer they want, but that guy couldn’t actually do the work on his best day. Without truly gifted technical lawyers handling the legal work, clients wouldn’t hire us (for repeat business, anyway). Our reputation would collapse, and we’d be out of business. We should richly reward the most technically competent lawyers, because, without them, we’re toast.”

You respect you!

Think about the managing partner of the office at your law firm (or the head of your in-house legal division). Does the managing partner stroll the halls, chat with the associates and secretaries, and do no legal work? Ask that person the meaning of leadership. Dollars to donuts says this is what you’ll hear: “The job of a leader is to maintain the employees’ morale. The manager has to see and be seen, know everyone’s name, and make everyone feel like the workplace is their home. Can you imagine us having an office managing partner who sat in her office doing legal work instead of walking the halls? That would be a disaster! A manager’s duty is to think about our people; that’s what motivates our people to do their best work.”

Or is your managing partner the more studious type, still taking depositions and revising briefs in his early 60’s, and calling his wife to say that he’ll be home for dinner tonight “at the usual time — maybe 9 or 9:30.” Ask that managing partner the meaning of leadership, and you’ll hear an entirely different story: “There’s only one way to lead — by example. I work harder than everyone else in this office; I do top-notch work; I bring in my fair share of business. That’s what we’re striving for here, and that’s the example that the leaders must set. I don’t have time to stroll the halls chatting with people; my job is to lead, and I can lead only by showing our other lawyers what it means to be a successful partner at this firm.”

Do you see the same thing in junior lawyers? I have: I had a buddy in law school who had played varsity golf (at Stanford, which had quite a team at the time), but was in the bottom half of our law school class. He’d walk into interviews for jobs and explain: “People with good grades are a dime a dozen; ten percent of the students in this class are in the top ten percent. But I may be the only person in this class with a one handicap. I’d be happy to golf with you — or your clients, or potential clients — whenever you like.”

I don’t think the editor-in-chief of our law review was making the same pitch.

# Some Law Firms Are Losing Billing Cash Cows Due To COVID-19
## Lawyers should prepare for the possibility that some billing opportunities may disappear as clients and courts learn lessons about efficiency while operating during the ongoing pandemic.

This website has already detailed how law firms are adapting to meet challenges posed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, law firms have implemented work-from-home programs, communicated with clients and counsel through videoconferencing apps more often, and taken other steps to operate in these uncertain times. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has also eliminated many billing opportunities for numerous attorneys, and this has had an impact on the revenue of many law firms.

As mentioned previously in this column, [court appearances are usually a cash cow for law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/unnecessary-court-appearances-are-a-cash-cow-for-law-firms/). Even though court conferences may only take 10 minutes or less to complete, attorneys often need to wait in court for hours before a matter is called for a conference. Attorneys are often able to bill all of the time they spend in court for a conference, even if lawyers are just waiting for conferences to be called. In addition, attorneys usually need to spend an hour or two traveling to and from a court conference. Although clients have different rules about how much travel time is billable, attorneys are typically allowed to bill their clients for at least a portion of the time they spent traveling to and from conferences.

However, at the beginning of the pandemic, many courts adjourned numerous conferences, likely because they did not wish to hold conferences in person and did not have the infrastructure to hold conferences remotely. As time passed, courts have mostly been holding conferences through telephone and videoconferencing apps. Although there were some complications with people getting used to the technology at first, conferences by remote means seem to be going much more smoothly now.

Nevertheless, conferences by remote means do not present the same billing opportunities for firms as traditional in-person court conferences. When courts conference matters through remote means, the parties are usually scheduled to conference a matter at an exact time. As a result, attorneys are unable to bill as much time waiting for a conference as they could when they were in court before a matter was conferenced. In addition, since remote conferences do not require any travel time, attorneys have been missing out on billing travel time like they were able to with traditional court conferences. Although attorneys used to be able to bill several hours for attending a court conference, they are likely able to bill only 15 to 30 minutes of their time for court conferences in the present environment.

The way depositions have been conducted since the start of the ongoing pandemic has also impacted another traditional cash cow of billing for law firms. Attorneys used to be able to bill at least a portion of their time traveling to and from depositions just as with court conferences. For some depositions, attorneys can bill a substantial amount in travel time. Indeed, while I was working at a law firm that handled a number of mass torts matters, I would sometimes spend many hours traveling to and from depositions hundreds of miles away. Sometimes, the travel time billed to a client would pale in comparison to the time actually spent at depositions.

However, most depositions are also being conducted by remote means now in order to promote social distancing. As a result, attorneys are able to call into a deposition from home and have not been billing their travel time as they were in the past. This must be having a substantial impact on firms that rely on such billing for a considerable amount of their revenue.

Some attorneys may believe that disruptions in their billing may be temporary and that as operations return to normal, traditional court conferences and depositions will resume. Of course, some matters are simply easier to conduct in person, and it is altogether possible that court conferences and depositions will begin to occur in person more frequently over the next several months as many states gradually reopen. However, it is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic may permanently change the way certain tasks are conducted so that traditional billing cash cows lost during the pandemic may be permanently disrupted.

For instance, I have heard more than one court attorney relate that they see no reason to drag all of the parties to court for run-of-the-mill discovery conferences ever again. Conferencing routine and noncritical matters by remote means is simply more efficient, and it might not be worth it for all of the attorneys to appear in court for such matters. Furthermore, clients may require attorneys to continue conducting depositions by remote means. Clients may not wish to spend massive sums on travel time and travel costs for attorneys to attend depositions when they are now familiar with how depositions can be conducted remotely at a much cheaper cost.

In the end, many law firms have struggled with issues caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the current environment has restricted the ability of certain shops to bill hours. Some attorneys may believe that such issues will begin to disappear as conditions normalize as COVID-19 restrictions are eased. Nevertheless, lawyers should prepare for the possibility that some billing opportunities available to them months ago may disappear as clients and courts learn lessons about efficiency while operating during the ongoing pandemic.

# 10 Reasons Why Contract Express Is Best For Your Law Firm
## When was the last time you looked beyond product features to choose which application works best for your firm?

When choosing enterprise software for your law firm, most buyers look at a product demo and take it for a spin. When was the last time you looked beyond product features to determine whether an application such as Contract Express is best for your law firm?

You might know that Contract Express delivers enterprise document automation for global law firms and corporations that need contract drafting, management, and updates for agreements as large as 500 pages or more and as small as 10 pages or less.

Let’s take a look at 10 reasons why your law firm should consider Contract Express beyond mere product features. And when you’re thoroughly convinced this could be the right option for you to learn more, then give Thomson Reuters a shout. We’ll be standing by for that product demo and a test drive.

10 Reasons Why Contract Express Is Best

- [13 Patents and Counting.](http://bit.ly/2F6m5JZ) This has to be our number-one selling feature for Contract Express: 13 patents and counting. This is mind-blowing when you stop and think about the time, effort, investment, and commitment by the software developers behind Contract Express. Not only did they secure one patent to protect the product’s credibility, they secured 13 with more in queue. Knowing there’s a team of developers and patent attorneys behind this product to protect it should bring you peace of mind that this team has its customers at the forefront of product innovation.
- Easier and Quicker Markup Creation. Fewer Programming Hours Needed. It used to be that when a lawyer wanted to draft a contract, he spent an exorbitant amount of time with IT to make it sing. Now, with the functionality of Contract Express and its dynamic engine, lawyers can more easily and quickly draft contracts using markup variables. This is the key feature of Contract Express as a powerful document automation tool. The lawyer’s markup can be sophisticated and complex to accommodate the needs of the customer.
- Practical Law Integration. For law firms with a subscription to Practical Law and Contract Express, users earn a head start in the drafting process. There are upwards of 300 ready-made contract templates in Practical Law U.K. alone that Contract Express subscribers can access. In addition, if you subscribe to Practical Law U.S. or Practical Law Australia, there is a breadth of templates available. Each is produced and maintained by Practical Law’s expert editorial team.
- Trust in Process. Trust in software also means having trust in process. With Contract Express, attorneys are in control with less fear of mistakes, less time needed for updates, more trust in the process, less testing needed, and dramatic cost savings against time spent. When you eliminate the numbers of people needed to handle a contract, that’s more peace of mind for the legal team to trust accuracy in the finished product.
- Use a Questionnaire to Launch a Contract. How many details are needed to draft your contract without errors? For those firms drafting 100+ pages of contracts on a consistent basis, details are cumbersome and critical to get right. That’s why this software uses a patented questionnaire methodology to ensure the contract is drafted properly the first time. You can create approval flows, sign your generated contract, and above all, report on all the processes users use in the end-to-end flow.
- Saving Minutes vs. Hours. No one thinks about time savings with software programs because we all take software for granted. When you use Contract Express, however, you’re saving hours and hours daily by using the automated document assembly, questionnaire, and resulting template that help draft and maintain contracts. Your team is freed up for other billable work.
- Cleaning the Archives. Manual management of old files and archives requires someone in the know about file contents and the client roster. In this newest update of Contract Express, legal teams can schedule deletion of inactive contracts themselves. You can now set client alerts as reminders of expiration dates. This enhances data management and security while eliminating confusion of storing outdated versions of documents.
- New Search Technology. Have you ever hunted and pecked through a contract seeking details or terms? Now, you can use search connectors and target specific terms and phrases to pinpoint the document.
- Solution for Alternative Fee Arrangement. Law firms are always under the gun to reduce fees, especially for active clients with higher demand for legal services. One way law firms can save clients’ billable time is via Contract Express. By giving clients access to a contract drafting portal with its automatic questionnaire and contract drafting template, lawyers are in stand-by mode to help clients on an as-needed basis. Clients can add specific details that get incorporated into the document, and a lawyer can review the end product for accuracy. This creates loyal and grateful clients who can develop their own contracts 24/7 on a self-service basis.
- Win New Business. When isn’t a lawyer seeking new business? The advantage Contract Express provides to lure in and retain new clients is a secret worth knowing. Firms are using this document automation software as a marketing showcase in addition to offering basic documents on websites at no charge.
Contract Express by Thomson Reuters is the premier document automation software preferred by enterprise law firms and global corporations. It is changing the face of document assembly among lawyers and becoming a must-have product for legal teams the world over. Want to know more? As said, we’re available for that demo and a spin.

The playbook for moving between in-house and Biglaw is well known and pretty straightforward.

Want to switch from in-house to Biglaw?

Easy, kiss your personal time goodbye and be prepared to be a slave to the almighty billable hour.

Want to move from Biglaw to in-house?

Hasta la vista big paycheck and regular bonuses, who needs those anyways when you can count on being home in time for dinner with the family.

But if you are working in-house and want to move to an in-house role in another company, well, the playbook is not as clear and the path is a little more obscure. Even though you may be more marketable given your previous in-house experience, the application process can be a challenge.

First, when asked to interview with a competing company, you will immediately be struck with a nagging fear the new company only wants to meet you to gather intel on your present employer. We are attorneys after all, and we are known to be competitive by nature. Would you really put it past a fellow member of the bar to want to meet you only for their own gain?

Second, even if the company really wants you for your brains, the interview process is a minefield. Think about it. How many of the most common interview questions can you really answer without running afoul of attorney-client privilege?

Tell me about the toughest decision you have had to make in the last six-months?

Well, that might be hard if your toughest decision related to steering your company clear of a lawsuit based on some fancy legal footwork you conducted with your current employer.

Tell me about a time you disagreed with a decision and how you handled it?

I’m pretty sure I can’t tell you about the time our CEO overlooked my legal advice in favor of a riskier route that ran us afoul of regulators.

What do you consider to be your greatest weakness?

At the moment, it’s those darn rules of professional conduct that prevent me from really telling you how great I am while regaling you with stories of how I saved my current employer of a most certain doom and gloom.

So what is a current, now seemingly trapped, in-house counsel supposed to do if they want to leave for greener in-house pastures?

First, a bit of worn advice: network. Despite our companies being in competition with each other, I keep in regularly contact with my in-house counterparts at other companies. I can tell you which of them I would hire tomorrow if given the chance.

In-house life can be a bit lonely, so proving you are someone tolerable can go further to getting you a job offer than detailing your latest heroics.

Second, if faced with direct interview questions you believe you cannot ethically answer, answer the question at a more global level. As a healthcare attorney, the things the keep me up at night are likely the same as my competitors. You can demonstrate your understanding of the current pressure points in our field without revealing confidential information.

Finally, don’t be afraid to apply for a job outside of your respective niche. I may be a healthcare attorney, but I have negotiated enough employment and vendor contracts in my time that I am sure I could meaningful contribute to most in-house offices regardless of the company.

And when all else fails, complain about your non-legal colleagues.

Nothing will prove to me you understand what it takes to be an in-house counsel faster than your ability to relay the horror you are faced with every day as your respective company stumbles throughout the day as if the law did not exist.

# From Biglaw To Freelance Law: How Pivoting To Freelance Work Helped Me Find Balance As A Military Spouse And Mom
## Freelance work can be life-changing for you and your family, too.

In fall 2012, I made a decision that would forever alter my career trajectory: I married an active duty servicemember. At the time, I was a young associate in a large, prestigious law firm with no idea what the future would hold. My husband was very supportive of my career, and even passed on certain of his own opportunities to ensure we could stay in California so I could continue working for my firm. This is not always possible for military families, but we were lucky because we lived in San Diego where plenty of jobs were available to enable us to stay.

Fast forward to 2016, and I was a seventh-year associate at the same law firm, but now with two very young children at home. As if the demands of billable hours and two young children weren’t enough, that year became even more challenging when my husband left on a seven-month overseas deployment when our girls were just 18 months and 5 months old. As is common with military life, I didn’t have any family members close by to help pitch in from time to time, which left me solo parenting every single night and weekend. Most days, I would come home from work, relieve our nanny, put the girls to bed, and then get back online and work until the wee hours of the morning.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Somewhere along the line, I realized that working full time at a traditional law firm just wasn’t compatible with my life as a military spouse and mom holding down the fort alone so far away from family. At the same time, I wasn’t ready to completely give up my career, so I started looking into the possibility of part-time freelance work. Then in May 2016, I turned in my notice at the law firm that had been my “home” for my entire career, and took a big leap into the unknown.

I had no idea back then how life-changing freelance work would be for me and my family. It has afforded me complete control over my schedule, which has been invaluable with a deployable spouse and young children. It afforded me great flexibility and peace of mind when, less than a year later, I became pregnant with very high-risk twins, requiring endless doctor appointments and several hospital stays. And also when, a few years after that, the COVID-19 pandemic hit, causing immense uncertainty and closing offices, daycares, and schools. Flexible, freelance work has been a lifesaver during these difficult and unprecedented times and in general as a mom of four young, very energetic girls.

No longer tied to California for my job since I freelance from anywhere, my husband was able to take on opportunities that required moves, leading us to Alabama for a year for a master’s program, then to Nebraska, then on to Virginia where we currently live. It has been amazing to be able to move with the military without the concern of what I will do for work that many military spouses face.

In addition to providing complete control over my schedule and location, freelance work has also afforded me complete control over the types of projects I take on, and the people I choose to work with. These additional factors have made my legal career immeasurably more fulfilling, as I work on projects and with people I truly enjoy.

Because of freelancing, I can balance a career I love with the demands of motherhood and military life. Looking back, it was the best career decision I could have made.

# 'Biglaw Idol' -- Or, How In-House Lawyers Actually Select Outside Counsel
## Picking a law firm for a seven-figure engagement can take under five minutes.

Over the course of the past month, our office has been debating which Biglaw firm to retain for a rather sizable engagement.

As a high-level overview of the facts, our hospital system is currently engaged in a dispute with one of our largest insurance companies. Under our interpretation of the contract, we should be reimbursed at a negotiated discounted rate of our fixed price for a particular service. Under their interpretation of the contract, they will reimburse us at a percentage of what Medicare pays for the same service.

If you are scratching your head at the above, you are not alone. It is rather wonky and an excellent illustration of why healthcare can be complicated. For the purposes of this article, however, you just need to know we had a material dispute in our contractual terms that we believe led to our being underpaid by more than $50 million over the course of the past few years.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In my role, I have often been asked how in-house selects outside counsel for such engagements. While many think we have some formal decision making process in place, in my organization, the decision ultimately comes down to a few in-house colleagues quickly discussing before deciding whom to select.

Not convinced? The below is a near-verbatim transcript of a recent huddle where we decided who we would retain for the case in question.

General Counsel (GC): Well, given the size of this, I think there are only five firms in town I would turn to. Since this involves contract terms on a healthcare matter, I would eliminate Biglaw 1 and Biglaw 2 out of the gate since their healthcare practice is virtually non-existent. What do you think?

Counsel 1: Very much agreed, ma’am. Only Biglaws 3-5 could really handle this matter.

Counsel 2: I agree, but also keep in mind Biglaw 3 has a large office in the same city where the insurance company is headquartered. They may not have a conflict in our state, but I am not sure I would trust them with this one.

GC: Great point, that leaves only Biglaw 4 or 5. Biglaw 5 has always done good work for us, but they charge New York City rates. Is it worth it in this matter?

Counsel 2: Given the size of the dispute, I think it is, but I called over there last week to see if they had a known conflict and I am still waiting to hear back. You would think they would have an answer a little faster given the size of the potential engagement. I haven’t even gotten a text from them or an update letting me know the status.

GC: Really? Look, if we are going to bring someone on board for the next year or so, they have got to earn our business.  Has anyone reached out to Biglaw 4?

Counsel 1: I talked with them yesterday, they followed up this morning and let me know they did not think they had a conflict, but that they would let me know by the end of the week. Their managing partner also called me this morning to thank me for considering them. He said he understood they may not be who we ultimately retain, but he appreciated the confidence we had in their firm for even considering them.

GC: Wow, Managing Partner called? I passed over his shop a few months ago in favor of Biglaw 2 and thought he was still mad at me. I am impressed he called. Look, if we can’t get an answer from Biglaw 5 and Biglaw 4 is ready to go — I am signed-off, bring in Biglaw 4.

And with that, in the span of no less than five minutes, a several-thousand-hour, seven-figure Biglaw engagement was decided.

Sure, expertise in the area was important. And unfortunately for Biglaw 3, sometimes you can’t help where you are located — but at the end of the day, showing an interest matters. Making the extra call matters. Biglaw 5 acted as heir apparent to the engagement, which ultimately cost them.

Even if you are the clear frontrunner for a matter, make the extra effort. It’s the small things that get discussed in a five-minute huddle that can mean the most.

In the first 10 years of our existence, we have accomplished under Joe’s leadership that which was entirely improbable when we embarked on this journey. Now we are positioning Dentons to go from being the world’s largest global law firm to the world’s leading global law firm. In recognition of all of those accomplishments, the global firm is retiring the role of global chairman.

— Elliott Portnoy, co-founder and global CEO of Dentons, commenting on his co-founder Joe Andrew’s [decision to step down from the role of global chair](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/11/07/joe-andrew-bows-out-as-dentons-global-chair-405-112601/) of the megafirm to work as a partner. “I am not going to run for another term. Going out on top is something all law firm leaders aspire to do,” Andrew said. According to a firm spokesperson, Andrew will return to his practice full time “after the first quarter of next year.”

# NY To $180K: The Raises Spread To Summer Associates!
## What is your firm doing for summer associates and incoming associates in the Class of 2016?

A summer celebrates his new salary of $3,500 a week.

Yesterday, Paul Weiss was the second major law firm to publicly announce that it would be matching the new [Cravath salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/?rf=1). At the time of its announcement, Paul Weiss was the only firm to explicitly state that incoming associates in Class of 2016 would see their base salaries raised to $180,000. The firm’s memo from chairman Brad Karp can be found [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/ny-to-180k-another-big-new-york-firm-matches-cravath/2/). (Perhaps this move inspired Milbank, the first major firm to match, to email its incoming associates (see the [3:37 p.m. update](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/ny-to-180k-the-first-major-match/)) and reassure them they’d be getting the new rate.)

After we noted that Paul Weiss specifically mentioned salaries for incoming associates, we received a flood of emails from members of the Class of 2016. Prior to the Paul Weiss announcement, it had been largely assumed that other firms, including Cravath, would reward their incoming associates with the $180,000 salary scale, especially given the July 1, 2016, effective date of the pay raise. Nevertheless, people began to worry that their firms would not increase their pay, perhaps forcing them to remain on the $160,000 salary scale since they’d already signed their employment contracts.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
As if the question of salaries for incoming associates in the Class of 2016 wasn’t enough, summer associates started to wonder if they, too, would be bumped up financially by their firms. Thus far in the 2016 associate salary wars, we hadn’t heard a peep about what Biglaw firms would be doing for their summer associates — until last night.

Paul Weiss may be forcing the market’s hand, because at about 6:45 p.m. last night, the firm’s summer associates received an exciting email from Brad Karp letting them know that effective July 1, their base salaries would be increased to $3,500 per week, thus applying the Cravath raise to summer associates. Karp noted that this move was “in keeping with [the firm’s] commitment that [its] compensation levels be at the top of the market.”

Karp’s language implies Paul Weiss is being a follower (its usual role, as we [noted yesterday](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/ny-to-180k-another-big-new-york-firm-matches-cravath/?rf=1), citing a PW source). But in this case, it’s actually being a compensation leader — as far as we know, no other Biglaw firm has yet applied the new starting salary to summer associates. How many other firms will follow suit?

Congratulations to all Paul Weiss summer associates! Not only is your firm the first to explicitly state that its Cravath salary raise applies to incoming associates, but it’s the first firm to demonstrate that it truly values the talents of its summer associates.

What is your firm doing for summer associates and incoming associates in the Class of 2016? Do you want your firm to be known as a market leader or a market loser?

On-campus interviewing season is right around the corner, and the salary moves firms make this summer could seriously impact their recruitment efforts this fall. If you want your firm to remain at the top of the market and attract top-of-the-market talent from the nation’s best law schools, we’d humbly suggest that you give your summer associates a raise and make your intentions known as to your incoming associates’ salaries.

Remember, we are covering this trend extensively, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

UPDATE (11:30 a.m.): Cleary Gottlieb is paying its summer associates [at the new rate](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/cleary-gottlieb-matches-cravath-scale-or-maybe-beats-it/).

UPDATE (12:12 p.m.): As we’ve said before, [three makes a trend](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/3-makes-a-trend-new-york-market-really-is-180k/). Simpson Thacher is also paying its summers [on the new scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/simpson-thacher-finally-announces-its-new-salary-scale/).

# A Constitutional Amendment Guaranteeing The Right To Privacy
## The only reason our Constitution doesn't protect the right to privacy is because the American Constitution was adopted in the 18th century.

All the uproar about Dobbs v. Jackson made me realize this: The United States should adopt a constitutional amendment protecting the right to privacy.

The only reason our Constitution doesn’t protect the right to privacy is because the American Constitution was adopted in the 18th century. Modern constitutions expressly protect privacy; the constitution of [nearly every country in the world does so](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/4686826915217781020). Ours should, too: Information privacy; bodily privacy; privacy of communications; territorial privacy — we need them all. Let’s do it in one fell swoop — amend the Constitution to expressly protect a generalized right to privacy!

Liberals and conservatives alike should support this idea.

Liberals: Own the conservatives! Want to guarantee a right to contraception, abortion, and interracial and same-sex marriage? Vote in favor of the amendment securing your right to privacy! Get everything you want!

Conservatives: Own the libs! Want to secure your right to be free from a pesky mask or a vaccination against your will? Do I have an idea for you! Not only that, a right to privacy is a quintessentially conservative idea: Everyone should have personal space that the government cannot invade. You need a guaranteed right to privacy! Vote in favor of the amendment that gives you what you need!

On the other hand, you’re never sure what you’re voting for when you give yourself undefined rights. Perhaps a future conservative court would hold that the mother’s right to an abortion must obviously yield to the rights of a third person — the unborn fetus. Maybe my amendment wouldn’t do the trick for liberals.

Perhaps a future liberal court would hold that the right to be free from involuntary vaccination must obviously yield in the face of a public health crisis.  Maybe my amendment wouldn’t do the trick for conservatives.

Shoot! If I’m wrong, then we’d be back to hammering out rights through the legislative process.

Maybe there’s no way to avoid that disaster.

(I’ll end on a personal note: Many people have asked me whether I think that the opinion in Dobbs spells doom for same-sex marriage: Roe recognized the right to an abortion grounded in the supposed constitutional right to privacy. Obergefell recognized the right to same-sex marriage grounded in the supposed constitutional right to privacy. Dobbs casts doubt on the existence, and scope, of a right to privacy. Do Roe and Obergefell necessarily fall together?

I have this to say about that: First, do I look like a constitutional scholar to you? I don’t think those guys spend much time writing weekly columns at Above the Law. Second, in the draft Dobbs opinion, Alito says that abortion is not like same-sex marriage, because abortion involves harm to a third party — the fetus — and same-sex marriage does not involve harm to a third party. That distinction is a plausible one, and a reasonable person might choose to respect it. On the other hand, that distinction is not iron-clad, and someone who wanted to do away with same-sex marriage could choose to ignore it: After Dobbs, there’s only a limited, or nonexistent, right to privacy; same-sex marriage has no long historical precedent; if Roe is gone, then Obergefell is gone. Asking me to say anything beyond that asks me to read the minds of five justices, which is beyond me.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
One last thing. An old buddy, who actually is a constitutional scholar, notes this:  [Yick Wo v. Hopkins](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/4686826915217781020) was a Supreme Court case from 1886 involving the permitting process for laundries in San Francisco, which was a hotbed of anti-Chinese animus at the time. Although the permitting process was facially neutral, in practice it almost exclusively hurt people of Chinese descent — their laundries didn’t receive the necessary permits. That’s invidious intent, and the permitting process thus violated the Equal Protection Clause. By analogy, statutes that ban abortions are facially neutral, but actually hurt women 100% of the time. Perhaps some version of that argument will eventually take center stage in the life of Dobbs.)

# Biglaw Firm's Black History Month Efforts Go Terribly Awry

Gowling WLG is a ginormous international law firm — seriously, it has 1,400+ lawyers and 19 offices worldwide. You’d think someone at a firm that big would know that finding it noteworthy that a Black person was “very nice and extremely polite”  is incredibly problematic.

The firm a[sked employees what Black history means](https://twitter.com/ModernPrivacy/status/1364723421314179073?s=20) to them. The responses were shared, and yikestown…. the following quote was captured on a computer screensaver in Gowling WLG Canada:

“My daughter inspires me a lot. When she was younger, she often spoke of her friend Daniel”, read the quote. “One day, my husband and I attended an event at her school and finally got to meet Daniel. He was very nice and extremely polite; my grandmother would have said he was ‘well brought up.’ Never during the course of her friendship with Daniel did my daughter mention he was black. That night, I went to sleep with the hope that one day, race-based conflicts would forever be behind us.”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Notice how the quote centers the white experience — the writer’s ethnicity isn’t mentioned because it’s presumed to be white or at least in contrast to Black experience. Also, is the writer somehow shocked that a Black person is “well brought up?” What the hell. That the firm believes it’s noteworthy to highlight this quote seems massively telling.

Another message dug up as part of the campaign exclusively highlights Black culture and influence in the music and sports fields. Of course, there’s Black excellence in those industries, but when that’s the primary focus — particularly at a law firm which should be aware of, you know, the accomplishments of Black people in the LEGAL FIELD — the result merely reinforces stereotypical presumptions about Black people:

We apologize for our screensaver message that appeared in this post. It does not reflect our values. The message has been taken down and we are reaching out to all of our people to listen to their perspectives and learn from this matter.

— Gowling WLG Canada (@gowlingwlg_ca) [February 24, 2021](https://twitter.com/gowlingwlg_ca/status/1364699041980891144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

And as[ reported by Roll on Friday](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-gowling-wlg-sorry-expressing-amazement-nice-black-man), the firm’s chair also made noises of contrition:

Andy Stylianou, Chairman of Gowling WLG UK LLP and the firm’s lead on diversity and inclusion, told RollOnFriday, “We are deeply sorry that a post that does not reflect our values appeared on an internal network in Canada yesterday”.

“Addressing systemic racism requires a collective effort and we actively encourage our colleagues to become allies” he said. “However, we recognise that we have more work to do to educate, upskill and empower them”.

RollOnFriday asked the firm whether Stylianou’s reference to “systemic racism” was an admission that Gowling WLG was racist, but a spokesperson clarified that he was “addressing systemic racism across society as a whole”.

Acknowledging the fuck-up is obviously the first step, but a lot more work and education needs to happen at Gowling WLG.
