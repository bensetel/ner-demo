[George T. Conway III](http://www.wlrk.com/GTConway/) — prominent New York litigator, Wachtell Lipton partner for more than two decades (since 1994), and husband of top Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway — will be nominated to a plum post at the Department of Justice. The news was first reported by the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-adviser-kellyanne-conways-husband-is-set-to-lead-justice-departments-civil-division-1489771204) (on Friday night, because weekends are when notable news breaks in Trumpworld):

From Pilot and Above The Law  
George Conway, the husband of senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, is set to be nominated to run the Justice Department’s civil division, according to people familiar with the matter, a job that would put him at the forefront defending the controversial immigration executive order and other lawsuits against the Trump administration.

Mr. Conway, a partner at Wall Street law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, had also been in the running for other jobs at the Justice Department.

Indeed. Serving as Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division could be viewed as a “consolation prize” of sorts for Conway, who was a [finalist for Solicitor General](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/the-latest-in-the-solicitor-general-sweepstakes/). That nomination ultimately went to former Jones Day partner Noel Francisco, but the process was very good for raising Conway’s profile inside the Beltway.

And while it’s not as glamorous as SG, AAG for Civil is a very important job — as noted by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/18/us/politics/kellyanne-conway-husband-trump-justice.html?_r=0), which also reported on Conway’s nomination:

Mr. Conway, 53, would lead a department of about 1,000 lawyers that has vast reach across the government, handling issues like national security and consumer protection and enforcing federal programs and the actions of the president himself….

If confirmed, Mr. Conway would immediately be in charge of representing Mr. Trump in the legal challenges — which are widely expected to reach the Supreme Court — over his executive order barring people from six predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States….

It would also fall to Mr. Conway to oversee Mr. Trump’s defense in a pending lawsuit charging him with violations of the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, which bans federal officeholders from accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments, because of the profits his hotels and resorts receive from foreign officials who are customers.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Conway is used to handling high-profile cases from his years at Wachtell Lipton, but even major takeover battles don’t make headlines the way that the travel-ban litigation has. (Speaking of which, in case you missed it over the weekend, check out the latest [Ninth Circuit drama](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/friday-night-fights-at-the-ninth-circuit/) in that case.)

So George Conway — a longtime player behind the scenes, e.g., in the [Clinton v. Jones](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/a-prominent-professors-pick-for-solicitor-general/) litigation — will have to get used to the spotlight. Luckily for him, he won’t have far to go for advice: his wife Kellyanne, Trump campaign manager turned senior advisor, is no stranger to the media (or to controversy).

As I’ve [mentioned before](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/an-exciting-new-entrant-in-the-solicitor-general-sweepstakes/), I had the pleasure of working with George Conway during my time at Wachtell Lipton. I send him congratulations to him on his imminent nomination, and wish him good luck in the confirmation process.

# Top Biglaw Firm Finally Matches Cravath, Announces Its 2022 Bonus Scale
## Exciting financial news for associates at the firm.

This may sound hard to believe, but some Biglaw firms are still matching Cravath. We’re not talking about Am Law 200 firms here; we’re talking about worldwide heavy hitters ranked near the tippy top of the Am Law 100. So, which firm is just now getting around to offering market compensation?

That would be Norton Rose Fulbright — a firm ranked at #14 in the most recent Am Law 100, after bringing in $2,100,000,000 gross revenue in 2021. The firm recently notified associates that it would, in fact, be matching the prevailing Cravath salary scale. Sources at the firm tell us that their raises quietly went into effect a few weeks ago but the announcement wasn’t made until May 3. NRF had previously [matched the Milbank scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/norton-rose-match-2022/) in early February and [matched the Davis Polk scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/nrf-dpw-match-2022/) in late February (mere hours before Cravath upped the ante on compensation).

Here’s what the salary scale now looks like at Norton Rose:



As we noted when Norton Rose announced its previous matches, the firm will only be applying this new salary scale to some of its offices. Associates in the firm’s California, New York, Texas, and D.C. offices will be on the $215K to $415K pay scale, while those in Minneapolis and St. Louis may have opportunities to earn higher salaries based on local guidance.

You may have also noticed that NRF has released its 2022 year-end bonus scale — and it’s the same as Cravath’s 2021 year-end bonus scale. We’re frankly not shocked by that at all; after all, Cravath’s new bonus scale will likely remain the same for years to come. A tipster notes that the firm’s 1900 hours eligibility mark for bonuses is more strict than in years past. Associates were once able to earn half bonuses at 1800 hours, but that policy has apparently been scrapped. Discretionary bonuses for “exceptional” contributions and “top biller bonuses” have been left intact.

Congratulations to (almost) everyone at the firm on their new market salaries. For those in smaller markets, just remember, any raise is better than no raise!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Norton Rose Fulbright.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Even as in-house attorneys are increasingly [utilizing legal operations teams](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/stat-of-the-week-law-departments-feel-the-squeeze/) to help them fire on all cylinders, they have yet to fully utilize one important tool: litigation finance. 

In this free white paper, our friends at Lake Whillans outline the basics of litigation finance, explore the benefits of having a legal operations strategy, and unpack how litigation finance can complement an organization’s operational goals.

# Perkins Coie Is The Next Firm To Defer Incoming Associates

Good news, this isn’t a layoff article. Bad news, the contents don’t exactly bode well for the market either. We’ve got another firm delaying associate start dates. This time, its Perkins Coie. And while it isn’t the full year delay that [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/cooley-deferral-corporate-associates/) offered a few of its associates, 4 and a half months is still quite the chunk of unexpected free time.

From [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/perkins-coie-delays-start-date-for-some-first-year-associates?source=newsletter&item=read-text&region=digest):

The Seattle-founded firm has moved start dates for its first-year associates—except those in the intellectual property practice—from this fall to Jan. 16, 2024, Perkins Coie told the associates in a memo from managing partner Bill Malley viewed by Bloomberg Law. Those associates joining the firm’s intellectual property group will start Sept. 18, 2023, the memo said.

The move is in response to “challenging market conditions that have slowed demand for legal work in several areas of practice,” Malley said in the memo.

The firm is providing a $15,000 stipend to cover living expenses for those deferred, according to the memo.

I guess the take away here is that if you’re looking for some consistent work and aren’t willing to go into something completely market-resistant like tax [or billing 277 hours for each 20 documents you review](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/biglaw-associate-bills-277-hours-to-review-20-documents-and-im-fascinated-to-know-how-this-happened/?amp=1), right now wouldn’t be a bad time to consider IP. A bunch of previously accepted commercial transactions could become legally questionable in light of the recent [Warhol](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/elena-kagan-footnote-withering-condemnation-warhol/) and [Jack Daniels](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/if-it-looks-like-a-bottle-scotus-ruling-on-a-jack-daniels-copy-dog-is-in/) decisions and what they mean for fair use.

Is your firm planning to start making major deferral offers to associates? If you have any intel, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Best of luck to all affected incoming associates at Perkins Coie.

If your firm or organization is reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through deferrals, open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive.

Greenberg Traurig partner [Joel Katz](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/professionals/k/katz-joel-a) is the center of a new sexual harassment Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint. The Biglaw partner, who also previously served as the former chair of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Academy’s board and who continues to serve as the Academy’s outside general counsel, faces allegations from Deborah Dugan, the first woman to serve as the Academy’s president and CEO who was placed on administrative leave.

According to the complaint, during a May 2019 business dinner Katz repeatedly called Dugan “baby” and made comments on her appearance. Additionally, the complaint alleges Katz made overtures to Dugan, saying they should spend time together” and travel to one of his “many homes.” The complaint alleges that despite Dugan’s lack of interest in Katz’s advances, he still attempted to kiss her at the end of the meal.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But that incident was not the end of Katz’s allegedly inappropriate behavior towards Dugan:

Despite the fact that Ms. Dugan rejected all of Mr. Katz’s advances, he continued to act inappropriately towards her.

Indeed, in every one-on-one conversation Ms. Dugan had with Mr. Katz following the May 18, 2019, dinner, he told her that she was pretty and referred to her as “baby.”

Dugan says she complained to Human Resources in an email on December 22, 2019 about the harassment she alleges she endured, which notes a “’boys’ club’ mentality and approach to governance at the Academy.” Three weeks later, Dugan was put on leave:

Only three weeks after sending her complaint to HR, on January 16, 2020 Ms. Dugan was put on administrative leave by the members of the Board’s Executive Committee. The decision to put Ms. Dugan on leave was clearly made in retaliation for her complaint, and came with thinly veiled threats of termination in the event that Ms. Dugan persisted in pursuing claims against the Academy.

In public statements about Dugan’s suspension, the Recording Academy pointed to alleged allegations made against Dugan saying she was released “in light of concerns raised to the Recording Academy board of trustees, including a formal allegation of misconduct by a senior female member of the Recording Academy team.” The complaint characterizes this explanation for her departure as “completely false and defamatory… designed to retaliate against Ms. Dugan, threaten her, and malign her reputation.”

As [reported by Law.com](https://www.law.com/2020/01/21/greenberg-shareholder-accused-of-sexual-harassment-by-ousted-grammys-chief/), Greenberg Traurig executive chairman, Richard Rosenbaum, issued a statement on the allegations calling Katz “legendary in the music industry” and said he helped the Academy “achieve previously unprecedented business results.” Rosenbaum also spoke about the allegations:

“The personal allegations recently made were not previously known to us and, if true, would of course offend our culture and values.” Rosenbaum said. “But our values also require a full and fair investigation before conclusions are reached. We understand this investigation is being conducted by the Academy and await the results.”

The Academy had its own statement that it had “immediately launched independent investigations to review both Ms. Dugan’s potential misconduct and her subsequent allegations. Both of these investigations remain ongoing.”

# Morning Docket: 05.10.17
## * Former FBI Director James Comey found out that he'd been fired in the worst way possible. He apparently saw the news of his sudden termination on television, and originally thought that it was some sort of a prank being played on him. When you get fired and everyone in the world knows about it before you do, that takes trolling to a whole new level. Ice cold.

According to White House press secretary Sean Spicer, Trump hired a ""leading law firm in Washington, D.C."" to send a letter to that effect to Senator Lindsey Graham. Which ""leading law firm in Washington, D.C."" could it be? [[NBC News](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-hires-law-firm-rebut-suggestion-russia-business-ties-n757106?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma)] * The Law School Admissions Council has named Dean Kellye Y. Testy of the University of Washington School of Law as its new president and CEO. Testy will step down from her current position to take the lead on several new initiatives at LSAC, including increasing the frequency of when the LSAT is administered and offering free online prep materials for the exam. Congratulations! [[ABA Journal](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/lsac_names_new_president)] * ""[W]e are reviewing all Department of Justice policies to focus on keeping Americans safe and will be issuing further guidance and support to our prosecutors executing this priority.""

# Do Any Law Firms Still Have Summer Hours?
## Being against summer hours is like being against Mom or apple pie.

This past weekend, I ran the Brooklyn Half Marathon with three of my brothers. The event was awesome, and it was great to run through 13.1 miles of the “old country” of Brooklyn where my grandparents lived before crossing the river to New Jersey. Saturday was also the hottest day we have had in New York City so far this year, reminding me that summer is right around the corner. That made me think of what it was like to work at some of the shops I was employed by before I started my own practice several years ago. Many law firms have rituals during the warmer months since numerous shops welcome summer classes, participate in softball leagues, and hold other events during the summer. I also remembered that a firm I used to work at had a “summer hours” policy and wondered if this is still a common practice across the legal industry.

I am sure that different firms have varying definitions of what the notion of summer hours comprises. At the firm I worked at that observed summer hours, it basically meant that if you did not have anything pressing in the office on Friday, you could leave work sometime in the middle of the afternoon. At the shop I worked at that had summer hours, sometimes the attorneys would take late long lunches on Friday and then just head home. I know for a fact that law firms are not the only employers that ever had a summer hours policy, since my brother worked at a financial company that also allowed employees to take shorter days in the summer.

There are a number of benefits to summer hours. For one, it makes it much easier for people to head out of town if they can leave the office a little early on Friday. The office I worked at which had a summer hours policy was in New Jersey, and many of the partners, associates, and staff would go DTS (“down the shore” for people who never saw “Jersey Shore”) many weekends, and it was much easier to beat traffic and head out earlier in the day on Friday than after business hours.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Even if people did not have explicit out-of-town plans over the weekend, it was still nice for individuals to have an early start to their time off. With a half day on Fridays, people could enjoy the weather a little more while the sun was up. Moreover, letting people out a little early usually meant that individuals had to sit in less traffic on their way home, which maximized the amount of time that they could spend with family and friends.

The only time I worked at a firm with summer hours was at a law firm early in my legal career, which was about a decade ago. After that point, I never worked at a law firm that had summer hours (although, since I started my own practice over three years ago, I guess I can implement the policy at my current shop!) Most of the firms I worked at would only let people out of the office a little early during Fridays in the summer if it was a Memorial Day, Fourth of July, or Labor Day weekend. Otherwise, bosses generally expected people to be at their desks the same hours over the summer as they were to be at their desks during any other time in their careers.

As law firms require associates and staff to return to offices again after working remotely during much of the COVID-19 pandemic, more shops should consider implementing summer hours. Policies like summer hours show that law firms care about their employees and do not stick to rigid time requirements just for the sake of having expectations and keeping people in offices. This could help lawyers and staff transition back into office routines if they know that at least on the day they most need flexibility in the summer, they will be afforded some fluidity by their managers.

Moreover, there really isn’t a need to stick to strict requirements about how much time people should be in an office. If the COVID-19 pandemic has taught the legal industry anything, it is that lawyers can be just as productive remotely as in the office, and lawyers can make judgments about tasks they can perform remotely and tasks for which they need to be in the office. Of course, sometimes, lawyers need to be in offices on Friday afternoons in order to complete filings, meet with clients, or for other purposes. However, lawyers and staff can be expected to meet client and firm expectations even if they have a little flexibility on Fridays.

In any event, law firms should consider reinstituting summer hours if such policies have been rejected in recent years, and more shops should consider implementing summer hours even if they never did before. Allowing attorneys and staff to leave early on Fridays can help promote work-life balance and will likely result in few negative consequences to a firm or its clients.

# NALP 2018: 'YOU’RE GOING TO HOLLYWOOD!!!!!!!'

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](https://www.mainspringlegal.com/laterallink/) team of expert contributors. [Scott Hodes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-hodes) is a Senior Director based in the Southeast where he oversees attorney placements and client services primarily in Florida, Atlanta, Charlotte, and Nashville. Scott holds a B.A. in Criminology, cum laude, from the University of Florida, a J.D. from the University of Florida Levin College of Law, and an LL.M. in estate planning from the University of Miami. Scott began his legal career as a corporate litigator for a full service firm in Boca Raton, Florida.

Overheard at the 2017 NALP Conference: “Next year, the conference is in Hollywood!! I can’t wait. Movie stars, beaches, surfing, In-and-Out Burger!!!! I need to make the pitch to my firm to send me right away. It’s going to be so awes…Wait. What??!! Hollywood, Florida? Is that a thing?”

And yes, I can make those jokes. Some of my best friends are Floridians (heck, I live here too).

Yes, indeed, NALP. The annual “World Cup” of recruiting. Three days of exchanging ideas, shaking hands, air-kisses, catching up with old colleagues and making new connections, and witnessing Herculean efforts to make even the most mundane panel topics entertaining.

Once again, this year did not disappoint and had it all, from a lively and informative Exhibition Center and educational and interactive panel discussions to Wednesday evening’s NALP Prom and noble, commendable efforts to help those in need (the good people of Puerto Rico) and effect change (school safety).

But in addition to all of the above reasons we attend each year, I think it is very important to take a moment to recap and consider some of the takeaways from this year’s conference.

The most important takeaway from my perspective is that the lateral hiring market remains very active, which is consistent with what we as recruiters are seeing on a daily basis. Firms’ hiring departments are open for business for top-notch associates, and as always, if you are a lateral partner with portable business, well, you know the drill. And not just in large markets. Smaller markets are booming as well. And the fears of a new administration negatively affecting the legal job market have fortunately (and admittedly, perhaps surprisingly) been to date unfounded. Time will tell, but I am hopeful that this will remain the case.

One of the things that stood out to me this year was the increasing focus on the partnership between recruiters and recruiting personnel at law firms. A few years ago, I spoke about the importance of a cohesive unit comprised of recruiters, recruiting managers/coordinators, and hiring partners. By all indications from last week, we are getting there and we are on the right track. If all parties view each other as partners in the recruiting process, and not as an obstacle or even worse, a prohibitive cost, recruiters and firms, and indeed the lateral market as a whole, will greatly benefit. I was personally encouraged to find that many of my colleagues on all sides of the equation wholeheartedly agree.

In addition to the general positivity surrounding the conference, there was a focus on hotbutton, important topics like diversity hiring and recruiting in the #metoo era. As valuable members that help shape the legal community, NALP conference attendees have a responsibility to make sure these issues remain at the forefront. Having a place for an open, honest dialogue about what we do right, what we do wrong, and how we can do better is a huge part of why NALP is a success year after year.

As a whole, this year’s conference left me, and I hope you too, enthusiastic and optimistic about the short and long-term prognosis of the lateral hiring market.

And as always, a special thanks to the planning committee, and all of you who take time out of your work schedule to come see us and who continuously make this conference the success that it is. It was a pleasure hosting you all in sunny South Florida, and I hope we made your trip worthwhile. If nothing else, you left with more schwag than you came with. We’ll see you next year when you run out of pens and candy.

So on behalf of my colleagues at Lateral Link, a sincere thank you.

Overheard at the 2018 NALP Conference: “I’m never going to another NALP for the rest of my life unless there is a pool and a beach right at hotel, like the one in Hollywood, Florida.”

As the sun sets on this year’s conference, we look towards NALP 2019.

A city I love. It’s a fact. It’s the greatest city in the history of mankind. Discovered by the Germans in 1904. They named it San Diaaago (translation and meaning censored).

I’m sorry. I was just trying to impress you. I don’t know what it means. I’ll be honest I don’t think anyone knows what it means anymore. Scholars maintain that the translation was lost hundreds of years ago.

Or perhaps it does simply mean, “Saint Diego.”

# The Global 200: The Richest Law Firms In The World (2022)
## Which firms are at the very top of the list this year?

Law.com International recently published its latest edition of the Global 200, a ranking of the world’s 200 largest law firms by total revenue. How did these firms do in the year that was? As we learned from the [most recent Am Law 100 rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/a-deep-dive-into-the-2021-am-law-100-rankings/), during the “post”-pandemic phase, 2021 was a banner year for Biglaw firms, with some of the planet’s top-grossing firms setting financial records.

What are we looking at in terms of the big picture?

For that, let’s check out the firms at the tippy top of the Global 200 ranking, the Global 100. Overall, the Global 100’s gross revenue grew by 15.3% (up 8.6 percentage points from fiscal year 2020), bringing the collective earnings of these firms up to more than $127.5 billion. During a time when some thought the coronavirus era would bring about all sorts of financial negatives, Biglaw was absolutely booming in some areas of the world, with profits per equity partner up by about 17% to more than $1.9 million collectively. Making up over three-quarters of the Global 100, the United States continues to dominate the list. This time around, 63 firms had more than $1 billion in revenue — and the vast majority of those firms are based in America.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Here are the [top 10 firms of the 2022 Global 200](https://www.law.com/international-edition/2021/09/21/the-2021-global-200-ranked-by-gross-revenue/) (i.e., the top 10 firms ranked by 2021 revenue). Almost all of these firms have most of their lawyers in the U.S.:

- Kirkland & Ellis: $6,042,000,000
- Latham & Watkins: $5,448,778,000
- DLA Piper: $3,471,437,000
- Baker McKenzie: $3,126,729,000
- Skadden Arps: $3,022,380,000
- Dentons: $2,940,600,000
- White & Case: $2,869,800,000
- Sidley Austin: $2,795,426,000
- Clifford Chance: $2,711,508,000
- Ropes & Gray: $2,674,046,000
Here’s some commentary on how the top firms on the planet fared so incredibly well in these otherwise turbulent times:

Altogether, revenue for the largest 200 firms in the world increased to more than $185.6 billion, as a confluence of high demand and high-dollar deal work drove the industry to dizzying heights. In general, but particularly in the United States, firms were also able to increase rates, increase utilization and increase their collections, “three big tics of the box,” says Tony Williams, a London-based principal at Jomati Consultants who advises firms around the globe.

“It was almost an ideal environment,” says Williams, also a former managing partner at Clifford Chance. …

“I think 2019 was great, 2020 was even better, and 2021 was way better. I think firms are wondering whether 2022 will be 2021—I think that’s realistic—or, is 2022 going to be more like 2020, which in the abstract is still plenty good,” says Honigman CEO David Foltyn, whose firm ranked No. 182 in this year’s Global 200. “If you talk to CEOs, I think what they’ll tell you is we are wondering where 2023 will fall.”

# Inside The $50 Million Gender Discrimination Case A Partner Filed Against Proskauer Rose

The list of Biglaw firms fielding gender discrimination complaints now includes Proskauer Rose. On Friday the firm was hit with a $50 million lawsuit by a partner, identified only as Jane Doe from the D.C. office, alleging “substantial gender disparities” at the firm. The complaint claims Doe was subjected to objectification by two partners and her compensation lagged behind that of similarly situated male partners.

Doe alleges that her physical appearance was a frequent topic of conversation:

During her time at Proskauer, however, Plaintiff has been overtly objectified based on her sex. Proskauer Chairman Joseph Leccese frequently complimented Plaintiff’s appearance, describing her as “elegant” and “glamorous” and praising her “presence” and ability to “light up a room.”

Almost every time he saw Plaintiff in the office, he made suggestive or inappropriate comments about her appearance.  He drew close to her in a lascivious manner and made inappropriate comments regarding her appearance, body, clothing, or “sexiness.”

But the biggest allegations in the lawsuit — and the most familiar for those following other Biglaw gender discrimination lawsuits — concern female partner compensation lagging behind that of male partners. The complaint provides several comparable male partners and argues that Doe’s compensation is inappropriately lower than theirs. She also notes, “The Firm’s five highest paid male partners earn more than double the amount that the five highest paid female partners earn.”

Some of the key statistics the complaint draws attention to are plaintiff’s rankings as related to billable hour/origination, which are higher than her overall compensation ranking. Plaintiff is:

* 6th among equity partners for billable hours;
* 18th among equity partners for origination;
* and yet, 32nd among equity partners for compensation.

Of course, lots of firms have other factors besides billables and origination that go into making up partner compensation, including client relationships and the dollar amount the firm was able to collect. And a source familiar with the firm notes Proskauer is not a strictly “eat what you kill” firm. That same source with details about the case also revealed that Doe’s 2016 compensation was higher than the average equity partner compensation.

Doe goes on to allege that after she complained, she was shunned by other members of the partnership:

[A]t a Partners’ luncheon, [an unnamed partner] turned his shoulder and pushed his right elbow at her chest, blocking Plaintiff from approaching him in front of other partners. This public shunning left Plaintiff feeling shaken, embarrassed, and isolated.

The firm has responded immediately and with plenty of gusto. They called the suit “meritless” and swung out at Doe’s potential motives for filing the complaint:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The plaintiff offered little complaint about her compensation until just a few months ago, when her business began to decline dramatically and she apparently became fearful that her compensation might be reduced. Instead of seeking to rebuild her practice, she sought to squeeze a massive payout from our firm in exchange for her rapid departure and an agreement not to weaponize her blatantly inaccurate charges. This action resulted only when we refused to capitulate to such questionable tactics.

We will show that her complaint is riddled with situations that never occurred, statements that were never made and accusations contradicted by the facts.

The plaintiff left each of her two prior firms after just four years and just completed her fourth with ours. That might be her view of partnership. It is not ours.

They also noted how high her salary was within her practice group (5th out of 49 partners in the group).

In the Law.com [article](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202786137827/Partner-Hits-Proskauer-with-50-Million-Gender-Bias-Suit) about this lawsuit, Scott Flaherty notes that there are only two women partners in the D.C. office, Connie Bertram, head of the D.C. Labor & Employment practice, co-head of the Whistleblowing & Retaliation Group, and head of the Government Contractor Compliance Group; and Ann Ashton, a securities and white-collar defense partner. However, only Bertram’s list of [awards and recognitions on the firm’s website](http://www.proskauer.com/professionals/connie-bertram/) lines up with those cited by Doe in the complaint. Additionally, Bertram’s [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/connie-bertram-8477277/) indicates she has been a partner at three Biglaw firms for just about four years each.

There are certainly benefits to suing as a “Jane Doe,” which could encourage others who are fearful their reputations may be put through the ringer should they come forward with similar allegations. However, given the amount of unredacted details provided in the complaint, it takes only a few minutes to connect the readily available dots. Indeed, Doe’s attorney — [David Sanford](https://sanfordheisler.com/team/david-sanford/), who’s also representing Kerrie Campbell in her suit against Chadbourne & Parke (coincidentally, Proskauer is representing Chadbourne in that case) — told Law.com, “The complaint is rich with detail. Some of the detail is redacted and at some point down the road it will get un-redacted.”

Given the amount of vitriol the parties seem to have towards each other, the case is likely to continue to have plenty more twists and turns for us to follow.

# Biglaw Staff Attorney Pleads Guilty To Child Pornography Charges

It’s not often that we write about Biglaw attorneys who have been charged with sex crimes involving child pornography, but when we do, it’s simply revolting. Today, we have news about a Paul Weiss staff attorney who recently pleaded guilty to kiddie porn charges, specifically, distributing videos of child sex abuse.

[Jason Mark Sims](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-sims-bb293115/), who received his law degree in 2009 from the University of the District of Columbia School of Law and his Tax LL.M. in 2010 from Boston University School of Law, was caught after he traded emails with an undercover FBI agent in response to an ad the agent placed on Craigslist. Sims had arranged to meet the undercover agent in the hope of sexually abusing the agent’s purported 10-year-old daughter. They never wound up meeting, but Sims instead sent the agent links to videos of girls as young as 4 years old being sexually abused, which are described in disturbing detail in the agent’s affidavit.

Sims also exchanged messages and videos with the undercover agent on the Kik messaging service, under the username “Bartleby.” — and he even had the gall to have some of these discussions from the Paul Weiss office in D.C. From the affidavit in support of the criminal complaint against Sims:

This is an excerpt from a conversation Sims had with the undercover agent on August 26, 2016, after viewing a photo of the agent’s purported 10-year-old daughter, while he was working at Paul Weiss:

Sims: Wow dude. Awesome. I’m terrified though.

A Paul Weiss spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment as to Sims’ status at the firm. [Paul Weiss’ website notes](https://www.paulweiss.com/careers/lawyers/staff-attorneys) that staff attorneys are hired on an as-needed basis to three-month contracts that are “renewable depending on their performance and the needs of the assignment.” Emails sent to Sims’ personal and work accounts went unreturned by the time of this story.

Sims faces a mandatory minimum sentence of five years and up to a maximum of 20 years in prison. He’s set to be sentenced on December 1, 2017.

(AFP OUT)

Every client deserves competent representation. This is a bedrock principle of legal practice. It’s as close as lawyers come to an article of faith. Lawyers defending the very worst in our society is what makes our society one of the very best. Defending the indefensible is one of the highest callings of the lawyer.

For those who believe in the rule of law, providing competent representation for murderers or rapists seems like a no-brainer. Representing Donald Trump, and his cohorts, feels worse, somehow. I know that sounds horribly partisan, but I don’t mean it to be. From the perspective of the “rule of law,” helping Donald Trump and the Trump administration subvert the rule of law feels like an entirely different ethical quandary than helping an alleged murderer avail himself to the rule of law.

At what point are lawyers complicit in Trump’s attempts to destabilize American democracy?

It’s an issue that firms like Jones Day and Morgan Lewis are getting asked about, a lot.

Politico [reports](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/politico-playbook-jeff-sessions-john-kelly-236741) that [The Wallace Global Fund](http://wgf.org/), a good-government group, has fired Morgan Lewis as its legal counsel.

“Complicit” is the word of the day here. We probably have [Saturday Night Live to thank for that](http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/complicit/3483871?snl=1).

Speaking of Ivanka Trump, the lawyer who is helping her evade obfuscate comply with ethics rules is taking heat for representing the First Daughter and her husband, Jared Kushner.

Thing is, that lawyer is WilmerHale attorney [Jamie Gorelick](https://www.wilmerhale.com/jamie_gorelick/). In a universe where Hillary Clinton wins, Jamie Gorelick is probably our Attorney General. [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/ivanka-trump-lawyer-jamie-gorelick-clintons-236445) has a story on the flak she’s taking for representing “the enemy”:

Gorelick sees herself as part of a time-honored Washington tradition of well-respected lawyers representing clients from the opposite party. Two of President Bill Clinton’s chiefs of staff, Mack McLarty and Erskine Bowles, turned to Arthur Culvahouse, former White House counsel under Ronald Reagan, to oversee their ethics arrangements, as did members of President Barack Obama’s administration.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In normal times, Gorelick’s representation wouldn’t raise eyebrows. But these aren’t normal times. There is the feeling that Ivanka and Kushner are trying to use Gorelick’s credibility to help them disguise what is a patently nepotistic status in the government. Why would Gorelick, or really any decent person, allow themselves to be used by these people?

I think the answer is: this is what lawyers do. Jamie Gorelick, Sheri Dillon, they have paying clients. When you have clients, you work on their behalf. That’s the job. Lawyers are kind of like prostitutes — no offense to prostitutes — you pay them, and they do what you want. They serve an important, and dare I say honorable, role in society. It’s not always pretty, but if you need them they are there for you, provided you can pay the fee.

Moreover, good luck hiring a firm like Morgan Lewis or WilmerHale or anybody of “Biglaw” size who has a client roster full of people and organizations you agree with. It’s hard enough to figure out what fast food you can eat while maintaining your political ideology. Don’t even try to the Biglaw firm that only represents people you like. It’s never going to happen.

The only lawyers I’m willing to call “complicit” in the horror show on Pennsylvania Avenue are the ones who actually work for the White House. [Don McGahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_McGahn), that guy is complicit. He left his lawyer job to serve President “Twitler.” That’s different. Good lawyers tell their clients to turn themselves in, McGahn is the kind of lawyer who offers to drive the getaway car.

Morgan Lewis and WilmerHale, they’re just providing services for paying clients. Lawyers do that every day. And we thank them for their service.

A typical reduction is in the range of 30 percent. I will be surprised if at least 80 percent of the top 200 firms in the U.S. have not made such a move by April 15th.

McKenna says that quite a few firms have already reduced partner draws.

# Saturday Morning Special: Another Firm Raises Compensation, But Do They Beat The Market?
## Are these raises worth getting excited on a Saturday?

No rest for the weary or the wicked — which turns out to be a good thing for Baker Botts associates. Even though it is a Saturday, the firm went ahead and announced raises for its associates, which parallel the Cravath scale, set out on Monday.



The raises apply to all U.S. associates, and the summer class as well, which is what we’ve come to expect for firms matching the market. The numbers don’t look exactly the same, as Baker Botts sets compensation based on levels, rather than class years. But according to our tipsters, the result was in line with the market:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
As expected. $20, $25, $30 and $35k raises for each of levels 1-4 respectively. Keeps same amount with respect to NY scale as before.

Whether or not this is better than the Cravath scale overall is a bit of a mixed bag. One tipster noted that at Baker Botts, as a member of the class of 2012, they will now be making $260,000, while a member of the same class on the Cravath scale would be making $235,000. You’ll notice, however, that associate compensation tops out at $305,000 rather than $315,000.

We are covering this story as market conditions develop, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

This is one of the oldest cases on my docket… It’s time to get going. [The SEC has got] to swallow hard and decide.

— U.S. District Judge Valerie E. Caproni, [telling the Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.law360.com/articles/964381/judge-pushes-sec-to-come-to-terms-with-dewey-duo) they need to decide whether to pursue their case against former[ Dewey & LeBoeuf](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/dewey-leboeuf/) executives Joel Sanders and Stephen DiCarmine for their roles in the Biglaw firm’s [demise](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/02/dewey-have-a-confirmed-chapter-11-plan-yes-we-do/). The pair has [already been tried](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/did-disgruntled-partners-lead-to-the-dewey-prosecution/) — [twice](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/dewey-know-why-theres-a-retrial/) — on criminal charges related to Dewey’s swan song.[ Earlier this year](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/holy-crap-dewey-know-who-was-convicted-of-felony-charges/), Sanders was convicted on those fraud charges and DiCarmine was acquitted. Judge Caproni gave the SEC under December 1 to make a decision on their case in order to facilitate potential settlements with Sanders and DiCarmine.

If you are reading this, we certainly don’t need to tell you about the pressure law firms are facing to work more efficiently these days. 

Replacing low-value work that clients don’t want to pay for with high-value work that they do is now integral to a law firm’s success.

While some firms are doubling down on tactics that worked in the past, other firms are finding innovative ways to leverage software to improve the efficiency of their service delivery.

At the same time, though, many celebrated legal technologies have had disappointing results after considerable investments in expensive implementations. 

Legal transaction management (LTM) is a return to the basics of using software to augment human efforts. 

It provides a structured workflow that lets transactional lawyers automate away mundane, error-prone tasks they currently do manually.

But even the best technology products require a coordinated rollout strategy to ensure they flourish.  

In this white paper excerpt, our friends at iManage provide some do’s and don’ts for effectively rolling out new legal transaction management (LTM) software at your law firm, in order to recognize the value immediately

Read on for a few of these tips, and fill out the form below to download the full white paper, “A Complete Guide to Legal Transaction Management.”

DO – Get practitioners to try it on a live deal 

LTM tools have a lot of features, and it can be tempting to dive in head first. By starting out with a simpler transaction, or even just using the tool to create a closing book for a deal that is already closed, lawyers can take time to learn the intricacies of the tool in a lower pressure environment. 

Getting that first transaction under your belt is key. In a deal team context, it may also make sense to initially restrict interaction with the tool to junior lawyers, paralegals, or assistants so that they do the heavy lifting. This aligns nicely with the incentives as these parties stand to gain the greatest efficiency rewards from LTM.  

DO – Support users with internal resources 

When users do take the plunge and try LTM out, make sure you have internal support available for them. A lawyer may not feel comfortable calling up a vendor support line and asking questions that include details about the unique characteristics of their deal. Identify an internal champion who can become the expert.  

They can provide training on demand and be an ad hoc resource for answering questions as they come up during live deals. In addition to this, take the time to establish an intranet page. Populate this with a quick tip sheet, some recorded internal training sessions, links to the vendor’s support resources, and key contacts in the firm for the project. 

DON’T – Use mock deals to evaluate LTM 

Legal transactions can be chaotic. Requirements can shift hour by hour, requiring the closing checklist to be substantially revised, documents to be redrafted and signature pages to be repackaged. 

In order for LTM to be a viable solution for your deal teams, you have to prove that the software is flexible enough to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances. If lawyers cannot use an LTM tool with a real closing they will not truly realize the value it creates. 

Watching an LTM tool save 30 minutes creating signing packages in a simulated environment can give a less than impactful impression. Saving 30 minutes on the eve of a closing in a high stakes legal transaction is a completely different story. After a client thanks you for sending a closing book the day after closing, we bet you’ll never consider going back to the old way. 

DON’T – Restrict usage to a handful of lawyers 

We’ve found that, within the average law firm, only 10% of lawyers will be willing to take a risk on using a new technology for the first time. While some lawyers have a reputation for this, the people who are the most excited to try out LTM are often surprising. 

The success of your rollout rides on these individuals, so it’s important that you find them. The best way to do this is to cast the net wide and see who comes out of the woodwork. Too often, a highly targeted rollout ends up failing on a mistaken assumption that a particular group has the time and interest to try out a new technology. 

Demoing the application to the broadest group of users early on will quickly surface the most interested individuals, allowing you to then focus all your efforts on making them successful.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

According to Above the Law’s New Normal report, associates at which tier of Am Law firm are the happiest with their compensation and among the happiest with their caliber of work and career options?

Hint: On the other hand, associates at these Biglaw firms are also the least satisfied with work-life balance and the most convinced that management doesn’t care about their well-being.

See the answer on the next page.

Bruce Stachenfeld

What a fool I am to write about this when I could just keep my mouth shut and take the safe route, rather than risk being misconstrued. However, I am supposed to be talking about “reinventing” the law business, and the law business is a personal service business in which the name of the game is to knit a team of people together to achieve a common purpose — so I am not going to take the easy way out.

Of late, it seems like every time I pick up the newspaper, I read with dismay, horror and sadness what is going on around us. Each week it seems like we hear of another mass shooting, another terrorist attack, or some other horrific and senseless act of violence. We live in a world with lots of amazing – and good – people, and yet things seem to be going so very wrong. There are many sides to what is happening – and I am being careful not to advocate a position here. There are many thoughts about what is causing these things to happen, and it seems like there is no solution, which makes me – and presumably others – feel frustrated, upset, helpless and depressed. At least that is how I feel.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
So took a little time to think about this from two perspectives…

First perspective – as far as solving the country’s or the world’s problems – I don’t have any solution. I have ideas as to what “we” should do, but when it comes right down to it I have no influence on the hundreds of millions of people who live and work all over the country, and even less impact on the rest of the world.

Second perspective – as far as my law firm goes – I have 100 people who work at my firm. Here I can do something for sure. I can make it 1000% clear to everyone at my firm that we are going to make value judgments about people based solely on who they are and what value they contribute to the Firm, rather than what they look like, what religion they practice, or their sexual orientation. I can also make it clear that, as a Firm, we will only tolerate people who have respect for one another (and the differences that we each possess). I believe we already do this exceptionally well at [Duval & Stachenfeld](http://www.dsllp.com/), and we can continue to do that.

If I think about the first perspective, it leaves me cold and saddened and even afraid – I am like Forrest Gump – a petal in the wind. I feel like no matter what I do, I have no material ability to have any positive effect on anything.

However, if I think about the second perspective, it makes me optimistic about the future and my role in it. I know that regardless of what is happening in the outside world, my 100 colleagues and I – together – will be able to control those things we can control and create a safe and welcoming environment for all within our little law firm.

Now I wonder – being a bit wistful – if other companies and organizations try to do the same thing that we are doing at D&S, then this might be able to create a ripple effect that will have a positive effect on the outside world. Maybe this solution to the second perspective will have a positive effect on the first perspective.

To conclude – neither I – nor all of us at D&S – can control events outside of D&S, but we at D&S can certainly do our best to lead ourselves internally in a way we can be proud of and, to the extent anyone else is watching, lead by example.

# Balancing Legal Ethics With Rapid AI Innovation
## The promised efficiency gains offered by these tools come with their own set of challenges, including doubts over result accuracy and concerns about client confidentiality.

There’s no doubt about it — we’ve entered the generative artificial intelligence (AI) age and advancements are occurring at a rapid clip. Whether you follow technology news or not, you’ve likely encountered many recent headlines about the release of new generative AI products.

The vast majority of legal technology generative AI products (50-plus companies and counting) are in beta, but just this week two legal technology companies announced the general release of generative AI tools into their products.

On Tuesday, [NetDocuments](https://www.netdocuments.com/), a company that provides document management software, [announced](https://www.netdocuments.com/press-releases/netdocuments-patternbuilder-max-globally-available) the global rollout of PatternBuilder Max. This new generative AI capability includes nine out-of-the-box apps designed to automate legal workflows involving documents. Key apps include summarize, draft, timeline, translate, and compare.

On Wednesday, LexisNexis announced the general availability of Lexis+ AI for U.S. customers. According to the [press release](https://www.lexisnexis.com/community/pressroom/b/news/posts/lexisnexis-launches-lexis-ai-a-generative-ai-solution-with-hallucination-free-linked-legal-citations), the generative AI solution “features conversational search, intelligent legal drafting, insightful summarization, and document upload capabilities.”

The rapid release of both of these products is indicative of the general demand and thirst for access to legal generative AI technology. I’ve been covering the intersection of law and technology for nearly two decades, and I have never seen legal professionals express this level of interest in an emerging technology. Every time I speak about this topic, the room is packed with attendees who are incredibly attentive and curious about generative AI and how they can use it in their law firms.

Not surprisingly, one of the primary blockers when it comes to lawyers embracing tools like ChatGPT is legal ethics rules. The promised efficiency gains offered by these tools come with their own set of challenges, including doubts over result accuracy and concerns about client confidentiality. In the absence of clear ethical guidance, adoption by lawyers is anything but straightforward.

Fortunately, ethics committees in several states are already hard at work on these issues. For example, in July, the New York State Bar Association announced that it was forming a task force to address emerging issues related to artificial intelligence. A few weeks later, the Texas State Bar also disclosed the formation of a group that would “examine the ethical pitfalls and practical uses of AI and report back within the year.” In May, the California Bar created a committee tasked with examining the impact of AI on the profession.

Most recently, the Florida Bar [threw its hat into the ring](https://www.floridabar.org/the-florida-bar-news/proposed-advisory-opinion-on-lawyers-and-law-firms-use-of-generative-artificial-intelligence/), sharing the Board Review Committee on Professional Ethics’ plans to consider drafting a proposed advisory opinion at the direction of the Florida Bar Board of Governors resulting from an inquiry by the Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tools and Resources.  The committee is seeking comments from Bar members on the following questions that may be considered in the opinion:

1) Whether a lawyer is required to obtain a client’s informed consent to use generative AI in the client’s representation;

2) Whether a lawyer is required to supervise generative AI and other similar large language model-based technology pursuant to the standard applicable to non-lawyer assistants;

3) The ethical limitations and conditions that apply to a lawyer’s fees and costs when a lawyer uses generative AI or other similar large language model-based technology in providing legal services, including whether a lawyer must revise their fees to reflect an increase in efficiency due to the use of AI technology and whether a lawyer may charge clients for the time spent learning to use AI technology more effectively;

4) May a law firm advertise that its private and/or in-house generative AI technology is objectively superior or unique when compared to those used by other lawyers or providers; and,

5) May a lawyer instruct or encourage clients to create and rely upon due diligence reports generated solely by AI technology?

As we head into a new era where AI innovation and legal ethics may collide, it’s clear that we’re in for some interesting times. Generative AI tools are already here and lawyers are using them, despite the unsettled ethical landscape.

Demand for these tools is high, and so are the stakes when it comes to faulty compliance. It’s anyone’s guess how the ethical chips may fall, but one thing is certain: the collision of AI and legal ethics will make for some compelling developments that could significantly impact the future of legal practice.

# Am Law Top 20 Firm Antes Up With Special Bonus Bucks For Associates, Counsel
## Yet another firm is offering big-time bonuses.

It’s another spring day, and Davis Polk is admiring its crown as the [new Biglaw compensation leader](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/) as peer firms line up to match the incredibly generous special bonus bucks the firm decided to hand out to its associates and counsel.

Which firm is the latest to fall in line and offer up bountiful bonuses in recognition of its attorneys’ hard work?

That would be Paul Weiss. Chairman Brad Karp sent a memo yesterday evening detailing all of the hard work associates and counsel had put in during 2020 and beyond, including work for their communities in the firm’s coronavirus relief center and for its racial justice, social justice, and voter-protection initiatives. “Thanks to your efforts,” Karp wrote, “we helped make the world more safe, more equitable and more just – and we still have lots more work to do.”

# T14 Law Professor Goes To White Nationalism Conference And Says White Nationalist Things And Somehow Still Has A Job
## Amy Wax spoke to 'national conservatives' about immigration and you can imagine what she said.

Every few months, Amy Wax finds her way into the spotlight. For years, the Penn Law professor has doggedly pursued her 15 minutes of fame by delivering a contrived song and dance that she can convert into a 5-minute hit on Tucker Carlson — the black tar heroin for insecure narcissists who measure their intellectual currency in cable news airtime instead of peer-reviewed scholarship[[1]](#f1) — to complain about the politically correct campus culture that’s “out to get her” simply because “she harbors different ideas” that are “a jumble of racist stereotypes.” And like any junkie who’s enabled at every turn, Wax finds a way to raise the stakes every time, spouting more and more outrageous nonsense in her desperate bid for attention.

Every single time Wax pops up to tie Penn Law’s reputation to her quackery, the school has shrugged its shoulders, preferring to treat Wax like the institution’s crazy, tenured aunt. There’s always another excuse to be made for Wax’s continued employment. A school donor threw a temper tantrum and [stepped down from the board of trustees](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/penn-trustee-resigns-in-defense-of-amy-waxs-god-given-right-to-make-up-false-claims-about-students/) when the school finally took the prudent step of pulling Wax off of 1L duties, forcing the school to sheepishly step back from any more substantial response to Wax’s tripe.

But perhaps we can all agree that wherever the line is, “speaking at a white nationalism conference” should be across it.

Yes, Amy Wax is at it again, appearing at a white nationalism conference — labeled a “national conservatism” conference, in a parallel to “national socialism” so clumsily transparent that it would be laughed out of the Black Mirror writing room — and arguing, as detailed in an excellent Vox write up, that what America needs are more white people:

In a panel on immigration, University of Pennsylvania law professor Amy Wax claimed that immigrants are too loud and responsible for an increase in “litter.” She explicitly advocated an immigration policy that would favor immigrants from Western countries over non-Western ones; “the position,” as she put it, “that our country will be better off with more whites and fewer nonwhites.” (She claims this is not racist because her problem with nonwhite immigrants is cultural rather than biological.)

You can almost hear the dulcet tones of Jeff Foxworthy: “If you say America needs more white people because everyone else are garbage people… you might be a white supremacist.” And in a vain effort to cut off the comical dipshits who always hunt and peck their way into defending her after these articles, white hoods aren’t required to be a white supremacist. All that’s required is the belief that white people hold superiority over everyone else for whatever reason. There may not be a more textbook example of white supremacy than Wax’s quoted remarks arguing that European “culture” is superior to all others. In a sense, she’s technically correct to draw the distinction that she’s not being “racist” when her claims aren’t rooted in biology — but it’s “white supremacist” in either case.

Wax’s antics have made her an Above the Law All-Star in all the horrible ways that status implies. She’s written rambling, evidence-free screeds about how [America was better when white men kept everyone else in their place](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/law-professors-say-white-50s-culture-is-superior-other-racist-stuff/). She’s [bald-faced lied about the academic achievements of black students at Penn](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/professor-declares-black-students-rarely-graduate-in-the-top-half-of-law-school-class/). She tried to newsjack the Kavanaugh hearings by popping off about how [Dr. Christine Blasey Ford should have “held her tongue.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/10/law-school-professor-says-dr-ford-should-have-held-her-tongue-in-latest-embarrassment-to-her-school/)

Wax’s critics often fall into her trap by trying to denounce her barely coherent sputterings as though she’s got “wrong thoughts,” only feeding her narrative that there’s some shadowy “thought police” out there. It’s “PC culture run amok,” she’ll argue while mic’d up on Fox News, and that’s the coin of the realm over there.

In reality, Wax doesn’t display “wrong thoughts” so much as a complete absence of thought. She’s not a “rogue academic,” she’s a laughing stock who spends her days dragging Penn’s reputation through the mud for her own self-aggrandizement. She’s a charlatan. She should be fired not for what she believes but for her failure to adhere to even the most superficial of academic standards while making easily debunked claims in public.

Tenure and the academic freedom it affords is critical to building a functional academy. But Wax isn’t an academic. She isn’t producing statistics-heavy research papers or heavily footnoted think pieces advancing upon existing scholarship — she’s peddling anecdotes and innuendo and trading on the goodwill of Penn Law’s reputation.

Penn would do itself a service in cutting ties with her immediately. They’ll end up getting blasted on Fox News for it. But just wait 15 minutes and Wax’s moment will, as it always does, pass.

[ [1]](#reff1) Not that law professors are “peer-reviewed” per se, but even if a bunch of 3Ls are the ones extending the invitation to publish in a law review, the decision to afford a particular work academic weight when it comes to the job market or tenure comes from faculty peers reviewing the work. At the end of the day, academics are still writing for their peers even in law’s unorthodox system.

# The Biglaw Firm Defending The Catholic Church
## The sexual abuse allegations out of Pennsylvania have attracted a major Biglaw firm.

If you’ve been paying attention to the news at all over the last week, you’ve surely heard about the [Pennsylvania grand jury report](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/grand-jury-report-about-catholic-priest-abuse-pennsylvania-shows-church-ncna900906) outlining the sexual abuse of thousands of victims at Catholic dioceses across Pennsylvania. Much has been made of Cardinal Donald Wuerl’s role as the former bishop of Pittsburgh, where he allegedly failed to remove priests accused of abuse from their ministries.

Now, he’s lawyered up.

According to a [report](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2018/08/15/as-sexual-abuse-scandals-mount-dc-cardinal-turns-to-jones-day/) by Law.com, Wuerl has tapped Biglaw giant Jones Day to represent him on matters relating to the grand jury report:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In confirming Jones Day’s representation of Wuerl on issues involving the grand jury, Wuerl spokesman Ed McFadden added that Jones Day had previously represented the cardinal on other matters. The firm worked with the Archdiocese of Washington general counsel Kim Viti Fiorentino on a settlement relating to Zubik v. Burwell, which involved the U.S. Health and Human Services Department’s mandate for employers to provide contraceptives under the Affordable Care Act that the Catholic Church found morally objectionable.

This isn’t the first time that Wuerl has worked with Jones Day. The partners he’s worked with previously on other legal matters include former partner and current solicitor general Noel Francisco and some other heavy hitters:

The lawyers now representing Wuerl were not immediately made known, but in prior matters involving the Archbishop of Washington the Catholic Church has turned to Jones Day partners Eric Dreiband and David Raimer, and then-partner Noel Francisco, now serving as U.S. solicitor general. Francisco was part of the Jones Day team representing the Catholic Church’s challenge to the ACA.

Wuerl, through his in-house lawyer, has already been on the offensive regarding the grand jury report:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
[Archdiocese of Washington general counsel Kim Viti Fiorentino], Wuerl’s in-house lawyer, has attacked the Pennsylvania grand jury report and its depiction of Wuerl. In an interview with her archdiocese’s weekly newspaper published Tuesday, Fiorentino said the investigatory process and resulting report, “narrowly targeted the Catholic Church in six dioceses in Pennsylvania and was generated in a process that suffered from significant legal flaws.”

He even has a website set up, TheWuerlRecord.com, to tell his side of the story. We’ll see if this aggressive strategy changes now that Jones Days is on board.

(via YouTube)

While many conservatives have kept their heads down while Justice Thomas suffers the slings and arrows of the outrageous consequences of [his own ethical lapses](https://www.propublica.org/events/clarence-thomas), his former clerk decided to take a turn justifying [half-a-million dollars in gifted vacations](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/paragon-of-virtue-clarence-thomas-has-been-given-millions-of-dollars-in-value-off-the-record-and-it-totally-hasnt-impacted-his-judging-not-one-bit-nope/) and having a right-wing donor [house a jurist’s mother rent-free](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/appearance-of-bribery-political-megadonor-wants-us-to-believe-he-bought-and-improved-justices-moms-house-off-the-record-because-of-history-or-something/) while failing to disclose it for years despite [the incredibly explicit language of the statute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/13104).

It’s not an easy fact pattern to square with, you know, [the law](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/04/clarence-thomas-harlan-crow-doj-congress-roberts.html). But where there’s a will, there’s [an incredibly disingenuous way](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/fifth-circuits-ho-defends-justice-thomass-ethics-in-speech):

“Citizens deserve a government they can believe in. So I warmly welcome any good faith discussion about how to strengthen ethics in government,” Ho said in prepared remarks. “But we should apply the highest ethical standards, not hypocritical double standards.”

What the f**k does that even mean?

Because even if there were double standards at play here, he’s saying that taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in value and failing to comply with basic financial disclosure laws is not covered by “the highest ethical standards” somehow? Any “hypocritical double standards” could only implicate others, never absolve Thomas — at least without invoking the “well, Jamie’s mom let’s her do it” doctrine. And I don’t think that was recognized by the Framers.

Also, the thing about “double” standards is that both behaviors have to be like in style or substance. What is Ho citing for this?

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Ho pointed to a [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/131-federal-judges-broke-the-law-by-hearing-cases-where-they-had-a-financial-interest-11632834421) report that found more than 130 federal judges heard cases in which they or a family member owned stock in one of the involved companies, saying the report “did not accuse all of those judges of actual corruption.”

That report determined that a whole bunch of judges failed to recuse themselves when a financial conflict existed. Some of those conflicts were more tenuous than others. Some held stock in the companies directly, while others just had family members with stock. At least one judge didn’t own stock throughout the case, while a financial advisor purchased some during the matter possibly without her knowledge. In almost all of the cases in the report, the amount in question totaled less than $50K, which is a weak comparison to half a million in direct gifts.

But also… you know who did say these were all serious ethical lapses and that some amount to actual corruption? [WE DID!!!](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/chief-justice-wants-you-to-know-he-has-the-utmost-contempt-for-you/)

Go ahead and flog the straw argument this is all fine because some vast left-wing conspiracy excused ethical breaches from Obama-appointees, but we were right f**king here writing that some of these judges deserved to be impeached.

“That’s an important distinction to draw. Because there’s a big difference between actual corruption and the appearance of corruption,” Ho said.

Avoiding the appearance of impropriety is the guiding maxim of the profession, but all right, dude.

If some future Republican administration nominates Judge Ho to the Supreme Court, I hope someone on the Judiciary Committee zeroes in on this remark as uniquely disqualifying. The highest court in the land cannot be populated with people who think that judges “just appearing corrupt” makes for a viable justice system. The justice system only works if the public generally has faith that judges aren’t corrupt. “Appearance” is just as bad if the judges are feeding it through their actions.

Ho said Thomas wasn’t the only justice to take trips that were sponsored by individuals or organizations that don’t have interests pending before the court, but that hasn’t been enough to trigger recusal.

One, it probably should be. Two, Judge Ho knows other justices took trips… because they disclosed them. Maybe transparency cures these breaches and maybe it doesn’t, but there’s not even an attempt out of this guy to justify concealing this. As an advocacy for Thomas, Ho’s remarks amount to a non-sequitur.

Even Thomas made up some argle-bargle about [his friends telling him it wasn’t a problem](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/thomas-responded-to-his-paper-trail-of-law-breaking-with-my-friends-said-it-was-okay-we-should-expect-better-of-our-judiciary/) and [not realizing that losses were covered by the statute](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/clarence-thomass-piss-ass-excuse-for-not-disclosing-megadonor-real-estate-sale/). Those, if true, would at least constitute defenses. Ho could have doubled-down on that! James Taranto at the Wall Street Journal wrote a blathering hagiography of Thomas’s poor upbringing to frame some warrantless claims that Thomas forgetting about hundreds of thousands in gifts [amounted to an honest mistake](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-truth-about-clarence-thomas-disclosures-propublica-georgia-harlan-crow-ethics-court-91cd21df) (wouldn’t growing up poor make him more cognizant of found wealth?). Ho might have at least tried the “noble oopsie” approach.

But instead, Judge Ho went in front of a microphone and said, “we need high ethical standards… like the ones we should’ve applied to people with $15K in stock” just forcing us all to ask: how does this help a judge getting $500K?

As hard as this may be to believe, somehow Justice Thomas was handling this better without Ho’s help.

The message I’m hearing from a lot of firms is that the sky isn’t falling. They’re not all positioned to potentially have to make tough decisions like layoffs.

— Summer Eberhard, a California-based recruiter at Major, Lindsey & Africa, in comments given to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/big-laws-extra-bonuses-hard-to-come-by-as-demand-hours-slide/), on how Biglaw firms are faring at year’s end, and whether additional layoffs ought to be expected in the months to come. As it turns out, firms that didn’t get as aggressively involved in the associate talent wars may actually be better off than their peers. “In some respects, they are better positioned because they’re either perfectly staffed or slightly understaffed,” she said.

# Courts Usually Shouldn't Be Angry Toward Lawyers Because Of Their Clients
## A lawyer’s job is difficult enough as it is, and attorneys have limited control over their clients.

Lawyers need to wear a number of different hats, and exercise varying skills, when practicing law. Attorneys of course need to conduct legal research and draft the appropriate legal papers so that a client’s interests are best served. Lawyers also need to serve as a conduit between their clients and the judicial system since clients are often not too skilled with the legal process. However, sometimes despite all of the best efforts of lawyers, clients do not satisfy their disclosure obligations, or do not show up for hearings on time, or commit other failures. Courts should not be angry toward a client’s lawyer in such instances since lawyers only have so much control over the acts of their clients.

When I was in Biglaw, I rarely had any communication with clients. Most of that firm’s clients were corporations, and the partners would usually coordinate with in-house personnel in order to satisfy obligations of a legal matter. Moreover, many of our clients had their own counsel who could be relied upon to timely provide information and materials needed to properly handle a legal matter.

However, when I left Biglaw and started working at smaller shops, I had much more contact with the clients whom I was serving. Many smaller clients do not have dedicated lawyers in house who can handle legal matters. Most smaller companies have one person who has many jobs — one of which is handling legal claims related to the company. In addition, when serving individuals, it is less likely that the client will have a legal background and understand the importance of procedures and deadlines during a litigation or transactional matter.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Over the course of litigation, attorneys need to constantly request that clients help them with information related to an issue or compiling documents related to a matter. In many instances, there is no way that lawyers can obtain such materials or information without the assistance of clients. If information or materials are not timely provided, adversaries can file motions against the party not providing materials, and the matter could be brought before a court.

I have attended numerous oral arguments and discovery conferences at which courts seem pissed off that materials or information have not been provided to date. However, likely because the attorney is present at the conference and the client is not, courts usually direct their anger at lawyers and not their clients. This is usually unfair. Of course, sometimes lawyers do not ask their clients for information or documents earlier in a matter, and this can delay an issue. However, most of the time, lawyers have contacted clients to obtain information and materials and clients have not provided responses either because they are too busy or do not understand the urgency of providing information or documents. It is of course fine for a court to ask an attorney what efforts have been undertaken to obtain the requested materials or information, but it is usually not fair to direct anger toward attorneys over the fact that information or materials have not been provided by clients to date.

At other parts of a case, lawyers need to produce their clients for deposition or testimony to be given at a hearing or at trial. It is usually a hassle to schedule a deposition or a client’s testimony at trial since clients have a lot of obligations and it is difficult to impart sometimes how important it is to be available for testimony. Usually, after significant back and forth, clients will agree to provide testimony at a given time and date.

Nevertheless, sometimes clients do not show up, even though the lawyer did everything in their power to remind the client of the testimony and where and when they should be present to provide such testimony. At court conferences, judges can sometimes be upset that clients did not show up for court conferences, and it is fine to be mad that lawyers wasted the court’s time and the time of other lawyers for not showing up to trial, a hearing, a deposition, or some other event during the litigation process. However, it almost never makes sense to be mad at a lawyer for such an issue since a lawyer has limited control over whether a client will show up to an event after they have been given notice about the situation. Nevertheless, in my experience, courts routinely scold lawyers when their clients miss depositions, court hearings, and the like, and unless this is a shortcoming by the lawyer in notifying the client of an event, this frustration is almost always misplaced.

In the end, a lawyer’s job is difficult enough as it is, and attorneys have limited control over their clients. As a result, courts should spare lawyers from their wrath at a client’s acts or omissions since attorneys have limited control over whether a client provides information, attends a hearing, or completes other steps over the course of a matter.

Our strategic desire to have a platform in the U.S. has long been public record. The challenge has been finding the right firm, particularly one that shares the same vision as us and is a strong cultural fit. In Sutherland, we have found that firm. Eversheds Sutherland will give each firm’s clients a truly global platform, including strong U.S. coverage. The feedback from colleagues and clients has been overwhelmingly positive, with many opportunities already identified, and we are very confident that this will be a great outcome for our clients and our people.

— Eversheds chief executive [Bryan Hughes](http://www.eversheds.com/global/en/who/people/index.page?person=en/Hughes_Bryan(822)), commenting on his firm’s [decision to merge](http://www.sutherland.com/NewsCommentary/Press-Releases/194955/Eversheds-and-Sutherland-Vote-to-Join-Forces) with Sutherland Asbill & Brennan. The firms’ discussions were first [announced in late November](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/law-firm-merger-mania-eversheds-and-sutherland-are-talking/), and two weeks later, both partnerships have agreed to merge. Eversheds Sutherland, the [combined firm](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/sutherland_and_eversheds_agree_to_merger), will have 2,300 lawyers and 61 offices in 29 countries.

(Flip to the next page to see an internal memorandum from [Mark Wasserman](http://www.sutherland.com/People/Mark-D-Wasserman), Sutherland’s managing partner, announcing the merger to the rest of the firm.)

# Partners At The Largest Biglaw Firms Are Billing At Super-High Rates
## That'll come in handy for their super-high paychecks.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

According to the latest LexisNexis CounselLink report, the average partner at the 50 largest law firms (i.e., those with 750 lawyers or more) billed at a rate that was what percentage higher than the average partner at the next tier of firms (i.e., those with 501-750 lawyers)?

Hint: As [noted](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/clients-complaining-law-firm-rates-inflation) previously, in 2022, the average partner billable rate increased by 4.5%. This is the largest annual percentage increase since CounselLink released its first report a decade ago.

# It's Good To Be An Elite Biglaw Firm -- Demand For Services Is Up
## Litigation leads the way!

[According to a new report](http://ask.legalsolutions.thomsonreuters.info/LEI-Peer-Monitor-Index-Q2-2018-Report) from Thomson Reuters, demand for law firm services (measured in hours billed) is up — at a higher rate in the second quarter of 2018 than in any other quarter during the past six years. The demand is up 1.4 percent, and when you look at the demand in just the Am Law 100, demand is up a noteworthy 3.2 percent.

As Law.com [reports](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/08/14/report-says-law-firm-demand-hit-new-heights-in-second-quarter/), it’s part of a larger trend where the Biglaw rich just keep getting richer:

[As has been the case](http://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/05/22/the-second-hundred-are-being-lapped-by-the-top-tier/) for the past few years, the country’s largest and most profitable firms, [the Am Law 100](http://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/04/24/the-2018-am-law-100/), experienced the [greatest growth in demand](http://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/05/14/demand-slips-rates-rise-as-legal-market-endures-uneven-first-quarter/), ratcheting up 3.2 percent. That compared to a 0.2 percent decline for the [Second Hundred](http://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/05/22/the-2018-am-law-200/) (the sixth consecutive quarter of Second Hundred demand declines) and 1.8 percent demand growth for [midsized firms](http://www.law.com/mid-market-report/).

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
This increase has largely been led by an increased demand for litigation. That’s a nice change of pace for that segment, which has underperformed in recent years:

Demand for litigation, [which grew 2.2 percent](http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/files/tr-lei-pmi_q2_2018.pdf), was higher than any other practice during the second quarter. For the year, litigation demand is up 0.6 percent, marking the first time since 2012 that demand for litigators’ time has been positive at the halfway point.

Also rising is the invoices sent to clients, known as worked billing rate. For the fourth quarter in a row, that metric is growing above 3 percent:

Worked billing rates—the invoices that firms send to clients—rose 3.4 percent in the second quarter, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of growth above 3 percent. Am Law 100 firms again led the way with 4.2 percent growth, compared to 2.8 percent growth for the Second Hundred and 3 percent growth for midsize firms.

Overall, it’s a story that’s getting increasingly familiar — things are good if you’re at the top of the Biglaw heap. But travel even a short amount down the rankings, and the landscape is more concerning.

# Learning In Unprecedented Times: Keeping Current With PLI
## PLI practically invented CLE over 80 years ago – and its commitment to flexible, online, on-demand programming has allowed the organization to adapt seamlessly to the pandemic era.

Change is constant in the legal profession. Even during an unprecedented pandemic, lawyers are expected to keep up with an evolving legal landscape as they deepen their practice, define their career goals, and deliver for clients. That’s where [Practising Law Institute (PLI)](http://bit.ly/2XvqVbd) comes in. For over eighty years, PLI has provided training and resources for lawyers at all stages of their careers. Craig Miller, PLI’s Interim President, provides an inside look at how the organization that practically invented CLE is responding to unprecedented times.

How did PLI come to be?

Imagine yourself a young lawyer in 1933. It’s the height of the Great Depression. FDR has just been sworn in as President and the first one hundred days of New Deal legislation occurs. Massive changes to the legal and regulatory landscape are underway, impacting banking, securities, agriculture, energy, and so much more. Court challenges will ensue. Overseas, Germany’s newly appointed Chancellor is Adolf Hitler.

That’s a blistering rate of change for lawyers to keep up with. Our founder, Harold P. Seligson, saw the need for those in the profession to keep learning long after they earned their JDs. And that’s a need we continue to meet to this day.

We do this by offering over 10,000 hours of [accredited continuing legal and other education programs](http://bit.ly/39ql3Fw) in a variety of formats; by publishing over 100 titles each year through our [PLI Press](http://bit.ly/3scVyAd) publishing division; and through other initiatives such as our online [One-Hour Briefings](http://bit.ly/2XypxEN) and our podcasts on [pro bono](http://bit.ly/2XsVVZm) and [securities law](http://bit.ly/38zsprj).

How has PLI adapted to serve customers during the COVID-19 pandemic?

For an octogenarian organization, PLI has always been quite progressive when it comes to serving our customers. Well before the pandemic, we saw that people needed more flexibility to attend our programs online and on their own schedules, so we have been producing live webcasts and online on-demand programming for years now. These capabilities have kept our CLE programs going seamlessly while everyone is remote. On the publishing side, because we knew that customers were unable to access books at their offices, we extended access to PLI PLUS so they could use these publications online.

Getting timely information to our customers – and the legal market as a whole – is always central to our mission. As soon as the pandemic materialized, our team worked relentlessly to provide essential COVID-19-related content and make it easily discoverable [on our website](http://bit.ly/2LqAN3o). I am also proud to note that PLI published the first in-depth book on the pandemic’s legal issues.

These days, lawyers who simply need to earn CLE credits have many options. What makes PLI different?

We’re a nonprofit, membership-based organization, so our business model is unique. Because we have such a strong reputation, we’re fortunate to attract a stellar volunteer faculty from preeminent law firms, corporate legal departments, law schools, the bench, the government, and more. They share our goal of strengthening the profession and the rule of law.

[Pro bono](http://bit.ly/3shFNrZ) is at the heart of our mission and we strongly believe in supporting practitioners who work to ensure access to justice. Our Members not only benefit from the wide array of programs we offer, but also help support the training that other lawyers and nonprofit groups use to advocate effectively for pro bono clients like disabled veterans, victims of natural disasters, and the indigent.

Our Members are a community – they come to us for more than just CLE credits, and we take our responsibility to them very seriously.

How can smaller law firms and individual practitioners take advantage of your offerings?

Our [membership model](http://bit.ly/2MXYEbr) is designed for firms of any size, location or practice area. [Privileged Members](http://bit.ly/39kIss4) get unlimited access to our CLE programs and learning resources for an annual fee. Our team handles all credit and compliance matters upfront and helps you monitor CLE credits and deadlines through our popular [My Credit Tracker tool](http://bit.ly/35vTqtC). For solo practitioners, we also offer Individual Memberships, which afford all of the above for a reasonable flat annual fee.

Many firms of all sizes also take advantage of our [PLI PLUS](http://bit.ly/2XtqpdB) online research database, which provides unlimited access to our full collection of treatises, course handbooks, legal forms, program transcripts, journals and answer books.

In addition, 501(c)(3) organizations that meet criteria can gain [Pro Bono Privileged Memberships](http://bit.ly/3qfzVO5), and scholarship applications are available to others seeking training.

Finally – what’s with the funny spelling of “practising”?

It’s not the style now, but the spelling was much more common in the ‘30s! I see it as a nod to the long and proud history of our organization – we always strive to innovate and grow, but we stay true to our roots and to our mission.

[](http://bit.ly/2LHuTL2)Practising Law Institute is a nonprofit learning organization dedicated to keeping attorneys and other professionals at the forefront of knowledge and expertise. PLI is chartered by the Regents of the University of the State of New York and was founded in 1933 by Harold P. Seligson. The organization provides the highest quality, accredited, continuing legal and professional education programs in a variety of formats which are delivered by more than 4,000 volunteer faculty including prominent lawyers, judges, investment bankers, accountants, corporate counsel, and U.S. and international government regulators. PLI publishes a comprehensive library of Treatises, Course Handbooks, Answer Books and Journals also available through the PLI PLUS online platform. The essence of PLI’s mission is its commitment to the pro bono community. View PLI’s upcoming live webcasts [here](http://bit.ly/2LHuTL2).

# How To Find Your Place In Biglaw
## The Unconventional Path To Biglaw Partnership With David Moreno.

David Moreno is a Biglaw partner, but that doesn’t mean he took the typical route to get there. From his early days as a lawyer in the Manhattan District Attorney’s office, to being a sports agent, to his time in a boutique law firm, to Biglaw partnership at Brown Rudnick, David’s seen the legal industry from a lot of different angles and he’s eager to share his experiences.

In the latest episode of The Jabot, I chat with David about diversity in Biglaw what are some of the challenges for recruiting and retention of diverse attorneys. We discuss his recent lateral move to Brown Rudnick, and what are some of the things he looked for in making that jump, and advice for others looking to move firms. We also talk about David’s passion for pro bono work and why is that so important for the legal industry.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

# Want To Mess With Opposing Counsel’s Head? Send Them A Letter From Hugelaw

If you are a frequent reader of ATL, you are no stranger to the term Biglaw.

Biglaw usually refers to those few hundred plus attorney firms. The ones law students clamor to join, but few are able to. The ones with starting salaries that make you blush and bonuses big enough to make you forget about your student loan debt, even if just for a day.

As in-house, I am used to dealing with Biglaw. Generally Biglaw makes for formidable opposing counsels, but I can often manage Biglaw internally without the need to retain the services of my own Biglaw.

Hugelaw, on the other hand, is a different story.

If you are not familiar with Hugelaw, it’s okay. I just coined the term.

Hugelaw is reserved for those few firms that are known even outside of the legal community. Those firms that count their attorneys by the thousands. That post annual revenues that rival companies in the tech industry. The firms that are able to make a seasoned in-house counsel doubt themselves on even the most routine of a matter.

This past week one of my associates entered my office looking as if he had seen a ghost. In his hand was a letter printed on the most brilliant white, and no doubt expensive, piece of paper I have seen. When he handed me the luxe piece of paper, the raised letterhead confirmed what I had feared, it was from a Hugelaw.

This Hugelaw had been retained to represent one of our business partners with whom we were currently working through, what I had believed, was a rather routine dispute. Sure the monetary value of the dispute was sizable, but nothing our hospital system had not seen before.

In fact, during our regular legal team meeting where we review our outstanding cases to assess our risk and potential need for outside counsel, our group collectively agreed this particular case could be dealt with internally.

It was a common fact pattern we had seen many times before. We had sufficient internal resources available to work on the dispute. And we were rather certain the law was comfortably on our side.

That is to say until we received the letter from Hugelaw.

As I read the letter, it was good, but it raised many of the arguments on similar fact patterns I had heard before. Yet despite my having heard the arguments before, this time I looked at them in a different light. And as I did, doubt began to creep in.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Was this case really different enough that my previous line of thought is wrong? Did I completely miss the mark on all of my previous legal analyses? Am I even a good lawyer?

After reviewing the letter I quickly assembled our legal team, showed them the letter, and asked if everyone stood by their initial analysis that we did not need outside help. Lo and behold, everyone in the room, myself included, thought that while we were still right, a second set of eyes from the outside couldn’t hurt.

A few days later we heard back from our outside help who confirmed our initial legal analysis, and with a renewed sense of confidence, we pressed forward and ultimately won, just as we had with many similar fact patterns before it.

So to the opposing party, well done. Although we ultimately prevailed, you made me pay an added premium in the form of my outside counsel who we hurriedly engaged out of some latent fear of your Hugelaw.

And to Hugelaw, even though you were unsuccessful, you were still worth your fees to your client. You caused us to second guess our analysis, cost us some sizable legal fees, and will certainly make me think twice the next time I find myself in a dispute with your client.

# The Pink Ghetto: It's Never 'Appropriate' To Ask If You Can 'Milk' A Breastfeeding Law Firm Associate
## Many women receive treatment like this regularly, and it's appalling.

Welcome back to [The Pink Ghetto](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-pink-ghetto/), a series where we take a look at some of the most appalling stories from one of the most sexist industries in the world: the legal profession. Today, we’ll be taking a look at the gender-based treatment that female lawyers receive in the workplace, ranging from being ignored to being sexually harassed. These are real emails that we’ve received from real readers.

When you see things like this happening, say something. Together, we can inspire the change necessary to stop this disturbing behavior from being so prevalent in the law.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
I work at a small firm on the east coast. I am a single mother, and I often need to take breaks to pump. The treatment I have received has been even worse since I had my child. My male colleagues used to proposition me, saying they’d never been with a pregnant woman before. Now, when they aren’t ignoring me or diverting work away from me, they’re asking if they can help milk me. How can they think this is appropriate behavior at a law firm?

My 1L summer, I worked at a prominent firm in a mid-size market (New Orleans). In my exit interview, I told the hiring partner that I was considering applying to firms in a larger market (Houston). I asked him about the discrepancy in the salaries and why I should choose to work for less pay. I was expecting his answer to be about firm culture, greater responsibility, lower cost of living, etc. Instead, he said the lower salary would make an excellent “second income.” I was single at the time. I did not accept the offer to return my 2L summer.

I am a young (under 30) female lawyer just finishing up her fourth year of practicing law in a tiny firm in a “flyover” state. The sexism I experience is simultaneously less overt but perhaps more severe: many opposing counsel just don’t acknowledge my existence. My boss, an older male attorney, and I work as a team and both of our names and email addresses appear on every pleading. I do the vast majority of the daily work, which means sending out a wide variety of emails and letters. And so often, the response is labeled, “To Mr. Boss,” and many times, they don’t even copy my email address on correspondence. Even though things go out signed by me, under my name, and from my email account, many opposing attorneys just deny my very existence and pretend that only Mr. Boss is involved in the case. The worst part is that this has real consequences — if I don’t get something, my boss doesn’t always notice, and then we have delays on issues that needed to be addressed immediately.

Last week, I was at an eight-hour mediation before retired a retired male judge in California. I am a nursing mother and excused myself twice to pump (which I cleared with JAMS beforehand) and he yelled at me both times for taking “breaks.” He then refused to talk to me and only spoke to the male attorney in the room, even though it was my client and I was the lead attorney on the case.

# Best Biglaw Firms For Women Who Actually Want To Make Partner
## Which Biglaw firms made the list?

Despite all of the heartache and work that go into achieving it, making partner remains the gold standard for most attorneys. And not just some service partner non-equity BS, but actual “real” partnership, of the equity variety. In recognition of the prevalence of that achievement, [Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/945767) has compiled a ranking of the very best law firms for women to become (equity) partners.

Their Glass Ceiling Report surveyed more than 300 firms on gender diversity to make their list, then ranked firms based on the ratio of female equity partners to male equity partners in the United States, and then broke them out into tiers depending on firm size.

In the biggest of Biglaw category, those with 600+ attorneys, the top 5 firms are:

1. Littler

1.  Fragomen, Del Rey
2. Kutak Rock
3. Holland & Hart
4. Carlton Fields
5. Marshall Dennehey

Strategies for ensuring women have a good shot at making partner differ from firm to firm, and include formal mentorship programs, increased flexibility on hours requirements for new moms, and increasing the visibility of women in leadership roles at the firm. The measures have been met with success, but there is still a difficult road ahead.

Of those on the Biglaw list, Fragomen has the highest percentage of female equity partners, at 40.7 percent. The rest of the ranked firms fail to break 30 percent female equity partners — and these are the best of the best. It’s clear that while these firms should be applauded for their efforts to increase gender diversity, there is still much to be done.

# Remember Your Firm's Special Counsel This Time Of Year
## Some counsel out there aren't seeing the big bucks that you might suspect.

From the vantage point of a lowly associate, counsel and income partners seem like they occupy a different compensation universe — and to some extent, that’s true! — but with senior associates bagging 100K+ bonuses, take a moment this Biglaw bonus season to remember all the counsel out there watching senior associates blow by them in comp right before the annual finish line.

This isn’t true of all counsel of course. Some firms reward special counsel with the top bonus tier, or provide some kind of off-grid individualized bonus commensurate with experience level. But many more are left out of the big bonus game entirely.

We write some version of this story every year, but it deserves to remain top of mind. Especially when you consider that at some firms this disparity takes on an additional problematic dimension as women and minority attorneys are often shunted into these roles to pad “partner” ranks for pitching clients but without sharing the equity pot of gold.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It may shock some associates out there who recognize the experience that talented counsel bring to the table, but counsel compensation ultimately comes down to the firm’s philosophy about bonuses. If bonuses are intended to reward attorneys for their value to the firm, counsel deserve massive payouts on a lot of levels. On straight up firm profitability, these are lawyers getting billed out at near partner-level rates while being paid as super-senior associates. That’s the best deal for a firm’s bottom line second only to the super-cheap first and second years billed out well beyond what their experience would dictate. Beyond the profitability, there’s also tremendous substantive value. There’s absolutely some 40 Act specialist out there who is downright essential to every deal but won’t make partner because clients don’t hire firms based on that expertise. For firms that approach bonuses with the “reward” model — whether they pay individualized or take a lockstep approach to spread the reward across the firm — counsel are going to be fine.

But to a lot of firms, bonuses are just a variable piece of maintaining market compensation. It’s less a reward than a necessity for firms committed to keeping pace with their peers in the never-ending battle for associate talent. At the point that an attorney has left the grid, the calculus changes. The attorney faces a difficult battle making partner at a peer firm. Taking a step down for another charge at the ring is an option, but probably entails a short-term comp cut and golden handcuffs are real. The bottom line is that in most cases the firm knows that they’ve got that senior attorney for the long-haul.

Not that it’s a terrible limbo to be in. Counsel are generally compensated better than associates with the exception of the most senior classes with bonuses putting them over the top. But not always. Tipsters tell us that [some firms even pay counsel below senior associate base salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/associates-get-raises-special-counsel-get-the-shaft/). Others pay counsel in the low $400Ks. Anarchy reigns in the world of counsel.

The point is, take a second to consider the plight of the attorneys you work with who have a decade or more of experience and have to watch cub attorneys make nearly as much as they do because market pressures trump merit. And, while you’re at it, take a moment to honestly assess your own career as an associate. Are you really on track to become a partner at your current firm? If not, would you be comfortable building your career there as counsel?

# Winter OCI Is Coming -- Let’s Keep It That Way

History is littered with examples of accidental discoveries or creations in times of great crisis that changed the world. Perhaps most famously, Scottish bacteriologist [Alexander Fleming](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1945/fleming/biographical/), studying influenza in 1928, leaves some Petri dishes uncovered while on vacation, and returns to discover mold that is the first step in the creation of penicillin. A bit of historical trivia that has almost assuredly been recounted to the vast majority of us over the last nine-plus months, most likely by parents or disapproving spouses who wished we would put on actual pants at some point, Shakespeare wrote King Lear while quite likely on [lockdown](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/22/shakespeare-in-lockdown-did-he-write-king-lear-in-plague-quarantine) due to an outbreak of the plague in 1606 — I recently binged Ted Lasso, so it is fair to say that both the Bard and I accomplished great things while stuck at home. And if Clarence Saunders had not been looking out of a train window at just the right moment to see a collection of little pigs struggle to get under a fence, the first full-service grocery store might not have been named [Piggly Wiggly](https://www.pigglywiggly.com/about-us), which might not seem to rise to the levels of curing infections or the greatest tragedy in the history of the written word, but the rhyming name provides a daily chuckle to a 5-and-a-half-year-old who sees the sign on the way to school.

Legal recruiting is not typically where one finds great innovation, accidental or otherwise. In fact, it is typically a staid affair. As nearly everyone who reads this website knows, likely firsthand, those who wish to start their legal career in Biglaw interview for a summer associate position at the beginning of their second year of law school, which will very likely result in an offer of permanent employment at the end of the subsequent summer. Thus obtaining a job roughly two years before it is set to commence. As I have discussed in this space before, such a system is completely absurd.  Whenever I try to explain to those outside of the legal profession that law students interview for jobs two years in advance based on grades accumulated from one-third of their time in law school, the response is relatively universal.

But despite the obvious insanity, this has been the system in place for decades and was seemingly set to continue for the foreseeable future. But 2020 had a funny way of disrupting all aspects of life, even the mundane ones. In response to the pandemic, the vast majority of American law schools, or at least the ones who give out grades — not that Yale Law School needs my advice, but perhaps a grading system would ensure that their graduates who go on to public notoriety possess an of understanding basic legal concepts such as [the First Amendment and to whom it applies](https://www.npr.org/sections/congress-electoral-college-tally-live-updates/2021/01/08/954777400/publisher-cancels-book-by-sen-hawley-citing-his-role-in-inciting-capitol-attack) — moved to a pass/fail system for the Spring 2020 semester. Being uncomfortable with making six-figure investments in second-year law students based on a single semester of grades, rather than the far more robust standard of two semesters, Biglaw firms worked with schools to push the Fall Recruiting cycle back to winter. So the Class of 2022 will have three semesters under their belt when they embark on 2L recruiting.

While on-campus interviews have yet to commence at a number of schools, the minds of many in the legal recruiting world are already looking toward next year. Much like I watch Kansas basketball [blowout Washburn](https://kuathletics.com/jayhawks-top-ichabods-in-home-opener/) in the fourth game of the season and think to myself, “well if Agbaji and Wilson come back next year, Clemence is a stud, and McCormack can stop being a spaz in the post, then maybe we will really have something in 2021-2022,” everyone on both the law school and law firm side are wondering if the fall recruiting cycle will return to its regular late-summer period later this year.  The assumption is that barring a continued botch in rolling out the COVID-19 vaccine, such a reversion to the norm will take place. I do not think it should.  My idea is simple, let us keep the 2L recruiting cycle in the winter, or even in the spring.

The reasons for incorporating the historical accident of 2020 into the legal recruiting going forward is quite simple, rather than basing massively consequential employment decisions on two semesters worth of law school, a permanent shift to the winter/spring would allow a third semester to be incorporated.  This might sound like a relatively minor change until you realize that that’s an additional 50% of law school that applicants will have completed. That’s 50% more grades that law firms can use to evaluate students, as well as 50% more time in law school for students to figure out what exactly they want to do with their J.D.

I was somewhat dubious that legal employers would be amenable to this calendar shift, but while not a nationwide survey, at the recent NALP Summer Outcomes Summit, I had a chance to float this idea by a couple of Biglaw recruiters, and the reaction was uniformly positive. Why? For the simple fact that more information, (i.e., another semester of grades), is better when evaluating job applicants. And it is not just a more fulsome GPA that firms can evaluate. At many schools, once a student finishes their first year, they have far greater choice in selecting their classes. These selections can evince a student’s career preference in a much clearer way than anything said in an interview. A 2L can say until they are blue in the face that they really want to be a transactional attorney, but if their elective course load is nothing but litigation courses, that illustrates a more accurate picture of future plans.

Anyone who has spoken to me about recruiting for more than a couple of minutes knows that how a proposal will impact law firms falls well below how it impacts law students, specifically Vanderbilt Law students, in my personal decision hierarchy. But making the calendar shift in 2L recruiting permanent would also benefit students by alleviating some pressure. Pandemic or no, the first year of law school is already difficult. It is not just the logistics of moving to a new city, finding a new place to live, etc., but in many cases students who have excelled academically their entire lives are being told to learn and write in an entirely new way. Added to those stressors are people like me telling these students that their academic performance the first-year of law school will have a profound impact on not only their near-term job prospects, but their entire legal career. It is no wonder that as the [American Bar Association](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/abanews/ThePathToLawyerWellBeingReportFINAL.pdf) recently summarized, “[l]aw students start law school with high life satisfaction and strong mental health measures. But within the first year of law school, they experience a significant increase in anxiety and depression.”  Anything that can be done to help alleviate student stress levels should be strongly considered, especially if the negatives are relatively few.

So what are the negatives or objections to keeping the pandemic schedule in place going forward? For those in the recruiting world, having to do the bulk of the scheduling and planning for interviews over the winter holiday season is definitely not ideal, but that can be easily remedied with some further tweaks to the calendar. Furthermore, the fall recruiting cycle had moved so far into the summer that callbacks were taking place before 2L classes commenced. Moving the process into the winter will undoubtedly create greater conflicts with class schedules. But, when I was going through OCI, all callbacks took place during classes, and the faculty dealt with it appropriately. If expectations are managed in advance, I do not foresee this being a big problem.

I think the biggest hesitation stems from the simple fact that permanently moving the fall recruiting cycle to winter/spring would be a seismic shift in this little corner of the legal world. Legal recruiting is a bit of a sclerotic institution that does not always welcome change. But as the great Theodore “Ted” Lasso tells the men of A.F.C. Richmond, “most of the time, change is a good thing. Now I think that’s what it is all about. Embracing change. Being brave.”


At one point in your life, you want the end of the night to take place at 4 a.m. on a random street corner, having just come out of your regular haunt, with Cat Power [serenading you](https://genius.com/Cat-power-empty-shell-lyrics). But eventually things change, and you shift to wanting the night to end at 10 p.m. with a slice of cake that [Claire Saffitz](https://www.instagram.com/csaffitz/?hl=en) just baked for you. Whether a winter/spring 2L legal recruiting calendar is more of a [Meyer lemon tart or a croquembouche](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/609892/dessert-person-by-claire-saffitz/) is a question I will leave to those with more discerning palates, but all I know is that New Year’s resolutions be damned, I want some.

In our polarized age, few things will garner more universal agreement than the fact that 2020 was a pretty terrible year — and a few days in, 2021 [ain’t looking that great either](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/06/us/trump-mob-capitol-building.html?name=styln-transition&region=TOP_BANNER&block=storyline_menu_recirc&action=click&pgtype=Article&impression_id=1d419810-51c4-11eb-8537-d1301cdd7fb0&variant=1_Show). But while it will not cure infections or frustrate high school English students for the next several centuries, 2020 provided us the opportunity to re-imagine the legal-recruiting calendar in a way that benefits all parties. Let us try to salvage one positive and make this change permanent.

# Will These Above-Market Salary Hikes Hurt This Firm's Bonuses?
## The base salaries for most classes are above market, so why aren't all associates happy?

Here at Above the Law we’ve been hearing a lot of frustration about firms’ slowness in increasing associate compensation to meet the new market standard, established by Cravath just over a week ago. But the firm we’ve heard the most complaints about is definitely Boies, Schiller & Flexner.

Interest in what the legendary litigation firm is doing on comp has come from inside and outside BSF. The firm’s top bonuses are in the stratosphere, and because of that they are widely considered compensation leaders. But those big bonuses only kick in when associates bill big hours, as a tipster noted:

The eye-popping top bonuses ([$350k!](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-boies-schiller-pays-up-to-350k-again/)) trumpeted by the firm pull up the average bonus numbers to the point that they are basically useless as indicators of what most associates are making. Last year, even 2400-2500 hours wouldn’t have been enough for BSF associates to hit the average bonuses reported.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Still, the firm hadn’t made a peep about what it was going to do about base associate salaries until this afternoon, when BSF became the 51st firm to match or beat the Cravath scale. In an email from Managing Partner Jonathan Schiller, the below raises were announced, and several of the classes will in fact be paid above market rate — we’ve noted the classes for which the base salary is above the Cravath scale:

1st Year: $180,000
2nd Year: $192,000 (+$2,000)
3rd Year: $210,000
4th Year: $240,000 (+$5,000)
5th Year: $264,000 (+$4,000)
6th Year: $282,000 (+$2,000)
7th Year: $300,000

Most people would assume this is a nice little (or not so little) payday, celebrate, and move on. Right? Well, BSF insiders say it isn’t quite that easy, and the firm’s salary raise may, in fact, come out of that big-time bonus pool:

If [Boies Schiller] do[es] raise salaries, scrutinize the move carefully. The firm’s formula comp structure means any increase in salary alone will only reduce bonuses. They need to increase salaries AND either (1) issue a special bonus or (2) change the comp formula entirely.  This is the one firm that can’t just raise salaries and call it a day.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
We have not, as of yet, received any word that BSF intends to make any changes to their [complex bonus formula](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/12/associate-bonus-watch-boies-will-be-boiesgenerous-bonuses-above-market-base-salaries/) (which essentially gives associates a share of the revenue they generate for the firm). One tipster characterized the new base salaries as effectively “a bigger advance on total comp” — unless, of course, how bonuses are determined is changed.

We are covering changes to associate compensation as market conditions develop, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

The week between Christmas and the New Year is usually pretty dead for legal news, which makes it the perfect time for a firm to try to slip some shady stuff past the goalie. Shearman started telling associates that they [would not be getting bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/shearman-bonus-2022/) for a variety of previous unannounced reasons. Foley Hoag tried to retroactively apply next year’s hours requirement to this year’s bonuses (they did the right thing and [retreated within 48 hours](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/foley-hoag-bonuses-2022/)). And [Nelson Mullins sprung a new “collections” policy](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/am-law-100-biglaw-firm-gets-ready-to-screw-associates-on-salary/) that you really have to hear about to believe.

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)
Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

Kevin Roberts

“I’ve been getting dirty money; Jordan Belfort.” — [Wes Walker & Dyl](http://genius.com/Wes-walker-and-dyl-jordan-belfort-lyrics)

Last Friday, Saatchi & Saatchi chairman Kevin Roberts gave a revealing interview on his cloudy thoughts regarding the stormy debate over gender diversity. For those unfamiliar with Saatchi & Saatchi, it is a leading [global communications and advertising agency](http://saatchi.com/en-us/network/about/), with 130 offices in 70 countries.

Many people now know about Kevin Roberts because of his recent incendiary diversity remarks, but I was quite familiar with him already. In many ways, I considered Roberts a role model. It just so happens that he authored one of my favorite advertising books of all time, [Lovemarks: The Future Beyond Brands](http://amzn.to/2aO4g1G) (affiliate link), as well as another great book I recently finished, [64 Shots: Leadership in a Crazy World](http://amzn.to/2azinVT) (affiliate links). Needless to say, he seems like such a conscientious person. How could he be guilty of such off-putting diversity remarks?

To fully understand the context of Roberts’s comments, I recommend taking five minutes out of your day to read the complete article by Lara O’Reilly of Business Insider, [Saatchi & Saatchi chairman Kevin Roberts thinks the gender diversity in advertising debate is ‘over’](http://www.businessinsider.com/kevin-roberts-on-women-in-leadership-roles-2016-7). Roberts has some interesting thoughts (e.g., citing Darwinism) on why women aren’t progressing to senior positions at a better rate in Saatchi & Saatchi.

Kevin Roberts thinks that people who attend diversity conferences, like the [3% Conference](http://www.3percentconf.com/downloads/female-cds-rise), are debating an issue that isn’t really there. As Roberts [told O’Reilly](http://www.businessinsider.com/kevin-roberts-on-women-in-leadership-roles-2016-7):

[T]here is no point in being brilliant at the wrong thing — the f**king debate is all over. This is a diverse world, we are in a world where we need, like we’ve never needed before, integration, collaboration, connectivity, and creativity … this will be reflected in the way [our company] is….

We have a bunch of talented, creative females, but they reach a certain point in their careers … 10 years of experience, when we are ready to make them a creative director of a big piece of business, and I think we fail in two out of three of those choices because the executive involved said: ‘I don’t want to manage a piece of business and people, I want to keep doing the work.’

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
[In his interview](http://www.businessinsider.com/kevin-roberts-on-women-in-leadership-roles-2016-7), Roberts said he doesn’t spend “any time” on supposed gender issues at his agencies at all — saying the issue is “way worse” in sectors like financial services, where there are “problems left, right, and center.” How true is Roberts’s statement?

Let’s analyze some statistics on the back of a napkin. Only 11.5% of creative directors within ad agencies are female, according to a [survey conducted by the 3% Conference in 2014](http://www.3percentconf.com/downloads/female-cds-rise), while women represent close to 30 percent of senior management at financial firms, according to an [April 2013 report](http://www.americanbar.org/groups/litigation/committees/diversity-inclusion/news_analysis/articles_2015/financial-services-sector-dodd-frank-diversity.html) issued by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. As for the legal industry, women account for only 16.5% of equity partners (and only 5.4% are minority), according to an [April 2014 NALP Bulletin](http://www.nalp.org/0414research).

In other words, gender diversity at the top is a systematic problem for all these industries. However, contrary to Roberts’s statement, the financial industry not only has more gender diversity at the top than the advertising industry, it has more gender diversity at the top than the advertising and legal industries combined. Sad!

Until his resignation, [Kevin Roberts](http://www.powerhousebooks.com/books/64-shots-leadership-in-a-crazy-world/) was chairman of Saatchi and Saatchi and head coach of its parent company, Publicis, the world’s third-largest communications group. I can’t help but wonder how such a smart man made such a foolish PR blunder. But then again, Publicis CEO [Maurice Levy](http://adage.com/article/agency-news/publicis-ceo-maurice-levy-people-highest-level-set/305306/), who wished Roberts the best and said he hopes Roberts learns from the unfortunate incident, [doesn’t believe gender discrimination](http://adage.com/article/special-report-4as-conference/publicis-ceo-levy-kicks-4as-keynote-change/303234/) is a systematic concern in their industry either. If it truly [starts at the top](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/01/tech-industry-leaders-are-beginning-to-accept-the-diversity-challenge-u-s-law-partners-should-do-the-same/), this [isn’t a very good sign](http://www.businessinsider.com/publicis-settled-mslgroup-sex-discrimination-lawsuit-for-3-million-2016-8).

Roberts begins his most recent book, 64 Shots, with this passage:

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Remember 1964? It was a landmark year that changed the world in many ways. The Beatles held the top five positions on Billboard, headed by “Can’t Buy Me Love.” Bob Dylan recorded “The Times They Are A-Changin’.” The Rolling Stones released their first album. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and President Lyndon B. Johnson enacted the Civil Rights Act.

Roberts may do well to also realize that [in 1964](http://womenshistory.about.com/od/feminism-second-wave/a/Feminism-in-1964.htm) the prohibition on [sex discrimination](http://womenshistory.about.com/od/glossary/a/Sex-Discrimination.htm) was [added to Title VII](http://womenshistory.about.com/od/laws/a/sex_and_civil_rights_act.htm) of the Civil Rights Act and the [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission](http://jobsearch.about.com/od/employmentlaw/g/eeoc.htm) was created. 1964 was a landmark year for progress, but it was hardly a panacea for discrimination in the workplace; it was just the beginning.

Times are indeed a-changing, and past mindsets may not fully appreciate today’s business climate and social culture. What was dogma during the Mad Men days may not necessarily be en vogue today. Roberts planned to retire from his chairmanship in May of next year, but it just so happened his time at Saatchi & Saatchi and Publicis ran out this week. Even a man with amazing vision can have a few blind spots.

To claim workplace discrimination doesn’t exist or that the debate is over is quite bold, to say the least. Maybe Roberts can update his book and add a 65th piece of leadership advice to his compilation: Beware of your privilege. It can be invisible to you and blind you to others’ realities. You can carry this invisible privilege around like a dollar bill crumpled up in your pocket, never knowing it is there until you reach deep down and discover it. Even with all the tips you may give out, you’ll still have this crumpled-up dollar bill in your pocket, never knowing it is there until you reach deep down. It may be you who needed a leadership tip all along.

For those who’ve read Roberts’s most recent book, the section in Chapter One titled “Shot 3: Don’t make assumptions” could also be good review. In this section, he writes:

Here is a rule of thumb: the less you assume, the more you explore, the better the outcome. Never assume; investigate. Be curious, pose questions, go to the source, and course correct. This is Genchi Genbutsu, aka “Getcha boots on.” It’s a key part of the legendary Toyota Production System. It means go and see for yourself…. If you want to understand how a tiger hunts, don’t go to the zoo, go to the jungle. Toyota tracks back to the root of a problem through a process of asking “Why?” five times. No problem can sustain that kind of pressure….

Don’t assume based on data. Data leads to false facts. Data reads the lines, but people live between them.

We would all be wise to review these words when attempting to solve the diversity crisis in our respective professions.

# The Difference Between Keeping Lawyers And Losing Lawyers? It's More Than Money.
## Thomson Reuters Institute report finds key differences between firms with high and low turrnover.

Back in January, the Thomson Reuters Institute and Georgetown Law’s Center on Ethics and the Legal Profession released a comprehensive report on the [state of the legal profession](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/legal/state-of-the-legal-market-2022/) that included a particularly curious chart. Tucked away toward the back of the report, the authors included a chart that broke down [the differences between “Stay firms” and “Go firms”](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-law-firm-edition/) — dividing the legal landscape into two categories based on turnover and then charting the real distinctions between the lateral market haves and have nots.

Not that the lateral market is the be all end all. A firm can be quite successful with a higher turnover model. Though as one partner once told me, lawyers are replaceable but they’re not fungible, and retention matters at some level.

This morning, a follow-up report ([you can get it here](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/legal/law-firms-stay-go-report-2022/?cid=9061230&chl=pr&sfdccampaignid=PR)) blows out that one chart and provides a ton of data on the differences between Stay and Go firms.

But how does the report define Stay firms and Go firms? At the most simplistic level, it took turnover across multiple years, did some weighting to account for some obvious variables, and produced two general categories. And they look like this:



Go firms are generally bigger, which makes sense as the Biglaw business model relies on folks leaving as they work up the seniority ladder. Stay firms are generally smaller, which makes sense because that business model relies on getting lawyers already trained and tested by the pressure cooker of Biglaw. That said, the methodology controls for the leverage differences and still came out this way.

How different are the two categories?

That’s an extraordinary gap and it’s only getting bigger. Check this one out!



The outlier highest turnover Stay firm now barely matches the outlier lowest turnover Go firm. Something is definitely happening there.

Obviously the lateral market is hot right now, but the proper takeaway is that the firms generally considered “low turnover” are holding steady while the firms already considered “high turnover” are feeling all the heat. So you can’t chalk it all up to industry wide demand — there’s something going on that gives certain firms a transitory feel.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“It really comes down to the culture,” said Bill Josten with the Thomson Reuters Institute said. “I think the biggest takeaway is that there’s a whole lot more than just money in keeping people.”

That brings us to the curious finding in the original January report that attorneys at these Stay firms work more while getting paid less. At first blush a counterintuitive result, but with the benefit of this report it’s a lot easier to understand.

“The takeaway is that if you have happier people they’ll want to work harder,” Josten said. “We went out and did a separate interview to ask associates at large about what they want out of a workplace.” And across the board lawyers preferred Stay firms on every non-monetary metric:



There’s probably some grade inflation in there so the gaps between the two are more important than the raw numbers.

“They said they would be happier at firms that resembled our Stay firms. They want recognition beyond cash,” Josten explained. “Cash is a part of it, but cash is the fallback position — if there’s nothing else keeping them there, then maybe they’ll leave for higher money, but that doesn’t solve underlying problems.”

Some of the most serious underlying problems apply squarely to underrepresented lawyers. While women are only slightly more of a flight risk than men, gay lawyers reported a 10 percent higher likelihood of leaving the firm than straight lawyers.

Though no category saw a greater disparity in desire to move on than ethnicity.



A 22 percent jump between the least likely and most likely to leave is a big deal. This is a critically important finding at a time when clients are increasing efforts to track and act upon diversity among outside counsel. The [collapse of Coca-Cola’s ambitious attempt to improve diversity](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/coca-cola-shook-up-diversity-efforts-racist-shareholders-gushed-out/) didn’t disrupt that trend.

“Flight risk factors are high across the board but when we see numbers like 62 percent in some categories of diversity… it’s imperative that firms get on top of that because those lawyers are already in high demand and firms are struggling to hold onto them,” Josten said.

# Biglaw Leader Who Took Cover In Bomb Shelter During Hamas Attacks Critiques 'Critical Thinking Skills' Of Those Making Controversial Statements On Israel

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

We send out a memo each year that we have a tolerant and respectful work environment. That doesn’t mean we are going to say if these students were involved in these organizations that they can’t be here. But we are asking people to pay them a lot of money for their critical thinking skills. If their critical thinking skills land them in that place [blaming the victims of the terror for the terror], then they have no place here.

— [Joseph Shenker](https://www.sullcrom.com/Lawyers/Joseph-C-Shenker), senior chair of Sullivan & Cromwell, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/10/19/this-is-deeply-personal-scs-joe-shenker-forced-into-a-bomb-shelter-speaks-on-connections-to-israel-the-way-forward/) on the law students who saw their [offers of employment rescinded](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/nyu-student-bar-president-israel-palestine/) at Winston & Strawn and Davis Polk & Wardwell after making or signing on to [controversial statements concerning the Hamas terror attack](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/davis-polk-rescinds-offers-to-t14-law-school-students-for-their-controversial-statements-on-israel/) in Israel. Shenker was in Israel celebrating Simchat Torah when Hamas struck, and found refuge in a Jerusalem synagogue’s bomb shelter. This is a “deeply personal” issue for Shenker, who explained to Am Law that revenge is not the way forward. “You have to feel their pain,” he said. “But never take revenge. Feel empathy, protect others and feel part of the human whole.”

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

# The Biglaw Roots Of Your Next(?) Supreme Court Justice, Merrick Garland

What Biglaw firm did Merrick Garland work at before heeding the call to public service?

Hint: He is not the only Supreme Court nominee from that same Biglaw shop to experience… difficulties getting confirmed to a SCOTUS position by the Senate. Abe Fortas was the first Jewish former partner of the same law firm to have been nominated by a second-term Democratic President for a position on the Supreme Court. (Already on the Court, President Johnson nominated Fortas to succeed Earl Warren as Chief Justice in 1969. Following a failed attempt to break cloture on his nomination, Fortas withdrew his nomination. He resigned as Justice in 1969.) The firm has undergone a name change since Fortas’s day, but it is still the same firm.

See the answer on the next page.

# Top Biglaw Firm Celebrates Inclusiveness With New Partner Class That's 75 Percent Diverse

Year in and year out, we watch law firm after law firm pay lip service to their commitment to diversity in the legal profession, with promises to recruit, retain, and promote more attorneys who are racially and ethnically diverse, LGBTQ+, and/or women, as well as those with disabilities. Despite these continued assurances, many Biglaw firms are falling behind when it comes to this important metric to create a more inclusive workplace, while others continue to perform beyond expectations, hitting it out of the park for diversity over and over again.

In our New Partner Watch feature, we write about new partnership classes at selected firms. We tend to write about announcements that are, for one reason or another, interesting. For this current cycle, we’ll be focusing on diversity (or the lack thereof) among new Biglaw partners. If you think you have a class that merits scrutiny, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=New%20Partner%20Watch) (subject line: “New Partner Watch”).

Today’s topic: The 14 new partners at Orrick, which the firm just announced on Friday. From their press release (emphasis ours):

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)

Orrick is delighted to announce the promotion of 14 lawyers to the firm’s partnership, effective January 1, 2021. …

The class reflects Orrick’s longstanding commitment to inclusion. Seventy-five percent of the U.S. class members are diverse and/or women, exceeding the Mansfield Rule standard. Continuing a trend of the past four years, we are delighted to promote a member of the class while on caregiver leave.

“It took extraordinary grit, adaptability and character to complete one’s partner candidacy over the past year – and we believe those qualities are key to outstanding lawyering in the future,” said Orrick’s Chairman & CEO Mitch Zuklie. “We have no doubt that we will be a stronger firm because of this exceptional class.”

Congratulations to these 14 new partners on grabbing the ultimate Biglaw brass ring, and congratulations to Orrick on the impressive diversity of its class. The new partners are diverse according to many metrics — by practice area, geography, racial or ethnic background, and gender. On top of that, Orrick continues to demonstrate that it’s possible for attorneys to practice law and attain the greatest heights of success while balancing their family lives by promoting someone who was on caregiver leave.

Fresh off announcing its [new diversity pipeline program](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/top-am-law-firm-starts-diversity-pipeline-program-for-incoming-talent/?rf=1), Orrick went above and beyond for the sake of diversity in its new partner class. If you’re in-house and you care about the diversity of your lawyers, you should know that Orrick does as well.

Can any other Biglaw firm compete with Orrick’s true commitment to diversity?

Before and after: Zachary Warren in early 2014 (left) and late 2014 (right).

After the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office [failed to convict](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/10/partial-verdict-announced-in-dewey-leboeuf-criminal-trial/) the three leaders of [Dewey & LeBoeuf](https://abovethelaw.com/dewey-leboeuf/) on any criminal charges related to the Biglaw firm’s [epic failure](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/05/dewey-file-for-bankruptcy-yes-its-about-time/), many of us wondered: what about Zachary Warren? In case you don’t recall, Zach Warren was defendant number four in the case, accused of conspiring with the “big three” — former chairman Steven Davis, former executive director Stephen DiCarmine, and former CFO Joel Sanders — back when Warren was a lowly client relations manager at Dewey. This alleged conspiracy took place ages ago, after Warren’s college years at Stanford but before he graduated from Georgetown Law and clerked for two federal judges.

The case took a toll on Zach Warren. His post-clerkship employment at D.C.-based Williams & Connolly, one of the nation’s most high-powered (and [high-paying](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/04/nationwide-pay-raise-watch-who-pays-a-starting-salary-of-200000-williams-connolly/)) law firms, got put on hold. Warren had to cool his heels in the hinterlands, working on [plaintiff-side employment cases](http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/id=1202744026586/Source-Davis-Will-Not-Be-Retried-in-Dewey-Criminal-Case?mcode=1202615704879&curindex=0&curpage=2) for the [Employment Rights Group](http://www.employmentrightsgroup.com/), a small firm in Pittsburgh.

Well, look for Zach Warren to get back into fighting shape. His battle with Manhattan District Attorney’s office has come to an end, as reported by [Law360](http://www.law360.com/articles/759638/breaking-dewey-s-zachary-warren-gets-deferred-prosection-deal-on-eve-of-trial):

Former Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP client relations manager Zachary Warren has reached a deferred prosecution deal just weeks before the trial over his alleged role in the defunct firm’s collapse was set to begin.

Warren, 31, who was indicted in the firm’s fraud scheme as an alleged low-level co-conspirator, inked the deal with Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance, the parties told the New York State Supreme Court on Tuesday. The deal calls for the charges to be dropped in one year if Warren completes 350 hours of community service.

Warren will most likely perform his community service in Washington, D.C., according to the [New York Law Journal](http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/id=1202749808839/ExDewey-Junior-Manager-Avoids-Trial-in-Deal-With-DA?cn=20160216&pt=Breaking%20News&src=EMC-Email&et=editorial&bu=New%20York%20Law%20Journal&slreturn=20160116153516). This agreement clears the way for Warren to start work at Williams & Connolly in the fall, according to the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/business/dealbook/prosecutors-have-deal-with-second-dewey-leboeuf-figure.html?_r=0).

Warren’s lawyers — Paul Shechtman and William Murphy of [Zuckerman Spaeder](http://www.zuckerman.com/), a go-to law firm when you’re in deep doo-doo — expressed satisfaction with the case’s resolution. “We are deeply pleased that the district attorney’s office has decided to dismiss the charges,” they said in a [statement](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/business/dealbook/prosecutors-have-deal-with-second-dewey-leboeuf-figure.html?_r=0).

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Warren was scheduled to go to trial in March. The DA’s office tried to sound confident about its case — Joan Vollero, a spokeswoman for Cy Vance, said in a [statement](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/business/dealbook/prosecutors-have-deal-with-second-dewey-leboeuf-figure.html?_r=0) that “had this case proceeded to trial, we would have met our burden of proof” — but no objective observer would accept that spin. The evidence against Davis, DiCarmine, and Sanders was so much stronger than the evidence against Warren, and their case still ended in a mistrial. If the DA couldn’t capture the whales, how was it going to snare the minnow?

So this agreement — given the evidence (or lack thereof), and given Warren’s minor role at Dewey — is actually not a bad outcome for the DA’s office, all things considered. They get to save some face — this deal is less humiliating than an outright acquittal or a mistrial — and they can concentrate their resources on the [retrial of Steve DiCarmine and Joel Sanders](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/is-continued-prosecution-of-the-dewey-defendants-un-american/). (Steve Davis, like Warren, also accepted a deferred-prosecution agreement — but Davis’s deal, unlike Warren’s, [bars him from the practice of law](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202746623154/Deweys-Steven-Davis-Takes-Deal-Ahead-of-New-Trial?slreturn=20160116163326) in New York.)

Congratulations to Zach Warren and to the Manhattan DA’s office on resolving this matter amicably. It’s nice to see the occasional triumph of common sense in the criminal justice system.

He should leave the firm entirely. Leave of absence still imputes the financial interests of the firm to him.

— Richard W. Painter, who served as chief White House ethics counsel during the George W. Bush administration, commenting on Doug Emhoff’s [continued association with DLA Piper](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/08/us/politics/doug-emhoff-kamala-harris-law.html) while his wife, Kamala Harris, campaigns as Joe Biden’s running mate on the 2020 Democratic ticket. Emhoff took a [temporary leave of absence](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/biglaw-partner-takes-leave-to-join-his-wife-kamala-harris-on-campaign-trail/) from the Biglaw firm in August. Painter said that firm clients could be accused of “trying to buy influence” through Emhoff, but the Biden-Harris campaign said this of Harris’s husband: He “has always observed the highest ethical standards to ensure his personal law practice was kept entirely separate from his wife’s work” and he is “completely focused” on the campaign.

Welcome back to [The Pink Ghetto](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-pink-ghetto/), a series where we take a look at some of the most appalling stories from one of the most sexist industries in the world: the legal profession. Countless tales of sexual harassment have emerged in the days and weeks since the Harvey Weinstein scandal was brought to light, and as women in this industry know all too well, a law degree will not [insulate you from sexual harassment](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/metoo-no-a-law-degree-doesnt-insulate-you-from-sexual-harassment/). Today, we’ll take a look at stories from women who faced intense sexual harassment during their nascent careers as lawyers, at firms big and small. These are real emails that we’ve received from real readers.

When you see things like this happening, say something. Together, we can inspire the change necessary to stop this disturbing behavior from being so prevalent in the law. We owe it to ourselves and to future generations of women in the law.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
My Harvey. Is there a woman out there who doesn’t have a Harvey Weinstein in her life? I’ve had several, but my Biglaw Harvey stands out. I was a summer associate at a large, highly respected Boston firm in the early 1990s. I was 24 years old. The economy was headed toward a recession, and my Harvey gave me a steady stream of work. I was grateful. My Harvey called me on a daily basis, asking me how I was doing, was I enjoying the firm, etc. My Harvey commented on my looks. He told me he knew I would do well once I came back to the firm as a full time associate. He told me I had what it takes to make it in the law firm world. He was excited that we would be colleagues. I brushed off my Harvey’s intense focus on me and told my office mate that I must have reminded him of his daughter. But my Harvey kept calling. Then my Harvey started asking me out to lunch; I went thinking I needed to go along to keep getting assignments. At lunch, my Harvey put his arm around me and asked me out to dinner. This happened multiple times. I always found a reason to say no and my Harvey told me he was very disappointed; I should really consider. He would keep giving me work. I finally told him that this had to stop and that I would not go out with him. He never assaulted me. He just stopped giving me work. I later found out that he gave me a poor performance review. I didn’t get an offer at my highly respected firm, and I never reported his behavior. That’s my Harvey story.

I’ve been inspired by so many people coming out and sharing their stories. It is very important that we all come forward to emphasize the pervasiveness of this problem, not just in the legal profession, but across all fields.

When I was an intern at a small law firm, I, like many other budding lawyers, wanted to absorb as much experience as possible. So when an opportunity came up to accompany a partner to a court hearing, I jumped on it.

The hearing was scheduled at 10:00am downtown, and the partner asked me to meet him at his apartment because of the proximity of his home to the courthouse. I thought it was a little weird, but went anyway, because his rationale made sense at the time.

So I went to his apartment at 9:30am like he had asked. I expected to leave immediately to head to the court, because we all know that one must get there early. I rang the doorbell, and he answered the door with only a towel around his waist, holding a mug of coffee.

Now, sitting here right now, I would have told the 24-year-old me to run, run, run, and don’t look back. But I was shocked and confused, and I was just really worried about getting to the hearing late. He asked me to come in, and I thought he would just get dressed and leave. He asked me to wait for him in the living room while he finished up his shower. I complied. His apartment was lovely, I remembered. There was a cute note from his wife on the counter. I thought that was a good sign?

He came out of the bathroom, still in his stupid towel. He walked across the living room slowly, so that I could get a good look at his disgusting body. He asked me if I wanted a tour of the apartment. I said no, thanks, and that we really must be going. He said he wanted to show me his daughters’ room. I did not want to piss him off and went to take a peek from outside the room. I could tell that he wanted me to go inside.

I kept reminding him that we need to go. He started to look annoyed and went to get dressed. We finally left the apartment at 9:55. I could not believe it had been only 25 minutes. It felt like 5 hours.

We hailed a cab, and he still seemed pissed. I was still confused and did not know why he seemed so angry. He asked me why I came, and was it out of the goodness of my heart? I was like, what are you talking about? I wanted to go to court!

The thing is, it still did not hit me then that he had nefarious intentions. Not even when he asked me that question. I thought he was just a weirdo. Like I said above, I was very naïve and trusting, and would not know sexual harassment if someone smacked my behind with it (which actually happened a few years before this, but that’s another story). Nobody talked about this when I was younger, and I feel this is why it is so important that all of us share our stories, no matter the level of egregiousness, so that the younger generation is aware and know what to look for. It took me a long time to realize what he really wanted in that apartment.

I am glad nothing happened in that apartment. But it is sad that I remember that day in such vivid detail. Every time I hear about somebody being harassed, I am reminded of what happened that day, and it is like being victimized all over again.

Oh, the court hearing? It was some b.s. appearance to adjourn a hearing.

# Have You Ever Wondered Why They're Called 'Associates'?
## The origin of a legal industry term we all take for granted.

What famous lawyer is credited with coining the term “associate” for junior lawyers?

Hint: The former S.D.N.Y. United States Attorney minted the term while serving as hiring partner at one of the most powerful Wall Street firms of its day. Regrettably, the firm (and its successors) are now defunct.

# Law Firms Should Use The Calendar Year To Evaluate Billable Hours
## One benefit of a calendar-year billable-hour cycle is that it takes advantage of the fact that many clients wait until the end of the year to pay their outstanding bills.

Most law firms have a billable-hour requirement under which attorneys need to bill a certain number of hours over a specific period, usually 12 months. Law firms have various periods over which they determine if attorneys satisfied the billable-hour requirement, and many shops judge attorneys from a period starting and ending before the holiday season. I have also heard of some firms assessing billable-hour expectations on a fiscal-year basis, and this 12-month period starts and ends in the summer. For a variety of reasons, it usually makes sense to evaluate attorneys based on the calendar year rather than any other period.

I am fortunate to have only worked at a law firm that assessed the billable hours of attorneys based on the calendar year. When I was starting at a firm, I welcomed this. My first day of work was in or around the middle of October, and it was reassuring to know that I had a few months during which I would not be assessed when it came to billable hours. During this time, I was freer to take on pro bono matters and was not too stressed about billing time since everyone knew that I would only start to be assessed in the new year.

After the new year, people naturally want to hustle and devote more time to work. Most people take time off to recharge during the holidays, and they are more energized after the new year to attack their work headfirst. This means that an attorney is more likely to begin the billing season strong and build a comfortable cushion of billable hours early during the period in which they are assessed.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Each year I worked at a law firm that had a calendar-year billable-hour cycle, I made sure to begin each year billing tons of hours. I let the new year energy naturally motivate my work, and I would set myself up with a solid cushion of billable hours after the first few months of the year. This was helpful to me when I planned the rest of my year. It was easier to take time off for vacation or personal reasons when I knew that I had banked billable hours and did not need to be at the grind as much to satisfy the billable-hour requirement.

Another benefit of a calendar-year billable-hour cycle is that this takes advantage of the fact that many clients wait until the end of the year to pay their outstanding bills. Some shops do not just assess attorneys based on the number of hours of time they bill. Rather, certain firms judge attorneys based on whether a client pays the bills associates with the hours billed by a lawyer. On the one hand, this practice is somewhat unfair since an associate often does not have control over whether a client pays their bills.

On the other hand, law firms likely need to keep track of budgets when making compensation decisions, and so firm collections are important. In any case, by waiting until the end of the calendar year, law firms maximize the chances that straggler clients will pay their bills, which would positively reflect on associates. Of course, not all law firms evaluate associates based on deeper billing metrics, but those shops that do should give associates the best chance possible to meet firm metrics.

One of the main reasons why law firms choose time periods other than the calendar year to assess billable hours is because they likely do not want to make bonus decisions around the holidays. Moreover, shops may not want attorneys to feel pressured into billing more hours around the holidays so that they can be eligible for a bonus.

However, if law firms establish a certain threshold above the billable-hour requirement to receive a bonus, there will not be much assessment needed around the holidays to determine if an attorney will be receiving a bonus. Moreover, it is not too much of an imposition to receive a bonus paycheck or two after the holidays. Indeed, this was the practice at a law firm at which I once worked, and it was honestly nice to know that a bonus paid early in the new year would not appear on my taxes for the preceding year. Any downside of having a billable-hour cycle during the calendar year is outweighed by the benefits of assessing billable hours during this natural period.

All told, it is unfortunately too late for law firms to change how they evaluate billable hours this year since the new year is right around the corner. However, law firms should strongly consider evaluating the billable hours output of attorneys during the ordinary calendar year.

Which law firm offers big money AND big fun?

For nearly 20 years, Fortune has released a list of the 100 Best Companies to Work For. Each year, a few law firms manage to sneak their way onto a list that includes employers like Google, Whole Foods, and IKEA. With companies like that on the list, each year we wonder if the people at Fortune have any idea what they’re talking about — after all, there’s no way a law firm could possibly perform on a similar level.

We try to cover this list every year (see our posts in [2015](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/03/which-law-firms-are-considered-some-of-the-best-companies-to-work-for/), [2014](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/01/6-law-firms-make-fortunes-list-of-the-best-companies-to-work-for/), [2012](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/01/fortunes-annual-%E2%80%98100-best-companies-to-work-for%E2%80%99-list-includes-four-law-firms/), [2011](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/01/annual-best-companies-to-work-for-list-includes-four-law-firms/), [2010](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/01/fortune-recognizes-six-firms-as-least-worst-best-companies-to-work-for/), [2009](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/01/fortune-lists-top-100-companies-to-work-for/), [2008](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/01/everyones-a-winner-at-these-five-law-firms/), and [2007](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/01/bingham-mccutchen-land-of-the-amazons/)). In 2015, five law firms made the list: Baker Donelson (#30), Alston & Bird (#41), Cooley (#42), Perkins Coie (#46), and Arnold & Porter (#75).

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
This year, six law firms made the list. Which firms had pay that was high enough, perks that were good enough, and environments that were nurturing enough to make the cut?

The six law firms on this year’s list are… five of the firms that made last year’s list, plus one firm that’s making its first appearance on the list since 2010. It’s worth noting that most of the five firms from last year’s list more or less retained their Fortune ranking, give or take a few slots, but one of them has been on a meteoric rise to the top.

Congratulations to the following six firms on being fun enough for Fortune:

- [Cooley](http://fortune.com/best-companies/cooley-28/): ranked #28, up from #42 last year
- [Baker Donelson](http://fortune.com/best-companies/baker-donelson-32/): ranked #32, down from #30 last year
- [Perkins Coie](http://fortune.com/best-companies/perkins-coie-37/): ranked #37, up from #46 last year
- [Alston & Bird](http://fortune.com/best-companies/alston-bird-41/): ranked #41, no change from last year
- [Arnold & Porter](http://fortune.com/best-companies/arnold-porter-81/): ranked #81, up from #75 last year
- [Orrick](http://fortune.com/best-companies/orrick-herrington-sutcliffe-91/): ranked ranked #91, unranked in 2015 (up from #95 in 2010)

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Last year, we [noted](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/03/which-law-firms-are-considered-some-of-the-best-companies-to-work-for/) that Cooley had the best work perks by far, what with its spectacular social calendar for associates and staff members, with events like Dancing with the Stars competitions and Nintendo Wii dance-offs. Once again, we’ll have to hand the competition to Cooley, which has risen 72 slots in Fortune’s ranking in the past two years. Where else can you find attorneys doing battle like this in the workplace?

# The $20 Million Biglaw Partner AKA 'The Kirkland Effect'
## Want your partners to stay? Then it's time to pay!

The Kirkland effect is that there are people out there with businesses that justify basically almost any amount of compensation. And so if Kirkland always wants these people, and is willing to pay them, if you want these people, you also have to be willing to join the pay party.

— Recruiter Mark Jungers of Lippman Jungers Bala, telling [Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/big-law-partner-pay-gibson-dunn-10-million-kirkland-effect-2022-3?r=US&IR=T) what other Biglaw firms must be wary of when it comes to pay for their top partners. In order to avoid the potential for poaching, compensation for partners with big books of business has gone up tremendously. “It’s ballplayer money,” said Sarah Morris, a recruiter at Macrae. According to legal recruiter David Walden of E.P. Dine, “It used to be unheard of to have partners make 8, 10, 15, and some of them $20 million a year.” That’s hardly the case anymore, with some partners taking home eight-figure salaries.

When it comes to Biglaw trends, the past year or so has taught us that group lateral moves are here to stay. Whether it’s an entire practice group heading to greener pastures at a competitor firm or a group of colleagues leaving to start their own firm, this is something that should be on everyone’s radar if it somehow isn’t already.

Today’s big news on that front is that Lewis Brisbois — a 1,700-lawyer firm that brought in $703,000,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 70 in the most recent Am Law 100 — will be losing up to 140 attorneys thanks to a large group of partners leaving to start a new firm.

John Barber, a 25-year veteran of the firm, is joining Jeff Ranen, a 20-year veteran of the firm, to start their own employment boutique, [Barber Ranen](https://barberranen.com/), alongside several of their colleagues. Barber and Ranen served as chair and vice chair of the Lewis Brisbois employment practices group, and both were members of the firm’s management committee.

Barber said that as of this morning, he has about 118 signed offer letters from lawyers at Lewis Brisbois, but wouldn’t be surprised if between 125 and 140 lawyers make the decision to join Barber Ranen. All of these lawyers hail from the Lewis Brisbois employment group.

Asked why they decided to start their own firm, Barber said, “Jeff and I had both independently been thinking about doing something new, something fresh. We wanted to build something that’s reflective of our values and our beliefs.”

“We reached the point where we felt like we’d gone as far as we could go, and that’s a real turning point in your life,” Barber said. “Am I going to take a leap and rediscover a level of vigor and energy and enthusiasm and excitement and try to build something even though there’s a lot of risk involved? We were both willing to shoulder that risk.”

What is Barber Ranen hoping to bring to the table for its lawyers and its clients? Barber’s response is quite hopeful and inspiring:

“Jeff and I are in lockstep in that we serve two masters — excellence and our culture — and we are ferociously protective of both. Every decision we make is not viewed from the prospective of profit or power or anything other than does this enhance our ability to deliver excellent results to our clients and does it enhance our culture. We are both singularly focused on paying it forward. We try as we can to create opportunities for our people to foster their careers, to mentor, to create an environment which is conducive to becoming the very best that you can be as a lawyer. While that may sound Pollyanna-ish, it is absolutely so firmly ingrained in who we are, and that’s the cornerstone of our firm.”

Right now, Barber Ranen has outposts in 12 cities across the country, with physical office space in Los Angeles, Newport Beach, Sacramento, and San Francisco.

Lewis Brisbois has been losing lawyers at a steady clip this year. Back in January, the Los Angeles-based firm lost its 44-member cybersecurity team (32 lawyers and 12 business professionals) to Constangy Brooks. Now, it’s losing up to 140 lawyers and a yet-to-be determined number of business professionals to Barber Ranen.

As noted by the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/05/02/employment-chairs-lead-mass-departure-from-lewis-brisbois-to-newly-launched-firm/), the employment practice group at Lewis Brisbois is in a state of transition:

[Lewis Brisbois partner] Smigielski said a “sizeable” group of attorneys have been approached to join the new firm, with many indicating their intention to stay in place. Smigielski said it’s not clear to leaders at Lewis Brisbois who has decided to remain and who has decided to go. “In the coming days, we’ll have a clearer picture of what will transpire of that,” she said.

Such transitions are “an unavoidable part of the legal landscape,” Smigielski said. She said the firm has a consistent case inventory for which clients will continue to receive “the same high level of support.”

# Research Proves Women Should Not Work For Republicans
## This is why every female associate needs to know her boss's politics.

This sounds like something cooked up in some liberal conspiracy circle, but it is literally everything you always thought about Republicans but couldn’t prove. Now science has your back. It turns out the political leanings of your boss have an impact on how you are compensated and the likelihood of getting promoted — if you are a woman.

In the [study](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2721979), two business professors, [Seth Carnahan](https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/seth-carnahan) and [Brad Greenwood](http://community.mis.temple.edu/greenwood/), sought to establish that people whose personal political opinions were conservative actually treat their female employees worse than their male counterparts. The study focused on law firms, which is what makes this study so damning, and they tracked individual political donations from partners at the 200 largest law firms between 2007 and 2012 and compared those donations to the outcomes for female associates. The results are not good.

The researchers’ ability to control across firms is what makes the data so powerful. It isn’t the case where there is one “bad” place to work for women, instead, it is directly correlated to the personal beliefs of the partners they work for. Reason.com [details](http://reason.com/blog/2016/03/01/law-firm-partners-who-donate-to-republic) the study’s methodology:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
As one way to test this, Carnahan and Greenwood explored merger-and-acquisition deals which U.S. law firms were involved in from 2007 through 2012—a sample that included 5,702 deals involving 16,860 partners and 18,215 associates at US law firms. Even after controlling for things such as an associate’s number of years with a firm, their law-school ranking, shared law-school ties between associates and partners, and law-firm location, they found a “negative interaction between donations to Republicans and the selection of female associates” to serve with partners on client teams.

Oof. So women don’t get to be on the big deals or big cases — you’d  better believe that has lasting impacts on their careers:

The authors also pinpointed associates at America’s top 200 law firms in 2006, and followed them until they received a promotion to partner or exited the company. Women made up about 45 percent of all associates. With or without controls factored in, Republican leadership in a practice area corresponded negatively to female promotion rates in that area and positively with turnover rates.

So it is clear to me, the researchers were able to establish the correlation between preference for political parties and the career opportunities for women. So, if you are a woman and thinking about lateraling to a new firm or a law student thinking about where you’d like to interview, you’d best become very comfortable with the [FEC’s search capabilities](http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/disclosure_data_search.shtml).

The authors point out there is no evidence there was conscious discrimination at play, but the inadvertent type of sexism is no less terrible and just as likely to derail your career. They also point out there might be other reasons a liberal partner may reward women associates more than their conservative counterparts, such as having more female clients, unduly promoting women, or rewarding liberal women who share their beliefs (not that conservative women did any better with conservative bosses). That sounds like a bunch of double talk to me, but the reason is almost beside the point. The data bears out a clear piece of advice for women lawyers: If you want to have a successful legal career, you have to know the political leanings of your boss, preferably before you show up on your first day.

“In general, women are much less likely to be promoted, and much more likely to leave their firms,” said Carnahan, an assistant professor of strategy at Michigan’s Ross School of Business. “We found that this gender gap gets smaller when male bosses are more liberal, but it gets larger when male bosses are more conservative.”

This study is basically actual research that tells women who find themselves in conservative law firms, “You are not crazy! That feeling you have every time a staffing decision is made isn’t in your head.” It is about time we have proof.

# Biglaw Firm Offers Revolutionary Program For Working Mothers
## This program is the the first of its kind among all Biglaw firms. Wow!

Many Biglaw firms out there now offer up to [22 weeks of paid parental leave](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/05/which-biglaw-firm-has-the-best-parental-leave-policy/), and that’s a wonder in and of itself. Some Biglaw firms are now even offering [gender-neutral parental leave](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/biglaw-firm-makes-big-waves-with-gender-neutral-parental-leave-policy/) programs. But what happens when female attorneys return from parental leave?

Managing a successful career at a prestigious law firm and a successful family life can be quite the task, and only some firms have risen to the occasion to make this easier for lawyers who are new mothers. In fact, until this week, not a single Biglaw firm had come up with a solution for working mothers who were on business trips and needed to ship breast milk home.

This all changes thanks to Latham & Watkins’s new breast milk-shipping program, which is the first of its kind among all Biglaw firms. Even Latham thinks breast is best.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Associate [Hayley Gladstone](https://www.lw.com/people/HayleyJMoore), who serves as global co-chair of the firm’s parent lawyers group, came up with the idea, and the firm ran with it. [Here’s](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/09/15/got-breast-milk-latham-will-ship-it/) how the program works:

When a nursing-mom lawyer travels for work, Latham sends a special shipping unit to her hotel. It includes a Styrofoam box that chills down after pressing a button. There are also plastic breast milk storage bags, labels, a marker and packing tape. Once the chilling unit is packed, it goes in a FedEx box for shipping.

The service, launched this week, is a welcomed solution, said [Julia] Thompson, [who’s had three children since joining the firm in 2009 and] explained that it’s difficult taking milk through airport security because sometimes, agents open and test the milk. Thompson said she explored shipping her milk using dry ice, but she didn’t want to risk feeding her baby milk that wasn’t frozen or refrigerated properly.

“This is something you don’t want to leave to chance,” she said.

Latham & Watkins will offer this important service to all nursing mothers — both attorneys and staff members — who need to travel on firm-related business.

Congratulations to Latham on going forward with this program that will surely benefit its attorneys and their families. Which Biglaw firm will be the next to step up and make life a little easier for female associates and staff who are working mothers?

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

According to a new survey conducted by Roll on Friday, associates in the London office of this U.S.-based Biglaw firm are very unhappy with their work-life balance, with one lawyer describing the firm as a “low value, high volume sweat shop of shitty deals.” At which top 20 Am Law firm are associates least satisfied with their work-life balance in the UK?

Hint: The firm recently conducted a [round of layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/am-law-20-firm-begins-layoffs/) in the US, eliminating about 5% of its workforce across multiple offices through the reduction.

# The 100 Largest Law Firms In New York (2021)
## Size matters for law firms in the Big Apple.

There are many different and exciting ways to rank law firms. How prestigious are they? How much money are they making? How much take-home cash do partners earn? How big are they?

Yes, size matters, especially after a year where lateral movement between firms was fast and furious. Sure, there was a lot of attrition in 2021, but firms were still putting up huge head count numbers thanks to the rapid influx of new associates in the ongoing talent wars.

The New York Law Journal recently unleashed its annual [NYLJ 100](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2022/07/18/scramble-for-associates-laterals-leads-to-bigger-new-york-offices/), a ranking of the largest law firms in New York covering the previous calendar year. As luck would have it, many Biglaw firms increased their New York City head counts by more than 10 percent in 2021, and the top 100 firms in the city netted about a 2% increase in attorneys over their 2020 numbers. If you’ve ever wondered about head counts, this is the ranking for you.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The NYLJ 100 tracks the number of full-time equivalent lawyers in firms’ New York offices last year and ranks them by their headcounts in the state. In total, about 24,208 attorneys were working in the New York offices of the state’s 100 largest law firms last year….

The top 15 biggest firms (numbers show attorneys in New York) are not surprising. Let’s take a moment to gawk at Manhattan’s Biglaw behemoths:

1. Paul Weiss: 812
2. Kirkland & Ellis: 745
3. Davis Polk: 733
4. Simpson Thacher: 662
5. Skadden: 628
6. Weil Gotshal: 611
7. Latham: 598
8. Debevoise: 552
9. Sullivan & Cromwell: 529
10. Milbank: 485
11. Cravath: 447
12. Cleary Gottlieb: 426
12. Ropes & Gray: 426
14. Sidley: 424
15. Fried Frank: 411

Congratulations to Paul Weiss for once again employing more lawyers in New York than any other firm. This firm wins the award for putting the “big” in Biglaw in the Big Apple.

# Zooming Toward Innovation … Or Not?
## Yes, I know the saying that the eyes are the window to the soul, but are the eyes sufficient, do they tell me enough?

In addition to zooming more than I ever wanted to zoom, I am reading about pandemics. I know I am not the only one. The topic fascinates me, and the books try to help me understand what is going on and why. My list includes two novels: Station Eleven by Emily St John Mandel and The End of October by Lawrence Wright, and two works of nonfiction, The Great Influenza by John Barry and Pale Death by Laura Spinney. Suggestions for others gratefully accepted.

Part of my fascination is imagining what our world will look like once the lockdown is behind us and we get on with whatever the “new normal” may be. We dinosaurs remember the years before 9/11 when we could accompany family and friends to the airline gate to see them off and be at the gate to welcome them home. Does anyone else of similar vintage remember those days? Yes, kids, there was such a time. Gone forever.

My ADR provider has had weekly zoom meetings to update its panel on the state of the courts, when they might reopen and what they will look like when they do. The provider also talks about when their offices might reopen, still to be determined, and what steps will be taken to ensure everyone’s safety and well-being, from the parties and their counsel, to the neutrals, to the staff. Given that we are in Los Angeles County, face masks and social distancing will be the way of the world for some time to come.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
So, the question then becomes how to conduct mediations? Option A: Go into the office and know that I can’t shake hands, have to sit at least six feet away from however many counsel and parties there are (that can be a logistical nightmare depending on how many) and be unable to get “up close and personal” when it’s needed. Several times when a case has settled at mediation either the plaintiff or defendant or both wanted to hug me in relief because the case is finally over. (At least I think that was the reason.) Obviously, personal contact is verboten.

How much facial expression can I see if there are masks covering everything but the eyes? Yes, I know the saying that the eyes are the window to the soul, but are the eyes sufficient, do they tell me enough?

Option B: use Zoom or whatever other method to conduct mediations. What do you think about that? Would you use that method or prefer to mediate face to face, to the extent possible these days? A recent unscientific poll showed that [judicial officers favored Zoom](https://www.judges.org/poll-of-virtual-court-operations/) over any other remote online platform.

Right now, I think that mediating via Zoom or whatever other platform is safer from a health perspective. Upsides? No need to commute to an office, no need to worry about face masks, and no need for social distancing from your client and the mediator. Downsides? You and your client are not in the same location, so you can’t deliver that gentle (or not so gentle) kick under the mediation table when your client says more than he should. Security issues that have arisen with Zoom bombing seem to have receded.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
From this mediator’s perspective, depending upon how the video is positioned, Option B doesn’t necessarily see body language. Fidgeting, leg jiggling, and other physical tics below the neck may offer clues that aren’t picked up otherwise.

And then there’s the age-old issue — older than mediation — getting the parties and counsel to agree to use this technology to try to get the case settled. Just as expected, some counsel are comfortable using it, while others are fearful. Is the case at the point where it is ready to settle and are parties and counsel ready? What’s the cost/benefit analysis of waiting some lengthy period of time for a trial date? From a plaintiff’s perspective, the answer is usually “there is none,” while a defendant’s perspective is often “we have the money, let’s keep it until we absolutely have to let it go.” Other defendants may roll their eyes as the legal fees continue to mount and would rather pay the plaintiff something than continue to pay their attorneys.

Even when the state courts do finally get back in business, Zooming will be the way of the legal world for many things. Case management conferences and motions are already being heard remotely and have been prepandemic. Jury trials? A Texas court has conducted a nonbinding summary trial on Zoom, with the hope that the case will settle at mediation. Even if nonbinding the jurors’ decision may make settlement easier as it [indicates how a full-blown trial](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-courts-texas/texas-tries-a-pandemic-first-a-jury-trial-by-zoom-idUSKBN22U1FE) might play out.

There’s been so much talk about legal innovation and how to apply it to the practice. Here is a perfect opportunity to see if legal innovation works in the context of a jury trial. California has had a summary jury trial procedure, but it’s been barely used. Given our herd mentality, I am not surprised. Thoughts of a lesser verdict, if one at all, and potential malpractice liability clutter the mind.

Will many people physically show up for jury duty in these pandemic times? It’s not just going through security, but what about temperature checks, people who are asymptomatic? Who will want to sit in a jury assembly room with hundreds of others, when you are clueless as to whether they are taking (have taken) similar precautions to stay safe? Just the thought of using a restroom in a courthouse may well be taking your life in your hands. The less said, the better.

So someone must lead the innovation, to take the risk, to try something new. I think Zoom jury trials may be the coming wave. How else are we going to get going again?

There’s no question that data and analytics have forever changed the way we practice law. The days when we fished around for anecdotal information to make major case and strategy decisions are long gone. Technology has put vast mountains of data at our fingertips, and [Lex Machina](https://bit.ly/3w44722) has been leading the charge when it comes to using data analytics to turn that data into winning case assessments and strategy.

Now, Lex Machina is raising the data bar even higher with [Quick Tools](https://bit.ly/3uXi14E), the easiest way to get instant access to Lex Machina’s underlying data and the most comprehensive analytics on the market, specifically curated to give you the information you need, right when you need it.

When you need an answer now, you need Quick Tools.

##What is Quick Tools?
Here’s a scenario you probably know all too well: your client calls you up with an obscure legal question out of the blue (probably late on a Friday afternoon) and wants an answer immediately, even though it’s not related to your current matter or possibly even to your area of expertise. In the past, you probably found some way to put them off with an answer that wasn’t really satisfactory to anyone involved. Then you started making calls or roaming the halls to question people who might know, followed by a stressful weekend of trying to prepare a solid answer for your client on Monday. But what if there was actually a way to find the answer and relay it in a matter of minutes?

Quick Tools is that way. It puts a universe of highly curated, in-depth litigation strategy information at your fingertips – information it might otherwise take you hours to cobble together. You get to demonstrate expertise to your clients while also having the confidence that you found the right answer quickly.

Of course, the phone call scenario is just one example of how Quick Tools is changing the way lawyers access information. Quick Tools gives you immediate access to data and intelligence that you won’t find anywhere else, via nine specific default tools that have been built based on customer feedback that Lex Machina has gathered over the years:

- COVID-19 Impact Analyzer
- Parties Comparator
- Courts & Judges Comparator
- Law Firms Comparator
- Early Case Assessor
- Motion Kickstarter
- Attorney Team Analyzer
- Patent Portfolio Evaluator
- Expert Witness Explorer
##How It Works
Your landing page for Quick Tools exists as a tab within the bigger Lex Machina platform, and on it you’ll see the full collection of legal analytics tools that have been created to give you instant access to information in nine discrete areas.

[](https://f.hubspotusercontent30.net/hubfs/470182/6.8.21%20Lex%20Machina%20Quick%20Tools%20Post/LM_1.png)Quick Tools is a more curated experience than you’ll get in the main Lex Machina platform, though it’s backed up by the same rich data, which is still available in the other tabs across the top of your screen. You can also link to the data in other areas of Lex Machina through the information displayed in Quick Tools. These tools are exclusive to Lex Machina – you won’t find this kind of curated analytics experience in any other product.

When you click into an individual tool, you’re guided through fields where you input basic information to get to the data you want, which is then produced in a report that can be viewed on a single scrollable page and easily shared. The comprehensive report is made up of analytics that typically take more than one search to replicate in the main Lex Machina platform, but you get it in a matter of minutes.

##A Closer Look
Each of the nine [Quick Tools](https://bit.ly/3uXi14E) is designed to give you quick access to curated information in a very specific area.

For example, if your client was sued in a contract case in Vermont and was wondering if they might fare better in California courts, you can go into the Courts & Judges Comparator and answer exactly that question in under two minutes.

[](https://f.hubspotusercontent30.net/hubfs/470182/6.8.21%20Lex%20Machina%20Quick%20Tools%20Post/LM_2.png)

[](https://f.hubspotusercontent30.net/hubfs/470182/6.8.21%20Lex%20Machina%20Quick%20Tools%20Post/LM_3.png)
Almost instantly, Quick Tools will show you the different contract case loads between your chosen jurisdictions, as well as how long those cases tend to last, what the typical damages are, and much more. If you have specific judges in mind within a given jurisdiction, you can compare on that level, too. With Quick Tools, you have data at your fingertips to make quick, informed decisions about the best way to proceed with cases from the instant they’re initially filed.

Quick Tools is also a powerful tool for onboarding new clients and matters. The Early Case Assessor is a great place to get valuable data that can help you understand what lies ahead, even if you’re not sure where to start with a new engagement. Just start by inputting the basic information about the opposing party like party name, opposing counsel, and type of case.

[](https://f.hubspotusercontent30.net/hubfs/470182/6.8.21%20Lex%20Machina%20Quick%20Tools%20Post/LM_4.png)

What you get in return is a comprehensive overview of the party’s history in similar matters – the most recent cases of the same type for that party, opposing counsel’s history representing that party, how often the cases reached trial, and much more.

[](https://f.hubspotusercontent30.net/hubfs/470182/6.8.21%20Lex%20Machina%20Quick%20Tools%20Post/LM_5.png)

While no one can ever guarantee litigation outcomes with complete certainty, the Early Case Assessor gives you a good, immediate snapshot of likely outcomes when your client is served and you get that dreaded Friday afternoon phone call asking you to predict the future. Quick Tools offers valuable data that’s integral to decision-making at all stages of your case, from inception through strategic decisions like motion practice and expert witnesses. 

The COVID-19 Impact Analyzer even gives you insight into which areas of law were most heavily impacted by the upheaval of 2020.

[](https://f.hubspotusercontent30.net/hubfs/470182/6.8.21%20Lex%20Machina%20Quick%20Tools%20Post/LM_6.png)
Whether you’re an in-house lawyer or outside counsel, you’ll find a Quick Tool that offers insight in some area of your practice that’s going to make your work easier, whether that’s assessing internal threat levels and litigation risks or deciding whether it’s worth it to bring a particular motion on your client’s behalf. If you’re less involved in day-to-day legal strategy, Quick Tools is designed to help you, too – when you’re not in the weeds on daily decision-making, Quick Tools is where you want to go to get up to speed quickly. If you spend all day every day litigating over patents, Quick Tools will curate the in-depth patent data you used to spend time amassing from multiple sources.

Lex Machina was already a powerful weapon to have in your arsenal, and [Quick Tools](https://bit.ly/3uXi14E) makes it even better. Instant access to curated data that you can refine and immediately share – it’s hard to imagine a more useful tool for today’s busy lawyer.

Much like the weather, bonus season is heating up!

After [getting roasted](https://www.instagram.com/p/CM4_8KrA82h/) by legal industry observers for sending out chocolate eggs (with Shearman branding, natch) while other Biglaw firm were announcing bonuses, Shearman & Sterling has decided the time has come to announce the market rate bonuses everyone pretty much assumed were in the offing. And you can buy yourself A LOT of chocolate with special bonuses this big!

The firm, ranked 42nd in the Am Law 100 with $968,164,000 gross revenue in 2019, will be matching the bonus scale set by Davis Polk, with July and October payment dates. And, as has become increasingly common, the second bonus payment will be the larger of the two:

# Lawyers Who Are Highly Stressed Are 22 Times More Likely To Consider Suicide
## This study is great cause for concern when it comes to the Biglaw model.

Biglaw is an incredibly demanding workplace environment, and associates continue to struggle with mental health issues due in large part to all of that stress. This is the reality in Biglaw firms across the globe, and according to a recently published study, the characteristics that define the perfect associate — those who bill around the clock and seek perfection in their work — tend to be predictors of suicidal ideation.

The study (available [here](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/11/4/536)), sponsored by the California Lawyers Association and the D.C. Bar, was based on a survey of almost 2,000 lawyers in California and Washington, D.C., and conducted by Krill Strategies and the University of Minnesota Department of Psychiatry in 2020. The study is the first of its kind, drawing data-backed connections between the legal profession’s stressors and thoughts of suicide among lawyers (including those who work at firms, in-house at corporate legal departments, within government agencies, and more).

Here are some of the study’s findings, as noted in the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/02/13/highly-stressed-lawyers-22-times-more-likely-to-consider-suicide-study-finds/):

[L]awyers who reported high stress levels were 22 times more likely to experience thoughts of suicide than lawyers with low stress, while lawyers with moderate stress were more than five times as likely. Lawyers who were highly “overcommitted” to their work—characterized by researchers as an all-encompassing level of devotion, a sentiment reflected in recent American Lawyer surveys of partners and associates—were more than twice as likely to consider suicide than those who maintained boundaries with their work.

On aggregate, 8.5% of lawyers surveyed reported suicidal thoughts, compared to 4.2% of the U.S. population age 18 and over. Junior associates, young attorneys, and attorneys working more than 60 hours per week were particularly at risk, and suicidal ideation was more common among racial and ethic minorities than among white attorneys. Bucking a broader societal trend, men in the legal profession were slightly more likely to experience suicidal ideation than women.

Patrick Krill, the law firm mental health consultant who co-authored the study, said, “We need to understand the full scope of consequences that can accompany the high stress of the profession and take it more seriously, because we know the strong association with suicidality.”

What are the leaders of these firms doing about these problems? Do they even care, so long as productivity expectations are met? While Biglaw firms have recommitted themselves to health and wellness in the wake of the pandemic, Krill suggests that they incorporate “boundary audits” into their programming, to ensure that associates aren’t overwhelmed with their workloads. Rather than simply assisting attorneys with the resultant stress that goes hand in hand with the intensity of their work, Krill believes it needs to be a two-way street. Biglaw firms must try to “reduce the amount of unnecessary inbound stress while giving lawyers access to more resources and tools to be healthy,” he said.

If you or someone you know is depressed and in need of help, please call the [Suicide & Crisis Lifeline](https://988lifeline.org/) (988) or a [lawyer assistance program](http://www.americanbar.org/groups/lawyer_assistance/resources/lap_programs_by_state.html) in your state. You can also get in touch with someone at the [Lawyers Depression Project](https://www.lawyersdepressionproject.org/). Remember that you are loved, so please reach out if you need assistance.

# What The Associate Compensation Bonanza Is Costing Biglaw
## Associates are getting expensive.

Associates have been — rightfully — cheering the deluge of money coming their way this year. Because the Biglaw lateral market is [super hot right now](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/the-biglaw-lateral-market-is-fire-right-now/) (we are talking [six-figure](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/biglaws-throwing-around-500000-signing-bonuses-in-red-hot-lateral-market/) signing bonuses), firms have had to respond — with money — to keep their associates. So we’ve seen [special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/special-bonus-tracker-2021/) and [raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/salary-wars-scorecard-tracker-2021/), and even retention bonuses on top of all that other money — if you’re lucky enough to work in a [super-valuable practice area](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/is-skadden-arps-handing-out-retention-bonuses-to-only-some-associates/).

But what has all this done to Biglaw’s bottom line?

According to the latest[ Peer Monitor Index report](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/legal/pmi-q3-2021-compensation-reality/) by Thomson Reuters, direct expenses are up 7.2 percent, driven largely by these compensation increases. As the report notes, “The increases in salary scale have never been as large or as frequent as they have in 2021.” And that might just be a little nerve-racking since associate compensation is “a potential profit sinkhole for firms, which spend hundreds of thousands of dollars per associate every year, while many of these associates operate at an effective loss for the year in terms of their collections.”

And all this spending hasn’t stemmed the flow of associates — firms experienced a 14 percent turnover in their lawyer ranks.

But there were lots of bright spots in the report for Biglaw. In the third quarter, compared with the same period a year ago, demand for legal services was up 4.4 percent; productivity was up 1.9 percent; and billing rates increased 3.7 percent. I’m sure Biglaw will be just fine in the long term, but it sure is interesting to find out just how much associate compensation is costing firms.

# The Incredible Shrinking Summer Associate Class

It was harder to get a coveted summer associate position in 2017 than it was the year before — and it’s only going to get worse.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/sites/americanlawyer/2018/01/25/summer-associate-hiring-slowed-at-largest-firms/) Law.com, National Association for Law Placement (NALP) data reveals that large law firms — those with more than 700 lawyers — actually cut back on the size of their summer associate classes in 2017.  This is the first decrease in class size since 2012, when recovery from the Great Recession first began.

The good(ish) news is that the summer associate classes aren’t that much smaller than they were in 2016 — the average class size in 2017 was 20, down from 22 for each firm office. But NALP executive director James Leipold cautions this is still a noteworthy decline in class size:

“This is a meaningful dip in recruiting at the largest firms,” NALP executive director James Leipold told the law firm recruiters and law school career services personnel assembled in New York Thursday for the the organization’s annual recruiting summit, where he revealed the latest figures. “For the last three or four years, we had this bump in Big Law recruiting as they regrew their summer classes. That has ended.”

The bad news is the data collected by NALP shows this downward trend will continue in 2018. During the most recent on-campus recruitment season, firms extended fewer offers for Summer 2018 positions than they did in 2017. The median number of offers fell 20 percent.

So good luck finding those Biglaw jobs, because looks like you’ll need it.

# Biglaw Firm Pushes First-Year Start Date To Summer 2021
## Oof! Are other law firms considering doing the same thing?

Thanks to the coronavirus crisis, Biglaw firms across the country have delayed the start dates of their incoming associates out of an abundance of caution. While it’s true that a few firms started their first-year associates this fall, the rest have opted to bring in the their new blood in or about January 2021. But now, we’re hearing that some first-year associates will be starting even later than that.

Which Biglaw firm will be punting some of its incoming associates into June 2021?

Sources have told us that Schiff Hardin — a firm that brought in $186,437,000 gross revenue in 2019, ranking 158th on the Am Law 200 — recently made this decision. If you recall, the firm instituted some of the [largest associate pay cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/50-percent-pay-cut-schiff-hardin/) we’d heard about during the height of the pandemic, with attorneys in certain practice areas taking an astonishing 50 percent hit. The firm [reinstated those compensation cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/biglaw-firm-that-cut-associate-compensation-by-up-to-50-percent-to-reinstate-full-salaries/) and will make all of its employees whole by the end of December, but these start date delays for first-year associates are a new bump in the road.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
We contacted the firm for comment, and received this statement from a spokesperson:

We have 10 first-year associates joining the firm; five are starting on January 4 and the other five will start on June 1. Those whose start date we delayed will receive a stipend from the firm.

When we asked for insight into why the Schiff Hardin decided to defer some of its associates until June 2021, a firm spokesperson told us, “It continues to be part of managing our business prudently through the pandemic.” That being the case, we certainly hope those stipends are generous because these new lawyers are losing almost an entire year of practice with the firm they hoped to call home.

Schiff Hardin is the first Biglaw firm we’ve heard of that’s made the decision to start some of its 2020 incoming associates so late in the game. Is this something that other firms are considering as well? Please email us at [tips@abovethelaw.com](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com) or text us at (646) 820-8477 to let us know.

Best of luck to the class of 2020 Schiff Hardin associates who will start their careers at the firm a few months after their colleagues in the same class year and a few months before class of 2021 associates are slated to start theirs. The unique situation these associates face will be interesting, to say the least.

## Another firm says yes to raises!

Another Biglaw firm has decided to match the new associate compensation scale established last week by Cravath.

Associates fishing for raises at Fish & Richardson were rewarded today. The firm, ranked 92nd on the most recent Am Law 100 with $512,043,000 in gross revenue last year, announced a brand new compensation scale, but one that is increasingly familiar to Biglaw observers.

Effective January 1, the new compensation grid at Fish is as follows:



You’ll notice the firm has not announced their year-end bonuses. The firm eschews lockstep bonus grids for individualized merit bonuses, and the firm insists for “a number of associates” bonuses are above the market standard.

You can read the full memo on [the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/fish-compensation-23/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Biglaw Firm Uses Technology As A Defense In Discrimination Case
## Those are some pretty explosive allegations.

Dechert is arguing that cloud-based computing technology, not gender and age discrimination, is the reason behind letting go some of their employees. Back in November, Patricia Gindhart, 58, and Dana Dudek, 55, sued the Biglaw giant alleging they were fired from their jobs in the payroll department of the firm as a result of age and/or gender bias. Gindhart and Dudek filed complaints about their termination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and received right to sue letters in August.

The plaintiffs, each of whom spent over 25 years in the payroll department at Dechert, claim administrative leaders made comments that revealed their bias against older women, as detailed in the complaint:

“Gindhart’s termination came on the heels of several complaints she raised with defendant that she was being discriminated against because of her age and/or her sex,” the complaint says. “By way of example, plaintiff Gindhart complained about a culture of bias against older and/or female employees at [Dechert], which included a supervisor calling long-term female employees ‘cows’ and the encouragement of a ‘boys club’ that resulted in beneficial treatment for certain younger, male employees of defendant.”

Those are some pretty explosive allegations. But, in an answer filed this week, the firm claims “[d]iscrimination played no role in Dechert’s employment decisions,” and instead insists that technology made the plaintiffs’ positions obsolete, as [reported by](https://www.law.com/sites/thelegalintelligencer/2018/01/30/dechert-says-tech-not-gender-spurred-staff-layoffs/) Law.com:

“Dechert moved to a cloud-based application for finance and human resources and then outsourced its payroll function to streamline processes, improve efficiencies, and implement needed controls,” the answer said. “As a result, the positions held by plaintiffs were eliminated. The decision to terminate plaintiffs’ employment had nothing to do with plaintiffs’ age or gender or any retaliatory motive.”

We’ll have to wait and see if this tech defense works.

Jim Gilliland

Terrible news from San Francisco. Kilpatrick Townsend partner [James Gilliland, Jr.](http://www.kilpatricktownsend.com/en/Who_We_Are/Professionals/G/GillilandJrJamesG14932.aspx) was shot outside of his house on Thursday.

According to police Lt. Robert De La Campa, Gilliland had just returned home from a social event, parked his car and was shot on his front porch. Police are still investigating possible motives for the murder, as [reported by](http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/El-Cerrito-resident-comes-home-to-gunman-dies-on-10419699.php) SF Gate:

It was not known whether Gilliland was stalked or followed, whether he was the victim of a robbery, or whether the victim and gunman knew one another, De La Campa said.

A few residents remembered seeing a white car, and someone running, around the same time as the shooting, he said. Others said they heard loud gunshots.

“I heard the shots, but honestly I didn’t make the connection to gunshots,” said neighbor Roberta Binarelli. “I thought it was fireworks. I thought, ‘What are they celebrating?’”

Gilliland’s practice focused on intellectual property litigation, and his clients included Apple, Sony, and Oracle. The firm is understandably shocked by Gilliland’s death, and released a [statement](http://www.kilpatricktownsend.com/en/Knowledge_Center/Newsroom/News_Releases/2016/10/In_Memoriam_Jim_Gilliland.aspx):

We are deeply saddened by the death of our colleague, friend and partner, Jim Gilliland. Our most heartfelt condolences and sympathies go to Jim’s family and all of his colleagues, friends and clients.

Jim was dedicated to his wife, Vickie, his four children and his parents. They were the center of his life. His passions spanned from spending time with his family to singing, enjoying the arts, travel and sports.

Jim was an absolute pillar of our law firm. He was our trusted colleague and close friend, as well as a mentor and role model to so many. Jim will be missed deeply. He was truly a great lawyer, and his many clients trusted him with their most difficult cases. Jim had been successfully trying cases in federal and state courts around the country for 35 years. Over his amazing career, Jim led our firm in many ways — as Managing Partner, Chairman, and most recently served as Chairman of our Litigation Department.

It is truly a great loss for the Kilpatrick Townsend family and the legal community. We offer our thoughts and prayers to Jim’s family and friends.

Our thoughts go out to the family and friends of this prominent lawyer.

# Biglaw Associates Really Hate The Billable Hour
## Save the associates, kill the billable hour.

The billable hour is a cancer that will slowly eat away at you if you don’t get away from it quickly enough.

— a Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath midlevel associate’s comments on the billable hour in the [American Lawyer’s 2022 Midlevel Associate Survey](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/08/03/midlevels-are-happy-but-they-are-yearning-for-more/). Over three-quarters of survey respondents said their jobs had “significantly” affected their mental health, and more than half said they’d turn in their resignations to get more work-life balance.

Along with many other achievements, this month — and especially this weekend — we can all celebrate the progress made toward a more inclusive definition of “family.”

Our current information on firms’ family leave and related policies can be seen [here](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/parental-leave-and-related-policies-by-firm-2015/?rf=1).

We encourage law firms to [email](mailto:research@breakingmedia.com) us updates, revisions or corrections.

I think the program served its purpose which was to allow companies to keep people on the payroll that they would otherwise lay off. Now as we sit here with a booming stock market, people tend to have short memories about what the world was like back then.

— Ronald Schutz, chair of Robins Kaplan, commenting on the [lifeboat that Paycheck Protection Program loans offered for law firms](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/07/08/am-law-firms-get-210-million-in-ppp-loans-forgiven/) amid the worst of the pandemic. Am Law 200 firms received roughly $330 million in PPP loans, and 27 of them have had their loans fully or partially forgiven. The following firms have had their loans, totaling roughly $210 million, forgiven: Thompson & Knight; Armstrong Teasdale; Robins Kaplan; Bond, Schoeneck & King; Hodgson Russ; Lewis Roca Rothgerber Christie; Allen Matkins Leck Gamble Mallory & Natsis; Day Pitney; Robinson & Cole; Morris, Manning, & Martin; Phelps Dunbar; Miles & Stockbridge; Miller, Canfield, Paddock and Stone; McElroy Deutsch Mulvaney & Carpenter; Shumaker, Loop & Kendrick; Schiff Hardin; Cole, Scott & Kissane; Ice Miller; Rutan & Tucker; Smith, Gambrell & Russell; Benesch, Friedlander, Coplan & Aronoff; Buchalter; Hinckley, Allen & Snyder; Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle; Arnall Golden Gregory; Williams Mullen; and Shutts & Bowen.

15 years of “How Appealing” — Reflections from the author: On Saturday, May 6, 2017, this blog will celebrate its 15th birthday. Fittingly, I will be in Atlanta then, looking forward to attending a baseball game with my family that evening at [SunTrust Park](http://mlb.mlb.com/atl/ballpark/index.jsp), the [St. Louis Cardinals](http://www.cardinals.com) at the [Atlanta Braves](http://www.braves.com). This weekend’s focus will be, as it should be, on my son, who on Monday will graduate from college and who, in the fall, will embark on his law school career.

During the 15 years that this blog has been in existence, five justices have departed from, and another five justices have joined, the [U.S. Supreme Court](http://www.supremecourt.gov). This blog chronicled it all. The [Philadelphia Phillies](http://www.phillies.com) reached the World Series twice, winning once. [This blog chronicled that](http://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/103008.html#030895), too. Over the past 15 years, my wife and I have celebrated our 15th, 20th, and 25th wedding anniversaries. My son was 7 years old when this blog began; today he is 22. In February 2004, I decided to launch my solo appellate practice in suburban Philadelphia, and every year has been better than the last. Aside from everything else that my solo appellate practice has allowed me to do, it also afforded more time for me to spend both with my family and publishing posts here at “How Appealing.”

Over the past decade and a half, this blog has posted countless installments of “[In Bashman News from Australia](http://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/030216.html#065992)” and far fewer installments of “[In Bashman Newz from New Zealand](http://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/062911.html#042167).” One of my favorite instances of “Bashman News” during this blog’s tenure originated from London in [this article](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/police-allegedly-tell-south-london-bar-to-stop-playing-john-paul-sean-paul-and-bashman-bashment-a6938766.html), which I’m not sure I previously linked to.

During this blog’s lifespan, I have learned that this blog’s readers include both Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. and [a man](http://howappealing.law.com/2003_10_01_appellateblog_archive.html#106581307109731465) who really wants [to visit his local public library without wearing shoes](http://howappealing.law.com/2003_10_01_appellateblog_archive.html#106579245368964123). For me, meeting so many of this blog’s readers in person has been one of the greatest rewards of this endeavor. Here’s hoping I can meet many more of you in the years ahead.

Finally, thanks to all of this blog’s readers who have already sent emails to [appellateblog@hotmail.com](mailto:appellateblog@hotmail.com) describing what “How Appealing” means to them, why they read this blog, what they like or dislike about it, or describing a moment in the history of this blog that was memorable for them. I will begin publishing those emails on Wednesday of next week, so that you can see for yourselves what a wonderful group of readers this blog is fortunate to have. Thanks again for making this possible!

# Blazing A Trail For Women, Then And Now
## Barbara Walters wasn’t a lawyer, but she paved the way for all women who sought to break out of the mold that had stifled them in all professions for so long.

Barbara Walters died last week. For those of you born in the 1990s or later, her name might not mean much, if anything. Her “old-fashioned” journalism has been replaced, at least to a substantial extent, by social media, podcasts, and other styles of providing and sharing contemporary information. Considered to be the first woman to break the glass ceiling of male-only television news anchors, she was a pioneer for women in TV news, but she was much more than that.

She wasn’t a lawyer, so why am I writing about her? Because she paved the way, not just for women in journalism, but for all women who sought to break out of the mold that had stifled women in all professions for so long. She showed that women could do everything and anything that men could. She upended the claims that women could not be competent professionals (which we were long beforehand, but no one recognized or even acknowledged that). And [even today, it’s still an uphill slog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRapiocnwYQ).

Walters was named a “co-host” of NBC’s Today show after working on the program for 11 years. (I put the term in quotes, and you’ll understand why in a few succeeding words.) While she was allowed to participate in newsmaker interviews, she was prohibited from asking any questions until the male co-host (Frank McGee) asked not one, not two, but three.

Do you think that any woman would countenance being treated like that today? Don’t you think it still happens when [judges instruct senior partners](https://nextgenlawyers.com/judicial-orders-promoting-next-gen/) to permit associates to make arguments in court?

In 1976, she moved to ABC News where she was the first woman anchor to be paid $1 million a year, but her pairing with anchor Harry Reasoner, who could barely conceal his disdain for her, flopped. Walters went on to other assignments at the network. Reasoner remained as sole anchor. Sexism? You think?

Walters fought the battles she needed to fight to do what she wanted to do, what she wanted to become, and to be respected for her talents and abilities.

For many of the women who embarked on professional careers during those times (the 1960s and 1970s), hard choices had to be made between the professional and the personal. There were no family leaves, no disability leaves for pregnancy. Women often had to make a difficult choice between motherhood and career because, for whatever the reasons, we couldn’t have both. The “mommy track” was how it was phrased, and unfortunately, it still exists today.

Walters discussed that she had to make that choice and it pained her that she had sacrificed the personal for the professional, the age-old question of whether in retrospect, it is more important to spend time with family than landing the big story or, in our profession, the big reputation-making case. The deathbed question of which is more important: family or work?

Is there a legacy of Barbara Walters that applies to women in the law?

Her legacy, [her hope, is that her story helps young women](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osGACNDvouQ) aspire.

Today, women who are looking at partnership are legitimately concerned if that they take off time for maternity leave, they will be derailed off the partnership track. [Threads on Fishbowl](https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/hello-i-am-a-first-year-associate-and-just-learned-that-i-am-pregnant-due-sept-2023-anything-i-should-know-before-communicating-the) show that the concern is alive and real.

Most, if not all, women lawyers have had mentors — known, unknown, or both — who have helped us along the way, who have given us a step up. Take the time to let them know the role they have played in helping you along, even if you haven’t been in touch with them for years or even decades. Even just a heartfelt thank you email will do.

Slow forward (certainly not fast) from the sacrifices that so many women lawyers have made along the way to today. Within the past year, we have seen Ketanji Brown Jackson take her seat on the U.S. Supreme Court as an associate justice, the first Black woman to have a seat on that court. Now, Kyra Harris Bolden becomes the first Black woman associate justice on the Michigan Supreme Court.

Appointed by Michigan Gov. Gretchen Witmer, Justice Bolden’s [personal history](https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2023/01/02/kyra-harris-bolden-michigan-supreme-court-first-black-woman-justice-harlow-dnt-cnntm-contd-ldn-vpx.cnn) includes the shocking scar of racism. Her great grandfather was lynched in Tennessee in 1939 because he asked for a receipt for a purchase he had made, something that white people never had any problem requesting and receiving. Her great grandfather was beaten and castrated and thrown into a local river. The coroner said it was an “accidental drowning” and thus, the two men accused of his murder were never prosecuted. That was one of the reasons that Bolden decided to pursue a life in the law. Her aspirations became reality.

And here in California, we now have the first Latina Supreme Court chief justice, Patricia Guerrero, in a state that is just under 40% Latino. We also now have the first openly lesbian woman of color Supreme Court associate justice, Kelli Evans. All these appointments are evidence of what courts should look like in 21st century America. Incremental progress, but progress indeed. Finally.

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

# Another Biglaw Heavy Hitter Announces Bonuses -- Both Year-End And Special Bonuses!!!

We have yet another bonus announcement today! This time Milbank is weighing in with a bonus announcement of its own.

The firm, which took in $1,235,499,000 in gross revenue in 2020 making it 30th on the AmLaw 100, is no stranger to the compensation wars. Remember Milbank was the[ first firm to raise associate salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/milbank-raises-21/) this year. Sure, they were [outdone by Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/davis-polk-salary-21/), but they matched that [scale quickly.](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/milbank-re-raises/) So now that their foil, [Davis Polk has announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/davis-polk-bonuses-21/) its year-end bonuses and topped those with an additional special bonus, what does Milbank have to say about bonuses?

Milbank has announced the following, increasingly familiar, scale:



With Milbank’s announcement (and match of the DPW scale), there aren’t many more spoiler firms left that may up the Biglaw bonuses this year. So these — very generous — bonuses (both the year-end and special bonuses) are what the market will likely coalesce around.

The full memo is [available on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/milbank-bonuses-21/2/).

# Stat Of The Week: A Historic Wave Of Early Ballots

“Last night felt like Christmas Eve,” [according to one voter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/early-voting-2020-election/2020/10/14/500c22ce-0d90-11eb-8a35-237ef1eb2ef7_story.html) who showed up just as his polling place first opened. 

“It’s crazy,” is how a [political scientist put it](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-virus-outbreak-politics-voting-elections-efd6eefbd3d140bdc8909360de0bff62). 

Early-voting data reported this week — and quotes like the ones above from The Washington Post and Associated Press — reveal that the combination of voter enthusiasm and the coronavirus pandemic is adding some unprecedented metrics to the 2020 election.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Over 17 million Americans have already voted in the 2020 race, representing “a record-setting avalanche” that is “leading election experts to predict that a record 150 million votes may be cast,” the [Associated Press reported](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-virus-outbreak-politics-voting-elections-efd6eefbd3d140bdc8909360de0bff62) on Friday: 

The total represents 12% of all the votes cast in the 2016 presidential election, even as eight states are not yet reporting their totals and voters still have more than two weeks to cast ballots. ”

In a [feature](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mail-balloting-is-fueling-historic-early-voting-in-the-2020-election-11602591220) on Wednesday detailing its early-voting data, The Wall Street Journal noted that more than 2 million voters had cast ballots at polling places and 12.5 million early votes were mail ballots. The publication added that rules surrounding mail voting are already the subject of numerous legal battles, including one before the U.S. Supreme Court. 

As for November:

Election officials already talk about ‘Election Week’ rather than ‘Election Day’ and urge voters to see a lengthy count in close contests as normal.”

In its [report on Wednesday](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/early-voting-2020-election/2020/10/14/500c22ce-0d90-11eb-8a35-237ef1eb2ef7_story.html), however, The Washington Post did note the potential for some clarity on election night — just 18 days away: 

If the presidential race boils down to Pennsylvania … there is little chance a result will be available on Nov. 3, since tabulation of mail ballots may not begin until that morning, and ballots may arrive as late as Nov. 6. Election officers in Philadelphia were still counting mail ballots two weeks after the state’s June primary.

Yet some potentially pivotal results are expected shortly after polls close, according to a Post analysis of early vote totals and state rules governing mail balloting. Thanks to surges in early and absentee voting, looser rules for processing and counting mail ballots, and active preparation by election officials, voters in critical states such as Florida and North Carolina can expect to see advanced results on election night, if everything goes to plan.”

# Biglaw Firm Hit With Record Fine For Failure To Prevent Partner's 'Dubious' Scheme
## Don't mess with legal ethics.

They are not messing around with legal ethics on the other side of the pond. In the U.K., the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal (SDT) recently announced a record-breaking fine against the Biglaw firm of Locke Lord, assessing them £500,000 ($656,000) for failure to stop the “dubious” investment scheme of a London-based partner.

The issue began in 2012, when Jonathan Denton was hired by the firm, shortly after they’d opened their London office. Only a few months later he incorporated two companies, Ikaya — for which Denton was sole director — and Slonne — which operated an “investment scheme offering very high yields” — which then turned around and hired Locke Lord as its lawyer, with Denton as the client partner.

In retrospect, the Biglaw outfit acknowledged this created “a certain mixing” of Denton’s roles as director of Ikaya and as law firm partner. As Law.com [reports](https://www.law.com/international/sites/international/2017/11/13/sdt-locke-lord-judgment-reveals-details-of-partners-dubious-21m-investment-scheme-and-airport-arrest/), the SDT judgment lays out the questionable transfers of funds that followed:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The judgment states that Denton and Locke Lord advised Ikaya “in relation to seven investment trusts during the retainer” between September 2012 and June 2015, during which time Denton billed a total of 1,424.9 hours, delivering invoices from the firm to Ikaya totaling £532,045 ($697,298), $657,194 and €286,902 ($334,628). Approximately £21 million ($27.5 million) was paid into the firm’s client account by investors during that period.

Despite Denton’s efforts to assure those putting money into the scheme that their capital would be safe, and that he could achieve monthly returns of 6 percent, the judgment states that “there did not appear to be any verifiable returns to investors.”

By 2013, Locke Lord received an inquiry about investors’ money from the FBI and another, separate one from the Metropolitan Police Service. In 2014, the firm was receiving complaints from investors and the firm’s compliance officer for legal practice raised some concerns about the arrangement. But it wasn’t until 2015 when the firm received yet another complaint from North Yorkshire Police that Denton was fired — though he was given the courtesy of three-months notice. In October of 2015 — after he’d formally left the firm — Denton was arrested in the Birmingham airport.

The fine meted out by the SDT is double the previous record fine. Locke Lord says they’ve now made substantial “changes and improvements” to their controls and systems to assess and catch conflicts of interest. After this mess, I’d certainly hope so.

# Biglaw Firm Assures Associates They'll Get Market Compensation
## Curious way to announce raises.

It’s a volatile time for Biglaw associate compensation. Though the market has largely settled on “the [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/), as [amended with regard to bonus structure by Simpson](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/), as further modified [for senior associates in accordance with Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) scale” ([TM Above the Law’s own Joe Patrice](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/sullivan-cromwell-matches-salaries-we-think/)), there’s still the risk that another firm might come over the top, leaving your raise announcement outdated. So what’s a firm to do?

Well, at Ropes & Gray, they’ve decided to eschew a straightforward chart that details the exact dollar amount each class year can expect in compensation and in special bonuses, instead assuring associates they are getting raise and bonuses “in line with the most recent market changes.”

So maybe this is a savvy CYA move just in case there are further developments in the salary wars. Perhaps they’re hoping some regional markets will settle on a lower scale. Or it could be they were too tired to type all those numbers out. But if anyone at the firm needs help knowing where the market settles, [we’ve got your back.](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises-2018/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Biglaw Firms Can Be A Liability To Clients

Many people believe that Biglaw firms are the best shops to handle a given legal issue since they have the most experience and resources to work on a matter. It is true that many matters that require substantial effort, and in which the stakes are high, might be best handled by Biglaw shops that can flex their muscle in order to solve a client’s issues. However, in many situations, Biglaw firms can actually be a liability to clients. As a result, clients should use a mix of firms in order to handle their legal work so that they can avoid situations in which Biglaw firms present challenges for clients.

One of the biggest liabilities of Biglaw shops are their high fees. It is well-known that Biglaw firms charge rates that are sometimes double, triple, or more than the market rate for legal work in their area. It is not uncommon for Biglaw shops to charge the same rate for a first-year associate that a seasoned partner at a smaller firm charges, and this can impact a client’s bottom line. The rates charged by a Biglaw shop can impact the amount of effort a client wishes to exert in order to solve a given matter and which strategies they wish to pursue in their case.

For instance, many clients have a figure in mind that they view as “nuisance value” on a case. This is the amount of money that will be spent on legal fees and expenses in order to not be involved in litigation. Many clients would rather pay what they believe is nuisance value in order to resolve a matter rather than litigate a case since they would presumably have to spend this money anyways and paying this cost ensures finality in the litigation.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
When a client uses a Biglaw firm, the amount a client views as nuisance value could be double, triple, or even higher than the amount would be if the client chose a smaller shop. This makes it more likely that a client will just pay nuisance value than litigate a case, even if the client has meritorious arguments. Indeed, I have been involved in matters with Biglaw shops over the years in which my adversaries flexed their muscles at the beginning of the litigation but then settled earlier on than I was used to. These Biglaw attorneys sometimes told me that their clients knew they would spend more money if they litigated a case than if they just settled, and this issue is exacerbated with higher-paid Biglaw firms. Clients can have more flexibility to keep litigating matters if they choose counsel that is less expensive.

The high rates charged by Biglaw firms can also impact the strategies employed in a case. Clients may be less willing to pay for certain strategies since it might cost tens of thousands of dollars for a Biglaw firm to prepare papers, and clients may not wish to spend the money if they are not assured of a favorable outcome. For instance, at the beginning of a lawsuit, parties are usually able to either answer the complaint or file a motion to dismiss. If a motion to dismiss is denied, clients then need to answer the complaint anyways.

Clients who are worried about the high cost of a Biglaw firm may be less willing to pay for a motion to dismiss, thinking that this will just waste time, and they will need to answer the complaint at some point anyways. However, sometimes clients have at least some chance of getting some or all causes of action dismissed, and they should file a motion to dismiss to at least try to dismiss counts against them. Nevertheless, clients can sometimes be hamstrung by Biglaw shops that can indirectly limit the options they have at their disposal during litigation.

Moreover, the way that Biglaw shops delegate work may be a liability to clients. At Biglaw shops, partners usually interact with clients and delegate work to associates. This allows the partners to work on business and client development, which can help the firm maximize billing. Sometimes, partners need to assign projects to associates. Associates are billed out at a lower rate, and partners know that they can get more work done on a budget if associates work on tasks. This is very different from other firms in which attorneys are more likely to handle all aspects of a case, including client interaction and all of the other tasks that are involved with working on a matter.

Some bigger clients may not mind not interacting with the people that are actually doing the work. However, some clients appreciate talking directly with all of the attorneys performing work on a file. In addition, this helps ensure that attorneys who are performing the legal work have all of the information needed for a representation without going through a partner, who can distort the details. How Biglaw firms are structured can lead to communication issues and problems in workflow that are not present at other firms.

In the end, Biglaw firms can be a great resource, but they should not be used on all types of work. Sometimes, Biglaw firms can be a liability to clients since they can limit the options available to clients and create barriers between clients and the ones who perform their legal work.

# Public Posts Mentioning Goodwin's Layoffs Keep Disappearing...

Goodwin’s employment roller coaster [kicked off 2023 with layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/am-law-20-firm-begins-layoffs/) followed immediately [with a big ticket lateral haul](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/sure-goodwin-just-laid-off-a-bunch-of-lawyers-but-that-doesnt-mean-theyre-going-to-stop-adding-laterals/) and then [more “performance review” cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/goodwin-is-conducting-performance-reviews-that-have-resulted-in-job-cuts/). If you’re wondering about the current status of the layoff yo-yo, good luck! Because Fishbowl posts about layoffs keep disappearing.

Fishbowl offers insiders an opportunity to post their tips and insights about a workplace for without much filter. It provides a nice impression of a company when taken with the appropriate grain of salt. If you know enough to navigate the nuanced difference between accepting an anonymous tip saying a firm is a sweatshop and “what does it say about the culture that someone perceives it as a sweatshop?” then Fishbowl can be a useful resource.

When attorneys get laid off, the first place they should go is, of course, the [Above the Law tips line](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com). But they also go to Fishbowl where they can expand on their personal experience for the benefit of prospective employees.

So it’s a little weird that Goodwin posts keep disappearing:



“Reason:other” doesn’t breed a lot of confidence in the moderation. While the original post is missing, there’s no indication that it breached any of the [community guidelines](https://help.glassdoor.com/s/article/Community-Guidelines?language=en_US), which claim that the platform will “Welcome Positive & Negative Content” while barring content that is abusive or threatening. The guidelines allow posts to be taken down for “misinformation” though there’s no indication that the post fits that bill.

Another layoff post appears to have disappeared that used the word “damn” though not in any kind of threatening manner. That might be an overactive moderation bot.

And then there’s more…



And folks have followed this advice!

What gives over at Fishbowl? Would Fishbowl consider layoff posts as “misinformation” if the firm cast the terminations as “performance-related” or something? It would be fairly aggressive moderation to pass judgment on whether or not someone describing their own termination amounted to a stealth layoff.

If that was the source of the problem, the moderators seem to have decided it was an unwinnable game of whack-a-mole because several posts referencing Goodwin layoffs from this week are now up. For example:

# More Associate Salaries Slashed At Am Law 100 Firm
## Plus 'confusing' furloughs at the firm.

We are now several months into the COVID-19 health crisis, and it’s increasingly clear there’s no solution on the immediate horizon. Faced with the prospect of even more economic uncertainty caused by the novel coronavirus, Biglaw firm are making tough choices to cut costs and maintain, as much as possible, their cash flow.

The latest firm making these COVID-19 austerity measures is Locke Lord, ranked 76th on the [most recent Am Law 100 ranking](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/04/21/the-2020-am-law-100-ranked-by-gross-revenue/#). But as we’ve seen over and over, even historically successful firms have deemed it prudent to start making cuts now.

So what is going on at Locke Lord? According to Above the Law tipsters, they’re doing a 10 percent cut in associate salaries that began May 1 and are anticipated to continue through the end of the year. (And tipsters say this move is “in addition to the 15 percent of associate salary tied up in ‘automatic bonuses’ that get paid out Dec 31 at the 2050 hours threshold.”)

Plus, sources at the firm say there have been some staff furloughs that were initially described as folks who could not do their jobs remotely. However, tipsters describe the situation as “confusing” and they’re learning exactly who was let go “by getting automatic bounce back emails.” Not exactly the model of transparency one might hope for.

UPDATE: Another tipster wrote in to share they have a different perspective on how the staff layoffs are proceeding:

I disagree with the lack of transparency comment. We were given a floor-wide email when a staffer was let go. Unless they do a firm-wide notification when anyone gets fired, how are people going to know someone gets fired until they try to contact them? We also had firm-wide calls with Q&A time and the offer to answer emailed questions privately, so any confusion seems to be the result of the unpredictable nature of this crisis, not the firm’s response.

We reached out to the firm for comment, but have yet to hear back.

# Biglaw Firm Hired For Andrew Cuomo Impeachment Investigation
## Of course a Biglaw firm is leading the investigation, but which one got the nod?

When the New York state Assembly hired a law firm to investigate the allegations swirling around Governor Andrew Cuomo, it was always going to be an elite firm. Maybe a top-flight boutique, but probably a ginormous Biglaw firm able to wield the legal know-how and brute force necessary to handle such a high-profile investigation.

Biglaw firm Davis Polk got the nod for this assignment. Today, Speaker Carl Heastie and Judiciary Committee Chair Charles D. Lavine [made the announcement](https://www.assembly.state.ny.us/Press/?sec=story&story=96075):

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“Since Thursday, Chairman Lavine led a vigorous search for a top-flight firm to assist with the investigation. I have the utmost faith that Assemblymember Lavine and our Judiciary Committee will conduct a full and fair investigation,” Speaker Heastie said. “Hiring Davis Polk will give the Committee the experience, independence and resources needed to handle this important investigation in a thorough and expeditious manner.”

“The addition of Davis Polk will allow my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee and me to fully and fairly investigate the allegations,” Assemblymember Lavine said. “These are serious allegations, and they will be treated with fairness, due process and discretion.”

The matter will be led by partners [Angela Burgess](https://www.davispolk.com/professionals/angela-burgess), [Greg Andres](https://www.davispolk.com/professionals/greg-andres), and [Martine Beamon](https://www.davispolk.com/professionals/martine-beamon), and “[t]hey are authorized to vigorously pursue all the evidence to determine the extent to which violations of the law have occurred.” We’re all waiting to see what they turn up.

But not everyone is optimistic about DPW’s involvement. Debra Katz, attorney for one of the former Cuomo aides alleging sexual harassment, [points to Davis Polk’s connection](https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/new-york-assembly-hires-top-flight-law-firm-for-impeachment-investigation-into-gov-andrew-cuomo/?utm_source=mostpopular) to one of Cuomo’s political allies, New York Court of Appeals Chief Judge Janet DiFiore. DiFiore is married to Dennis Glazer, a former partner at the firm:

“Political independence is fundamental to the integrity of the investigation. We were alarmed to learn that Speaker Heastie has hired Davis Polk to assist with the investigation, given the connection between Dennis Glazer, who spent more than 30 years as a partner at Davis Polk, and the Governor. This is an unacceptable conflict of interest,” the attorney for [former aide Charlotte] Bennett said in a Wednesday morning statement. “The impeachment investigation must operate free of political influence and must be transparent, detailing for the public the steps being taken to protect the integrity of their impeachment investigation. We already know the extent to which Governor Cuomo has surrounded himself with people in the Executive Chamber who enabled his behavior and swept evidence of sexual harassment under the rug. If there is even a hint of political influence in the impeachment investigation, it will taint the entire proceedings.”

“While Ms. Bennett is committed to cooperating with all appropriate governmental inquiries, including the impeachment investigation, the involvement of Davis Polk gives her pause. I suspect it will have the same effect on other women who were sexually harassed by the governor,” Katz added.
