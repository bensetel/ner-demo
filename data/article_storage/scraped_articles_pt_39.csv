A disciplinary complaint by the Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission against former Vedder Price partner Robert Hankes has all the trappings of a throughly entertaining story. There is a fired parter, alleged fake invoices, misused client accounts and golf fees that just have to be paid.

According to the complaint, Hankes, a one-time member of Vedder Price’s transportation finance team, faked invoices for more than $130,000 in fraudulent payments. Hankes was allegedly terminated by Vedder Price on Oct. 2, 2019 over the scheme, which had begun in January of 2018. Hankes was home grown at Vedder Price, he began working there in 2005 as a summer associate, and was made partner in 2014. Before joining the firm, Hankes, also a CPA, was auditor at Arthur Andersen and a financial analyst with Winston & Strawn.

As for the details of the alleged fraud, Law.com [has the skinny:](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/01/14/ex-vedder-price-shareholder-accused-of-faking-invoices-double-billing/)

The complaint asserts that while Hankes was employed by Vedder Price, the firm did work for a unnamed financial institution and sometimes billed fees for services to the financial institution’s customers, as the client directed.

Sometime before January 2018, the firm billed about $23,783 in work for a customer of the financial institution. Hankes allegedly reactivated an unrelated client account, fabricated an invoice for the billed amount, and deposited the payment as a credit into the reopened account, which he controlled. Hankes also billed the financial institution with the correct billing number and applied the payment to its account.

There were another eight allegedly fabricated invoices according to the complaint the resulted in double-billing the financial institution and its clients. The complaint also alleges that during this period Hankes would charge the dormant account for expenses including golfing, dining and travel and got reimbursed to the tune of at least $79,790.

Hankes has not issued a statement about the complaint, but he his bar status is voluntarily inactive and not licensed to practice in Illinois. As for the firm, they say they’ve refunded clients who were double-billed but did not provide further comment.

# Take The Leap!
## Ever consider reinventing your law career? Whether it's changing practice areas or specialties, moving from litigation to transactional practice, or hanging your shingle, there is a path forward for radical reinvention.

But also: risk-averse.

Anticipating and managing risk is what we do every day as lawyers. The legal profession also tends to reward conservatism and staying the course (hello, partner track). As moms, we seek stability to support our families. Many of us settle for good-enough jobs. We shoot down dreams of an unconventional law practice or a more-balanced work life. We put our heads down and grind, trusting that our hard work will be rewarded. We stay in practice areas that we developed in an earlier period of our lives (often, the pre-kids one) that may no longer fit who we are today, but we feel we are in too deep to make a change.

When risk aversion collides with a poor career fit, the result is unhappiness.

Changing firms, moving in-house, or in or out of a government position can address the problem for some of us (or mask it for a while). But for others, more dramatic measures may be required. Those of us who are chronically dissatisfied with our jobs but want to remain in the legal profession owe it to ourselves to consider radical reinvention.

As moms, we’ve heard the parenting adage in reference to young children: “The days are long, but the years are short.” I offer this variation for us as lawyers: “Our legal careers are long, but our lives are short.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
There is enough time in our legal careers to reinvent ourselves as attorneys, and even to do so multiple times. We can add practice areas or change them completely. We can let go of litigation or embrace it. We can develop a fully transactional practice after years spent in court. We are armed with law degrees and bar registration cards, and we are smart and resilient, and all the qualities in between. A legal career can be satisfying, engaging, and (appropriately) lucrative.  Life is too short, and we work too hard to remain unhappy in a profession that holds as many opportunities as law.

It took me too long to learn this lesson. I came up as a transactional attorney, working primarily on business and commercial real estate deals. My first law firm associate position introduced me to the idea that successful, prestigious lawyers stay in their lanes. My fellow associates and I quickly fell in line, reaching higher and higher for the brass ring in our chosen (or default?) practice area. However, things did not click for me, no matter how hard I worked or how successful I was in my practice area. I moved to different firms and then in-house, but there was no fundamental change. It seemed easier to stay on the well-worn path. I started wondering “is that all there is?” constantly.

As it turned out, that was not all there is for me. While law continued to be frustrating, two wonderful little boys joined our family. The infusion of child joy into my life was amazing, and it highlighted the lack of joy in my legal career.  Caring for my babies was work with a purpose, with joy, with flow — a concept I had read about, of course, but never experienced in my work life. Once I felt it, I did not want to let it go. So, many years after law school, I finally found the will to seek it out in my work.

I am now on the other side, having reinvented my legal career entirely. With my amazing law school classmate and business partner, I own an intellectual property law firm. I love what I do, the service we provide to our clients, and the business we have built. The dread I used to feel each morning when heading to my office has been completely replaced by excitement and anticipation for the day’s work.   This life is something I did not remotely imagine back at my first job.

I say this as humbly and sincerely as I can: I am not unique. I follow in the footsteps of many badass lawyer moms, who, through grit and determination, shaped their legal careers into exactly what works for them. The key is to pay attention to both mind and spirit — and then to gently explore whatever feedback you discover. If you do determine that it is time to disrupt, reinvent, and take the leap, following are a few tips to consider.

Tips For A Successful Legal Reinvention

- Take Action: Keep taking action. Don’t let analysis become a hurdle to moving forward. Any missteps (see #6) can be corrected, and any plans (see #8) can be modified.
- Say Goodbye: You are retiring early from the first phase of your legal career. Expect mixed feelings — there may be grief, doubt, and fear mixed in with all the excitement.
- Find the Flow: The key is finding passion and flow. Keep your mind open and be ready for surprises. Ask yourself: Who are the lawyers you get along with? What topics would you read about outside of work? How do you want the working hours of your life to feel?
- Educate Yourself: Consider how much education you may need to succeed in your new path. This can take the form of everything from new software, to CLEs, to an additional degree.
- Social Media and Networking: Join groups, find lawyers sharing their stories, and reach out to lawyers you find inspiring. Their experiences can be goldmines of information and motivation.
- Embrace Missteps: You will not get it all right out of the gate. Embrace that the journey may look like a series of pivots rather than a straight line.
- Mind Over Matter: Believe in yourself, your skills, and your capacity to adapt. It is possible. Whatever it is you might be daring to dream, it is possible.
- Plan, Plan, Plan: Lay out your goals, action items, and contingency plans.  Play with the variables. Look at your finances. Also lay out your timeline. You may have to bide your time, or make small steps toward your goal, rather than a full leap forward. (But also, see #1.)

UPDATE: Please note the UPDATE, a statement from Mayer Brown, appended to the end of this post.

We’ve all heard the expression [“corporate welfare.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_welfare) How about… Biglaw welfare?

These allegations are hard to believe, but also hard to ignore. From [NBC](http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Virginia-Woman-Charged-With-Welfare-Fraud-For-Collecting-Benefits-While-Husband-Earned-Millions-415923183.html):

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
An Arlington woman was arrested this week and charged with four counts of welfare fraud for collecting over $100,000 in benefits – all while her husband was a high-earning attorney in D.C., police say.

Police say a six-month investigation into Helen Agbapuruonwu, 41, found that the mother of four had collected benefits like food stamps and Medicaid assistance for the past six years.

While Helen was collecting benefits, her husband, Fidelis Agbapuruonwu, was earning $1.5 million per year as a lawyer, according to court documents obtained by News4.

That’s a very nice chunk of change. Where was Fidelis Agbapuruonwu supposedly raking in all this dough?

Fidelis’s [LinkedIn page](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/biglaw-wife-accused-of-welfare-fraud/2/) claims he works for the D.C. firm of Mayer Brown, but today the firm said he no longer works there. Court officials believe Fidelis, a Nigerian immigrant, has “fled the country and is somewhere in Africa.”

That LinkedIn profile, which we’ve posted in full [on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/biglaw-wife-accused-of-welfare-fraud/2/), claims that Fidelis Agbapuruonwu won a prestigious [Soros Fellowship](https://www.pdsoros.org/meet-the-fellows/fidelis-i-agbapuruonwu), graduated from Ohio State Law in 2002, and then joined Mayer Brown. It lists his title as “Associate,” though, which makes the $1.5 million figure a bit puzzling — seven figures for an associate is pretty unheard of. Perhaps the $1.5 million was the cumulative total earned by Fidelis over the six-year period in which Helen allegedly collected benefits?

Despite widespread public beliefs to the contrary, the incidence of welfare fraud is [very low](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_fraud). But high-profile cases like this one make headlines, stay in people’s memories, and fuel the view that millions are improperly claiming entitlement to public assistance.

Law enforcement authorities trumpet cases like this one for purposes of deterrence. As Arlington County Police spokeswoman Ashley Savage told NBC of the Agbapuruonwu allegations, “We hope it sends a message that if you are taking public assistance it’s truly intended for those in need, and we’re committed to ensuring those who need the most help receive it.”

How are people who know the Agbapuruonwus reacting?

The director of the pre-school the Agbapuruonwu’s children once attended said she is shocked by the allegations against family.

“I have to believe it’s not true,” she said.

There has to be something more going on here, no? If Fidelis Agbapuruonwu is living in Africa now while Helen Agbapuruonwu remains in Virginia with four children, perhaps the Agbapuruonwus are divorced or separated, and Fidelis isn’t paying alimony or child support. But even if this (highly speculative) theory is correct, one then must wonder whether Helen made any effort through legal channels to get money from Fidelis — and, if so, whether any such effort was successful.

# Layoffs Come To Cleary Gottlieb
## The firm is serious about cutting back on staff.

The autumn of COVID is rapidly turning into a [season of layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/layoffs/) in Biglaw, and administrative staff has been particularly hard hit. It’s long been a trend for Biglaw firms to reduce the amount of staff that is needed to support Biglaw attorneys, but the economic upheaval of the novel coronavirus seems to have supercharged the issue.

The latest firm to take a carving knife to its staff ranks? Cleary Gottlieb.

Last week, the elite law firm laid off staff members. According to sources at the firm, this follows a voluntary severance package that was offered back in June. It’s unclear how many people took that voluntary package which saw them depart the firm in July, but given the recent involuntary layoffs, it doesn’t seem like it was enough.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
And the salt in the wound? Above the Law understands the voluntary severance package was more generous than the one given to those laid off. Ouch. Guess the firm is sending a message that it mean business when it offers a voluntary package.

A spokesperson for Cleary provided the following statement in response to Above the Law’s layoff inquiry:

Following a comprehensive review begun early last year, we have restructured some operations to align our business functions with the needs of our lawyers and our clients. These changes reflect long-term trends in the legal market and have been made with careful thought and consideration for those directly affected by this transition.

Best of luck to those who find themselves involuntarily out of work.

Lawyers are trained to find problems with anything. Will someone say, ‘Oh my god, instead of having nine-and-a-half years of assured employment, we only have seven-and-a-half years’? That is something we have to drive home and make clear that’s not what’s intended here.

— [Barry Wolf](https://www.weil.com/people/barry-wolf), executive partner of Weil Gotshal & Manges, commenting on a potential complaint from associates he foresees happening due to the firm’s [new shortened path to partnership](https://www.law.com/2018/05/30/weil-gotshal-shortens-path-to-partnership-in-bid-to-retain-associates/). Wolf recently announced that Weil is cutting two years off its partner track because millennials “[don’t] want to wait nine or nine-and-a-half years” to find out whether they’ll be promoted.

# Morning Docket: 06.06.16
## * Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has already attacked a federal judge due to his ""Mexican heritage,"" and now he's speaking out about judges' religious beliefs. Trump apparently thinks Muslim judges would be biased against him due to his plans to ban Muslim immigrants. [[New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/06/us/politics/could-a-muslim-judge-be-trump-neutral-trump-thinks-not.html)] * Reviled pharma bro Martin Shkreli finds himself on the wrong side of the law, again: He -- along with his ex-attorney, Evan Greebel (formerly of Kaye Scholer) -- has been accused of scheming to defraud potential investors of Retrophin, the drug company Shkreli founded in 2011. [[Associated Press](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/67a12dac934c489f99f3e218376e0271/more-charges-against-ex-pharmaceutical-executive-shkreli)] * Ouch! Last week, Norton Rose stole an entire practice group from Sidley Austin. The 17-member public finance group, including six partners, will move to San Francisco, marking the firm's entrance into the Northern California market. [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/norton-rose-hires-17-lawyers-from-sidley-austin/)] * Dean Phyliss Craig-Taylor of North Carolina Central University School of Law has been appointed by President Barack Obama to serve on the President's Board of Advisors on Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Congratulations! [[News & Observer](http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/article81803252.html)] * A suit filed against Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby that accused her of firing prosecutors due to their political associations has been dismissed. According to Judge J. Frederick Motz (D. Md.), prosecutors can be fired for political reasons.

# The Most Searched For Biglaw Firms (2023)
## What did your firm do last year that made people search for it over and over again?

Biglaw firms are ranked in a multitude of ways, from gross revenue to size to quality of life and even prestige. But what about what may actually matter most, the number of people who are searching for these Biglaw firms on Google? Those searching could be associates and partners interested in salary information or looking to lateral, existing or potential clients, and even members of the media interested in tracking down a hot law firm story.

So, which Biglaw firms came out on top of this new ranking? For that, we turn to the [Mad Clientist blog of BTI Consulting Group](https://bticonsulting.com/themadclientist/the-most-searched-for-law-firms-of-2023). Without further ado, here are the most searched Biglaw firms:

Cravath
DLA Piper
Greenberg Traurig
Jones Day
Kirkland
Latham & Watkins
Morgan Lewis
Sidley
Skadden
White & Case
Wilson Sonsini

This list may be alphabetized, but there’s no doubt in our minds that Cravath was the most searched firm in 2023 thanks to the new Biglaw salary scale. The top of the Biglaw market [quickly fell in line](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/biglaw-raise-bonus-tracker-2023/) after Cravath gave the new $225K scale its [official seal of approval](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/cravath-announces-raises-comes-over-the-top-of-milbank-scale-for-some-associates/), with some extra cash for midlevel and senior associates.

# What’s Up With All The New York Mid-Market Lateral Moves?
## 2017 has seen quite a few partners, counsel and associates in all practice areas move law firms in New York City.

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts on lateral partner moves from [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors. [Jonathan Birenbaum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanbirenbaum) is a Senior Director at Lateral Link, where he specializes in the recruitment of partners, counsel, associates and groups for law firms and attorneys for in-house counsel roles with corporate law departments in the New York area, the U.S., Canada and internationally.

We have seen quite a few partners, counsel and associates in all practice areas move law firms in New York City ranging at the AmLaw 100 and Magic Circle in Q1 and Q2 of 2017:

2017 Lateral Lawyer Movement NYC



There are more than 7,000 litigators in New York City alone (including lawyers in a variety of litigation sub-specialties).  From our experience in recruiting over the past decade in this space, we have seen a consistent demand for litigators.

This is true for both boutique multi-practice firms and major Am Law firms that specialize in representing mid-market clients for partners and groups of practitioners in these practice areas (especially those with portable books of business and that are accretive additions to their acquiring firms).

While the majority of litigation does not proceed to trial due to mandated arbitration or mediation, or due to settlement, clients continue to rely on their outside counsel to at least get them to a position of leverage to get out of it.

Labor & Employment Remains Very Competitive Among Am Law 200 and National “Boutique” L&E Firms

Although the U.S. economy is generally strong, currently there is clearly a strong demand from corporations and businesses for employment lawyers, as evidenced by the plethora of national L&E “boutique” firms that are increasingly becoming global players in employment litigation and counseling, as well as in business immigration and human resources law.

These boutiques have put rate pressure on the AmLaw firms, including instituting “flat fee” billing in some cases in order to compete with them for clients.  The demand for lower rates from clients is a key factor motivating employment partners to consider moving to platforms that enable them to offer more rate flexibility.

Nevertheless, the Am Law 200 and mid-market firms continue to demonstrate interest in adding L&E partners and groups that can enable them to compete more robustly for clients.  These multi-practice national firms provide the potential for employment law partners to cross-market their clients’ needs to generate greater potential originations and billings for the L&E partner who needs to “thread the needle” with billing rates for their work to retain and add clients in today’s legal economic environment.

Of course, the key for associates in this practice area who aspire to make partner is to generate their own portable business by cultivating clients who will transition to a new firm with them.  L&E is a practice area where young lawyers can establish their own clientele by representing smaller businesses and insurance carriers that provide employment practices liability insurance to corporations and are thus defendants in lawsuits.

Bankruptcy & Restructuring Has Been Hot

We also have seen a number of mid-market firms show strong interest in adding insolvency partners or groups to their New York offices.  These firms also often have strong practices in Delaware, a hub for the filing of corporate insolvencies, and can service corporate clients with boots on the ground only in New York or with an office in Wilmington and/or Philadelphia.

Demand for bankruptcy lawyers is cyclical in nature.  There has been an uptick in bankruptcy filings in a number of key global industries like retail, energy, shipping and healthcare.  Based on the current global and national economic climate, there is no reason to believe that more companies won’t seek the protection of the courts from creditors as they attempt to restructure or liquidate their assets.

It is important to note that several global firms, including White & Case and Freshfields, added multiple insolvency and restructuring partners to their New York offices earlier this year, demonstrating that there is strong international demand in the practice area.

High Demand For Complex Commercial Litigators

There is always a demand from the mid-market law firms for business litigators, particularly those who represent major Fortune 500 clients in bet the company litigation.   We are continuously asked by AmLaw 200 and mid-market firms to identify commercial litigation partners and groups with track records that show an upward trajectory.   

What We Can Do To Help You Identify Lateral Litigation Opportunities

One of Lateral Link’s core missions is to recruit and place partners, groups and associates in a variety of litigation disciplines, including Labor & Employment, Professional Responsibility, Products Liability & Mass Tort, Commercial Litigation, Bankruptcy and White Collar law. 

We are currently working with partners with strong portable books of business (between $500k to $30mm) in a number of these practice areas with firms in the New York City area.   Our team is in the game helping talented partners who explore the market for real benefits achieved only by making a move and to provide them with guidance throughout the hiring process.

# 4 Things That Small Firms Need To Change When It Comes To Hiring Talent

At some point, I’ll need to post a Help Wanted sign next to my shingle. But in the world of small law, hiring is somewhat of a crapshoot.

We don’t post job listings that stay up for six months hoping that the [purple squirrel](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/back-in-the-race-stop-trying-to-hire-the-purple-squirrel/) will come along. Also, we don’t have the budget to hire recruiters or advertise in every legal publication and website. And most importantly, we need help fairly quickly.

I admit I don’t have a lot of experience when it comes to hiring. So I decided to do some research on finding employees.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Looking online wasn’t much help. There are a multitude of advice articles, and a lot of them seem to conflict with each other. I honestly couldn’t find an article that was particularly helpful.

So I next looked at solo and small-firm attorney message boards and looked for discussions involving hiring employees. But most of the responses tended to be horror stories describing the employee from hell. The one that’s consistently late. The one with the bad attitude. The one that embezzled the trust account money. And the one who turned into a homewrecker.

In sum, when it came to actual hiring advice, I have heard some common themes: Don’t make any promises when it comes to money, hire only people who are genuinely interested in your practice area, supervise your employees closely, and don’t hire people who plan to upgrade to a better firm.

I have issues with the above advice to varying degrees. Some of them might be outdated, while others seem to be based on paranoia, fear, and superstition. Here are four changes I plan to implement when I eventually hire:

I won’t make vague promises about promotions and raises. The problem I see here is when small-law employers make promises that mean nothing. For example, they offer a very low base pay but promise a possible raise at some point in the future depending on performance.

I get that employers don’t want to put themselves in a position where they can’t pay what they promised. But people want specifics, especially when it comes to money. There is a reason why every top law firm has a specific salary and promotion structure. Employees have bills to pay, including their [student loans](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/will-you-ever-be-able-to-pay-off-your-law-school-debt/). Finally, whether employers want them to or not, employees are relying on their promises to make major financial decisions in the future. Breaking those promises will quickly hurt morale and very likely result in employees secretly making plans to defect (and they usually leave at the most inopportune time).

If working for me is not their first choice, I won’t hold it against them. The problem for a significant number law school graduates is that their careers choose them, not the other way around.

Like most people, I would prefer to hire someone who is familiar with my specialty. But even if a candidate’s academic background and professional work history suggests that working for me is not their first choice, I am willing to hear them out. I am not particularly interested in hearing their prepared speech about how their irrelevant skill-sets are transferable to my practice. I am more interested in hearing about how quickly they can adapt to new situations, and their ability to be reliable and meet deadlines.

Trusted employees can go home early and work from home so long as they get their job done. A lot of employers still believe in maximizing face time at the office so that employees can be properly supervised. But I personally don’t see the point of a diligent and reliable employee staying in the office longer than necessary.

If they get their jobs done and want to leave an hour or two early, I am likely to let them do so. And I won’t dock their pay. I would also encourage them to leave early attend to attend networking mixers, CLE events, or other fun activities that can result in business development.

Today, with high-performance scanners, and the ability to transfer documents remotely through the cloud, it is easier than ever to work from home or anywhere else. So I am inclined to let trusted professionals work remotely whenever possible. This will allow parents to spend more time with their family, and possibly reduce daycare costs.

Of course, there are some caveats. First, they have to earn my trust. Also, they must agree to work only from home or another secure location. In other words, they cannot work at a local coffee shop.

I don’t mind if people leave me for something better so long as there is a transition plan. Finally, some people in small law are reluctant to hire because they think that the employee will leave once they find something better. But I’ve learned that this seldom happens, as employees are very reluctant to leave a secure job where they are comfortable and happy. And if they really want to leave, I do not want them to miss out on a good opportunity. All I ask is that they give enough notice before they leave so that I can find and train a replacement and ensure a smooth transition.

My rationale for this is that if I force (or guilt-trip) employees to stay, they will eventually be resentful and will not give their best work. Second, they might be referral sources. Finally, in the long run, if I gain a reputation for being a feeder to prestigious firms, then more people with good credentials will want to work for me.

# No Stranger To Paying Support After Screwing Around, Elon Musk Faces Twitter Lawsuit Over Failed Deal
## Wachtell joins the chat... plans to file suit on behalf of Twitter this week.

Elon Musk played fast and loose with SEC regulations and ended up paying the government. Elon Musk has two ex-wives and 10 kids — [including twins we only heard about last week!](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-twins-shivon-zilis-twins-neuralink-executive/) — and presumably owes hefty support. All this is to say that Musk’s life is defined by screwing around and then writing checks after the fact.

Twitter intends to add to Musk’s payroll when it sues the billionaire after Musk divorced the company he earlier pledged to buy.

The day after Elon Musk announced his agreement to buy Twitter, I posted that this deal would probably blow up the speculative bubble driving his fortune into the stratosphere. Tesla investors would flee before Musk could go through with paying an exorbitant price for a platform he had no real plan to monetize and another pool of his wealth — cryptocurrency — would finally experience the long-overdue implosion befitting a warmed over pump and dump. Elon Musk would still be very, very rich… but he wasn’t going to find himself “pay $45B to buy a social media company for LOLZ” rich.

As it happened, all of that came to pass! Pretty quickly after the announcement, actually! And that’s when Musk began what resembled [a half-baked campaign to put himself in breach of the merger agreement](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/elon-musk-already-breached-the-twitter-takeover-agreement-with-his-stellar-record-of-following-the-rules/), hoping that Twitter would give up on the deal. But since Twitter stood to gain a ton from the deal going through and was now fully aware that Musk was trying to get out of it — triggering the $1B fee Musk would have to pay if he nixed the deal — the company just smiled and nodded while Musk lobbed insults.

Now that Musk has fully abandoned the deal, Twitter has mobilized to get what’s coming to them, [bringing on Wachtell](https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-hires-legal-team-sue-musk-over-dropped-takeover-bloomberg-news-2022-07-10/) to complement its team from Simpson Thacher and Wilson Sonsini. The company plans to file suit in Delaware this week.

And yet, Musk still doesn’t seem to grasp the magnitude of his legal problems.

As Professor Rick Hasen put it, “[We might as well assign this an Exhibit number now](https://twitter.com/rickhasen/status/1546346105662648320?s=20&t=fZs77xmo9ulYY4WcTICW3Q).”

Musk’s fascination with this “bot” argument is stupid, but it’s become the all-encompassing mantra for Tesla Bros and the segment of right-wing social media that have curiously adopted Musk as a patron saint. As Matt Levine explained in great detail, [this argument makes no sense](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-07-09/elon-s-out):

[Musk’s attorney Skadden’s Mike] Ringler says that “it appears that Twitter is dramatically understating the proportion of spam and false accounts represented in its mDAU count.” There is not a whisper of evidence for this claim, no hint that there might be evidence, no acknowledgement that a reasonable reader of this letter might want to see evidence. The only basis for the claim is that “preliminary analysis by Mr. Musk’s advisors of the information provided by Twitter to date causes Mr. Musk to strongly believe that the proportion of false and spam accounts included in the reported mDAU count is wildly higher than 5%.” Notice that Ringler does not say that the analysis shows that the bots are “wildly higher than 5%” of mDAUs: That would be a factual claim that, I suspect, Musk’s advisers know is false. They make only the subjective claim that Musk “strongly believes” it. I don’t even believe that he believes it! But that’s harder to disprove.

Plus, as Levine points out, Musk went on record multiple times saying that he wanted to buy Twitter to fix the bot problem, making his claim that it would be a material adverse event to learn that there might be a bot problem laughable on its face.

Which brings us to Musk’s related but distinct argument that Twitter failed to give him the information he wants. As part of the merger agreement, Twitter committed to give Musk access to information to help complete the deal. On the back of this provision, Musk kept making onerous requests to set up a case for killing the deal. Back to Levine’s analysis:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
And in fact Ringler’s letter makes it pretty clear that that’s what Musk was up to: He’d ask for information about bots, and they’d give it to him, and he’d ask for more, and he’d keep trying to get information that he could use to undermine Twitter’s SEC reports. He buried Twitter in an avalanche of demands for data

Coupled with a provision in the agreement that allows Twitter to not provide information that could hurt the competitiveness of the company and Musk’s insistence that he’s looking for information that would hurt the company he’s not setting up the best case for himself.

He now seems to galaxy brain believe that Twitter’s lawsuit will require it to fork over the “information” Musk thinks they’ve been hiding. Since Twitter’s representation was just that the SEC filings were correct and the SEC filings said that the company tests a random sampling to reach a statistically responsible estimate that bots are less than 5 percent of all users, it’s not clear what additional information would be relevant beyond what the company claims to have handed over already. Discovery is pretty powerful but it doesn’t let you just go fishing beyond the confines of the actual dispute at hand. If they performed sampling and got to 5 percent, discovery isn’t going to force them to conduct a different study to hypothetically find another 50 or 60 percent of all accounts being fake.

But Musk’s social media suggests he’s committed to wandering down this path anyway. I hope Skadden’s not getting paid in Dogecoin.

# Objectors Threatening To Derail Massive Antitrust Award Because Some People Want To Watch The World Burn
## Companies considering holding settlement hostage to squeeze a little bit more.

In The Dark Knight, Alfred counsels Batman about the folly of trying to get inside the mind and motivations of The Joker, warning Bruce that “some men just want to see the world burn.” This awesomely quotable line is about his dealings in Burma as a young man… certainly nothing problematic about an aging Brit’s stories about quelling dissent in Burma!

Putting aside the legacy of colonialism, I think about that line a lot whenever objectors barrel into a class action settlement threatening to ruin it for everyone. These folks who disingenuously want to wrap themselves in the cloak of “the poor victims” to [pursue a long-term assault on the practical viability of class action litigation](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/guy-trying-to-blow-up-flint-water-settlement-treated-to-brutal-response-brief-roasting/) genuinely want the world Judge Posner famously described as “the realistic alternative to a class action is not 17 million individual suits, but zero individual suits.” In other words, they want to see the world burn… preferably from the pollution of their corporate backers.

And now one of the biggest antitrust awards ever is getting threatened by companies looking to make “keeping health insurance costs high for poor people” their brand… I guess?

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
[Blue Cross Blue Shield agreed to a $2.7B settlement and injunctive relief](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/blue-cross-blue-shield-plans-to-settle-for-2-7b-and-thats-not-the-most-important-relief/) back in 2020 following a class action antitrust suit brought around nine years ago. The underlying behavior was suitably complex for a national insurance brand with 50 ways of charging for aspirin, but the nutshell version is that entities selling BCBS were granted geographic fiefdoms and told they couldn’t intrude on a fellow BCBS seller’s area even if they were trying to sell non-BCBS products there. Also folks selling BCBS were told that non-BCBS products had to amount to less than a third of their revenue.

Since this looks and quacks like a cartel, federal antitrust authorities did… absolutely nothing. Leaving it to the private sector to protect the market. Boies Schiller brought claims on behalf of insureds harmed by BCBS’s anticompetitive actions, kicking off a case that ultimately boasted over 30 defendants, some 50 firms, and over 1,000 lawyers before it was all said and done.

But it was, at last, done. [Judge David Proctor approved the settlement](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2022/09/2022-08-09-02931-000-FINAL-ORDER-AND-JUDGMENT-GRANTING-APPROVAL-OF-SUBSCRIBER.pdf). BCBS would compensate the victims with the largest antitrust award ever secured in a case where the government never participated. More importantly BCBS would have to change its marketing rules and agree to a watchdog committee to make sure this never happens again. That’s the part of class actions that the propagandists always miss — these cases aren’t just about victims getting $25 when they might’ve lost $40, they’re also about making sure millions of future people never get bilked out of $40 in the first place.

So of course there are objectors looking to screw everything up for different reasons.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
One entity filed a [notice to appeal](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2022/09/2022-09-07-02940-000-NOTICE-OF-APPEAL-by-Employee-Services-Inc-Topographic..pdf) the approval “including but not limited to the order awarding fees and costs to class counsel.” This is the standard objection, whining about the lawyers getting paid out of the settlement and casting it as “stealing” from the victims as opposed to compensating the lawyers for working on a case for nine years — with the possibility of receiving zero for their effort if the case fails — to get relief that the victims were never going to see otherwise. That’s why these objections are typically filed by corporate defense lawyers in disguise hoping to stack the deck so future class action litigators fear the financial risk of taking on a case that might help people at the expense of corporate abusers.

But to hold everything, especially the injunctive relief, hostage over [a fee award that clocks in at a mere 23 percent](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2022/09/2022-08-09-02932-000-ORDER-AWARDING-SUBSCRIBER-PLAINTIFFS-COUNSEL-ATTORNEYS-FEES.pdf) is a special kind of cynicism.

Meanwhile, [Home Depot has complained](https://sourceonhealthcare.org/final-settlement-of-bcbs-antitrust-class-action-hopes-to-increase-competition/) that the injunctive relief itself doesn’t go far enough because BCBS can continue to limit the use of its trademarks on a geographic basis. Which is true, though if BCBS providers from other areas can come in and compete with products from other insurance companies, it’s not clear what extent of competitive damage remains. Yeah, trademark protection is inherently anticompetitive… but we allow it anyway.

And it’s definitely not clear why that justifies blowing up the whole deal. Do they want to drag this Bleak House litigation through court for another decade? Do they realize it’s not an actual house that needs renovation supplies?

And are they really willing to hold up billions in relief to squeeze out one more injunctive concession? They’re Home Depot! If they think BCBS will still be artificially too expensive after this deal, I’m sure there are other insurance providers ready and willing to take their business.

# The Jabbing-A-Toothpick-Into-Your-Eye Method Of Picking A Job

I’ve [written before](https://www.amazon.com/Curmudgeons-Guide-Practicing-Law/dp/1590316762) about why it makes sense to be a lawyer:  It’s an intellectual feast; there’s an ever-changing set of issues and cast of characters; you experience the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.

So you could pick a job based on the things you would like about the job.

But how about the reverse?

Think about the things that you would hate most about a job — the things that would make you want to jab a toothpick into your eye.  Gather those negatives in a heap on a scale, and then pick a job to avoid the jabbing.

Here’s how you’d pick a job if you wanted to avoid that jabbing-a-toothpick-into-your-eye feeling.

Should you work at a law firm, as opposed to a corporation?

That depends.

Do you like recording your time?  Or does the very thought of recording your time every day cause you to want to jab a toothpick into your eye?  If you quiver at the idea of recording time, you know there’s one aspect of practicing law at a firm that you won’t like.

How do you feel about irrelevant discovery disputes?  If you prefer not to deal with them, then you prefer not to work at a firm.

How do you feel about quibbling over whether the deposition next week will be in Houston or Dallas?  

Negotiating over the search terms that you’ll use to collect electronic documents?

Life, of course, evolves over time.  So, later in life:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
How do you feel about preparing bills?  If you just started to quiver, a law firm might not be for you.

How do you feel about running conflict checks?

How do you feel about the prospect of generating business?

(Not all of those things are necessarily negatives, of course.  Some folks thrill at the idea of generating business; others tremble at it.  Where does it go on your personal scale?)

Gather those things together, weigh them against the positives of a job, and then decide whether life at a law firm is for you.

But what about the other side of the coin?  Should you work in-house?

That depends.

Do you like the idea of setting annual goals for yourself and those who work under your supervision?  If you can feel your eyeballs getting bloody, in-house work may not be for you.

How about having regular one-on-one meetings with those you supervise?

Having regular one-on-one meetings with the person who supervises you?

Having team meetings to keep everyone abreast of what’s going on in the department?

And, of course, reviewing bills:  Not sending them out; making sure that you should pay them.  If that sounds a little tedious, maybe in-house work isn’t right for you.

Some people, of course, think the idea of having regular one-on-one meetings, for example, is a good one.  You’re assured time with your boss.  You can pause and think about your long-term career goals.  You can reflect generally on whether you’re happy with where you stand professionally.

Other people tremble at the thought of regular meetings:  “I went to law school to practice law!  Why am I wasting my time chatting with people about touchy-feely stuff?  Let’s get back to analyzing cases, thinking about strategies, and drafting outlines of testimony and arguments!”

Of course you should think about the good parts of a job.

But maybe you should also consider what you’ll be doing on the days you’ll dread the most.

And, of course, if it all sounds too grim to bear, there’s always medical school.

Piss off a lawyer and you’re going to get a lawsuit. Maybe it is a little trite, but it is also a reality for an actress/model/programmer and Airbnb.

[Christian Pugaczewski](http://www.shearman.com/en/people/p/pugaczewski-christian-a), an associate in the Derivatives & Structured Products Group at Shearman and Sterling, wanted to rent an apartment for a few months this summer, and like so many in 2016 he turned to sharing economy leader [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/). He found an apartment on Roosevelt Island (mistake number 1), and based on the description, he assumed it was in one of the luxury buildings on the island. But, no, [it wasn’t](http://nypost.com/2016/08/30/airbnb-renter-duped-into-paying-9k-for-dingy-apartment-suit/):

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“I stayed there one night and left immediately,” Pugaczewski said. “There was paint peeling, there was grime and dirt on the window sill and on the air conditioner, a hole in the floor was covered up by strategically-placed bar stools,” he said.


Christian Pugaczewski

Pugaczewski is suing the lease holder, Lyndsey Scott and Airbnb, for tricking him into renting “a property materially different from the property portrayed.”

Oh, dear.

[Scott](http://www.lyndseyscott.com/#about) is the actress, model, and programmer — what a combination — and neither she nor Airbnb have commented, but it will be an interesting case to follow. I mean everyone — on both sides of an Airbnb relationship — that uses the service regularly has horror stories to tell. It’s just that this Biglaw associate has taken it to court.

UPDATE 9/7/16: We’ve received the below update from Lyndsey Scoot about the lawsuit:

I acknowledge Mr. Pugaczewski’s complaints and am working closely with Airbnb to ensure this is settled in a fair and just manner. I wholeheartedly respect Airbnb’s standards and have worked tirelessly to ensure renters have had an above average experience, as evidenced in my 5 star rating on Airbnb.com. Roosevelt Island is a beautiful neighborhood in New York City, known for its sense of community, family environment and diversity – all traits I wholeheartedly embrace. I have always felt safe in my apartment and proud to call Roosevelt Island my home. I apologize for any inconvenience this has caused Mr. Pugaczewski. The photos, description and reviews included in the listing are verifiable and accurate: [https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/923708](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/923708)

# Reinventing The Law Business: A Potential Impediment To Growth, Culture, And Client Development (Part III)

Bruce Stachenfeld

Two articles ago, I wrote about the problems that arise when a law firm gets too big for a single person — a single brain — to be able to keep track of everything that is going on within the firm, including not only legal matters with clients, but culturally as well. Speaking from my vantage point as managing partner of my law firm, I identified two major concerns that flow from this situation:

The obvious first problem is that I don’t know if bad things are happening, even though I am responsible for them. For all I know, a partner is abusing an associate, a lawyer is mistreating a client, or any of a myriad of bad stuff is going on.

The second problem is even harder, which is how does each lawyer know what the other lawyers are doing?  This is a pernicious issue and has numerous repercussions. For example, if lawyer A doesn’t know that lawyer B is an expert in widget law, she will miss the opportunity when the client says to lawyer A:  “I wish I could find a widget lawyer somehow…..”

In my last article, I did my best to come up with solutions to the first problem.  In this article I am doing my best to come up with solutions to the (harder) second problem, so here goes…..

Historically, what I have been doing for years is for me to make it my personal mission to find out what my partners and associates and administrative team were doing, and then when I would learn these things I would email everyone and tell everyone what was going on.  I did this for years, but finally reached a point where I just ran out of time.  I also realized that it was a foolish plan — to have the managing partner spend his time as the news source for the firm.  Plus — being perhaps too honest — people start to get sick of getting too many emails from me over time.  I still do this as much as I can, but this initiative has run out of steam as the firm has grown too big for it; hence, the search for new ideas.

We considered “requiring” people to announce deals and other things, but that didn’t feel right.  It also seemed like people just wouldn’t do it irrespective whether it was “required”, so we rejected that.

We considered a committee that would be a “Communications Committee” and be responsible for learning what was going on and communicating it to others at the firm.  I believe this might be a good idea, for the reason that any repeated method of communication becomes stale over time, so the committee’s goal would be to change and modify itself over time with the one mission statement to make sure everyone at the firm has access to as much information as possible about whatever everyone else is doing.  We haven’t done this yet but it is a possibility and might be a very good idea.

We considered a newsletter but rejected it because it would be too infrequent and suck up a lot of time making it look good and it seemed like just something that would “sound” good but not solve the problem.  Then — to my surprise — a member of my administrative team came up with a very interesting idea for a newsletter type publication that will strive to disseminate information and at the same time be interesting.  I immediately said, “Great idea!”, and I am awaiting the first issue in the coming weeks.  It is going to be called The Hedgehog Chronicle (which reflects our hedgehog principle).  Hats off to the team here spearheading this, and I am hopeful this will have some positive effect in solving this concern.

We had the idea of creating a ticker that scrolls across everyone’s computer screen and puts in news that is relevant about goings on at the firm.  We didn’t pursue this too deeply because as we thought about it we ran into a combination of technological problems, logistical problems, plus a realization that it still had the same base issue of concern in that we still needed someone to hunt down the content if people didn’t post voluntarily.

A daily all-hands meeting seemed like a great idea at first.  The Ritz Carlton (a brilliantly run organization) supposedly has this at every hotel.  The entire staff meets for 15 minutes every morning and chats about goings on, plans for the day, accomplishments, and other things.  I “loved” this idea; however, after reflection I chickened out since I would have had to “require” everyone to show up and people who were busy would find it an imposition, so we discarded this plan.  I will say this — if I had a small firm of about 5 or 10 people I would embed this in the culture early on and then as the firm grew it would just be part of the DNA.

So these are my thoughts.  I obviously haven’t found a “killer app”; however, I believe solving this problem is a major issue as my firm grows.  I am fortunate — and blessed — to have a really great place at my firm right now. No exaggeration. People really like being here.  No one hides anything.  But try to get someone to remember to tell everyone else she just closed a major deal or has something else to share — and it just doesn’t happen.

One thing is for sure — if you establish this into the culture when a firm is very young and small it is a lot easier to pull off than once you have a culture to the contrary.  Establishing something in a new a culture is a heck of a lot easier than changing an established culture.

Since I admittedly don’t have super answers here, I am hoping someone will email me with some magical solutions that I can not only put in future articles, but also use myself at Duval & Stachenfeld.

[Yesterday, we told you](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/biglaw-partner-arrested-after-deadly-hit-and-run-crash/) suspended Dentons Canada corporate partner Shane Stevenson had been charged with impaired driving causing death, driving over the legal limit causing death, and hit and run causing death following a car crash that killed 16-year-old Chloe Wiwchar. Wiwchar was struck while crossing the street at a crosswalk by a pickup truck that fled the scene. An off-duty police officer witnessed the crash and followed the truck. Stevenson was arrested in his truck a short time later.

Now we know this isn’t the Biglaw partner’s first brush with the wrong side of the law.

[According to CTV News Edmonton,](https://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/lawyer-charged-in-fatal-hit-and-run-released-on-bail-1.3890879) Stevenson was charged on two separate occasions with impaired driving. The pair of incidents happened in 2009, and  he was never convicted of that charge — in one case, the charges were withdrawn two years later, and in the other, he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge:

Stevenson was charged with impaired driving and refusing to provide a breath sample in 2009. Those charges were withdrawn in 2011.

Also in 2009, Stevenson was charged with impaired driving in Stony Plain, but pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of careless driving – he paid a $500 fine.

As for the charges Stevenson currently faces, he is out on $50,000 bail. He is expected back in court on May 2nd.

Richard Hsu

There’s probably not a job in the world that epitomizes being a service provider better than being a waiter.

— [Richard Hsu](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/columbia-law-alum-and-former-managing-partner-richard-hsu-on-podcasting-purpose-and-picking-a-law-firm/), a legal recruiter at Major, Lindsey & Africa and former partner at Sherman & Sterling and former managing partner at Townsend LLP (n/k/a Kilpatrick Townshend & Stockton LLP), on the latest episode of the [Legal Speak podcast](https://www.law.com/2018/08/10/think-like-a-waiter-and-other-tips-for-making-it-in-big-law/) revealed tips for attorneys looking to get ahead in the cutthroat world of Biglaw. Hsu said attorneys need to think like waiters or service providers in order to be best at their jobs.

# Jones Day Out About $7M After Client Goes Belly Up

You win some, you lose some.

Jones Day is currently in the latter category and we’re not just talking about the GOP losing the White House [despite the firm’s best efforts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/yesterday-was-the-day-america-learned-what-weve-known-about-jones-day-all-along/). No, the law firm that developed something they openly called “[Project Ratfuck](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/gop-lawyer-slams-trump-for-undermining-election-confidence-despite-long-career-of-undermining-election-confidence/)” earned a small measure of karmic payback when a client went up in smoke leaving the firm on the hook for what works out to be around $7 million.

[Roll on Friday has the story](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/jones-day-out-pocket-ps55m-and-hsf-owed-ps900k-after-client-goes-bust):

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
An insolvent business has left Jones Day out of pocket to the tune of £5.5 million, while HSF has an unpaid debt of £900k.

Today Development Partners (TDP) was co-founded by Jonathan Faiman in 2018 as an online groceries business to rival Ocado. Faiman had been one of the three founders of Ocado, but left the business in 2008 and sold most of his shares in 2010.

A founder moving on to start a rival can become a huge success. Or it can become exactly what you’re already predicting:

Shortly afterwards, TDP became embroiled in a legal battle when Ocado sued Faiman, accusing him of “corporate espionage” and claiming that he had used confidential information to set up TDP. In June 2021, Faiman and another former Ocado employee, paid £1.75 million to Ocado as part of a settlement it [was reported ](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/waitrose-is-owed-4m-in-saga-of-today-development-partners-75cgn252q)in The Times.

Yeah.

On top of this, Ocado called out then-Jones Day partner Raymond McKeeve for contempt of court alleging that he counseled his client to destroy documents. McKeeve was cleared but the case continued on appeal.

Things kept getting worse for the company as a former client sued for millions more. Finally, everything came crashing down:

An unholy mess, which may have seemed to be a money-spinner to the lawyers involved, had it not been for TDP going bust last month. An administrators’ report has shown that Jones Day was the single biggest creditor, being owed a whopping £5,532,837. Waitrose was listed as the second biggest creditor, with an outstanding debt of £4 million. And HSF was third: out of pocket by £901,134.

In the grand scheme of a $2.2B firm, losing out on a few million isn’t going to make much of a dent.

# Biglaw Partners Benchslapped Over 'Bitter' Post-Trial Claims Of Anti-Semitism
## The judge thinks this is a case of sore losers.

A bunch of partners are headed back to school — or at least back to CLEs. Partners Paul J. Andre, Lisa Kobialka, and James Hannah of Kramer Levin and John Palmer of Naman Howell were[ sanctioned ](https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/documents/401/60474/Freshub-v.-Amazon.Albright-Order.pdf)to take 30 hours of continuing legal education courses in ethics by U.S. District Judge Alan D. Albright of the Western District of Texas for claims made in post-trial briefings.

So, what actually happened? Kramer Levin and Naman Howell represent Israeli company Freshub in a patent infringement case against Amazon. They were unsuccessful in their claims at trial. In post-trial briefingsw, they made claims that Amazon’s attorneys from Fenwick & West were anti-Semitic. As [reported by](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/kramer-levin-lawyers-are-sanctioned-for-vitriolic-and-unsubstantiated-anti-semitism-claims) the ABA Journal:

In their motion for a new trial, the four lawyers argued that Amazon lawyers “played on the stereotype of greedy Jewish executives of an Israeli company allegedly taking advantage of U.S. companies, to trigger religious biases and deepen the ‘us vs. them’ nationalistic divide in the minds of the jurors.”

The motion also argued that “defendants blew this Jewish stereotype ‘dog whistle’ at every opportunity to unfairly bias the jury.”

Fenwick hit back [at the notion](https://www.law.com/texaslawyer/2021/12/17/judge-albright-sanctions-kramer-levin-attorneys-for-baseless-anti-semitism-claims/) they perpetuated any anti-Semitic stereotypes:

Fenwick partner Saina Shamilov, who fled with her family from the Soviet Union to escape religious persecution, said at the October hearings that the allegations “hit right at my heart.” At no time during the trial did anyone on her team “raise any Jewish stereotypes, mention Judaism, any religious affiliations of anyone, or present anything that the Waco community would interpret as a dog whistle,” she said.

Albright agreed with Fenwick’s position, and even took offense to the suggestion that he ignored any anti-Semitism going on at trial. He noted that Freshub’s lawyers did not object to references to Israel during trial, and that Amazon’s attorneys only referenced Israel when relevant or to rebut specific allegations. He also said that a reference to Israeli shekels was appropriate because Freshub’s financial records are reported in shekels.

But the judge has a theory about why they allegations of anti-Semitism came up now, and it has everything to do with being bitter about losing:

“The court did not turn a blind eye to any racist or anti-Semitic conduct because indeed there was none,” Albright wrote.

“The court finds that Freshub’s inflammatory allegations are nothing but baseless attacks on the integrity of this court and the reputation of defendants’ counsel,” Albright said.

“A bitter losing party’s difficulty in explaining its loss is never a proper basis for counsel to invoke baseless allegations of racism and anti-Semitism to request a new trial. Such vitriolic and unsubstantiated allegations are not only shocking but also offensive to this court.”

The Kramer Levin attorneys are not unfamiliar with benchslaps. U.S. District Judge William Alsup called out the[ same attorneys last July](https://www.law.com/therecorder/2021/07/27/alsup-names-shames-counsel-while-awarding-5-9-million-in-attorneys-fees/).

Sorry honey, but sometimes my millionaire boss feels lonely too.

Well, you’ve got to give this unnamed senior partner credit for saying the quiet part out loud.

This morning, Skadden announced that it would backtrack on its current 3-day hybrid office model and institute a 4-day, Monday-Thursday attendance model starting in September. And, of course, the firm intends to factor compliance with the policy into performance reviews. Because why evaluate attorneys on work product or revenue generated when face time is an option?

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Executive partner Eric Friedman blasted this message to the firm:



If the message found attorneys well, they didn’t stay that way for long. Is the irony lost on Skadden leadership that it trusts remote work technology to deliver the message that the firm no longer trusts its remote work model?

Yes. Yes it is.

The “specified remote work periods” include stretches like Thanksgiving week and the week between Christmas and the New Year.

It continues to confound that law firms seem unable to grasp that the value of hybrid office models is entirely in flexibility. Associates care less about the number of days they have to come in than the freedom to craft an office and commuting schedule that [works for them](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/cravath-backtracks-on-the-flexible-part-of-its-flexible-office-policy/). A three-day weekend (or more accurately a “three-day at home period that corresponds to what non-lawyers define as a “weekend”) might suit one lawyer, while another just wants Wednesdays at home because that’s the day that works for their child care.

And the advantage for the firm itself is [in hoteling concepts](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/managing-the-hybrid-office-of-the-future-with-a-couple-clicks/) — reducing the physical office footprint (and the associated overhead expenses) by having associates in on a rotating basis throughout the week. Making everyone come in on the same days requires keeping all the office space but utilizing it less.

Associates are not pleased. “If they enforce it I’ll quit, I’ve got tons of recruiting emails coming to me,” wrote one tipster. Biglaw compensation always presents a bit of a collective action problem, but a lot of folks overlook how this applies to office policies. If Skadden gets caught out on a M-Th mandatory limb while peer firms offer flexibility or fewer in-office days, it’s functionally placing a fire sale sign on its associate ranks.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And one unverified tip suggests that partners might not be pleased either — likely recognizing all the issues outlined above. According to this source, the policy was put to a vote at the partners meeting and failed. Could firm leadership have really ignored the collective will of the partners he imposed the policy anyway?

Oh, there’s a bit more:



In other words, the partners don’t want to be here in August either.

Which cuts to the core of these “return to the office” policies. Some partners are lonely and they want the single-serving friends that they pay to come hang out with them in the office. There are a lot of valid issues with fully remote work — mostly concerning training and team-building — but firms can address those without packing the office to the brim four days a week.

Partners are lonely. And they don’t think kids — or whatever other interest an attorney might have — should keep them from having juniors in the office to either pal around with or systemically berate.

So, yeah, “you didn’t see your kids before the pandemic….”

[](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/the-legal-tech-non-event/legal-tech-adoption-guide-cybersecurity/)As regular Non-Event visitors are aware, the coming year will again promise new, cutting-edge technology for your firm.

This can help you connect with and manage clients and billing, organize your data and documents, and put your whole operation into the cloud.

But with these new opportunities — and the integration of permanent remote work — come more points of vulnerability. 

In this special report on the state of law firm cybersecurity, renowned cybersecurity analyst and professor Leeza Garber details the newest challenges firms will face in 2022. And later, the top companies in tech show how you can keep your firm safe amid these ever-changing threats.

# How Do You Get Biglaw Firms To Care About Diversity?
## It's a tough question but one the industry must wrestle with.

It often feels like the legal industry should be further ahead on diversity issues than it is. Despite being a [profession](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/lawyers-hate-giving-money-to-donald-trump/) that’s [more liberal than average](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/biglaws-most-liberal/), there are still a shocking number of Biglaw firms with[ 1 percent or fewer black partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/um-where-are-all-the-black-partners-at-these-biglaw-firms/?rf=1). Yes, in 2019.

In this week’s episode of The Jabot, I speak with [Lynne Espy-Williams](https://www.cozen.com/people/bios/espy-williams-lynnette), Chief Diversity Officer and litigation partner at Cozen O’Connor. We discuss what it is about Biglaw that seems to hurts diversity, what law firms should be doing to change that, and what it looks like to change the industry to be more diverse.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wears when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

# What's Behind The New Am Law 100 Numbers?
## Michael Allen of Lateral Link analyzes the recently released Am Law 100 rankings.

Michael Allen

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors. [Michael Allen](http://www.laterallink.com/about/team/1) is Managing Principal at Lateral Link, focusing exclusively on partner placements with Am Law 200 clients and placements for in-house attorneys.

The [new Am Law 100 rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/) are finally in, and the race to analyze the results is underway. Those questioning whether Latham could defend its first-time title from 2015 were pleasantly surprised, as the firm fended off DLA Piper and Baker McKenzie, who were in close second and third, respectively.

Most Am Law rankings remained stable within the top 100 firms. Few firms gained or dropped more than a few places in the rankings. The biggest drop was Hughes Hubbard (dropping from 78 to 90). The two largest leaps were made by Locke Lord (which springboarded up 14 places off the Edwards Wildman merger) and Polsinelli (which gained 12 spots in the rankings after leaping from 86 to 74). Only 13 firms boasted the exact same rank as the year before, compared to 24 last year, and 19 moved just one spot (click to enlarge images).

[](http://laterallink.com/gen/amlawrank)

Overall attorney growth for Am Law 100 firms was slightly down this year. The average firm grew by 17 net attorneys compared to 20 last year. Morgan Lewis grew the most of any firm, increasing its number of attorneys by 542 thanks to the mass lateral hire of Bingham McCutchen lawyers.

[](http://laterallink.com/gen/netlawyers)

Partnership stocks were replenished at almost exactly the rate they were lost. Overall growth in the total number of equity partners in the Am Law 100 was a paltry 0.6 percent. Not all firms experienced meager growth, however. Morgan Lewis continued its candidacy for “Best 2015” by growing the equity partnership ranks by 44 percent, thanks again to the Bingham deal. By comparison, the second-best firm, Ballard Spahr, was over 30 percentage points behind, with a growth rate of 13 percent.

[](http://laterallink.com/gen/equitypartner)

Everyone’s favorite metric, PPP, yielded interesting results this year. Overall, PPP grew by 4 percent in the Am Law 100. Lewis Brisbois impressively grew its PPP by 24 percent while increasing overall headcount by 14 percent. Interestingly, the equity partnership stock actually shrunk by one, while the non-equity partnership ranks increased by 34. Arnold & Porter and Baker & McKenzie rounded out the bottom three in PPP percentage losses.

[](http://laterallink.com/gen/ppp16)

The greatest overall gains belong to Morgan Lewis, which grew revenue by an astounding $527,000,000, an amount that alone would place it at #63 on the Am Law 100. Ropes and Gray was in a distant (yet respectable) second place, with $274,500,000 gained.

Newcomer metric PPL looked to challenge its more established brethren PPP. The American Lawyer asserts that PPL will eventually replace PPP as the barometer of a firm’s performance, and so far this seems to hold true. The two-year change in PPL correlated more closely with the two-year change in gross revenue than the change in PPP did, by over 25 percent. Ballard Spahr grew its PPL by an unheard of 60 percent, more than twice its closest competitor (Fish & Richardson, 27 percent). PPL also rose by 4 percent overall in the Am Law 100, in line with PPP’s growth.

Overall, 2015 was a solid year for Biglaw. With overall growth in revenue and efficiency, Biglaw is primed for another strong year in 2016.

# Am Law 100 Firm Finally Hands Out Market Raises To Associates -- If They Bill Enough

Hey! Guess what? Biglaw raises are still happening! That’s great news if you happen to work at one of the dwindling number of Biglaw firms that has yet to pony up the cash to meet the new market standard for associate compensation set by Davis Polk back in June.

The latest firm to keep up with the DPWs of the industry is Venable, a firm that made $681,864,000 in gross revenue in 2020 taking 65th in the Am Law 100. But there’s a pretty big catch for midlevel and senior associates.

The new salary scale at the firm is as follows:

# Biglaw Firm To Close Three Offices, Likely Perform Layoffs
## How many lawyers will be affected by the office closures?

What does a Biglaw firm do when it has lawyers in three offices that no longer fit in with its primary practices? That firm closes the offices in question and potentially performs layoffs to tie up loose ends.

Troutman Sanders will be closing all of its offices in China — in Hong Kong (opened in 1997), Shanghai (opened in 2007), and Beijing (opened in 2013) — thus ceasing its operations in Asia entirely after a 21-year presence there. The firm made the announcement internally yesterday. Troutman Sanders delivered a statement on the winding down of its China offices to [Asian Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/international/2018/01/23/troutman-sanders-to-close-three-asian-offices/):

“As part of a strategic review and after careful consideration, we have concluded that there is not sufficient overlap between our China practice and our areas of greatest focus,” the firm said. “As a result, we have decided to cease our operations in China and close our Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing offices effective May 31, 2018. …

In the statement, Troutman stressed that 2017 had been a strong year for the firm, which had exceeded its goals for the third year in a row. It had done so largely by following a strategic plan. The China practice no longer fit into that plan.

“Our strategic plan prioritizes our areas of greatest focus, which include broadly serving the middle market, as well as representing clients in the energy, banking and finance, life sciences and insurance sectors,” the firm said.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Troutman has about 30 lawyers, including seven partners, across its three offices in China, none of whom practice within the firm’s “areas of greatest focus.” There’s been no official word yet on whether layoffs will occur due to the office closures.

We wish all of the lawyers and affected individuals at Troutman Sanders the best of luck while they seek new job opportunities in the legal industry and beyond.

# Biglaw Firms Are Continuing To Grow Amid Dropping Demand Because Associates Aren't Quitting

Not so fast…

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

I think it’s that they see their strength and they’re recruiting for areas that do have growth, and they just haven’t reduced in areas they haven’t seen growth. It’s not a decision overall to say, ‘We wanna continue to grow head count.’

[Many firms are] relying on some natural attrition, and it’s not coming along as fast as they’d like. The transactional associates are staying on when they might have otherwise chosen to leave voluntarily. At the same time, they do have to hire in other areas. So it’s kind of a mismatch in skill sets, and they’re not interchangeable.

— Owen Burman, managing director for Wells Fargo Legal Group, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2023/05/30/why-is-big-law-growing-when-demand-is-dropping/) on law firms’ recent growth in head count. In 2022, Am Law 100 firms grew head count by 4.3% on average, with a median of about 923 lawyers, while in 2021, the median was 880.

# Fired Biglaw Associate Who Tried To Extort Partners Now Facing Ethics Charges
## He wanted to screw the partners, but in the end, he only screwed himself.

Michael Potere

You may remember the mystical, magical case of Michael Potere, the former Dentons associate who was fired and allegedly decided to [exact his revenge](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/biglaw-associate-arrested-over-plot-to-extort-partners/) against the firm by threatening to leak sensitive information taken from the email account of the Los Angeles office’s managing director — i.e., information that ranged from emails between partners to the firm’s quarterly financial reports to associate reviews — to Above the Law, unless he was paid $210,000 and given an expensive piece of artwork. Prior to his arrest, Potere reportedly told two partners he felt like “people his age were getting screwed and that he might have a chance to screw back.”

As you may have guessed, Potere screwed himself further and was later arrested and indicted on charges of extortion, attempted extortion affecting interstate commerce, and transmitting threatening communications with intent to extort. Instead of potentially spending more than two decades behind bars, he [took a plea deal](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/fired-associate-takes-plea-deal-in-biglaw-extortion-charge/) on a lesser charge. Prosecutors asked that Potere receive a three-month prison sentence, but instead, he received [five months in jail](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/former-associate-gets-jail-time-in-biglaw-extortion-case/) with one year of supervised release.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Things have only gotten worse for Potere since then, as state bar authorities have decided to come for his license to practice law. The Illinois Attorney Registration & Disciplinary Commission claims that Potere’s actions (specifically, that he committed a crime and engaged in conduct involving “dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation”) violated professional conduct rules. Here’s some additional information about the complaint from the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/07/25/ex-dentons-associate-in-disciplinary-hot-water-after-extortion-plot/):

Dentons, which ultimately fired Potere, assisted an FBI probe into the former associate’s conduct, according to the disciplinary complaint and court records in Potere’s criminal case. While cooperating with the FBI, a pair of unnamed Dentons partners in Los Angeles met with Potere in May 2017 and helped investigators obtain audio and video recordings of the associate admitting to accessing the confidential firm documents, threatening to leak them, and repeating his demands for the money and artwork.

The disciplinary complaint also noted Dentons partners warned Potere that he may incur potential criminal consequences and legal ethics violations based on his conduct. Potere, the complaint said, “responded that he did not care about professional disciplinary issues because he did not plan to practice law again.”

While the ethics complaint doesn’t recommend a specific punishment for Potere, we have a feeling that he won’t have to worry about practicing law again.

# The 60 Best Law Firms For Women (2020)

Year in and year out, we watch law firm after law firm pay lip service to their commitment to diversity in the legal profession, with promises to put women attorneys on equal footing with their male counterparts, whether it be through hiring and retaining more women attorneys, promoting more women attorneys to equity partnership ranks, providing more leadership positions to women attorneys, or adopting more family-friendly policies to ensure that women attorneys are able to excel at their jobs while maintaining a stable work/life balance. Despite these continued assurances, and despite the fact that a number of firms have made great efforts to improve women’s stature in the law, there is still much more to be done.

Today, Working Mother released its thirteenth annual list of the 60 Best Law Firms for Women. These law firms are considered pioneers in the field when it comes to attracting, retaining, and promoting women lawyers. These law firms not only stand out as being family-friendly workplaces, but they also ensure that women shine in their equity partnership ranks.

Which firms made the cut for this year’s ranking?

To earn themselves a spot on the Working Mother Best Law Firms list, self-selected applicant firms with 50 or more lawyers must complete an extensive application (more than 300 questions long) with topics ranging from attorney representation, schedule flexibility, paid time off and parental leaves, and development and retention of women. Working Mother then selected the 60 best firms based on data provided by those firms from the year 2019 (i.e., pre-pandemic data). “Law firms on this year’s list were better prepared to respond to the effects of the pandemic because of their continued support of flextime and remote work for working parents and caregivers,” said Subha V. Barry, president of Working Mother Media. “We are proud to recognize their resilience and steadfast commitment to supporting gender equality.”

Here are some of the interesting results gleaned from Working Mother’s study:

Flexibility Has Been Increasing

- Pre COVID-19, all these firms offered reduced hours and remote work for lawyers. Thirty-nine percent of female lawyers used remote work in 2019.
Top Law Firms Hold Leaders Accountable for These Factors

- Career progression of women lawyers who are direct reports…72%
- Managing work-life issues of direct reports…67%
- Career progression of lawyers working reduced hours who are direct reports…66%
Advancement Matters

- The number of women lawyers promoted to equity partner has increased by almost 25% in the past five years.
- All firms on the list offer formal mentoring and 50 percent of mentees are women.
- Two-third of the firms on the list have formal sponsorship with 62% of participants female.

# John Quinn Still Isn't Happy, But Now He's Showing A Softer Side
## Wherein Quinn tells his firm how much he loves them.

When Philippe Selendy and Faith Gay announced they’d be [leaving Quinn Emanuel](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/big-name-departures-from-quinn-emanuel/) to start their own firm, John Quinn wasn’t happy. And he let [everyone in the world know he wasn’t happy](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/john-quinn-is-not-happy-about-selendy-gay-and-he-sent-the-angry-reply-all-to-prove-it/). His blistering “reply all” to Faith Gay’s departure memo laid bare the sort of frustration that too often goes unseen.

In the passive-aggressive world of law, Quinn opted for a more active-aggressive approach.

As I said at the time, it’s refreshing — as an industry observer — to see an honest expression of the hurt feelings that naturally accompany any high-profile move. It was almost assuredly not an advisable email to send, indeed some of the digs seemed unfair if not condescending to a highly successful woman at the top of the legal industry — but anger makes people say regrettable things, or at least phrase their honest feelings in regrettable ways.

So now, with the passage of a little time, Quinn is taking a softer approach. He’s still not happy, but he’s shifting to the “I love you, man” stage of the grief cycle. In another email to all sent yesterday afternoon, Quinn opened up about the warm fuzzies he feels when personnel decide not to jump ship to Selendy & Gay ([full email transcribed here](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/john-quinn-still-isnt-happy-but-now-hes-showing-a-softer-side/2/)).

But, what is remarkable — and makes me proud — is the way in which our people have come together and shown their dedication to this great firm and to one another. We often speak about NFLO (No Firm Like Ours). The last few weeks have seen that motto put in action. I believe many of us have re-discovered how much this common enterprise means to us, and how much each and every person means to the firm. I, and I know other partners in the firm, have been very gratified that people who have been approached have overwhelmingly voted to stay with us — including many who worked primarily with the lawyers who left. This is not something we will take for granted or forget. I certainly won’t. Keeping this renewed commitment alive is a task that should never end. It will make us better and stronger as a firm.

Aw.

Seriously though, Quinn Emanuel has a bounty of talent and while Quinn would love to keep everybody, the firm isn’t going to suffer if several employees make the move the Selendy & Gay. In a year we’ll be talking about Quinn Emanuel as an industry giant and we’ll be talking about Selendy & Gay as one of the hottest newcomer firms in years. Everyone is going to get their piece of the pie when this is all said and done.

But it looks like it’s still going to take awhile for Quinn to be totally cool with this.

# Partners Usually Have Difficulty Keeping Secrets From Associates
## Once one associate knows confidential information, most of the other associates will shortly find out such details.

Partners often try to keep information about a firm secret from associates. At times, law firms go through precarious financial periods, and partners might want to keep plans for layoffs, expansions, office closures, and other information secret so that morale is not impacted. However, partners often have a difficult time keeping secrets from associates and should usually assume that anything the partners know will eventually be leaked to associates for a variety of reasons.

Shared Email Accounts

One of the biggest reasons why information might leak to associates is the access some associates may be granted to email accounts of partners. When I was working at a large law firm earlier in my career, some of the partners were not too proficient with technology. As a result, some associates had access to the email accounts of a partner so they could apprise a partner of information faster since the partner rarely checked his email. Moreover, the partner was responsible for thousands of cases, and having associates access his email made it easier for our law firm to handle the loads of associated messages.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
However, giving associates access to the partner’s email account also gave associates access to communications that were unrelated to the matters upon which the associates were working. Indeed, some of the associates conveyed that they saw emails scheduling curious meetings and other messages about the financial health of the firm. In this way, associates could tell that layoffs were on the horizon even though partners were trying to keep this information under wraps to protect office morale. Of course, it seems less likely in the present day that partners would share email access with associates, but if they do, partners need to be extremely careful to ensure that associates are unable to access confidential information about a law firm.

Friendships With Partners

Some partners are very friendly with associates and speak about all types of topics. Usually, the partners with the best connection with associates are younger ones who might have only recently been elevated to the position of partner. Since these individuals might have recently been associates themselves, they might have more rapport with associates than partners who have been partners managing associates for decades.

In my experience, the easiest way for secretive information to leak from partners to associates is when junior partners share information with favored associates and these associates spread such information with other associates. Everyone loves to gossip, and junior partners might want to show off their access to secretive information by sharing details with associates to which those associates might not be privy. Even though a junior partner might think they can trust an associate to keep secretive information to themselves, this rarely happens, and once one associate knows confidential information, most of the other associates will shortly find out such details. In any event, if partners want to ensure that less secretive information leaks out, they should tell partners that they should not discuss such matters with even trusted associates to ensure the information does not leak.

Administrative Professionals

People always underestimate how much information administrative professionals like secretaries and IT professionals know about a law firm. However, these individuals might know more about the happenings of a law firm than associates in many circumstances. For instance, secretaries might be involved in booking travel or making other kinds of arrangements which can signal news that might be on the horizon at a law firm. In addition, information technology professionals might be tasked with cutting people off from their technology once they are laid off, and this can give them valuable information about who might be on the chopping block at a law firm.

Some associates do not have the best relationship with administrative professionals since associates and other professionals may not mix and mingle at some shops. However, if associates want to know all of the secretive information floating around at a shop, they should definitely become friendly with administrative professionals. Everyone loves to gossip, and once an administrative professional starts talking about a secretive matter, the information is sure to travel to other people at a law firm.

In my experience, there were only a few times in my career that partners were able to keep important information from associates at a law firm. But if partners focus on securing avenues that secretive information typically leaks from partners to associates, they can have a better chance at keeping confidential information from spreading.

# The Best Law Firms To Work For: Biglaw 'Quality Of Life' Rankings
## Is your firm in the top 10, or perhaps the top 25?

Biglaw quality of life — what life? Cynics might say that “Biglaw quality of life” is something of an oxymoron.

If you’re expecting to earn [$180,000 a year](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) in your first job out of law school, be prepared for some sacrifices. And the required sacrifices could grow in the months ahead; as [Patrick Lamb](http://www.abajournal.com/legalrebels/article/associate_salary_increases_may_not_be_good_business) and others have warned, look for billable-hour requirements to increase in the wake of the recent pay raises.

How firms respond to the raises will vary from workplace to workplace. Not all firms are created equal — notwithstanding the attempts of many firms to make it look like they are the equal of Cravath simply because they pay the same starting salary. As I have [argued before](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/dear-biglaw-firms-please-dont-raise-salaries/), not every firm should be copying the Cravath pay scale. If a firm decides not to raise pay (or not to raise pay to the full Cravath scale), that doesn’t mean it’s automatically a loser (as the Donald might say) in the fight for talent. Firms can distinguish themselves in other ways — for example, by making themselves into great places to work.

How do you figure out which firms are great workplaces? There’s a ranking for that, produced by our friends over at [Vault](http://www.vault.com/blog/vaults-law-blog-legal-careers-and-industry-news/2017-best-law-firms-to-work-for):

Vault’s 2017 Quality of Life rankings are here, and there’s a new Best Law Firm to Work For. O’Melveny & Myers tops the overall quality of life ranking, knocking previous champ Paul Hastings from the No. 1 position. O’Melveny earned that ranking in part by topping two Quality of Life categories—Satisfaction and Hours—while coming in second in three more areas key to associate happiness—Firm Culture, Leadership Transparency, and Substantive Work. O’Melveny’s associates report to Vault that “O’Melveny has a culture of caring about each other and truly seeing our work together as a team activity” and that “the people are what make OMM the best!”

The competition at the top is intense; Ropes & Gray is putting up a strong fight to reclaim the top spot. Ropes topped the Best to Work For list in 2011 and has been No. 2 since then, trailing O’Melveny by just 0.07 points this year. After three years at the top, Paul Hastings falls four places to the No. 5 spot.

Here are the top 10 firms in Vault’s 2017 quality of life rankings:

1. O’Melveny & Myers (up from #3)
2. Ropes & Gray (no change)
3. Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe (up from not ranked)
4. Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson (up from #17)
5. Paul Hastings (down from #1)
6. Thompson & Knight (up from not ranked)
7. Williams & Connolly (up from #13)
8. BuckleySandler (down from #5)
9. Gibson Dunn & Crutcher (down from #7)
10. Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett & Dunner (no change)

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Congratulations to these ten top firms, as well as all the firms in the [full top 25 list](http://www.vault.com/company-rankings/law/best-law-firms-to-work-for/).

If you check Vault’s list of top 25 firms against our [salary wars scorecard](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises/) listing which firms have announced raises since the start of June 2016, you’ll see that most of them are on the Cravath scale. But you’ll also find a few firms that either haven’t adopted the Cravath scale in full or haven’t raised pay at all.

And maybe that’s okay. As we’ve said before, Biglaw [isn’t all about the benjamins](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/09/biglaw-its-not-all-about-the-benjamins/). If you’re an associate who enjoys your work and your colleagues — if, in short, you believe your firm offers good quality of life — then maybe you shouldn’t worry too much about the money you might be leaving on the table.

P.S. Of course, to earn the goodwill of our many associate readers, here at ATL we will still [pressure firms to raise salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/the-firms-that-are-losing-the-battle-in-biglaws-salary-wars/). Firms should resist our pressure as their circumstances dictate. And don’t take it personally, partners; it’s just our job.

# Will Law Firms Have Normal Holiday Festivities This Year?
## Hopefully this year is finally the time when law firms can have holiday parties like they did before COVID-19.

Ah, the office holiday party. Anywhere but Nakatomi Tower.

I was watching TV about a week ago (yes, live TV!) and to my surprise and, I’ll admit, to my chagrin, a holiday commercial flashed on the screen. I thought that there was an unspoken rule that holiday commercials could not play before Halloween, but apparently, the advertisers in question did not get the memo and decided to capitalize on the 2.5 months before the holidays to hawk their goods. This got me thinking to how the holidays were right around the corner, and whether law firms would return to their normal festivities this year. Although people have said it before, I am hoping that this year is finally the time when law firms can have holiday parties like they did before COVID-19.

In 2020, pretty much every firm went without a holiday party. The COVID-19 pandemic was raging, and cases were rising because more people were indoors around the holiday season due to the cold weather. In addition, COVID-19 vaccines were just being rolled out, and only a small amount of healthcare workers had vaccines at that point. Law firms wisely chose to maintain social distancing by not having holiday parties, and it is clear that holiday parties could have been super spreader events.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In 2021, the situation was a little different. COVID-19 vaccines had been around for quite some time, and they were relatively effective against the virus. Against this backdrop, many law firms decided to host holiday parties. However, right after Thanksgiving, news broke that the Omicron variant of COVID-19 had been discovered, and it was much more transmissible and vaccine-resistant than other variants. Some law firms decided to cancel their holiday parties while other law firms decided to go ahead with their plans. Around the holidays, COVID-19 case counts reached levels never seen before, and it was usually a solid idea not to host a gathering against this backdrop.

However, this holiday season may finally be different. There is so much natural immunity and vaccine-induced immunity in the population that perhaps case counts will not rise too dramatically around the holidays. Moreover, the bivalent vaccines are now widely available, and they are more effective against the Omicron variants than other vaccines. I have been wrong before about a return to normal when it comes to the holidays in the legal profession, but hopefully this year, things will be more like they were before the COVID-19 pandemic.

I hope companies will organize a variety of holiday events this year that were typically held before the pandemic. Top of mind is the Above the Law holiday party I have attended almost every year it was held for the past decade. This event was an amazing time for individuals across the legal profession to get together, take it easy, and make new connections. The event was always well-attended by people from across the legal profession. Not to out the great folks for whom I write, but I really hope this event makes a return sometime soon.

I also loved attending holiday parties hosted by various vendors. Some service companies within the legal industry, like court-reporting agencies, held holiday parties frequently before the pandemic. Some of these events were legendary “can’t miss” affairs according to numerous industry insiders. The events were a good way for the companies to advertise their servicews and were also a solid way for attorneys to meet people who did not work at their firms. Of course, such events probably cost a pretty penny that can impact the bottom line of these companies, but the events are a great way to build good will for these companies with many different kinds of lawyers.

Lastly, of course, some of the greatest holiday parties within the legal profession are hosted by law firms themselves. Every single firm I worked at had a holiday party. Some of the holiday events were huge affairs at country clubs or other exclusive venues at which the firm likely spent tens of thousands of dollars. Other holiday parties past firms hosted were smaller affairs at a local bar. No matter the size or venue, law firm holiday parties can be a great way for individuals who work at a law firm to forge connections outside of an office. This can also be the perfect time for alumni of the law firm to reconnect with people with whom they used to work, which can be helpful toward business development efforts.

All told, the legal industry has had to sacrifice a number of traditions over the past few years because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Hopefully, this year can be the first year in a while in which lawyers and staff within the legal profession can enjoy a mostly normal holiday season.

# Schedule A Meeting With Your Firm's IT Group This Week!
## Lawyers aren't going to legal technology shows... take advantage of folks that do.

Lawyers do not have time to take a week away from the billing grind to learn about all the cutting edge tools being built to make their lives easier. Well run firms and legal departments have technology professionals on staff (or consultants on retainer) who do their level best to keep their organizations on the right technological track, but at the end of the day these folks aren’t the end users and a technology strategy is only as good as the buy-in from attorneys.

This is the fundamental issue with ILTACON every year. The show brings together around 3000 attendees — from the IT side and the vendor side — for one of the best peer learning and market intelligence gathering events out there.

But legal tech is a three-pronged stool and the missing leg represents the lawyers out there who write the checks and ultimately have to use all this fabulous tech. And there are vendors and tech professionals out there doing a magnificent job of gleaning what lawyers need and building the attorney support needed to ensure adoption, but the fact that one necessary piece of the legal tech puzzle is always already absent from these conferences guarantees that even the most successful show ends incomplete.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The legal press are basically the “lawyers by proxy” at any show, talking to the vendors to convey the narrative the lawyers need to hear. Which is a little different — and probably the source of the show’s [sometimes rocky relationship with the press](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/iltacon-reminds-us-that-we-cant-have-nice-things/) — because conferences always understand their core audiences but with ILTA the challenge is stepping outside that box.

Articles like this one — and the many more that will follow over the next few weeks — are about showing a junior partner that there’s a better way to build a deposition binder or a deputy GC that there’s something out there providing instant contract visibility.

Which brings us to the real call to action guiding our tech coverage here: Don’t wait until the next procurement interval or, worse, tech crisis to find out what’s going on — meet with your people now. Thousands of IT professionals just returned home brimming with knowledge and stacks of business cards from innovative vendors. They know what they can implement, they need to know what they should implement by getting some enthusiasm from users. If you have any influence within your organization this is the time to hear about it.

Besides, the firm paid to send these folks, so may as well find out what happened.

# Kirkland & Ellis Announces November Office Return, Complete With New COVID Vaccine Or Testing Protocol
## The firm's reopening amenities for employees are pretty nice, too.

As the legal profession attempts to get back to the office to begin to create the next normal, law firms have been faced with delay after delay thanks to the constantly evolving coronavirus crisis. Plans for September returns to office begat postponements to October, and some firms have even decided to forgo reopening in 2021 at all. In recent days, however, more than half a dozen Biglaw firms have settled on November as the perfect time to return to their work outside of a remote enviroment.

The latest firm to announce a November return is none other than Kirkland & Ellis, the world’s wealthiest law firm. In 2020, the firm brought in $4,830,000,000 gross revenue, topping the charts for not just America, but the globe. The firm originally planned to [reopen in September](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/kirkland-reopening/), but has now chosen to welcome employees back to the office on November 8. As part of its return, the firm will now require vaccination or weekly COVID testing for all. Here’s a relevant excerpt from the memo (available in full on the next page):

As many are aware, the U.S. Department of Labor announced plans to issue federal guidelines that would require employers like us to limit access to our facilities only to those persons who provide either proof of vaccination or a weekly negative COVID test. We do not know whether or when these proposed regulations will become effective.

After a thorough review, we have decided to adopt this same approach for our U.S. offices, regardless of whether the federal guidelines take effect. We do so in the interest of establishing uniformity across all of our U.S. offices.

As a result, effective November 8, 2021, and until further notice, all personnel will need to provide either proof of vaccination or a weekly negative COVID test.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In an effort to continue to provide “market-leading benefits, offerings, and workspaces,” Kirkland will shatter the amenities market with things like:

- Complimentary breakfast, lunch, and snacks
- On-site concierge support and services (e.g., dry cleaning, errand running services, etc.)
- Social events that bring offices and practices/departments together regularly
Are lawyers ready for the [“office-centric work environment”](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/kirkland-reopening/) that was first announced when the firm originally planned to reopen in September? We suppose we’ll see what happens.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

# Thousands Of Biglaw Partners Issue Calls To Action In The Wake Of Dobbs
## An army of Biglaw partners has assembled to offer pro bono assistance to those in need.

Now that the Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade with its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health — negating almost 50 years of precedent and effectively taking away a once-constitutional right to choose — many lawyers are incensed. Law firms have pledged to defend abortion rights for people, and some have even joined forces with the [Legal Alliance for Reproductive Rights](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/biglaw-firms-finally-speak-up-in-wake-of-scotus-leak-and-theyre-prepared-to-defend-abortion-rights-in-america/) to do so. Now, thousands of individual partners from some of the largest law firms in the world have signed onto calls of action to support reproductive rights in America.

More than 2,500 women partners from some of the most prestigious Biglaw firms across the country have joined together “with sorrow and a call to action” in our post-Dobbs nation to defend the right to choose. From their [letter](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/07/05/450-women-partners-across-big-law-issue-call-to-action-post-dobbs/):

In sum, with the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs, women’s fundamental rights to liberty and equality have been drastically abridged. Women’s right to make choices about our reproductive health and when and if to have or expand a family is now subject to the control of state legislatures. The court has failed to uphold the promise at the very core of the Constitution: the promise of liberty and dispassionate, fair and equal treatment for all under law.

We cannot let that failure stand. As lawyers, and officers of the courts, we know we have unique abilities and responsibilities in the wake of this decision. To honor that responsibility and our oath to support the Constitution, we each commit ourselves to offering our pro bono legal services to organizations that defend and support women’s rights to autonomy, equality and safe access to reproductive care, including abortion. These organizations have waged the battle for reproductive freedom for decades. Now more than ever, they are in need as they support women across the country who will find themselves in the crosshairs of the law. This commitment is personal, but we call upon members of the bar across the country to make similar commitments, including and importantly the men of the bar, who we need as our allies in the fight for equal citizenship.

Shortly there after, more than 1,400 male Biglaw partners penned their own call to action, in solidarity with their female colleagues. From their [letter](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/07/01/over-1000-male-partners-start-own-call-to-action-post-dobbs/):

We refuse to remain silent. Too often, reproductive health care is framed as a “women’s issue.” While women are clearly affected most significantly and directly, this is a human rights issue. It is imperative that men speak up and stand up as reproductive justice affects us all. This is not just about abortion, although abortion is health care and should be treated as such.

As members of the bar, we took an oath to uphold the Constitution and its promise of liberty and equality for all. Dobbs breaches that promise and hands women’s right to make their own reproductive decisions over to the whims of state legislatures. It is our duty to join our women colleagues and also offer our pro bono services to organizations that defend and support women’s rights to autonomy, equality and reproductive care. We are committed to offering those services and also to making a donation now to support such organizations.

Those seeking abortion access now have a veritable army of attorneys to call upon to defend their bodily autonomy. Thank you to each and every lawyer who signed these letters. There is strength in numbers, and your decision to help those in need during these tough times shows just how powerful your dedication to this human rights issue truly is.

# If You're Working This Weekend It Might Be Because Your Bosses Are Dropping The Ball

Working over holiday weekends is not extraordinary for Biglaw associates. Frankly, it’s not out of the ordinary for small law associates. For over a decade I was home on Memorial Day exactly once. Working holidays is unfortunately part of the job.

But even though it’s sometimes necessary, a lot of times it’s just… not.

We’ve litigated the question of whether or not lawyers are technophobes to death. Whether it’s a fear of technology or the inefficiencies of any large organization, there are associates out there struggling because they’re doing tasks by hand that the legal technology community automated years ago.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Are you a transactional associate doing due diligence this weekend? Looking at key provisions from a hefty sample significant deals? Did you know [Kira Systems](https://kirasystems.com/) has a solution that could let you review every deal using artificial intelligence. In a fast, cost effective manner, you could have problematic provisions flagged for evaluation instead of trying to dig them out of a sample. Frankly, this isn’t only a time-saving measure, it might be a professional responsibility matter — if tech exists that could find problems and the firm doesn’t identify them as part of the sample, is that really due diligence?

And contract review [is not just about due diligence](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/2021/05/18/just-calling-a-product-artificial-intelligence-isnt-good-enough/). There are multiple aspects of the contract review from [BlackBoiler](https://www.blackboiler.com/) to [Luminance](https://www.luminance.com/) process that all have their own AI-based solutions designed to expedite the drudgery.

On the litigation side there are discovery platforms that use AI to charge through mounds of documents more efficiently. There are products like [Casetext](https://casetext.com/) for research and writing. [LexisNexis](https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/products/context.page) and [Westlaw](https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/insights/articles/westlaw-edge-litigation-analytics) offer various analytics tools to [streamline](https://legaltalknetwork.com/podcasts/thinking-like-a-lawyer/2018/12/getting-inside-a-judges-head/) the annoying “look up every thing our judge has ever said about this issue” task.

Everywhere you turn there’s a product designed to help associates do these tasks faster. If you’re looking to find out what’s out there, we [have a guide right here](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/the-legal-tech-non-event/). Has your firm taken the steps to help you finish your job in time for Friday happy hour? If they haven’t, get active within the firm — maybe there’s a tech committee, or allies to find on the IT staff or among the law librarians — and make sure the firm has access to the tech it needs. Or more importantly that it’s adopting the tech it’s already bought.

# The Biglaw Firms With The Best Client Pitches
## It's the windup... and the pitch! Which firms scored home runs in this ranking?

When an prospective in-house client is searching for a Biglaw firm for any kind of representation, what may matter most when it comes to clinching the deal is the firm’s business pitch.

But which firms do it best?

As luck would have it, there’s a new ranking for that. BTI Consulting Group interviewed almost 350 corporate counsel for its 22nd Annual Survey of Top Legal Decision Makers, and time and again, these in-house clients named 30 firms that not only gave the best pitches but also met their goals for a pitch. “These seasoned clients have seen it all before. Or at least most of it,” writes BTI’s Michael Rynowecer. “And they can spot a great pitch in an instant. Clients want to learn and see a path to their goals.”

# Tips To Increase Your Biglaw Salary
## Salary negotiations are tricky, here's a guide of things to consider.

Think back to the summer of 2018, when everyone thought that Tobias Harris was crazy for not taking an $80 million extension from the Los Angeles Clippers. Fast forward to the summer of 2019, Harris received a contract extension worth $180 million from the 76ers.

Just because your current employer tells you that you are worth a certain amount does NOT mean you cannot bet on yourself and secure more cash in your pocket. Salary negotiations are tricky, and it is helpful to get in touch with an experienced recruiter before you attempt to renegotiate with your current firm. Before you start maneuvering, here is a guide to consider before strategizing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqYzoYIwfY

Lateral Moves. Typically, moving laterally is one of the fastest and most efficient ways to increase your salary by 10-20%. It is simply the nature of the business that different firms will value you at different levels—much like Harris means more to Philadelphia as a complement to Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons than he does to the Clippers. You should leverage the market to maximize your payday. After twelve years of prep, four years of undergrad (or maybe five to the ire of your parents), three years of law school and possibly eight years as an associate, partnership is your chance for payday. What may seem like a marginal increase in pay can compound immensely after a 20-30 year partnership and any increase in pay can also provide a launch point for future increases as well. Don’t simply chase the next payday, make sure it sets up the subsequent ones as well.

Put Management On Notice (Tactfully). Approach management at the firm in a smart and well thought out manner. If you approach management without doing your research, they will not recognize your efforts and most likely you won’t get any offer at all. We have many resources available to help partners know their market worth. There are many free resources available to you so you can try to ascertain your maximum market value. Like Yelp and other user-generated-content sites, you probably won’t find the data realistic for your pay grade. Lateral Link recruiters have access to many tools to help you figure out your highest potential salary and where you can get it.

Recent laterals are also a good indicator of what you are worth on the market—albeit not always at your firm. If a partner with a similar background laterals to your firm with a significantly higher salary, go to management and show them that this is indicative of an increase in your value as well.

Success From Within. Connections are important outside of your firm, but your current workplace can also be a great resource to build your network. Seek out lawyers in similar practices and you may be able to source additional work should the client’s needs be more suited towards your expertise. Furthermore, get to know the successful group heads and try to align yourself with them. If you consistently show management that you are a hard worker and have a positive presence in the office, they will be more inclined to reward you when the time is right.

Keep in mind, your value grows, whether you are an associate, partner or counsel if the firm is prospering from your work. This might sound too obvious, but many attorneys undervalue their skills or become complacent over time. The truth is, if you are a partner and your salary has not increased over the past 10 years, you are making significantly less than market. Make sure your salary is adjusted not only for inflation but also for your market value.

Don’t Bite Off More Than You Can Chew. If you go into a salary negotiation, you better be able to deliver everything you promised or that will come back to bite you and you could find yourself in a worse position than where you started. When you negotiate a salary with your current or prospective firm, make sure you keep your long-term practice in mind. Everyone wants a large salary, but if you are fired or lose clients, your value has the potential to be significantly less than your previous market value.

# The Global 100: The Richest Law Firms In The World (2021)
## Which firms are at the very top of the list this year?

Law.com recently published its latest edition of the Global 100, a ranking of the world’s 100 largest law firms by total revenue. How did these firms do in the year that was? As we learned from the [most recent Am Law 100 rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/a-deep-dive-into-the-2021-am-law-100-rankings/), despite the pandemic, 2020 was a banner year for Biglaw firms, with some of the planet’s top-grossing firms setting financial records. What are we looking at in terms of the big picture?

Overall, the Global 100’s gross revenue grew by 6.7 percent (up 2 percentage points from fiscal year 2019), bringing the collective earnings of these firms up to nearly $128 billion. During a time when some thought the coronavirus crisis would bring about all sorts of financial negatives, Biglaw was absolutely booming in some areas of the world, up by more than $8 billion year over year. Making up over three-quarters of the Global 100, the United States continues to dominate the list. This time around, 51 firms had more than $1 billion in revenue — and the vast majority of those firms are based in America.

Here are the [top 10 firms of the 2021 Global 200](https://www.law.com/international-edition/2021/09/21/the-2021-global-200-ranked-by-gross-revenue/) (i.e., the top 10 firms ranked by 2020 revenue). Almost all of these firms have most of their lawyers in the U.S.:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
- Kirkland & Ellis: $4,830,000,000
- Latham & Watkins: $4,333,763,000
- DLA Piper: $3,133,829,000
- Dentons: $2,910,300,000
- Baker McKenzie: $2,899,834,000
- Skadden Arps: $2,662,890,000
- Sidley Austin: $2,462,935,000
- Morgan Lewis: $2,446,000,000
- White & Case: $2,387,800,000
- Clifford Chance: $2,345,141,000
Here’s some commentary on how the top firms on the planet fared so incredibly well in these unprecedented times:

“The latest figures demonstrate how the world’s largest commercial law firms are able to thrive in almost any market environment,” said Paul Hodkinson, London-based Editor-In-Chief of Law.com International. “In particular, U.S.-based firms, which make up the bulk of the list, have performed well on the back of a strong domestic economy, and it is a similar story with China-based firms.”

Lisa Shuchman, New York-based Executive Editor of Law.com International, added: “The 2021 Global 200 data shows that steady demand is allowing the world’s largest firms to keep on growing. Most regions — notably the Asia Pacific and Latin America — have demonstrated they have great growth potential for global and domestic firms that have positioned themselves well in those markets.”

# It's All About Optics, Man: Biglaw Firm Bans Personal Email After Salary Info Leaked
## For law firms, banning personal email has become a bit of a thing, but it is all about timing.

For law firms, banning[ personal email](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/which-biglaw-firm-has-blocked-personal-email/) has [become](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/04/youve-got-no-mail-major-law-firm-blocks-employee-email-access/) a bit of a [thing](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/biglaw-trend-alert-say-goodbye-to-gmail/). Citing security concerns and client requirements, blocking access to webmail sites has been trending in Biglaw. Sure, sometimes the associates express their dissatisfaction with the new policy (to be fair, when you spend 12+ hours a day in your office anything that makes keeping up with your personal life even a little bit more difficult is going to be met with resistance, and with good cause), and firms may devise [workarounds](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/10/a-sensible-solution-to-the-problem-of-personal-email-and-web-browsing-at-work/) or modify the most draconian of the restrictions, but these new policies are only growing in popularity.

So it isn’t really surprising that Jones Day has jumped on the banning personal email bandwagon, but it’s all about timing, man. Last Thursday — the day after Above the Law[ posted the associate salary information](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/) we’ve compiled from attorneys at the firm, which is notoriously tight-lipped on compensation issues — the firm announced a new policy ending access to personal email at the firm.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
As a tipster noted:

Also to add insult to injury we just got the attached memo, saying they’re blocking Gmail from our work computers, even when we take them home. Ppl are going to be upset when they see this.

We don’t blame you at all. After just learning the “black box” compensation model seems to keep most associates at below-market rates, morale must already be low, and now you can’t even check your Gmail account. That sucks.

At least this doesn’t mean you have to keep quiet about any Biglaw tips you want to send to Above the Law! You can always text us at (646-820-8477), and you can text a photo of any memos or emails you want to send along. As always, all sources are kept strictly confidential.

# A Biglaw Holiday Romance? D.C. Powerhouse Cuddles Up To Prominent New York Firm
## Baby, it's cold outside, and these firms have got the urge to merge.

Crowell & Moring and Herrick Feinstein?

Could it be? Is there a Biglaw holiday romance afoot? According to sources, D.C. government contracts powerhouse Crowell & Moring is involved in “late-stage negotiations” to merge with prominent New York real estate firm Herrick Feinstein. The news was first reported by [The Real Deal](http://therealdeal.com/2016/12/12/herrick-feinstein-in-merger-talks-with-d-c-based-crowell-moring-sources/), which claims that both firms are in the process of drafting a letter of intent.

Neither firm has commented on the alleged December romance, but if the firms were to combine, the merger would create an entity with about 570 lawyers and $478 million in gross revenue. Here’s some additional information from the [Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202774562891/Merger-Madness-Hits-Crowell-amp-Moring-Herrick-Feinstein?mcode=1202617075486&curindex=0&curpage=ALL&slreturn=20161114120023):

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Crowell, with about 440 lawyers, generated $363 million in revenue in 2015, while Herrick, an Am Law 200 firm with about 132 attorneys, grossed about $115.5 million, according to The American Lawyer’s latest financial and census figures.

The merger would signal further consolidation among Am Law 100 and 200 firms, which have been coping with flat demand and the rising costs of associate salaries. And it would represent another Washington, D.C.-founded firm acquiring a smaller but prominent New York firm. Just last month, Arnold & Porter in Washington said it would merge with New York-based Kaye Scholer.

Will they or won’t they? Two sources with ties to Herrick gave conflicting answers, with one saying the talks were “preliminary,” with a deal was unlikely to be announced before 2017, and another saying the firms had been in tie-up talks for months. Stay tuned, because unlike the failed talks between Crowell & Moring and Saterlee Stephens last year, this prospective law firm coupling could go the distance.

# Top Biglaw Firm Announces National Salary Scale For All Associates
## This Davis Polk match is for everyone -- no matter their office or how much remote work they do.

Compensation changes are happening at Biglaw firms across the country, so wouldn’t it make sense for Biglaw firms to adjust their existing salary scales and move to a national salary scale?

That’s what’s happening at Orrick, a firm that brought in $1,152,850,000 gross revenue in 2020, landing it at No. 35 in the most recent Am Law 100 rankings. At the close of business yesterday, Orrick announced that because they strive to work as “one team,” the firm would be moving to a national pay scale for all U.S. partner-track associates and of counsel, no matter their office affiliation and no matter the amount of remote that’s being performed. And what pay scale would that be? The Davis Polk scale, of course. Salaries will also be raised by $10,000 for both the firm’s career associates and analytics project attorney teams.

(We’ll note that this is the first time we’ve seen salaries mentioned in the same breath as remote work. This may be because Orrick is one of the few firms that has [started to hire remote employees](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/biglaw-firms-are-hiring-remote-associates-in-this-post-pandemic-world/), and wants to reassure them that their brand new salaries are secure regardless of their remote working arrangements.)

The legal industry has evolved significantly, and selecting the right law firm requires careful consideration of various factors. In this comprehensive guide, we present an updated and detailed analysis of the 7 key factors to consider when choosing a law firm in the competitive legal and recruiting market, supported by relevant data and statistics to help you make an informed decision.


Firm Size: Assessing the Work Environment and Opportunities

When evaluating a law firm, size plays a crucial role in determining the work environment and available opportunities. Large firms (Am Law 100 and 200) typically offer a broader range of practice areas and represent 81% of total revenue generated by the top 200 law firms in the U.S. However, they may also involve longer hours, with over 60% of associates working more than 50 hours per week on average. Smaller boutique firms and regional firms may provide a more intimate work setting, focused expertise, and better work-life balance. Consider your preferences and evaluate which size firm aligns with your legal career goals.

Practice Area Focus: Identifying Firms with Strong Practice Groups

Certain practice areas are experiencing significant growth. For instance, the global data privacy market is expected to reach $158.2 billion by 2027, and intellectual property filings have increased by 10.2% in recent years. It’s crucial to identify law firms with strong practice groups in your area of interest, as this can impact your professional development and long-term career prospects. Research each firm’s reputation and track record within your chosen practice area to make an informed decision.

Firm Culture: The Importance of Diversity, Inclusion, and Work-Life Balance

Firm culture has become increasingly important, as law firms recognize the value of a healthy work environment in retaining top legal talent. According to a survey by the American Bar Association, firms with diverse and inclusive environments report higher retention rates and overall satisfaction. Investigate the firm’s commitment to diversity, inclusion, and work-life balance, and assess whether the firm’s values align with your own. Speak to current and former employees and attend legal networking events to get a feel for the company culture.

Compensation and Benefits: Evaluating Competitive Law Firm Salaries

Compensation remains a critical factor when choosing a law firm. The median salary for first-year associates at large law firms is $190,000, while smaller firms may provide competitive compensation based on their niche expertise or regional market strength. In addition to base salary, evaluate benefits such as bonuses, retirement plans, and health insurance to make a comprehensive assessment of the firm’s compensation structure.

Location: The Impact of Geographical Presence on Your Legal Career

Remote work has become increasingly common in the legal industry, with 74% of law firms offering flexible work arrangements. However, a firm’s geographical presence still plays a significant role in shaping your career. Major legal markets provide access to prestigious clients and high-profile cases, while smaller markets may offer lower costs of living and a better work-life balance. Consider your personal preferences and long-term goals when evaluating a law firm’s location.

Professional Development and Mentorship: The Key to a Successful Legal Career

Law firms that prioritize professional development and mentorship tend to have higher retention rates and more satisfied attorneys. A study by the NALP Foundation found that firms with structured mentoring programs have a 20% higher associate retention rate after three years. Investigate each firm’s commitment to training, continuing education, and mentorship programs to ensure a supportive environment for building a successful legal career.

Partnership Prospects: Assessing Your Long-Term Career Trajectory

As you advance in your legal career, partnership prospects may become increasingly important. According to the American Lawyer, the average time to partnership at large law firms is approximately 8.2 years. Assess each firm’s partnership track, including the average time to partnership, the firm’s expectations for partner candidates, and the overall partnership structure (e.g., [equity vs. non-equity partners](https://laterallink.com/is-it-better-to-be-an-equity-partner-or-non-equity-partner/)). A transparent and well-articulated partnership track can impact your long-term career trajectory and financial success.

In Conclusion: Navigating the Legal Landscape with Confidence

Choosing the right law firm requires thorough research and consideration of various factors. By evaluating firm size, practice area focus, firm culture, compensation and benefits, location, professional development and mentorship, and partnership prospects, you can make an informed decision that aligns with your personal and professional goals. The legal landscape is continuously evolving, and understanding the nuances of each firm can help you navigate your career more effectively.

As you embark on your legal career, remember that selecting the right law firm is just the first step. Staying up-to-date with industry trends and developments, networking, and continually reassessing your goals will help you remain adaptable and successful in the ever-changing legal market.

# Where Will You Be In 2181?
## The reasons that women have left their law careers can be boiled down to a number of salient categories.

Is any other woman lawyer as tired of this as I am? Over the past few years, the ABA has published several reports on how women are faring in the profession. Its most recent report is “[In Their Own Words](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/women/intheirownwords-f-4-19-21-final.pdf).” Subtitled “Experienced Women Lawyers Explain Why They Are Leaving Their Law Firms and the Profession,” the report lists many cringeworthy examples. It’s an agonizing choice for both majority and minority women lawyers when they ditch their law firms (or corporate law departments) and even decide to leave the profession.

The study focuses on women who have been in practice at least 15 years. So, these are not newbies who have left or are leaving; these are women lawyers who have made substantial investments in their careers. The reasons that women have left can be boiled down to a number of salient categories: pay inequity, being screwed out of origination credit, isolation, and being made to feel that their contributions are not being recognized or rewarded.

Despite my hope that my second wave feminism of the 1970s would produce male children who would regard women as equals, such has not been the case. What saddens me in reading the report is how little has really changed, and how it is, to a large extent, “same old, same old.” I fault the leadership in law firms and corporate legal departments, colleagues who don’t see women lawyers as assets, as well as the businesspeople who don’t want women anywhere near their matters.

One of the shockeroo stats in the report shows that it will be 2181 (not a typo) before women lawyers achieve parity in the profession with their male counterparts. Disgraceful. Anyone for [cryonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryonics#:~:text=Cryonics%20uses%20temperatures%20below%20%E2%88%92130,vitrification%20to%20avoid%20ice%20damage)?

And as if women didn’t already know it, when offices do reopen, who do you think will be [more heavily represented](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210503-are-men-dominated-offices-the-future-of-the-workplace?ocid=global_worklife_rss&xtor=ES-213-%5BBBC%20News%20Newsletter%5D-2021May7-%5Bworklife%5D)?

Some examples that women gave for why they left are hard to believe that in the third decade of the 21st century, some men still have the “caveman” attitude of hunter gatherer, while women are supposed to tend the home fires.

Pay disparities, both real and perceived. “[A]t my last firm, there were two male partners who were … probably averaging about $75,000 more than me. And the two of them together were not originating what I was originating. … [W]hen I asked someone about it, I was told, “Well, such and such, he has two kids and he has a family to take care of.”

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
I was told essentially the same thing in my first corporate job many years ago. A male attorney who graduated one year ahead of me at another law school was hired after me, but at a higher position and salary and the ostensible reason given was that he had a wife and kids, and I only had a husband.

Origination credit: when this woman lawyer first joined her firm, “a matter came in and the senior partner said, ‘I have no idea what this is. I don’t want to do this. Does anybody want it?’ ” The woman partner volunteered immediately even though the type of matter was not her specialty. She then proceeded to build a million-dollar book of business in this new practice area. However, the senior partner who passed off the matter to her took all the origination credit. When she raised this disparity, the senior partner responded, “My God, we just really didn’t think you’d care that much about the money.” Really?

Collegiality has gone the way of VCRs. It’s now hypercompetitiveness instead of working as a team. It’s dog eat dog. Just one example: one respondent shared how she had been building a substantial book of business with a client when a senior male walked into her office and declared that the client was in his Rolodex. [Remember those?] When she protested, he insisted, and it was only through intervention from the client that she was able to get credit for the business. By the way, clients do not want to be involved in internal firm squabbles.

Isolation takes a huge toll on women lawyers, even more so now because of the pandemic. There’s no time to build relationships; it’s all about billable hours. It’s all about closed office doors and siloed work, with no time to bounce ideas around, another collateral consequence of the lack of collegiality. The absence of women in leadership positions contributes to that isolation, and women lawyers of color feel the isolation even more.

And of course, we can’t forget sexist and racist behavior. “I would say without exception, every lawyer, female lawyer that I’ve spoken to that I’m friends with, that I’m close enough to talk to, has experienced some form of discrimination.” Of course.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
One woman who stopped practicing law and now consulted for law firms said “I focus more on age discrimination when it comes to women than I do on men. I tend to regard un-dyed gray hair on women like I regard visible tattoos.” Wait, what? Women are told that a male with gray hair is often viewed as possessing “gravitas,” but the same is not true for women. Age discrimination is alive and well and living in hair color.

Other reasons women lawyers are leaving include being passed over for promotion both at outside firms and in house, long hours, and unpredictable schedules. The report notes that “Issues of inequity will be greatly reduced, and perhaps disappear, on the day that men recognize that something is wrong when they enter a room at the firm and do not see a substantial number of women lawyers.” We wish.

[How much harder can it get](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/05/04/women-supreme-court-clerkships-485249) for women lawyers? Here’s just one example:

And as recently as three years ago, a Texas federal judge commented: “It was lot simpler when you guys wore dark suits, white shirts, and navy ties…. We didn’t let girls do it in the old days.” Res ipsa loquitur.

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

# Biglaw Associate Arrested Over Plot To Extort Partners

Michael Potere

ALERT: We have an early contender for the craziest story of the year. It’s a Biglaw scandal, natch, and the allegations are just bonkers.

It all starts out simply enough, with a Biglaw associate being fired — a sad, but all too common, story. But when Michael Potere learned his last day at Dentons was going to be June 1, he allegedly decided to get some revenge. According to law enforcement claims reported in the [Daily Journal](https://www.dailyjournal.com/) (sub. req.), Potere took sensitive information from the firm and threatened to leak that info to none other than Above the Law — unless he got $210,000 and a piece of artwork. Nice.

Potere was arrested Thursday on charges of extortion. According to the affidavit, Potere got access to the confidential information when an unnamed partner gave Potere access to his email while they were working together on a case. The info Potere allegedly swiped included some real doozies:

This information included emails between partners, quarterly financial reports, client lists, confidential reviews of associate attorneys, lists of equity partner candidates, documents describing billing rates, details of recruitment efforts, and memos describing how partners should approach clients with outstanding balances, the FBI said.

I think a certain unnamed partner is due for some cybersecurity training.

Potere was allegedly trying to strike a blow for millennials everywhere — see, this is why younger associates get a bad rap:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
During a meeting to resolve the matter that was recorded in early June, Potere reportedly told two partners that he felt like “people his age were getting ‘screwed’ and that hypothetically he might have a chance to ‘screw back,'” according to the FBI document.

It seems Potere was aware his plan could easily go pear-shaped, but thought the potential upside was worth it, even if he lost his legal career as a result. I guess that artwork he was trying to get was pretty fancy, because $210,000 is worth less than a legal education.

Potere allegedly informed the partners that “people who rape other people do not get jail time so he is not worried about jail time for his actions against” Dentons, the FBI said. Potere acknowledged during this conversation that his actions would potentially doom his future legal career and jeopardize his recent admission to graduate school, but he said it would be worth it, according to the FBI affidavit.

As of this writing, Potere has not entered a plea to the extortion charge, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years. He is, of course, presumed innocent until proved otherwise.

Word to the wise: committing a crime is not the best way to get revenge. As with most things, Beyonce is right: [best revenge is your paper](https://giphy.com/gifs/music-video-beyonce-formation-xT0BKuJh6nogDX4psA/embed).

# Will Jones Day Drop Donald Trump As A Client?
## Probably not -- but many lawyers at the firm wouldn't mind saying ""you're fired"" to the controversial candidate.

Jones Day’s Don McGahn (left) with his client, Donald Trump

Our report from earlier this week about [Jones Day representing Donald Trump](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/jones-day-helping-donald-trump-to-make-america-great-again/) has apparently caused quite the controversy in the halls of the white-shoe, blue-chip firm. It seems that many JD lawyers and clients didn’t know about the firm’s work for the Trump campaign until this week, when the firm [hosted a meeting in its D.C. offices](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-03-21/donald-trump-holds-meeting-with-congressional-republicans) between Donald Trump and top Republicans. And as you can see from the [multiple updates](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/jones-day-helping-donald-trump-to-make-america-great-again/?rf=1) added to our prior post, many JD lawyers are unhappy about the representation, for a whole host of reasons.

In addition to the obvious ones — the accusations of racism, sexism, xenophobia, and incitement of violence that have been leveled against Donald Trump — there are a number of objections to representing Trump that are specific to Jones Day. For example, it’s particularly unfortunate to have Trump as a client given (1) the firm’s interest in expanding its Latin America practice, (2) its extensive pro bono work on behalf of immigrants’ rights, and (3) the fact that Fox News host Megyn Kelly, a frequent target of Trump’s attacks, is a prominent Jones Day alum.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Here is one JD lawyer’s reaction that is representative of many others we received:

It’s disgusting, cynical horses**t. I came into this knowing that many firm leaders are very active members of the Republican Party, but until now it’s seemed to be the Bush-vote, family-values variety. So, I am genuinely disturbed that Jones Day accepted Trump as a client, and I would expect and hope that many other JD clients (particularly pro bono clients) would be equally disturbed. A lot of other lawyers here feel as strongly as I do.

This source then directed our attention to this page, [Why Is Jones Day Different?](http://www.jonesday.com/principlesandvalues/whydifferent/) The firm exhibits values like “integrity,” “dedication,” and “commitment” — all in the service of this classy client (who tweeted out side-by-side photos of Heidi Cruz and Melania Trump to follow up on an earlier threat to “spill the beans” about Ted Cruz’s wife):

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Over the past few days, there have been many internal conversations and email threads at Jones Day about the Trump representation — including a few lawyers talking privately about quitting in protest — but no firm-wide statement from the powers-that-be (and no response to another query from us). The closest thing we’ve heard to an official comment is a New York-based partner addressing the subject at an all-associates meeting earlier this week (a previously scheduled, annual all-associates meeting, not a meeting to talk about Trump). Here’s how one source summarized it:

An associate asked about Trump: was this an institutional decision? The basic answer: no, we have an election-law group that came over from elsewhere, we represent a lot of bad people (hilariously, one example given was the [Modell family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Modell), who moved the Browns out of Cleveland), so no the firm isn’t endorsing him.

A perfectly reasonable response. Jones Day is [America’s largest law firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/whats-the-biggest-law-firm-in-the-country/?rf=1), with [almost 1,700 lawyers](http://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/772291) in the United States alone, and so the decision of one partner in D.C. to take on Trump shouldn’t be held against the entire institution and its thousands of lawyers and staff around the world. (This would seem so obvious as to not be worth stating, but one JD defender claimed that our [prior piece](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/jones-day-helping-donald-trump-to-make-america-great-again/) was somehow implying that everyone at the firm supports Trump — an absurd claim, considering that not even a majority of Republicans support Trump, and Jones Day, while conservative by Biglaw standards, is far from 100 percent Republican.)

In further defense of Jones Day, it’s not the only Biglaw firm to have an unpopular or controversial client — and it’s in the finest tradition of lawyering to represent such figures. Major firms represented (and still represent) Big Tobacco as a paying client, and they take on pro bono cases to defend accused murderers. Or to take some examples related to the current election season, Williams & Connolly is [repping Hillary Clinton in her email scandal](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/01/15/how-the-state-department-caved-to-hillary-clinton-s-lawyer-on-classified-emails.html), and O’Melveny & Myers is defending the Donald in [Trump University litigation](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/trump-university-court-showdown-220632).

There are, of course, responses to these responses. Not all candidates are created equal. It’s not very persuasive to throw up one’s hands and say “representing a presidential candidate is always okay because that’s what election lawyers do”; it depends on who the candidate is and what she stands for. In this situation, there’s a good case to be made that Donald Trump is especially loathsome (yes, even compared to Hillary Clinton and Ted Cruz). Heck, [David Duke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Duke) ran for president before too, and a firm would surely get flak for serving as his campaign counsel (which, to respond to another point from Jones Day defenders, is not just some ministerial or housekeeping function to ensure that Federal Election Commissions are typo-free; as any election lawyer can tell you, serving as legal counsel to a major presidential campaign is a significant role that touches on everything from fundraising to advertising to FEC interactions to litigation).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
And even though every client is entitled to counsel in the courtroom, representing a client in a pending case — which requires court permission for withdrawal — is a different matter than serving on an ongoing basis as a strategic advisor and counselor, the role that Jones Day is playing for the Trump campaign. Except for pending litigation matters where it’s already counsel of record, presumably Jones Day can ditch Trump as a client at any time.

So will Jones Day dump [Donald Drumpf](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/03/us/politics/donald-drumpf-a-funny-label-but-is-it-fair.html?_r=0), just as King & Spalding [kicked DOMA defense to the curb?](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/04/paul-clement-quits-king-spalding-after-ks-moves-to-drop-doma-defense/) Probably not. Despite their huge size, Biglaw firms have distinct personalities, and Jones Day’s might be described as “stubborn” and [“indifferent to public opinion”](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/jones-day-does-not-have-a-sense-of-humor/) (or, [more charitably](http://www.jonesday.com/principlesandvalues/whydifferent/), as “independen[t]” and “courage[ous]”).

Although I don’t see Jones Day telling Trump “you’re fired,” I wouldn’t rule out the possibility of Don McGahn and his associates voluntarily departing at some point to set up their own election-law practice. When you have controversial clients, it’s easier to be in a boutique, with fewer clients, lawyers, and constituencies who might be offended by a given representation. That’s why it made perfect sense for Paul Clement, after [leaving King & Spalding](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/04/paul-clement-quits-king-spalding-after-ks-moves-to-drop-doma-defense/), to take his practice to [Bancroft](http://www.bancroftpllc.com/), the high-powered boutique known for representing prominent conservative clients.

It’s worth noting that McGahn is far from a fixture at Jones Day. He has been at the firm for less than two years; he [joined in spring 2014](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/three-top-republican-lawyers-leaving-patton-boggs-to-establish-practice-with-jones-day/2014/05/29/bf8eab88-e77e-11e3-afc6-a1dd9407abcf_story.html), fleeing the wreckage of Patton Boggs (around the time it got [absorbed by Squire Sanders](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/05/say-hello-to-squire-patton-boggs/)). So it wouldn’t be insane for him to go out on his own — and it might reduce the potential for tension or conflict between his practice and the practices of fellow election-law partners like [Benjamin Ginsberg](http://www.jonesday.com/bginsberg/) and [William McGinley](http://www.jonesday.com/wmcginley/).

(Although there are so-called “Chinese walls” to protect against conflicts, having several prominent members of a very small practice area under the same roof can create awkwardness, even in the absence of direct conflict. Ben Ginsberg, viewed by many as the dean of the election-law bar, [previously represented the Scott Walker campaign](http://www.p2016.org/walker/walkerorg.html). The Walker campaign died months ago, but Ginsberg continues to [write](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/republican-contention-chaos-213725) and speak on television about a brokered GOP convention — which Trump views as synonymous with robbing him of the Republican presidential nomination. This might have gone unnoticed by the Trump campaign, which doesn’t strike me as a very detail-oriented operation — but if Trump were to notice it, I could certainly see him placing an irate call to his law firm, Jones Day.)

We’ll continue to follow the Jones Day/Donald Trump story with interest. Feel free to contact us [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Jones%20Day%20and%20Donald%20Trump) or by text message (646-820-8477) if you have anything to add.

UPDATE (6:01 p.m.): I should clarify, in response to some [Twitter conversation](https://twitter.com/DavidLat) I’ve been having, that I am not arguing that Trump should be denied legal representation. Every client, no matter how awful — criminal defendants accused of heinous acts, large corporations accused of terrible misconduct — should have the right to retain counsel. I’m simply wondering, from a prudential point of view, whether taking on Trump was a wise move for Jones Day as a law firm and as a business.

# Biglaw Partner Goes Public In Lawsuit Over Alleged Rape
## She says the Biglaw firm has been supportive of her as she deals with the aftermath of the assault.

[Back in February we told you about the Biglaw partner suing a Houston, TX, restaurant](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/biglaw-partner-files-20-million-lawsuit-over-alleged-rape/?rf=1) over an alleged sexual assault. At that time, the lawsuit was filed anonymously to protect the plaintiff’s privacy, but now she has gone public. [Jessica Crutcher](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/people/c/crutcher-jessica-l?tab=overview), a Mayer Brown partner in the litigation department, has identified herself as the plaintiff in the case and the victim of the alleged rape.

The alleged assault happened in 2015 when Crutcher says a Brennan’s of Houston bartender, Sean Kerrigan, spiked her drink, took advantage of her incapacitation, and raped her with aid of a manager of the restaurant. Crutcher pressed charges against Kerrigan, and in July 2018, he was indicted for felony aggravated sexual assault. Kerrigan died in November 2018, and the charges were subsequently dismissed. Crutcher filed the lawsuit against Brennan’s alleging the restaurant is responsible for the assault and breached its duty of care in failing to properly supervise its employees and was negligent.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/05/09/mayer-brown-partner-goes-public-in-suit-against-houston-restaurant-over-alleged-rape/) Law.com, Crutcher opened up about her reasons for identifying herself to the public, saying she has “nothing to hide” and she wanted to be able to stand up for herself:

“I’ve done a lot of pro bono work over the years where I have seen my clients, survivors of horrible violence, very bravely stand up for themselves. I think I should be able to do the same thing here,” Crutcher said, a few days after she filed the [third amended petition](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5995255-85083092.html) that identified her.

For their part, Mayer Brown has been supportive in a statement about Crutcher:

“We appreciate how incredibly difficult and challenging this experience has been, and continues to be, for Jessica. As our partner and colleague, she has our complete support in her recovery.”

In response to the lawsuit, Brennan’s denied the restaurant is responsible for the alleged actions of their employees. (A former manager of the restaurant was also named as a defendant in an amended complaint; he denies the allegations in the complaint.) Brennan’s offered the below statement in response to the amended complaint:

“While Brennan’s condemns what Ms. Crutcher claims happened to her in the strongest terms, we strenuously dispute any allegation that our family business is somehow responsible for the damages she claims.  We were supportive of her at the time of the incident and we cooperated with the criminal investigation she instigated more than two years later,” the statement said.

The lawsuit is seeking $20 million in damages. According to the complaint, Crutcher has been on leave from Mayer Brown since last August due to the stress and PTSD caused by the sexual assault. Crutcher indicated it is her goal to return to work, saying, “I want my life back.”

# Are In-House Lawyers Happy With Their Outside Counsel?
## Corporate clients want practical legal advice, but law firms aren't giving it to them.

How happy are in-house lawyers these days? That’s the question that a survey conducted by In The House, an online association of 26,000 lawyers working for legal departments, sought to answer.

The results seem to be mixed. While in-house lawyers generally like their current jobs better than their old ones (many are Biglaw refugees), they could be made a little happier by the improved performance of their outside counsel. [Law360](https://www.law360.com/ip/articles/906645/are-your-in-house-lawyers-happy-?) (sub. req.) has more information:

How pleased were the respondents with the work and service of their firms? Twenty-nine percent answered, “very satisfied” and 62.1 percent said “somewhat satisfied.” Only 8.5 percent were “dissatisfied” and a minuscule 0.9 percent said they were “very dissatisfied. Women were both more enthusiastic — 31.5 percent were “very satisfied” — and more critical — 10 percent were “dissatisfied.”

There is a second, more ominous view of the client-law firm relationship lurking in these results. Responses from seven out of 10 in-house lawyers suggest that there is room for improvement in law firm performance. This means that some firms are less secure in their relationships than they realize and need to increase their efforts to understand the needs of their clients and how clients want these needs to be met.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
About 45 percent of respondents had cut ties with a law firm within the past two years, with the top five reasons for dismissal being that the firm was “too expensive,” “unresponsive,” did “bad work,” “didn’t understand our business,” or “worked inefficiently.” Perhaps some responses from in-house lawyers will be helpful in understanding how law firms can improve. Here are a few examples from the survey:

- “They were non-responsive and overpriced; [I] can get over the latter if work is superb, but not meeting expectations and being overpriced means the end of the relationship.”
- “The advice was extremely conservative and not practical.”
- “They didn’t provide clear and concise guidance. We can’t use ‘what-ifs’ and hypos. We need actionable advice and strategy.”
- “Some outside lawyers are excellent partners who make my team and me better every day. Others go through the motions or put too much onus on me to project manage and cull out results and answers. Business acumen is a much underdeveloped muscle in the law firm world. I think this is also a big factor in why certain law firms can’t seem to crack the value billing, price-sensitive offering demanded by clients. They don’t fully understand what is being asked and what they need to deliver, and they spend time and effort needlessly (and expensively) on things that don’t really move the ball forward.”
Perhaps fewer law firms would be shown the door if lawyers truly listened to what their clients expected of them and then followed through on it. In-house lawyers are in search of practical advice from the lawyers they turn to in times of need, so much so that survey respondents repeatedly said that it was one of the things they’d change about law firms — aside from desperately wanting to kill off the billable hour, of course.

Now that you’ve got some useful information from in-house counsel, try to put it to use. Your firm can only benefit from knowing that it’s not performing up to par. Change your ways and perhaps fewer corporate clients will part ways with outside counsel next year.

# 400+ Biglaw, In-House Leaders Make Pledges To Support Diversity & Inclusion
## What is your firm or legal department doing to meaningfully advance this cause?

Year in and year out, we watch law firm after law firm and legal department after legal department pay lip service to their commitment to diversity in the legal profession, with promises to recruit, retain, and promote more minority attorneys. If there’s ever going to be any real change in the legal industry, diversity has to be more than just a buzzword — it must be a priority at every law firm and legal department. Now, with the assistance of the Leadership Council on Legal Diversity (LCLD), things may finally be moving in the right direction.

In 2020, the LCLD began an initiative asking member law firms and legal departments to make personal and organizational pledges for the advancement of diversity in the legal profession. The initiative reached its conclusion this month, with the hundreds of law firms and legal departments leaders putting their commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion on paper.

The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/06/17/over-400-managing-partners-gcs-make-public-dei-pledges-as-lcld-campaign-concludes/) has the details:

Leaders of the country’s largest law firms and corporate legal departments have committed to increasing their sponsorship of diverse attorneys, developing succession plans that include diverse attorneys, and collaborating with clients to advance the careers of attorneys from underrepresented groups, according to a review of managing partner and general counsel pledges submitted to the [LCLD]. …

[T]he leaders of over 400 law firms and legal departments made commitments to continue existing DEI efforts and implement new measures, such as offering billable hour credits for DEI initiatives and reviewing DEI contributions in partner compensation. …

Reviewing the member pledges, which the LCLD has posted as they arrived since fall 2020, the organization’s Board of Directors found several common areas of improvement: sponsorship, succession planning, and collaboration between law firms and clients.

“I’m very excited with the idea that we are posting the strategic initiatives that our members are using to advance diversity in the organization,” LCLD president Robert Grey said in an interview with the American Lawyer. “The purpose was to create transparency and accountability, but also to create an opportunity where there could be more learning and piloting of ideas by sharing with each other.”

What is your law firm or legal department doing to meaningfully support diversity in the legal profession? We’d love to learn more. Please email us at [tips@abovethelaw.com](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com) or text us at (646) 820-8477. Thanks.

Biglaw firms across the country are implementing all manner of initiatives to bring attention to the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion among their ranks. We’ve previously acknowledged [Dorsey & Whitney](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/biglaw-firm-introduces-diversity-hours-that-count-toward-associate-billable-requirements/), [Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/care-about-biglaw-diversity-well-now-you-can-bill-for-it/), [Davis Wright Tremaine](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/5-concrete-steps-law-firms-can-take-to-advance-diversity-equity-and-inclusion/), [Reed Smith](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/the-first-biglaw-firm-to-offer-billable-diversity-hours-for-all-timekeepers/), [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/top-25-biglaw-firm-offers-bonus-eligible-diversity-inclusion-billable-hours/), [Baker McKenzie](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/top-5-biglaw-firm-raises-the-bar-on-billable-diversity-inclusion-hours/), [Ropes & Gray](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/top-biglaw-firm-offers-associates-100-billables-hours-for-diversity-inclusion-work/), [Locke Lord](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/biglaw-firm-offers-associates-75-billable-hours-for-diversity-inclusion-work/), [Foley Hoag](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/biglaw-firm-offers-associates-unlimited-billable-hours-for-diversity-inclusion-work/), [K&L Gates](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/top-50-biglaw-firm-offers-associates-50-billable-hours-for-diversity-inclusion-work/), [Robinson+Cole](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/biglaw-firm-affirms-its-commitment-to-diversity-inclusion-with-new-billable-hours-policy/), and [Stoel Rives](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/with-new-billable-hours-policy-biglaw-firm-solidifies-commitment-to-making-legal-profession-more-inclusive/) as firms where approved diversity and inclusion-related work will be billable for attorneys and will count toward bonus thresholds. We now have news that yet another firm has amended its billable hours policy in the name of promoting diversity.

WilmerHale — a firm that brought in $1,243,384,000 gross revenue in 2020 — has been focused on this important initiative since May, when it announced this policy change to recognize associates’ diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.

We appreciate that our efforts to continue to broaden the diversity of our organization require a commitment from our attorneys to spend time on a variety of activities both to support our recruiting efforts and to build a culture of inclusion within the firm.

To recognize these efforts, we are amending our current Bonus Eligible Time policy to include up to 50 hours of firm time spent on activities related to diversity, equity and inclusion programming as follows:

- attending law school sponsorship and diversity events
- coffee chats and phone calls with prospective candidates
- attending fall recruiting diversity receptions and related events
- participating in summer program training programs and presentations
- leadership roles with office level diversity committees and affinity groups (planning heritage month activities, organizing agendas, leading group activities)

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
WilmerHale seems to truly care about the diversity of its workforce. The firm has continued to climb in the American Lawyer’s annual Diversity Scorecard (recently soaring from No. 63 to No. 37), has been ranked as one of the best law firms for women by Working Mother since 2007, has received a 100% rating on the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index since 2009, and has been Mansfield Plus Certified by the Diversity Lab since 2018.

“Diverse individuals make organizations stronger by broadening perspectives, deepening access to talent, and helping to foster innovation,” [notes](https://www.wilmerhale.com/en/about/diversity-and-inclusion) co-managing partner [Susan Murley](https://www.wilmerhale.com/en/people/susan-murley). “Expanding our strategic lens on the world with a focus on diversity and inclusion is quite simply both fair and makes business sense.”

Congratulations to WilmerHale on affirming its already strong commitment to diversity in the legal profession. What is your firm doing to support DE&I within the legal profession? Please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com) to let us know.

Since we broke the news of the new $180K salary scale for associates at large law firms in the United States — a trend that was [started by Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) on Monday, June 6, 2016 — dozens of firms have fallen in line and matched (or sometimes beaten) the scale, dozens of firms have offered statements on why they haven’t matched the scale yet, and worse yet, dozens more firms have remained completely silent.

All the while, associates have continually asked that we compile a table of all the firms that have already matched the new salary scale, and the markets where those matches were made. Today, we unveil that table for your viewing pleasure. We will be updating this table on a daily basis, sometimes multiple times, as news on raises unfolds. If you see any information here that is incorrect or needs further clarification, let us know.

Remember, we are covering this trend extensively, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

We’re more than halfway through Hanukkah, Christmas is nearly upon us, and Biglaw bonus season is still going strong. In fact, it’s going really strong at some firms. Irell & Manella is making sure that its associates end the year on a high note with bountiful bonuses.

Irell pulled in $143,500,000 gross revenue in 2021, putting it in 184th place on the Am Law 200 ranking. Once again, the firm is offering its associates major bonus bucks. “In consideration of your exceptional contributions to the firm’s success over the last year, we are thrilled to once again be paying bonuses that are substantially above market at all associate class levels,” writes partner [Keith Orso](https://www.irell.com/professionals-keith-orso), who serves on the firm’s management committee. “More specifically, while the exact ratios vary by class level, our total bonuses across the associate classes this calendar year (spring plus end of year 2022) average more than twice (2x) the total ‘market’ bonuses being paid by most other high-end firms this year.” Here’s the bonus scale the firm is offering up in 2022:

- New Associate: $39,000 (pro-rated)
- Class of 2021: $39,000
- Class of 2020: $51,000
- Class of 2019: $89,000
- Class of 2018: $110,000
- Class of 2017: $128,000
- Class of 2016: $156,000
- Class of 2015: $168,000
But that’s not all, folks. Irell is continuing to offer spring bonuses to associates, based on profit sharing. In April or May, bonus-eligible associates will receive supplemental bonuses when the firm’s fiscal year has closed. Associates will receive their bonuses on December 27, which will put a cap on their holiday season and make for an even happier new year.

Congratulations on the above-market bonuses, Irell associates!

# Biglaw Firm About To Write A $20 Million+ Check To Their Former Client
## Dechert places the blame squarely on their former partner.

The roller coaster ride that is Dechert — and its former white-collar crime head, Neil Gerrard — and their former client Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (“ENRC”) now has a multimillion-dollar (or more precisely pound sterling) price tag.

[You may recall](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/biglaw-partner-treated-client-as-cash-cow-gets-benchslapped-in-court-judgment/) the Biglaw firm and Gerrard lost their case in London’s High Court when the judge found they breached their duty to ENRC, and Gerrard treated the billing code as a “cash cow.” Indeed, though he denied it at trial, [ Gerrard allegedly referred to billing in the case as “rape mode.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/the-most-offensive-way-to-refer-to-biglaw-bills/)

Gerrard was hired by ENRC to investigate a whistleblower complaint about its Kazakhstan operations (the engagement began in December 2010 when Gerrard was at DLA Piper, but the matter moved to Dechert when Gerrard did in April 2011). However, the initial matter they were hired for quickly grew in scope, something Gerrard was largely responsible for.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And the High Court judge in this case, Mr. Justice David Waksman, found Gerrard leaked confidential client information to regulators (and newspapers) in the hopes of expanding the engagement. As one might imagine, the judge did not take kindly to that move, calling it “at least in reckless breach of duty.” Gerrard was “so obsessed with making money from his work that he lost any real sense of objectivity, proportion or indeed loyalty to his client.”

As [reported by](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/dechert-agrees-pay-former-client-ps20m) Roll on Friday, now Dechert has agreed to an *interim* payment of £20 million for costs to ENRC. But their former client wants more than that — they’re seeking indemnity costs because of Dechert and Gerrard’s “aggressive resistance, unreasonable and uncooperative conduct and, most seriously, dishonesty.”

Perhaps correctly, the firm has pushed Gerrard directly under the bus, saying they’ve since “jettisoned” their onetime partner. In a statement on the matter, a spokesperson said, “We recognise the seriousness of the judge’s findings in relation to our former Partner, Neil Gerrard’s conduct. Trust among partners is integral to any partnership, and up to and including the trial, Dechert acted in good faith in reliance on the assurances given to us by Mr. Gerrard.”

But that isn’t holding much water with opposing counsel:

ENRC’s barrister, Nathan Pillow QC, told the court that Dechert and Gerrard’s defence was “based on lies from start to finish”, according to a report in the Gazette.

“Gerrard and therefore Dechert, vicariously…knew that ENRC’s case was essentially true and that he had committed some of the most serious professional misconduct an officer of this court could commit,” said Pillow.

ENRC’s barrister added that although Dechert has “belatedly parted company with Mr Gerrard…it does not disguise the fact that until June…they were standing shoulder to shoulder.”

Though Dechert and Gerrard are no longer represented together, they’re both arguing against awarding indemnity costs in the case.

# Biglaw Firms Offer Second-Class Benefits To Staff

It’s Administrative Professionals Day today — not that this matters anymore, since somewhere along the line this occasion of gratitude got expanded to Administrative Professionals Week. Seriously, how did that happen and [Love Your Lawyer Day](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/today-is-love-your-lawyer-day-and-its-completely-stupid/) is still only 24 hours long? Who do the admins have lobbying for them? I need someone with [unparalleled government insight](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/jones-day-advertising-its-trump-admin-ties-because-they-have-no-shame/) to help us get to the bottom of this spectacular instance of holiday mission creep!

But I digress.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
We continue to honor the law firm staff members who keep firms rolling in the face of the psychotic breakdowns of attorneys working on their last frayed nerve after pulling their fourth consecutive 20-hour day. Earlier this week, we noted that Fried Frank offered its staff a little mid-year bonus on top of their annual discretionary bonus. We’ve not heard of many other firms joining suit, but we’d like to think someone out there is stepping up to the plate.

However, lower pay and missing bonuses aren’t the only way that law firms relegate their staff to the have-nots. No one expects staff to be paid the same as attorneys — they don’t have the intensive, costly degrees, and on balance (though there are certainly exceptions), they work fewer hours under less stress than lawyers. Which is why the more serious site of staff disregard comes in the form of benefits.

Because everyone needs benefits, now more than ever assuming the current government follows through on its pledge to erode the paltry protections guaranteed today, and yet your firm may well be stiffing the staff on benefits. It’s more common than you’d think and in every case we’ve heard, attorneys don’t even know it’s happening.

How many weeks of maternity or paternity leave would one enjoy as an attorney? At several Biglaw firms it’s more than a staff member would under the same circumstances. We’ve heard tell of a Biglaw giant that offered up to 18 weeks for associates and 6 weeks for staff. That’s one hell of a discrepancy.

No one expects attorneys to take all their vacation time — unless you [work at Bartlit Beck or something](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/03/atl-march-madness-which-perk-do-you-want-from-your-firm/) — but attorneys still likely collect more vacation time every year. And in a system that pays lawyers for unused vacation days, they may not extend the same courtesy to the staff.

The argument for this sort of imbalance is that the market for high-caliber attorneys requires offering a Cadillac package. No firm can afford to slip behind the firm next door or risk losing some precious Law Review all-star. That’s certainly a good argument on paper. But with salaries starting at $180K, law school graduates aren’t fretting about their benefits. Most attorneys don’t even know the outer bounds of their benefits until they have to call up HR to use them. MoneyLaw scale and a history of market bonuses are all a firm needs to lock down the top recruits. Firms could offer back-alley cholesterol screenings for all the associates care. Dollar dollar bills, y’all.

Paid maternity leave too short? A lawyer could happily take an extra two weeks unpaid. They have that luxury. Staff don’t generally. And yet the benefits regime tends to privilege the parent who needs the benefit the least.

Look, no amount of corporate motivational speaking bulldink about “teamwork” is going to change the fact that law firms are hierarchical. Firms may be the most hierarchical working environments that don’t involve Apache helicopters. But do we really have to exacerbate these gaps by creating second-class citizens when it comes to benefits?

We’ve heard about some of a number of discrepancies from tipsters over the years, but we want more feedback. If your firm is shortchanging the staff on benefits, let us know! Leave a tip — we’ll keep you anonymous — by emailing us (subject line: “[Firm Name] Benefits”).

# UK Firm Delivers Happy Salary News To Its American Associates
## There are still a lot of firms yet to match.

We’ve still got a week to go before the July 1 date when the new associate salary scale will take effect at all the firms who’ve matched so far, and associates on the outside looking in are getting antsy. We’ve fielded a lot of messages from people convinced their firm is the only firm that hasn’t issued raises yet and demanding that their employers be appropriately shamed by name.

The problem is… there are still a ton of firms out there that haven’t matched. As much as a random associate out there may feel justifiably aggrieved right now, trust that you’re not alone. This raise season has played out interminably slowly. In 2016, we wrote a post about a “finally” matching a mere seven days after the initial move. In 2018, we didn’t even have the scale fully settled within seven days.

But with July 1 looming, expect today and early next week to feature a flurry of announcements! Like this one from Herbert Smith Freehills, who informed its American associates that the firm’s New York office would be joining the new pay scale:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Class	New salary scale for New York associates
Class of 2010	$       340,000
Class of 2011	$       325,000
Class of 2012	$       305,000
Class of 2013	$       280,000
Class of 2014	$       255,000
Class of 2015	$       220,000
Class of 2016	$       200,000
Class of 2017	$       190,000
The firm is not offering summer bonuses at this time, making this — in the parlance of our times — a “Milbank/Cravath hold the Simpson.”

Scott Balber, Office Managing Partner of Herbert Smith Freehills New York office and US Head of Investigations and Financial Services Litigation said:

We are building a top notch team in our New York office that is consistently performing at an elite level. This new salary increase demonstrates our continuing commitment to maintain a high-quality talent base in New York. Investing in our associates in this way promotes our high-performance culture, rewards our existing team and helps to attract premier talent, in a highly-competitive New York legal market.

The lack of summer bonuses is surely a disappointment for associates, but at least they can rest easy before going into the weekend that the firm has moved them to match the proper scale.

Not every firm’s associates will get to say that.

You know the drill by now, but we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Paul Clement Laments Kirkland's Cancel Culture... Or 'Capitalism' As The Case May Be

Poor Paul Clement.

The [former Solicitor General just quit](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/who-needs-antitrust-to-break-up-major-firms-when-you-have-the-second-amendment/) yet another firm after Kirkland & Ellis decided it was done putting its SIX BILLION DOLLARS OF ANNUAL REVENUE at risk so Paul Clement can bring in a couple million painting the firm’s name all over the papers as the firm that won’t rest until every Kindergartner is murdered in cold blood.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
It’s a revelation the firm should have reached a long time ago, but as [the old maxim goes](https://twitter.com/westwingweekly/status/1129092604145033216?lang=en), “let’s forget the fact that you’re coming a little late to the party and embrace the fact that you showed up at all.”

So, of course, Clement — and Erin Murphy who also quit Kirkland after the firm announced it was getting out of the death merchant business — [ran to the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/2nd-amendment-bruen-new-york-gun-case-supreme-court-decision-kirkland-and-ellis-rule-of-law-constitution-11656017031) to cry a river over cancel culture. Or as the rest of us call it “capitalism.”

This time around, we received a very different message from our law firm. Having just secured a landmark decision vindicating our clients’ constitutional Second Amendment rights in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, we were presented with a stark choice—withdraw from representing them or withdraw from the firm. There was only one choice: We couldn’t abandon our clients simply because their positions are unpopular in some circles.

Abandon them? Y’all won. To quote the Bard, “[You’re still here?… it’s over… go home!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJ38y4Jn6k)” Technically they have other blood clients, but post-Bruen it’s [hard to tell how anyone loses those](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/gun-ruling-proves-supreme-court-just-coasting-on-vibes-at-this-point/).

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
To be clear, they weren’t fired. They were told to build their practices around literally anything less toxic for the firm. But they looked at their prospective client list and came up empty.

But martyrdom doesn’t brake for facts, and the new firm of Clement & Murphy isn’t keeping the lights on without engaging in the time-honored tradition of preaching to right-wing media about their personal struggles with cancel culture. Just remember to open your checkbooks!

Some may find this notion strange or quaint. Many businesses drop clients or change suppliers as convenience dictates. To others, the firm’s decision will seem like one more instance of acceding to the demands of the woke. But law firms aren’t supposed to operate like ordinary businesses. Lawyers owe a duty of loyalty to their clients.

They do! And the private equity firms that actually make the firm’s money would like a little bit of loyalty too.

Our adversarial system of justice depends on the representation of controversial clients, no matter which side has most of big law rooting for it. This is particularly true in constitutional cases. Many of our fundamental constitutional guarantees are designed to be countermajoritarian, and many have been vindicated by litigants who are deeply unpopular, but still have a right to march through Skokie, Ill., to confront witnesses against them—or to defend themselves from violence.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Oh, I say, good sir, harumph!


He’s not entitled to Kirkland’s resources and goodwill and he knows that. He knows that because he threw a tantrum when he left King & Spalding when THAT firm realized he was [slapping their brand on discriminating against gay people](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/04/paul-clement-quits-king-spalding-after-ks-moves-to-drop-doma-defense/).

Not for nothing, Clement whined about that too. This article is headlined “The Law Firm That Got Tired of Winning” which is just funny since the complaint echoes his huffing and puffing after leaving K&S over DOMA and… well, [how’d that turn out](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/07/breaking-defense-of-marriage-act-doma-struck-down/)?

Don’t worry, Paul… I assume the current Court will reverse that soon based on not a damn thing too.

But how stupid do Clement and Murphy think the public is?

First, the article devolves into vague recitations of attorney ethical obligations to clients as though THE MOST SUCCESSFUL LAW FIRM IN THE UNIVERSE is naively unaware of those obligations. As if KIRKLAND & ELLIS doesn’t understand the precise bounds of what is and is not ethical. Because let me assure you, K&E knows exactly where that line is or it would have told Clement and Murphy to drop this nightmare for the firm’s primary clients long before the Supreme Court ruling put the firm’s name in the headlines. The measure of K&E’s patience is defined by the ethical rules.

Second, how does anyone read this and think Clement and Murphy bring anything to the K&E table? This is a firm that embodies the Montgomery Burns line:



The firm is making billions and these tweebs are representing non-profits throwing convenient hooks for the current Court to throw its pre-determined nonsense hats upon. There aren’t enough [terrible law schools left to represent](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/good-law-schools-are-all-alike-every-bad-law-school-is-bad-in-its-own-way/). If you could collect Kirkland money and got told to just drop one class of client… you only leave when you know y’all got nothing in the tank.

Clement’s left scraping for the lowest common denominator of right-wing cause. And that’s still worth a few million a year. It’s just the world has moved on and in a world measured by billions no one has patience for a few million.

So, yeah, whine that the firm has gotten tired of winning. I’m sure it’ll cry all the way to the bank.

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

The Swiss verein model of Biglaw organization is under a microscope after the Ohio Supreme Court refused to review a $32.3 million malpractice verdict against Dentons. Which 5 other Biglaw firms in the Am Law 100 also employ the verein model?

Hint: A key issue in the case — and what may be catching the attention of other firms with the model — is whether Swiss verein firms have to do conflicts checks across all affiliates in their network.

# Above The Law’s 13th Annual Holiday Card Contest
## We look forward to your submissions. Thank you, and happy holidays!

It’s the most wonderful time of the year (all things considered). Thanks to some [big-time bonus news](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/biglaw-bonus-tracker-2021/), the holiday season is off to a great start. Cravath was very merry this year, stuffing associates’ stockings with [good cheer and wads of cash](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/first-mover-on-bonus/). Thanks to the ongoing pandemic, law firm holiday parties will likely be pushed onto Zoom once again, but the virtual celebrations and hefty paychecks pale in comparison to what’s about to get underway: Above the Law’s thirteenth annual holiday card contest. We’ve already received several emails asking about when this year’s contest would start. The answer: It starts today.

We are a legal website, so of course there are some rules to follow:

1. Because we are committed to the environment here at [Breaking Media](http://breakingmedia.com/), we will consider ONLY E-CARDS. Please don’t send us paper holiday cards via snail mail this year — the Above the Law editorial team hasn’t been in our physical office much since March 2020.

2. To submit an e-card, please email either a link to the card or the card itself (as an attachment) — but note that WE PREFER LINKS, if available — to [tips@abovethelaw.com](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Holiday%20Card%20Contest), subject line: “Holiday Card Contest.” The subject line is very important because it’s how we will comb through our inbox to collect the entries when picking finalists. If you don’t use the correct subject line, expect a lump of coal in your stocking.

3. Please limit submissions to holiday / Christmas cards that you view as WORTHY CONTENDERS. We’re looking for cards that are unusually clever, funny, or cool; we’re not interested in cards that are safe or boring (e.g., a beautiful winter landscape, a “Happy Holidays 2021,” and the law firm name). We’re seeking cards with some attitude, with that extra je ne sais quoi. If you send us a banal card, don’t be surprised if we make fun of it.

4. In your email, please include a BRIEF EXPLANATION of why this card is compelling — an explanation that we MIGHT QUOTE FROM if your nominee makes the finals (if you want to be anonymous, let us know). If you can’t offer an explanation, please rethink whether the card is a worthy contender (see rule #3, supra).

5. The deadline for submissions is about two weeks from today: WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 15, at 11:59 p.m. (New York time). No exceptions. If you’re reading this post after the deadline, then you don’t read Above the Law frequently enough.

# Supremely Disappointing

The SCOTUS Term is over and so is any remotely text-based interpretation of the Voting Rights Act. Justice Alito pulled off a smooth rewriting of the statute with nary a peep from his textualist colleagues. It looks like this is going to be our future for a while. And it’s a future that will apparently include Justice Breyer who appears to have locked in to staying on the Court, all common sense aside. Speaking of common sense, how much money might you sacrifice to have work-from-home flexibility? For most of you out there, it’s a lot.

# Davis Polk's Reopening Plan Includes 3-4 In-Office Days, And Floating Remote Workweeks
## The firm is introducing a period of five consecutive remote work days -- and they won't impact vacations.

Davis Polk is law firm responsible for both the new compensation scale and special bonuses that have spread through Biglaw like wildfire. Now that the firm is planning the official reopening of its offices across the country, associates may not like what’s in store for them — but it’s not like they can really afford to complain.

Earlier this week, firm chairman and managing partner Neil Barr notified associates that starting in September, they’d be expected to be in the office at least seven out of every 10 business days. During this trial period, lawyers will “generally” be expected in the office three or four days each week. The firm’s in-office trial will end at the conclusion of 2021, and office policies will be updated as needed in 2022.

As detailed in the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/07/12/davis-polk-plans-trial-period-for-office-returns-requiring-in-office-work-7-out-of-every-10-business-days/), lawyers at the firm will get one remote workweek during the trial period, where they can choose to work remotely for five consecutive days of their choosing (without taking vacation time to do it). Per Barr, in 2022, the firm may adopt additional floating remote weeks.

Barr wrote the plan was an attempt “to strike a balance that cultivates our unrivaled culture — a balance that captures the genuine good that has come from remote working, like greater flexibility in managing personal and professional lives, and the challenges, like supporting a team orientation and a feeling of community.”

Over the last year or so, Barr said, a lot has been learned about what works in a remote environment, and that he’s proud of how the firm responded during the pandemic.

“But our business is built on personal relationships. In-person interaction is crucial to supporting and cultivating our culture of teamwork and collaboration for lawyers and business services personnel alike and to continuing to develop our associates through mentoring programs and our best-in-class training curriculum,” Barr wrote.

“I am excited for all that is to come for the Davis Polk community as we move toward our next chapter, and, most importantly,” Barr concluded. “I look forward to seeing you all again soon.”

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

The deluge of bad news caused by COVID-19 continues. This time Cozen O’Connor, a firm ranked 73rd on the [2020 Am Law 100](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/04/21/the-2020-am-law-100-ranked-by-gross-revenue/#), has made their stab at austerity measures. The good news is that compared to many other top firms, these measures aren’t too severe.

According to[ reports](https://www.law.com/2020/04/30/pay-cuts-layoffs-and-more-how-law-firms-are-managing-the-pandemic/), equity partners will have between 10 and 20 percent of their compensation deferred to later this year. Additionally, staff who are unable to work remotely — ~2.5 percent of administrative staff — have been furloughed. Firm CEO Michael Heller has said that furloughed employees will have benefits covered by the firm and should receive full salaries through the CARES Act.

That means associates and the majority of the staff remain unscathed by the austerity measures. And the firm has indicated they’re trying to avoid layoffs or salary cuts for these folks.

Ed. Note: As the decade comes to a close, Above the Law presents you a special [Trivia Question of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/) series in remembrance of the Biglaw firms we lost in the 2010s.

What now defunct D.C. based Biglaw firm was founded in 1953 and announced its dissolution in 2016?

Hint: The firm’s lobbying operation had a brush with infamy when it fired former Republican Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert as a lobbyist. Hastert resigned in 2015 after his indictment on federal charges (structuring bank withdrawals to evade bank reporting requirements to make hush payments and making false statements to federal investigators) was unsealed.

# Kirkland & Ellis Non-Equity Partners Know Exactly Where They Should Be... Somewhere Else
## A deep dive into Kirkland's partnership.

The managing partner of an elite Biglaw firm once told me, “you have no idea how many resumes I get from Kirkland partners… people are desperate to get out of there.” We’d been talking about a piece I was working on about [the rise of the “non-equity partner,”](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/repeat-after-me-partnership-without-equity-is-not-a-partnership/) a cynical faux partnership tier allowing firms to better market their special counsel and slap golden handcuffs on senior attorneys that might balk at being forced to accept a title demotion to move anywhere else.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Roy Strom at Bloomberg Law conducted a [decade-spanning review of Kirkland’s non-equity partnership ranks](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/how-kirkland-partners-in-name-only-live-in-limbo) and there’s a lot to crunch in this article, but it comes to a clear conclusion: they really are desperate to get out.

Among the 84 lawyers in [Former Kirkland partner Matthew] Topic’s 2012 class of those promoted to non-share partner, fewer than 40% remain at the firm and only 14% are publicly identifiable as equity partners, according to a Bloomberg Law analysis. Bloomberg Law compiled 10 years of data on Kirkland non-share partners. Among the 2009 class, only about 20% remain at the firm.

Topic managed to build a small practice out of his pro bono work. He was responsible for the FOIA fight that led to the release of the Laquan McDonald shooting video. Most non-equity partners who leave Kirkland end up in some role that still requires putting on a brave face in public about the firm that still sends referrals. Privately, former Kirkland attorneys told Strom a different story:

Ultimately, [one unnamed former Kirkland attorney] lasted about four years as a non-share partner. In the meantime, he said he was billing close to $2 million a year and making, at most, $500,000.

“I was a money maker for them,” said the partner, who declined to be named to protect relationships with the firm.

That’s not an uncommon tale. Strom’s post notes that non-equity partners at Kirkland are bringing in roughly $2 million more than they’re getting paid. As leveraged assets go, that’s about as good as a firm can get. Equity partners are averaging a take home ten times as much with an annual take of around $5 million. Even the most junior equity partners are making almost $2 million.

Unfortunately, the Kirkland model may be taking over Biglaw. The ranks of one-tier, lockstep firms shrinks every year. Cleary just had the [high-profile defection/firing of partners seeking a bigger slice of the pie](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/major-lateral-moves-its-open-season-on-cleary-partners/). Old school partnership models are disappearing like Elves departing to the West at the end of Lord of the Rings and similarly leaving a less magical world. The old model brings an air of collegiality to the practice, a sense that every partner is pulling the same direction because everyone benefits from the firm’s success. Partners aren’t going rogue and hoarding their private book of business and fighting internal conflict turf wars. That’s the price the firm pays to be able to award the spoils to those making the most rain and part of that model is keeping the equity spoils tightly guarded.

And because it’s a strategy that’s working — and working at Kirkland better than anywhere else — it’s going to continue to spread. And Kirkland’s legion of “partners in name only” are going to continue taking their titles and moving elsewhere.

# What Firms Are Atop The A-List? (2016)

There are lots of ways to measure the desirability of law firms, but the latest ranking from American Lawyer, dubbed the [A-List](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202762960450/Top-of-the-Charts), has a unique blend of factors:

• Our Am Law 200 survey’s revenue per lawyer rankings,

• Our pro bono survey, which measures average pro bono hours per lawyer and breadth of firm participation in pro bono,

• Our diversity survey, which ranks firms by their percentage of minority lawyers, and

• Our midlevel survey, which measures associate job satisfaction.

The inclusion of pro bono and diversity scores will, hopefully, speak to the culture created at the firm, and if you get midlevels who are still happy at a firm, that is an achievement to be celebrated. But we know you just want to know who is on the list, so here is the top 10:

So I guess if you want to be happy, or at least “satisfied” with your career, you should move to Los Angeles, the city that captures the #1 and #2 spots on the list. I’m just kidding, you didn’t go to law school to be happy.

Congratulations to the firms on the list. You can check out the full list [here](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202762960450/Top-of-the-Charts).

# The One Insurance Policy Your Practice May Not Have But Definitely Needs

Is your firm ready for “ransomware”? Do you even know what ransomeware is? If not, that’s a shame, because you’re probably not covered.

According to cybersecurity experts, ransomware is the up-and-coming brand of cyberattack that will hit companies — including law firms — like a firestorm this year.

That most firms aren’t covered against this emerging threat should come as little surprise since most firms aren’t covered against any of the panoply of cyber assault flavors floating around the Internet. Most haven’t stopped [replying to that Nigerian prince](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/12/lawyer-falls-for-nigerian-inheritance-scam-gets-suspended/), let alone figured out what protection they need. Though this is changing.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
From [Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202752692874/Amid-Hacking-Threats-Law-Firms-Turn-to-Cyber-Insurance):

According to insurance brokerage Aon, more than 60 out of the 250 medium and large law firms that it services have purchased cyber insurance within the last two years. Marsh said that close to 40 percent of its roughly 100 large law firm clients have purchased the insurance, up from 20 percent two years ago.

Oh, law firms! Still the soft underbelly of ignorance in the world of industrial espionage and cyberattack. In defense of the firms, some may think they’re already covered:

“A lot of firms were under the impression that professional liability would pick up almost anything. This is not the case,” said Tom Ricketts, a senior vice president and executive director at Aon. “This has been one of the major debates that we’ve had with law firms over the last two years.”

The policies that law firms typically carry, such as lawyers’ professional liability insurance, general liability insurance and property insurance, do not always provide coverage when employee rather than client data is compromised, or when the firm must hire a forensic team to determine what data was lost and how. They also most likely won’t cover the cost of notifying regulators or engaging a public relations firm.

What? An insurance carrier has decided a comprehensive policy doesn’t cover some specific risk of loss? I’m incredulous!

Apparently these policies have been around since the late 90s when some insurer saw Sandra Bullock in The Net and realized there was a way to make money off of it. Fast forward 20 years, and all the fantastical hacking Hollywood conjured out of a haze of technological ignorance and cocaine is actually real. And worth budgeting for.

Just as policies vary dramatically, so do their prices, Ricketts said. But he offered what he called “a very, very loose rule of thumb:” A policy should cost $10,000 to $15,000 for each $1 million of limit.

In other worlds, a firm can expect to pay between $20,000 and $30,000 per year for a cyber policy that will cover up to $2 million in expenses.

Ricketts estimated that law firms with fewer than 50 attorneys are typically buying insurance with a $2 million limit; midsized firms are looking at polices with limits between $3 and $5 million; and firms with over 500 lawyers might buy polices that pay out $10 million or more.

Not too bad an investment. But Paul Caiazzo, Principal and Chief Security Architect at [TruShield](https://trushieldinc.com) cautions firms not to see cybersecurity insurance as the only investment they need to make in this area:

The pitfall is where clients think an insurance policy is all they need. A policy is important in handling that last bit of residual risk after a sound cybersecurity policy is in place. I’ve seen claims denied where the company didn’t have the basics in place.

That’s probably the most important takeaway from all this talk about insurance: just as you wouldn’t buy car insurance and [leave your keys in an unlocked $100K car](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/lawyer-leaves-keys-in-100000-sports-car-dude-steals-lawyers-100000-sports-car/), don’t buy cybersecurity insurance and just assume your 2002 infrastructure will do just fine in a 2016 world.

If you do think that, well, maybe that Nigerian prince will finally come through for you, too.

# In Major Overhaul, Biglaw Firm Creates Two-Tier Partnership To Boost Profits
## This is a pretty bold move.

Why can’t I be an equity partner?

Earlier this week, we discovered that [Shearman & Sterling was facing difficulties](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/this-biglaw-firm-may-demote-partners-to-boost-profits/) with unproductive members of its partnership. Profits per partner had fallen by 4 percent in 2015, and thanks to its restrictive partnership agreement — one requiring a supermajority of 75 percent of equity partners to approve a partner’s removal — Shearman’s management was having a hard time dealing with what was referred to as a “major problem for the firm.”

Thanks to the firm’s push for greater profits, anonymous partners disclosed to various media outlets that Shearman was thinking of demoting current equity partners and reducing its current number of practice group heads. The matter was to be discussed between the firm’s global and regional managing partners during a meeting on Wednesday in New York City. No one knew, however, that Sherman & Sterling was considering a major overhaul to its entire partnership structure.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
A confidential memorandum leaked to Above the Law details the firm’s plans to move to a two-tier partnership structure, creating a non-equity partnership role during a time when many law firms are reconsidering or phasing out this type of partnership model.

Here’s an excerpt from a firm-wide email sent this morning by Global Managing Partner [David J. Beveridge](http://www.shearman.com/en/people/b/beveridge-david-j) and Senior Partner [Creighton O’M. Condon](http://www.shearman.com/en/people/c/condon-creighton-om), explaining the big changes coming to the firm (the full email is available on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/in-major-overhaul-biglaw-firm-creates-two-tier-partnership-to-boost-profits/2/)):

The firm has decided to create a new non-equity partner role to help us grow the partnership. This approach, adopted by a high percentage of the Am Law 100 and most global law firms, will allow junior partners to grow into equity partnership and facilitate the continued growth of our practices across our global platform. These changes are part of a process of strengthening our equity partnership and more fairly rewarding partners at all levels.

The memo goes on to state: “We believe these developments will provide significant benefits and opportunities for all of us at the firm.” One of the most significant benefits Shearman will reap from its new partnership structure is the way that its profits per partner are reported by the American Lawyer in its annual survey of law firm performance. Non-equity partners’ profits are not included in Am Law’s methodology for calculating partner profits, and Shearman’s new non-equity partnership class may result in the firm posting a better performance in that area for equity partners.

# Sometimes, It's Fine To Burn Bridges With Past Employers
## Aim for the near-retirees and the true jerks to minimize damage.

People are commonly told that they should not burn bridges in their professional lives since they never know when they might need to rely on someone from the past for a future opportunity. In nearly every situation, this is good advice, since people may have far more chances to excel in their careers if they can rely on references and suggestions from people in their past. However, sometimes people cannot resist burning bridges in their professional lives because they have particular disdain for someone or because they are especially peeved about their situation in a workplace. In some situations, burning bridges might not have too many consequences, and people might be emboldened to throw bombs on their way out of a job.

One time when it might be fine to burn bridges is if people who might be upset with the words or conduct of a departing lawyer are close to retirement. If managers will soon leave the legal profession, they might not be able to interfere with a former employee’s career ambitions, and they might not serve as a reference for much longer. Earlier in my career, I knew someone who was particularly peeved by a workplace that was run by people who were all close to retirement. On his way out the door, he made it clear that he was not satisfied with the firm’s management, and he did not do a particularly good job handing off his work tasks to his successor.

After leaving that firm, he had a successful career, and it is not clear that burning any bridges had a negative impact on him. As expected, some of the senior management retired a year or two after he left, so there was likely no one who could make difficulties. To some extent, many of the contemporaries of the person respected him more since he departed on his own terms and spoke his mind about some of the issues at the firm. In that way, perhaps burning bridges with some of the senior management actually helped improve his reputation with people who would spend longer in the legal profession than the soon-to-retire senior managers at that shop.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Another time when it might be okay to burn bridges is when the person to be scorned is a known jerk. Some people in the legal profession have horrible reputations with other people in local legal communities. Sometimes, this is because of how the person treats employees. In other instances, it is due to how that person treats adversaries who might also be parties in a given legal matter. In any event, even if people have considerable “juice” within the legal profession, they can still be held in contempt by others in the same legal community.

If someone burns bridges with such a contemptible individual, it might not have much of an impact on that person’s legal career. If the jerk lawyer says anything bad about the other lawyer, people in the community might not give the bad review much weight since people know that the person is a jerk. In addition, since people might not like the jerk lawyer, a negative review of someone by that individual might be received positively. I knew an individual who, shortly before leaving a firm and seeking new opportunities, had a shouting match with a contemptible lawyer. That person ended up landing on his feet, and I have to believe that other people within the legal community also did not like the contemptible lawyer and did not give much weight to any negative comments by that person about the departing lawyer.

In any case, it’s always safer to not burn bridges to ensure you have the most opportunities in the legal profession. However, if you can’t resist the urge, burning bridges in some instances likely will not hurt your career.

We absolutely encouraged him to seek help. But you can’t force anyone to do something they don’t want to do—and I don’t think he was aware of the seriousness of his illness. I think he viewed it as a weakness and worried about the stigma. Looking back I can see signs—I wish I could have seen them then.

If it helps one person to open up and seek treatment, it’s worth it. Depression is a very treatable illness. I was so touched by the outpouring of people who’ve gotten in touch and shared that they suffered from depression or are suicide survivors. If you have kidney disease or a broken arm, you are not expected to tough it out. If you are suffering from a mental illness, why should you be expected to suffer in silence?

# Biglaw Firm Sent FAKE Salary Increase Memo... To Teach Attorneys A Lesson!

While “narrator voice” became Arrested Development’s enduring contribution to the zeitgeist — though Donald Trump [“light treason” memes](https://www.bingeclock.com/meme/s/arrested-development/p/120/) are all the rage this week — at least some folks out there must remember iconic character, [J. Walter Weatherman](https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/J._Walter_Weatherman). Weatherman was the one-armed actor that the family would hire to partake in elaborate schemes that end with his arm getting torn off in gruesome fashion because the kids didn’t leave a note or left the door open with the air conditioning on. This is all relevant because [Knights PLC](https://www.knightsplc.com/) channeled its inner Weatherman.

The firm may not be as familiar to American audiences, but Knights has offices throughout the UK with over 1,500 employees. They also seem to have an absolutely atrocious sense of how to treat those people.

[RollOnFriday broke the exclusive story](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-incredulity-firm-sends-lawyers-fake-pay-rise-emails) on… well, Friday… that Knights sent its staff a compensation announcement heralding a firmwide round of salary increases and attaching an attorney-specific memo with the details for the recipient.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
“After assessing the current salary structure as provided under the terms of your employment, it was discovered that you are due for a [double digit percentage] annual salary increase beginning in the upcoming fiscal quarter”

When staff opened the email, they were told that the announcement was fake but that the attorney had fallen for the firm’s test pfishing scam. “And this is why you always refuse to open attachments from HR,” Weatherman would intone… were he there and also a psychopath hellbent on torching the firm’s goodwill.

Even as pfishing tests go, this is an incredibly stupid one because (a) why would a scammer even assume that the [notoriously unpopular employer](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/knights-plc-new-golden-turd-uk-law) would give raises; (b) seriously though, if one hoped to pfish an attorney why would they tease a salary increase instead of taking a key client identified on the firm’s [press release page](https://www.knightsplc.com/knights-news/), spoofing their email, and writing “please see attached draft”; and (c) wouldn’t emails from dummy human resources sites be among the easiest things to filter at the enterprise level, eliminating the human element altogether? Just so many questions!

In news that will shock no one, RoF reports that this all “went down ‘like a lead balloon’ and prompted ‘strongly worded emails, partners threatening to leave and incredulity.'” When the partners are deeply offended enough to threaten to walk, one might expect firm leadership to take a conciliatory tone.

NOPE!

A spokesperson for Knights was unapologetic for trolling their own staff, telling RollOnFriday, “We take cyber security very seriously so engage a number of third party providers to guard against continually evolving threats. Our phishing campaigns are run by a third party provider, which bases its scenarios on the phishing attempts that are prevalent currently, to make them as realistic as possible. Unfortunately, they are seeing a rise in phishing attempts based on pay rises and this prompted the theme of this campaign”.

Pfishing attempts based on attorney pay rises? Because the industry matters, which is why third-party providers aren’t always the best suited for this task. We’d all love a round of salary increases but that’s not the reality right now outside of [some aggressive boutiques](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/brewer-2023-raise/).

Maybe that’s the real Weatherman lesson here. “And that’s why you don’t troll attorneys over money.” Except no one lost an arm in this scenario… though the attorneys might not have all had a chance to see firm leadership face-to-face yet so let’s not close the door on the possibility that it’s going to come up.

Jennifer Bluestein is the Chief Talent Officer at Perkins Coie LLP, and author of two books published by the Practicing Law Institute: “An Associate’s First Year” and “Stepping It Up.” 

Early in her career, she was an employment and litigation attorney, before progressing into her present position managing all talent strategy and human resources functions at one of the world’s top international law firms. 

In this Q&A, she discusses the unique research leading her to reevaluate the place of top-tier law schools, along with what inspired her to write books for new and mid-level attorneys. (This interview has been edited for length and clarity.) 

You’re currently the Chief Talent Officer at one of the country’s biggest firms. Do you view this role as sort of being in-house within a law firm, in a way, overseeing the internal operations?

My responsibilities include learning, development, recruiting, staff recruiting and development and retention, compensation, benefits, all of that for a leading Am Law 50 firm. It’s a lot.

But my responsibilities do not include the legal advising. We still have in-house counsel. Most large firms either have somebody 100 percent, or multiple people, as an in-house counsel department. 

You have previously mentioned something interesting about always wanting a new challenge. Do you see that in the people you’re bringing on, and trying to retain? Is that a personal quality, or is it somewhat universal, something that you have to repeatedly address?

I think it’s both. 

I think there are some people, especially those who are in something highly technical, like, for example, an electrical engineer who becomes a patent lawyer, for whom there is new technology coming up, and there is always that learning. 

I don’t know that it applies to them necessarily.

But for me, and for some of the positions in my team, we do see people who need to move departments and to new challenges. 

I just took somebody from our learning and development team and we created these new positions called “talent advisors” where they’re embedded in a department. We went to her and said we had this new position, we think you’d be great for it. She moved over. 

I don’t hold it against somebody if they want to be an expert and manage the same position for 15 years. However, I think it can be a little harder to continue being challenged in some of the more strategic positions. 

For the record, though — this job is challenging me for a long time. Really there’s a lot.

Especially in what I’m reading on Above the Law, there’s a hot legal market right now. Why don’t we talk about that a little bit? 

The [quote that I saw from you](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/no-t14-degree-no-peer-firm-work-no-problem-biglaw-firms-change-hiring-criteria-in-white-hot-market/) was along the lines of looking at some of the people who accepted scholarships at law schools outside of the top tier and chose to go without debt or with very little debt, as opposed to going to a top-ranked school. 

Tell me about that. Where’d you come up with that mindset? How do you see that playing out?

Actually, part of the way I came up with the mindset is just personal experience. 

For one thing, I went to Northwestern, no scholarship. But I had almost a full ride at a lower-ranked law school.

In part because of geographically where I wanted to be, and in part because of the reputation of the school, I ended up deciding I was going to go to Northwestern. Which was much more expensive. And I think that has really helped me. 

People look at my resume and are more likely to interview me because I went to a higher ranked law school. But I’d be the same person, with the same brain, and the same capabilities, had I taken that law school scholarship. 

And I have a really good friend who took a full ride to Notre Dame, which is still a good law school, but had gotten in everywhere she applied. She opted to go for a full ride — in part because it was closer to her family, too, there were other factors. 

She was able to graduate from law school with close to no debt. She didn’t necessarily have the brand behind her. It’s hard to say what the difference is in legal education. A smart person is going to do well. The Socratic method doesn’t differ that much.

Right.

If you pass the bar, you pass the bar. You still have to pass the bar regardless of which law school you went to.

This is my opinion: Unless you’re really getting into some of the for-profit schools and stuff — well, don’t go there — but at even the top 100, the differences in the actual education I think are very marginal.

So, here’s the thing that I did. At my old firm I did an analysis. And I’m not a statistician, but I did actually consult with a friend who is a statistician. I looked at, I forget if it was five-year or 10-year, but I did a study of our attorneys, and the test was how many stay five years or more. 

Because you’ve got to be good if you’re there five years, right? Even if you’re not great, something will weed you out if you’re not good.

Yup. Something will come up that will weed you out.

I looked at the law school ranking. I looked at whether they came in as a summer associate or a lateral. And I looked at — it might have been law review. I wanted to know what schools had the best likelihood of us keeping them five years or more. Because for me that was the most important measure of success. And we looked at whether they made partner. 

The two top schools for that firm, they were not T-14 schools. It’s not scientific, but I actually did a study. All myself, pulled the data myself, looked up the U.S. News and World Report rankings. 

We had some practice groups that were like, “No, they have to go to a T-14 school.” And then others were like, “We don’t care, we want to look at their job experience, and if we like them, and if they seem curious.” 

So, for me that was part of it. That study really verified everything that I thought. And then the other piece of it, too, was if you have people who are first-generation graduate school or undergrad, they’re more likely to weigh a scholarship more heavily. 

I mean, I was fortunate in that I was willing to take the risk. I did have debt when I graduated from law school. But I didn’t have as much debt because of my financial situation. 

But if your parents didn’t go to college — my in-laws didn’t go to college — maybe they didn’t have any ability to help, and maybe you took everything on in terms of debt-load.

Right.

If that’s your reason for going to a lower-ranked school, again, if anything, you might be more motivated to work hard, because you don’t have any family money or support to fall back on.

Well, it’s almost like you know me better than I know myself. My old man was a janitor. That’s exactly why I was like, “I’m not going hundreds of grand into debt.”

Right! You look at all those factors, and you say, “Are we going to continue to be exclusionary?” 

And then also, Perkins Coie started focusing on whether we were doing a good job recruiting from the Historically Black Colleges and Universities. HBCUs give very good educations. If you want to enhance your diversity, you have to expand the pool. 

We all feel really strongly we are better for our clients — we’re not just doing it because it’s a public policy thing — it’s better service for our clients the more diverse we are and the more we reflect our client base and the local communities where we work and live. 

If we’re only pulling from these top-tier, super-expensive schools that really give very, very few scholarships, we’re doing everybody a disservice.

Frankly, I know it wasn’t a scientifically controlled study, but what you did was just as good as much of what is out there. Maybe you should do something like that again and actually get it published. Do you want to talk about your books a little bit?

OK, so what can I tell you about? I have one here. Oh, I have two [holds up books]! Color chosen by my daughter. This is the first one.

So what are the premises?

The first one [“[An Associate’s First Year](https://www.pli.edu/catalog/publications/treatise/an-associates-first-year-a-guide-to-thriving-at-a-law-firm)”], there were not a lot of books out there that were really practical, and with different viewpoints, about what it’s like to be a first-year at a large law firm these days. The idea was that I had different contributors to get different perspectives. 

It’s: “What are the expectations of a first-year? How do you set the right tone the first six months? How do you deal with time-management issues? How do you foster inclusion?” 

Good.

The reception was so positive. What law firms did is they bought a book for every first year. There are a couple firms that actually created their whole first-year curriculum around it, which I took as a huge compliment. A large law firm would buy like a hundred copies. 

So PLI came back and was like, “This is doing so well, what else is a need?” I said, “The biggest need, I think, is mid-levels.” Mid-level associates are A) expected to step it up, and B) don’t know what that means. 

As soon as we started talking about it, I said I already had the title, it’s “[Stepping It Up](https://www.pli.edu/catalog/publications/treatise/stepping-it-up-a-guide-for-mid-level-law-firm-associates).” 

Because when I was creating core competencies for expectations within specific practice groups for associates, I would say, “You’re a corporate lawyer, what are you expecting around drafting, or client relationship management?” and the partners would be like, “I just want them to ‘step it up’ from being a junior.” 

Well, they don’t know what that means, so let’s break that down. 

What’s the difference between drafting an ancillary agreement when you’re a first-year versus being a fourth-year? I had to really pull it out of them. 

And they said, “Well a first-year, I can edit it and get it in shape, but they don’t really understand the strategy of the deal and how that translates into different parts of the agreement.” 

And I’d go, “OK, but a mid-level,” and they would kind of finish my sentence, “Well the mid-level understands how you tie in the goal of the deal and then how you draft it and whether you even need this clause at all, and when they give it to me it really should be done and need almost no editing.” 

And I’m like, “OK, that’s what we put in then.” 

So that was the goal of this book. I did more of the chapters myself, because I had done so much around the core competencies stuff and I had had so many interviews over a period of time. 

There’s a lot on marketing, and doing your own client development plan, how to show you’re a future leader. There’s a lot on delegation, managing up, managing down at the same time. 

We have a chapter on well-being. The goal here is really if we can help people get over that hump of being a mid-level, we’ll retain them longer. 

Because this is when people leave. 

Mid-level is when associates say, “I don’t know if I want this.” 

I think with our typical focus on first-years, we forget mid-levels. The law firms that have looked at the book and said we’re going to get this for all our mid-levels, that’s pretty savvy to invest just this small amount of money in every mid-level. 

I’ve talked to a couple firms that are doing the same thing where they’ve actually decided to do a mid-level series based on the chapters in the book.

Well, I appreciate you talking to me today. I think this is going to be a really good piece for the readers at ATL.

Excellent. There’s one more thing I’ll just add, which is I’ve been at Perkins Coie two years. I came less than a year before the pandemic. People often say to me that that was a bad time to move, having to deal with all this new work in a pandemic. But I moved because I really wanted to work at a top employer where they really, really valued their employees and attorneys. 

Perkins had been on the Fortune best workplaces list for 19 straight years and it’s no accident. It was one of the very few firms that was on it. So that’s been a real point of dedication. And this year we were the No. 1 professional and consulting services firm. I think that goes to the point of really trying to be a good employer, and committing to your attorneys and employees. 

That’s a big part of why I became an employment lawyer all those years ago.

As a general rule, individualized bonuses and bonuses announced after the New Year aren’t good news, so when a firm does both, it’s cause for suspicion. There are exceptions, such as [Cooley LLP’s up to 150 percent bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/firm-hands-out-massive-bonuses-150-percent-cravath-scale-for-many/), but more often than not there’s something shady going on when a firm waits this long and then tries to atomize its workforce.

Associates at Baker McKenzie are outraged based on the tips we’ve received. The firm conducts reviews in late February and early March, and associates are learning, to their shock and dismay, that the firm changed its bonus requirements without adequately informing attorneys, leaving them with 50 to 80 percent of the bonuses they worked all year to earn.

At the heart of the controversy was the firm’s decision to change its 2000-hour billing target from the target required to earn a market bonus to the eligibility threshold for earning any bonus at all.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Market bonuses were not paid in NY (and all our US offices) unless associates hit 2100 hours. This policy was implemented retroactively and after the fact. Associates are outraged and were paid anywhere from 50-80% of market bonus even for hitting what we thought was our target (I.e., 2000 hours).

The sense of detrimental reliance was a theme of associate comments:

We all feel like we were completely blindsided by this. There was no indication from the management that they would be moving the goal posts this year and requiring associates to bill several hundred hours more than 2,000 to get a market bonus, even though we all got market bonuses last year for billing 2,000. We didn’t find out that the firm had changed its policy until this past week during our annual reviews just before bonuses were paid out on March 2.

For those who hit between 2,000 and 2,200 hours, the bonus amounts vary wildly between associates and practice groups. In my group, bonuses ranged between 50% to 80% of market, but we pretty much all billed and worked the same amount. It doesn’t make any sense.

An associate relayed a rumor going around the firm that attempts to find some rationale for the firm’s bait and switch:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Rumor is that the firm thinks it made a mistake last year by paying market rate bonuses for associates “only” billing 2,000 hours. I am hearing from our associate leaders that the firm is saying we don’t deserve market rate bonuses because we don’t work as hard as the associates in the prestigious New York firms where (according to firm management) associates are required to bill at least 2,200 hours to get a market bonus.

That’s… not really true. If that’s the argument, then the firm should consider hiring a better industry consultant to set them straight.

As we’ve explained before, “bonuses” sound like the sort of gratuitous payment that associates have no right to expect. But the [market makes reality](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/associates-dont-deserve-bonuses-argues-woman-who-isnt-an-associate/). Everyone enters this industry knowing that the top firms will pay an annual bonus and it’ll generally match Cravath’s and it’ll generally center around a 2000-hour billing target. At that point, this isn’t a bonus as much as “guaranteed variable compensation.”

And when people don’t get money they’ve been expecting, they get angry.

There is an eligibility threshold of 2,000 billable hours, under which there will be no bonus. For those of us who exceeded the billable hour requirement, we are getting anywhere from 50% to 75% of the market level. Very disappointing. We have been led to believe that 2,000 billable would get us the market level bonus all year long, only to be let down in early March of the following year.

It was a big hit on morale. Certainly feel like second-class citizens in the big-law world right now. I’m yet to meet another associate who is happy (or even OK) with the bonus amount. I would not be surprised if fellow associates start dusting off their resumes and picking up recruiters’ calls in the next few months.

When people ask me how I knew it was time to leave Biglaw, I often tell the following story: I was a fifth-year associate, struggling with work-life balance in a practice area that did not inspire me to get out of bed in the mornings. Add to the fire that I had a toddler and was pregnant with my second child. I inquired about changing practice areas, but after five years, I was told that was not possible because “this is who you are now.” What a ridiculous and terrifyingly narrow
mindset — do not believe it. But, how do you gain experience or information about a new practice area? How do you leave Biglaw and come back stronger for the win?

In addition to attending CLEs in other practice areas, I took several pro bono matters in areas that interested me. One of my pro bono clients helped to propel me out of the inertia that can come when you are highly paid, have loans, and a family to support. The client (I’ll call her Sarah) had gotten someone to murder her husband and was suing the state of New York for having placed her into solitary confinement for too long (a prisoner may only be placed in solitary for a limited time, and anything more triggers the right to seek compensation). I met with her to discuss her lawsuit.

She confided in me the nightmare experience of solitary confinement – reading all day, eating alone, and speaking to no one. As an associate at a 500-plus attorney firm, when I realized how much I was relating to my client’s descriptions of solitary confinement, I knew I had come to a breaking point.

Obviously the moral of this story is not meant in any way to undervalue the severe hardships that those subjected to solitary confinement suffer. (In fact, solitary confinement for more than 15 consecutive days is recognized as torture by the United Nations and other human rights groups).

Yet, there are certain lifestyle issues that go in-hand with Biglaw that left me feeling trapped, devoid of human connection, and unfulfilled. The isolation that I felt as a young female associate was very real, as was my identification with that Promethean struggle, similar to what Sarah described (despite my place of incredible privilege). The lifestyle creep, the demands of partners
who lacked time management skills, the eating (and sometimes sleeping) at my desk, and a clear lack of female partner role models: I knew that I needed out, and so I made the leap from Biglaw to solo, and corporate to matrimonial.

One thing that Biglaw does well is to instill a work ethic and willingness to work long hours in young attorneys. That stamina helped to drive me in my newly selected path, a career in family law. I pushed myself to work as hard as I could to become proficient. I attended CLEs on family law and law practice management. I networked with other attorneys and reached out to everyone that I knew for advice, guidance and support. I spent my “free time” at court, immersing myself in the proceedings. My hard work paid off and my practice grew. At one point I had five associate attorneys working for me, and was retained to handle a divorce involving a “Real Housewives of New York” persona. It was thrilling to take on a highly public case against a much larger law firm. But most importantly, I was able to choose an area of practice that challenged and fulfilled me in ways that my previous career and practice in Biglaw had not.

Ultimately, the heavy lift of running a small firm, litigating (and parenting) was a challenge. I realized that by merging with a larger firm, it would help me cut down on some of the management issues, and allow me to focus on the actual legal practice. By building up my practice, I realized the value that I could add to any larger firm that I approached. I made a move into partnership, bringing along associates. Eventually, one of my partners and I moved to an even larger firm, co-founding the firm’s matrimonial and family law practice. We design our
department and set the standards so that our attorneys can grow as advocates and avoid feeling trapped or unfulfilled in the ways that I had previously experienced. My work is exciting and rewarding, and my firm is a unicorn in terms of culture and ideals.

My lesson for you, if you are feeling stuck in any one legal path, is to keep searching — keep pushing yourself to find the better fit for your life.

Morghan L. Richardson of Tarter Krinsky & Drogin focuses her practice on divorce and family law and regularly handles cases that involve complex divorce litigation, alimony, child support, pre-nuptials, parent coordination, separation agreements, post-nuptial agreements, parental access and visitation, collaborative divorce, property division, equitable distribution, orders of protection, and LGBTQI family law issues.

One of the great things about CES is the Consumer Technology Association’s opening media presentation on tech trends. While these trends primarily focus on consumer technology, their ripple effects on the legal industry are real. The technology with some of the most significant impacts on legal has in fact been that which lawyers, as consumers, adopt and begin to use in their work. Smartphones. Laptops. Google. Even Gen AI.

The presentation is always on the first media day of CES. This year, the presentation was given by Jessica Boothe, the CTA Director of Research, and Brian Comiskey, the resident futurist at CTA. Unlike years past, when the presentation was pretty substantive, this year’s presentation was more of a puff piece for the show itself. Nevertheless, there were some trends discussed that may impact the legal marketplace.

Gen Z’s Rising Influence

Boothe and Comiskey say we are on the cusp of a generational sea change. The number of Gen Zs, people between 11 and 26 years old, is growing exponentially. It will soon be upwards of a quarter of the world’s population. And 86% of the Gen Z people CTA surveyed say technology is essential to their lives. Their tech-centric lifestyle is shaping the future.

This growing dominance of Gen Z is a change that legal can ill afford to overlook. The truth is that more and more Gen Zs will be on juries, will become judges, will be working for lawyers’ clients and will be in decision making roles. 

Yet, many lawyers communicating with the Gen Zs are older. They have different attitudes toward technology and how to use it to persuade. To effectively persuade and communicate with Gen Z, legal must recognize the changes that are coming and understand and adapt to Gen Zs’ technological preferences and expectations.

Increased Connectivity

Boothe and Comiskey cited statistics confirming a dramatic increase in connectivity, particularly in emerging markets. 5.4 million people are connected to the internet today, with 1 billion more by 2027. 

This dramatic rise in connectivity will continue to reshape how people access and process information. More and more people will get their information from online sources. More and more people will learn by watching YouTube and videos. The legal profession must evolve its persuasion tools and techniques, transitioning from traditional paper-based methods (paper and  quill) to more digital platforms. 

Increased Acceptance of AI

According to survey results by Booth and Comiskey, most adults say they are familiar with AI and have a favorable view of it. They believe it to be innovative, futuristic, and intelligent. They are less concerned about unpredictability and more about privacy and the loss of jobs.

What does this mean for lawyers? We can’t ignore the fact that people will expect legal to use AI to improve what lawyers do. To make the experience of hiring and working with lawyers more frictionless. 

Boothe and Comiskey predict that in the future, Gen AI will power chatbots that can be used in kiosks, cars, homes, and even offices. If a chatbot running AI can handle a retail transaction (some already can), clients will demand the same frictionless experience for interactions with their lawyers. For years, lawyers have either ignored or poo-pooed the need to use technology to improve client experience under the theory that clients don’t want it. That’s not true anymore, if it ever was.

Boothe also pointed out the health challenges due to cost, the need to prioritize other things over health, and limited appointments and doctor office hours. Boothe says AI and Gen AI offer significant opportunities to meet these challenges. Those seeking legal help face these same challenges — which is why we continue to have such an access to justice problem. AI and Gen AI products could better meet these challenges and open up markets for lawyers.

AI Acceptance: A New Frontier

As I watched Boothe and Comiskey’s presentation, it dawned on me that while there were several references to AI and Gen AI, there were fewer than I expected. 

Boothe and Comiskey, focused not so much on what AI and Gen AI could do in the abstract but on practical applications. This stands to reason: Consumers really don’t care how a product works. What they care about is what it can do. 

This consumer-centric approach, emphasizing product functionality over technological specifics, offers a valuable lesson for legal. Legal tech has been more focused during the past year on Gen AI itself rather than trying to create products that use Gen AI to solve pain points. Unfortunately, lawyers and law firms, in the rush to say they are using Gen AI, haven’t really cared so much about what the products enabled by the technology could do for them.

We could all do with a step back and a refocus on why we want technology. A focus on what job we want technology to do for us instead of blabbering on about the technology itself. 

The Emerging Role of Smart TVs

Boothe and Comiskey claim that our TVs will become even smarter and better connected to the web and the internet. Our TVs will become an intelligent center for a variety of applications powered through our smartphone. TVs will be able to direct things like appliances and security cameras. Perhaps even more importantly, our TVs can become e-commerce centers, allowing us to speak with them and conduct business.

I saw this concept expressed in some CES press briefings by TV suppliers like LG and Panasonic. According to LG, some 74% of consumers have access to web connectivity through their TV. This connectivity enables the use of all sorts of apps and tools that once were only accessible with a desktop, laptop, or smart device. LG also announced a collaboration with Google to provide greater power to its Web OS product. In the future, this connectivity will enable your smartphone to control content on other TV devices no matter what your location.

TVs could soon be used for almost anything your desktop is used for. Apple TV already has an app for Zoom. Today, my TV has a feature that allows me to scroll around the screen and click on various features and apps, just like I would do with a mouse. Integrating smartphones with TVs, streaming and cloud opportunities, and better screen display may allow TVs to challenge desktops and even laptops in the future.

This increased TV capability means that the TV could become a more dominant mode of working and computing for lawyers. As TVs become more integrated with the internet and capable of functioning as communication hubs, they could potentially replace traditional computing devices in legal settings. With features like voice control and pattern recognition, TVs could serve as efficient tools for such things as document preparation and client meetings.

The Gaming Revolution

Boothe and Chomsky noted that the gaming experience will be exponentially improved through AI and Gen AI. Last year, CTA claimed the US already had 164 million gamers between the ages of 13 and 64 who spent 24 hours per week gaming. Those numbers will only increase.

This means there will be gamers on juries, as clients and as decision makers. People who get information from games. People who are used to the game graphics. People who understand how games can distort reality. 

As gaming becomes a more dominant form of media consumption, understanding the perspectives and experiences of gamers becomes more important than ever for lawyers.

Consumer Technology’s Relevance to Legal

There was, of course, lots more to the tech trends discussions. Boothe and Comiskey discussed the coming of small, lightweight robots that can interact with us conversationally. Improvements in health monitoring and access. Improvement in farm tech. Electric vehicles that will do more and more. Smart communities, fintech. 

Developments and trends in consumer products will no doubt continue to impact how and where lawyers do their work, perhaps in ways we can’t yet envision. Understanding and adapting to these trends is imperative for lawyers to remain effective.

The elimination of this definition not only invites health care insurers and providers to discriminate against LGBTQ people seeking health care, but it also introduces substantial confusion among health care providers and insurers regarding their legal obligations and the right of the populations they serve to be free from sex discrimination, particularly in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock v.

Naomi Biden is[ more than just your average Biglaw associate](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/bidens-granddaughter-a-d-c-biglaw-associate-to-marry-t14-law-school-grad-at-white-house/). As the last name suggests, she’s also the President’s granddaughter. So while she bills away her time[ at Arnold & Porter](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/biden-granddaughter-to-join-d-c-biglaw-firm/), she also gets a[ Secret Service detail](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/secret-service-agents-on-arnold-porter-associates-detail-shots-fired-during-attempted-car-break-in/). As one does.

She’s also Hunter Biden’s daughter, so you know she’s hear a lot of bullshit about her family, particularly from the far right. But last night, Naomi heard something so out of pocket she just had to respond.

Earlier this week, Fox News Host Jesse Watters said some truly awful stuff — without even getting into policy disagreements — that was just wrong about the nature of addiction.

Watters said, “I knew Biden was bad on the border because he’s not the best father. The man can’t say no to his own son. He can’t say ‘stop.’ He can’t have consequences for actions.” He continued, “And that’s what you need, you need a man in charge, on the border, to say ‘this is not going to be allowed.’” 

That was… very much over the line. And Naomi took to the artist formerly known as Twitter to sound off.

I have heard so many lies about my family, it takes a lot to make me upset. This crosses the line. Not sure how this man can call himself a reporter and I hope he never has a son or daughter who struggles with anything. You can disagree with his policies without being this ugly.

Ed. note: Please welcome D.W. Randolph, author of the must-read [Biglaw Confidential](https://amzn.to/3Ky6OkT) (affiliate link), to our pages. They will be writing about Biglaw firms and life, all from a partner’s perspective.

You’ve beaten the odds, and obtained one of the relatively few, highly desirable offers to work at a Biglaw firm as a summer associate.  Congratulations!  Now, it’s important to understand why the program exists, what you should expect from the program, what attorneys at Biglaw firms expect from you as a summer associate, and how to succeed.

During my many years working in Am Law 100 law firms, as a partner, leader, and practice leader, including working on law school recruiting teams and with my firm’s recruiting committee, I was responsible for hiring, evaluating, and training numerous summer associates.  So I know a bit about this topic.

Why summer associate programs exist

Summer associate programs are typically eight-to-10-week intensive internships with Biglaw firms that exist to serve multiple purposes, including:

- determining whether a law student would be likely to succeed at the firm as a full-time associate (if hired);
- training the student how to perform legal work for the firm and its clients;
- introducing the student to the firm’s clients, attorneys, and culture;
- determining the right practice group fit for the student;
- offering the student a providing ground to demonstrate that they should receive a full-time job offer to join the firm after law school graduation (or to weed out those who the firm determines shouldn’t receive such offers);
- selling the student on the firm and its practice groups; and
- getting the student accustomed to living the high life as they earn an associate-level salary and benefits to entice them to accept a job offer, if made.
And, most importantly, summer associate programs are the primary means through which Biglaw firms recruit brand-new attorneys.  Biglaw firms usually have pyramid-shaped hierarchical structures, with a few partners at the top, then a few more counsel, then a few more senior associates, then a few more mid-level associates, and then the most junior associates.  There are typically many times more associates than partners at a Biglaw firm (you may have heard this called leverage).  The Biglaw firm model at many firms largely depends on leverage to generate profits.

Firms’ different approaches to summer associate programs

Similar to the Sorting Hat in the Harry Potter books and films, Biglaw firm recruiting teams try to determine a law student’s practice area interest when they interview with the firm’s attorneys, and match that interest with a corresponding staffing need, to ensure that staffing needs are met.  It isn’t a good outcome for the firm or the summer associates to have all the summer associates interested in working with one practice group, only one or a few summer associates receiving offers to join that practice group, and the rest of the summer associates relegated to their second choice practice groups or practice groups in which they have no interest in practicing law long-term (e.g., a would-be litigator becoming an M&A attorney, or vice versa).  In such cases, those summer associates/associates are likely to leave for another law firm that has a need and opening for an associate in the practice group of their choice.  Firm management would view that as a loss on the firm’s “investment” in recruiting them and training them as a summer associate.

Summer associates and associates often seem surprised to learn that Biglaw firms are hiring a summer associate up to 18 months to three years in advance of the anticipated need for a full-time associate.  Practice leaders submit anticipated staffing requests to firm management, and assuming those requests are approved, firm management directs the recruiting committee/team at the firm to fill that need.  It’s an art as well as a science, and a challenge for the recruiting team, to end up with the right mix of summer associates, in terms of practice area interest and staffing need, diversity of law schools, gender and other types of diversity, geographic coverage, and other criteria.  When a law firm fails to meet its staffing needs through on-campus interviewing and summer associate programs, and/or loses an experienced attorney, management has to turn to the expensive experienced attorney (“lateral”) market to fill the gap.

Firms tend to take one of two general approaches to summer associate programs: (a) they only hire summer associates they have the ability and intention to hire as associates (i.e., the full-time offer is the summer associate’s “to lose”); or (b) they hire lots of summer associates and only have the intention to hire some of them as associates (i.e., the summer associates have to compete with each other for those full-time offers, not all of them will obtain offers, and the rest will have to look for other jobs).  You can sometimes tell which approach a firm is taking by the size of their summer associate class (if you don’t hear about the firm’s reputation and approach from law school classmates).  If a firm has more than 50 summer associates (per office or total, depending on the size and geographic scope of the firm), they’re likely in the former camp, and if they have more summer associates, they’re likely in the latter camp.  As a summer associate, you want to be at a firm with the former approach, or do what you can to ensure that you’re in the top half (or better) of your class in terms of performance at a firm that takes the latter approach, to maximize your chances of receiving a full-time job offer to join the firm after law school graduation.

Once at the firm, some firms rotate all summer associates through each of various practice areas, e.g., each summer associate will work a few weeks with practice group “A,” then a few weeks with practice group “B,” etc.  Other firms have an approach that is more so “choose your own adventure” where the summer associate is initially sorted into litigation v. transactional v. specialist categories, and then can take on whatever projects are available with one or more practice group(s) within that category.  In my experience, the latter approach is more common, in part because Biglaw firms can justify charging more for their attorneys to do work for their clients when they can say that the attorneys have specialized, deeper training and greater experience in one practice area, as opposed to being generalists with a little training and experience in a number of practice areas.  That training and experience can start day 1 as a summer associate.  All else being equal, when a firm can charge and collect a higher amount for the same unit of an attorney’s time, the firm is likely to make more money.  And Biglaw firms are hyper-focused on doing whatever they can to make as much money as they can.

# Everyone Go Back To The Office, But Here's A Firm-Branded Toy For Your Trouble!

While many firms have already pushed off office reopenings until 2022 given the still undefeated coronavirus, [Sidley made it clear that everyone needed to be back as of yesterday](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/top-10-biglaw-firm-plans-to-fully-reopen-its-u-s-offices-in-november/). The firm assured attorneys that it respects “flexibility” when it comes to working from home, but that lawyers are expected to be in the office the majority of the time. Which, if you take out your passive aggressive to English decoder rings, means associates must be in the office every day.

But associates won’t be forced to brave the pandemic empty-handed! The firm recognizes the sacrifice being made and has offered a token of its appreciation:

Amid reports of more [special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/mintz-special-bonus-fall-2021/), [practice group windfalls](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/paul-weiss-special-bonus-discretional/), and [upwards of half a million in signing bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/biglaws-throwing-around-500000-signing-bonuses-in-red-hot-lateral-market/), Sidley associates can be excused for a lackluster response to the firm’s announcement to this gift.

A note to law firm management: when you pay associates what they’re already getting paid, every lawyer who wants Airpods has already got Airpods. They’re less than $200. So this token of appreciation is either redundant or unwanted, completely defeating the purpose.

That these devices will be “Sidley-branded” betrays a comical sense of the state of associate morale. Because the only thing cooler than AirPods Pro are AirPods Pro emblazoned with your employer who stands almost alone among top firms in dragging everyone back to the office.

As we enter November, Sidley might want to consider how it’s going to play this upcoming bonus announcement cycle. Because moving fast and big could do a lot to make up for this sour note.

UPDATE: They also got branded jackets so… never mind. Seriously though, the problem isn’t that Sidley won’t ultimately pay up — they likely will — or that gifts aren’t generally appreciated — they are — it’s that the firm is bucking its peers and trying to force everyone back to the office with a policy that sounds an awful lot like mere lip service to flexibility and thought it could smooth that over with some headphones. Oh, sorry, headphones and a jacket.

# 'Supreme Court Ethics' Achieves Oxymoron Status

The Supreme Court’s ethical lapses reached such heights that a fellow federal judge had to step in to [publicly ask what’s wrong with these people](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/federal-judge-absolutely-nails-supreme-courts-ethics-dumpster-fire/). And it’s not just the big ticket scandals anymore, with the Court’s reputation so tarnished that folks freak out over non-scandals (or at the most minor ones) like [Venmogate](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/maybe-the-guardian-should-leave-the-clarence-thomas-exposes-to-pro-publica/) and [Sonia’s Book Club](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/sonia-sotomayor-schools-conservative-supreme-court-justices-on-the-right-way-to-respond-to-an-ethics-inquiry/). Meanwhile, more Biglaw firms opt for a 4-day mandatory office policy, though there’s still not a lot of momentum behind the move. And Judge Pauline Newman of the Federal Circuit continues to fight against her colleagues for her right to continue to hear cases.

Who’d have thought that Monday night would be such a busy time for associate salary news? Since 5:00 p.m. eastern Above the Law has received tips that 10(!) Biglaw firms have notified associates their base compensation will be increasing effective July 1.

The latest to join the party is Houston-based firm Bracewell. They are increasing salaries to the full Cravath scale, which gives all associates a pay raise of between $20,000 and $35,000, depending on class year, as set forth in the memo below. The class of 2016 and summer associates can also expect a bigger payday.

Reaction to the news has been very positive from the rank and file associates on the ground:

Early word is that associates are really pleased, especially in smaller markets like Seattle/San Antonio / Dallas. The firm had a down year last year (though it’s been a very busy 2016) so it’s great to see that they are still being generous to associates.

We are covering this story as market conditions develop, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

# Am Law 50 Firm Ponies Up Market Rate Special Bonuses -- For *Some* Associates
## Some folks are excited, at least.

The special bonus trend is still ripping through Biglaw. The latest firm that made an announcement joining the ranks of firms handing out big cash to associates is Perkins Coie.

The Biglaw firm — ranked 45th in the Am Law 100 with $934,810,000 in 2019 gross revenue — recently [made headlines](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/04/09/perkins-coie-anticipating-hybrid-work-to-scale-back-office-footprint/) for deciding to scale back their physical office footprint, noting that hybrid work solutions are here to stay. Another thing here to stay are Biglaw special bonuses, and Perkins Coie has also saddled up to that trend.

Last week, Perkins Coie announced special bonuses. They’ve matched the prevailing market rate, ranging from $12,000 for first-year associates to $64,000 for ninth-year+ associates, divided up into two payments made in April and November of this year. Associates have to be in good standing and hit a 1950 hours requirement.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Well — for some associates.

As tipsters at the firm have noted, only major market offices are getting those big bonuses. Others are getting some bonus money, just not as large:

Bonuses are at market for Austin, Bellevue, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, LA, NY, Palo Alto, San Diego, San Fran, Seattle, and WDC. Bonuses for Anchorage, Boise, Madison, Phoenix, and Portland are only half of market. Associates getting reduced bonuses are, naturally, pretty pissed—but hardly surprised since we have become so used to being shit on related to salary and bonus decisions. So much for the “One Firm” model that they keep emphasizing to us, I guess.

Hm, sounds like morale — at least at those other markets — isn’t great.

# Getting Noticed As An Associate
## Every day is a chance to market yourself. Here are some tips to get you started.

As a younger attorney, focusing on proving yourself and doing a good job are very important, but so is developing a comfort level in interacting with the (more senior) people you are working for, whether it’s a senior partner or one of your clients.  Most junior lawyers don’t think about this. I know I didn’t. I did what I was told. Instead of being proactive, I was purely reactive. Was this a disaster?  No. But I bet I missed out on a lot of opportunities.

Consider the last meeting you were at where there was a partner running the meeting with the clients. Did you participate in the discussion or just sit quietly at the table?

Are you a believer in this view: “If you sit there quietly and say nothing people may ‘think’ you’re stupid but won’t be sure, but if you open your mouth you will remove all doubt about it.”

Certainly, I was that way for many years. It was basically because I was intimidated and afraid to open my mouth for that very reason.

If you are quiet and passive and do great work, you will do okay, but if you are outspoken and positive you will do much better. Every day is a chance to market yourself.

Here are some thoughts:

- Practice an elevator pitch: Assume someone asked you something open-ended like:  “Hey Toby, tell me about yourself. What’s your story?”  What would you say?  You could talk about your sailing hobby, or you could talk about your career and desires. Maybe say something like:  “Well Bruce, I have been at the firm for a year and a half now and I really find myself just loving the joint venture deals. Don’t get me wrong, that I don’t like other stuff too, but the joint ventures seem to fit my personality and the way my brain works. It is sort of like playing chess in the future. I love those deals and hope I get a chance to do a lot more of them.”  Saying something like that makes an implied statement about you that you are smart, eager, focused, and developing key skills. If I were the partner in charge of you, I might not realize it at that moment, but I would certainly be earmarking you for more work on joint ventures.

- Introduce yourself: If there is a meeting, introduce yourself confidently with an appropriate handshake and make eye contact. “Hi, my name is Toby. I am Bruce’s associate on this deal. I am really looking forward to working with you on this.”
 

- Ask your colleagues: If you are treated like a potted plant at meetings by the partner you work with, screw up your courage and ask the partner. Maybe something like:  “You know, Bruce, I appreciate the chance to work on the deals, but one concern I have is that I don’t get a real chance to participate in the meetings. I would love it if maybe you could include me in the conversations a bit. I assure you I won’t let you down and say something foolish.”  This may go nowhere I admit, but it may go somewhere you should admit. In any case, you have little to lose in having this conversation and perhaps everything to gain.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
- Learn about your industry: As I have said repeatedly in prior articles, knowledge is power. So learn everything you can about your industry. If you know the topic du jour it is much easier to participate.
 

- Something gutsy and creative: Before you go into the meeting with a client and the partner, Google the client and learn about her. Perhaps she has a charity she supports. Imagine how cool you will look when you say: “Hi, my name is Toby. I am Bruce’s associate on this deal. I am really looking forward to working with you on this. Also, I looked you up before our meeting and we share a passion in saving whales. I am really impressed with your work on the Save the Whales Initiative.”
 

- Connect with the other associate: Okay, perhaps the team at the table is just above your pay grade or you are just too intimidated to speak to a captain of industry when you are a junior associate. Fair enough. However, certainly, you aren’t afraid to speak to the other junior associate in the room. Possibly she feels the same way. So go ahead and make a friend. Someday she may be your biggest client or you may be hers. You are playing in the same sandbox so build a sand castle together.
 

- If you have an idea, say it for heaven’s sake: I am sure you have been sitting in a meeting and you think you have a thought or perspective that no one else has. It is bubbling up and you are almost about to speak, but you just chicken out and then the moment passes and it is too late, and you missed your chance. Next time that happens, just don’t do that. Speak!  Let it fly. The worst that happens is your idea is a dud and, okay, you don’t have the happiest feeling. But if it is a good thought, well, then suddenly you are participating in the conversation
Ultimately, the advice here comes down to one thing, which is not being afraid. I admit I was afraid for years as a junior associate as it is completely natural in a new unfamiliar setting. But you don’t have to make the same mistakes I made. So I urge you to go for it and see what happens.

 Our London bonus plan also allows flexibility to award a limited number of larger bonuses to associates and counsel for outstanding contribution through activities that add significant value to the business.

— A spokesman for Allen & Overy, commenting on the Magic Circle firm’s new year-end bonus plan for its London associates, which is part of A&O’s efforts to compete with U.S.-based Biglaw firms with London offices. According to [The Lawyer](https://www.thelawyer.com/allen-overy-creates-new-bonus-plan-for-leveraged-finance-associates/), these bonuses will be offered only to leveraged finance associates, while the firm’s spokesman told [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/wake-up-call-a-o-says-london-associates-to-get-bonuses) that all London associates would be eligible. No bonus specific bonus scale was mentioned.

Cryptocurrency has been around for more than a decade, and it only continues to evolve and grow in popularity. Bitcoin may have ruled the scene in the early days, but today there are [over 18,000](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/most-important-cryptocurrencies-other-than-bitcoin/) cryptocurrencies on the market.

While crypto may once have been dismissed as frivolous or something that would never expand beyond the realm of the most internet-savvy, today it plays a legitimate role in business. Many companies now accept payment in cryptocurrency. Furthermore, an increasing number of municipalities around the world are recognizing cryptocurrency as legal tender and have even dabbled in launching their own cryptocurrencies.

It was just a matter of time, then, until employees started discussing the idea of integrating crypto into their compensation and 401(k) retirement plans. As with all benefits and compensation issues, this raises a number of ethical and legal considerations.

PLI has put together a program to address those issues. In a one-hour program entitled [Employee Compensation and Benefits Involving Cryptocurrency: Trends and Legal Issues](https://www.pli.edu/programs/employee-compensation-and-benefits-involving-cryptocurrency-trends-and-legal-issues?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2), Shawn Butte, in-house employment counsel at Wish, will provide an overview of the legal issues governing the payment of wages or bonuses to employees in cryptocurrency and the addition of cryptocurrency as an election option in a 401(k) plan.

Topics to be covered include:

- Cryptocurrency definitions, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins
- Cryptocurrency transaction basics
- Potential benefits to employers with allowing employees to receive wages or bonuses in cryptocurrency
- Legal risks to consider when paying employees in cryptocurrency
- Examining how the volatility of cryptocurrency could impact an employer’s compliance with wage and hour laws
- The possible impact on classification of employees as exempt or non-exempt
- The Department of Labor’s recent guidance expressing concerns with adding cryptocurrencies as an election option to a 401(k) plan
- Recent trends involving the adoption and regulation of cryptocurrency, including its adoption by municipalities worldwide and the SEC’s plans to regulate cryptocurrency
- Requirements for 401(k) plans under the Economic Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”)
The potential of offering employees the option to receive wages or invest in cryptocurrency through their 401(k) is an exciting development in the benefits space, but it’s important to understand the related legal and ethical issues.
