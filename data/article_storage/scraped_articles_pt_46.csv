We will wind down our operations in Russia and close our Moscow office. We will continue supporting our people there in the process, doing all we can to help them transfer to new roles within Linklaters or otherwise. We are grateful to our Moscow team for all their contributions and friendship since we opened the office in 1992.

We will not act for individuals or entities that are controlled by, or under the influence of, the Russian state, or connected with the current Russian regime, wherever they are in the world.

We will wind down existing work in accordance with our legal and professional obligations.

— A statement issued by Linklaters on its plans to [wind down its office in Moscow](https://www.linklaters.com/en/about-us/news-and-deals/news/2022/january/update-on-linklaters-russia-related-work), amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which the firm referred to as “reprehensible.” Linklaters is one of many Biglaw firms to have recently reevaluated its business in Russia. The firm has also pledged to “continue to assist international clients in dealing with the implications of the current crisis and in unwinding their Russian business interests.”

# Biglaw Associates’ Buying Power: Exploring Salary Disparities & Cost Of Living In Major US Cities
## Discover the disparities in buying power among Biglaw associates across major US cities and how billing rates, rather than cost of living, shape the legal industry's salary landscape.

Like it or not, most Biglaw associates have returned to the office, with [90% of Am Law 100 firms](https://www.law360.com/articles/1567200/biglaw-cracking-down-on-return-to-office) now encouraging or requiring a specific number of days per week of in-person work. In an environment where “work from anywhere” is no longer viable for most lawyers, and where inflation remains high, cost of living in the market where your office is located has become more important than ever.


Cost of living and salaries are closely connected in many industries. Some legal sector jobs exhibit that correlation. Consider as an example a federal judicial clerk with one year of practice experience and bar passage (i.e., paid at the [Grade 12, Step 1](https://oscar.uscourts.gov/qualifications_salary_benefits) of the Judicial Salary Plan scale). Because [federal judicial pay rates](https://www.uscourts.gov/careers/compensation) are adjusted based on cost of living, that clerk would be paid $102,489 in [San Francisco](https://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/archive_3/jsp_san_jose_2023.pdf) versus $89,848 in [Dallas](https://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/archive_3/jsp_dallas_2023.pdf).

In Biglaw, however, cost of living is largely irrelevant to salary scales. Top firms pay associates the “New York” rate in several “major” markets, including the Bay Area, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Dallas, Boston, and DC. From a cost of living perspective, paying New York salaries in San Francisco makes sense. In Houston or Chicago? Not so much.

It’s good to be a Houston Biglaw associate

A November 2021 [NALP analysis](https://www.nalp.org/class_of_2020_buying_power_index) of median private practice first-year associate salaries relative to cost of living found stark differences in associate buying power. NALP calculated that Houston and Dallas first-year associates each enjoyed more than double the buying power of their New York counterparts.

NALP’s calculations may actually understate the advantage enjoyed by Houston and Dallas associates because NALP considered only the relative cost of goods and services. But Houston and Dallas don’t just offer lower prices, they also feature no state income tax. For highly paid Biglaw associates, tax savings can make a significant difference in enabling fast wealth accumulation.

City	Buying power index (NYC = 1.0)	Marginal state + local income tax rate for single first-year Biglaw associate
Houston	2.5	0%
Dallas	2.2	0%
Chicago	1.9	4.95%
Atlanta	1.9	5.75%
Los Angeles	1.6	9.3%
Boston	1.6	5%
Washington DC	1.5	8.5%
San Francisco	1.2	9.3%
NYC	1.0	10.73%
The NALP survey looked at private practice salaries overall, rather than Biglaw salaries exclusively. If the analysis had been limited to Biglaw offices, the results would surely have been somewhat different. But the broader point is unassailable: associate salaries are poorly correlated with cost of living.

Billing rates are a key driver

If cost of living isn’t driving associate salaries, what is? In short, billing rates. Houston and Chicago may not be high-cost cities, but they have plenty of clients willing to pay firms top-dollar rates. Viewed from that lens, paying top salaries in these markets seems fair: associates are being compensated for the value they create. Over time, as clients become more accustomed to the notion of top legal talent being based in regional cities, we expect to see more lawyers being paid New York rates in cities across the country, especially with Biglaw firms [expanding aggressively](https://laterallink.com/lateral-partner-moves-to-secondary-markets-an-unprecedented-opportunity/) in [secondary markets](https://laterallink.com/partners-assessing-a-secondary-market-move-finding-the-right-firm-and-office/). That’s not to say that median associate salaries in secondary cities will rival the New York level. But for lawyers with top-flight credentials, geographic arbitrage may become increasingly possible and alluring.  

If you’re a New York or Bay Area associate tired of putting up with relatively low buying power, you may wish to consider a lateral move to Texas, Chicago, or Atlanta. If working from the beach in Mexico is no longer in the cards, at least consider the wealth accumulation potential of a lower cost city where firms pay New York rates!

# Let’s Retire 'Can I Pick Your Brain?'

Before I go into my objections to this phrase, I want to assure you that I was a notorious offender of the “pick your brain” practice. When I first began my firm, out of desperation, I would reach out to lawyers I didn’t know but whom I admired and thought could offer insight into their firm ownership journey. Part of starting a firm means putting yourself out there and asking for help, even in some of the most awkward situations. I’d often send cringe-worthy emails like this:

Dear Lawyer with Great SEO: 

My name is Iffy Ibekwe, and I am a new estate planning solo attorney. I found you on [Google](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=how+to+pick+someone%27s+brain) and would love to pick your brain about your journey to apparent success as a lawyer. Like [Jon Snow](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Jon_Snow), I know nothing. I need help. Can I take you to lunch or coffee? Please let me know if there’s a time that works best for you.

Sincerely, 

Desperate Iffy

If you, too, have sent emails like this, don’t feel bad. I’m not here to criticize or judge you for doing what you had to do to build your practice. However, I want to offer two alternative ways to approach a lawyer for help. (CAUTION: For attorneys who disagree with my following approach, please don’t come at me with your disapproval. I am sharing my opinion, which is not the law. You do you.

Be clear about the objective of the conversation. When I get a vague email or a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ifeoma-iffy-ibekwe-esq-7b319238/) DM asking to pick my brain, my most likely response is to put off responding to that person. This might sound harsh, but I get these sorts of requests frequently and as a business owner, wife, and mother of four children, giving away 30 minutes to someone who has an undefined objective is not the best and highest use of my time and resources. A better way to approach this is to be clear about the purpose of the conversation. Try saying:

Hello Innovative Attorney:

I follow you on LinkedIn, and I love your insights on creating a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable legal practice. I’m leaving Biglaw in August to start a solo estate planning practice. I want to talk to you about how you position a law business to be culturally sensitive and inclusive. I have researched this topic by [succinctly insert your research and how you are not looking for the attorney to do all the work]. Would you be open to speaking for 15 minutes in the next month? If your schedule doesn’t permit our conversation, I would appreciate any referrals to other attorneys or resources who may help. Again, absolutely no pressure.

Thank you for your time,

An Attorney with Initiative

It doesn’t hurt to ask the other attorney for direction politely. Often, if I am not the right attorney for the request, I recommend another attorney or share resources, which is a workaround without the makeup, hair, and effort of a [Zoom call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZpEpNPaxsw).

Offer to pay a consulting fee for the attorney’s time. Time is money. One of the best ways to reach out to an attorney for expertise is to offer to pay a consulting fee. Many attorneys have hourly rates, and some have flat fees for sitting down and strategizing or problem-solving. Instead of providing lunch or a coffee, which isn’t always convenient, offer to pay for 30 minutes or an hour of that attorney’s time. Start with something like this:

Dear Wise Attorney,

How are you? I am interested in consulting with you on a probate matter that involves a decedent without a will. I have never handled a probate without a will, and I want to walk through the steps before taking on a client. Do you have an hour to talk about how to handle this type of matter? I will compensate you for your time at your hourly rate. 

Please let me know if you have the availability and, if so, your hourly rate. 

Sincerely, 

A Lawyer Who Knows Time is Money

Most lawyers will appreciate the offer of money, even if they don’t accept it. After the meeting, follow up. You can send a note with cookies thanking the lawyer for their time.

I respond positively to many of the inquiries I get to “pick my brain” because I love being generous with my time and giving back where I can. I’ve even recorded a short video about [how I became an estate planning lawyer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFd9AEO4qxI); I often send it to people who want to know about my journey. After answering this question repeatedly, it made more sense to make a video letting colleagues know how I did it and that they can too!

As members of the legal profession, we have an [ethical duty](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/model_rules_of_professional_conduct_preamble_scope/) to strive toward the highest skill level to improve the law and the legal profession. Arguably, part of this duty involves supporting other legal professionals. However, this is not an entitlement to pick a lawyer’s brain, so you must implement a thoughtful approach that won’t exhaust or overwhelm a lawyer who already has numerous demands on her time. Please learn from my mistaken approach.

I’d love to hear your constructive comments or questions at [iffywrites@ibekwelaw.com](mailto:iffywrites@ibekwelaw.com). I am always looking for topic suggestions!

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Davis Polk Sets Up Optional 'Back To Office' Days For Lawyers To Reacquaint Themselves With Office Life
## The compensation leader has spoken on what its return to work will look like.

As Biglaw firms continue to weigh their options when it comes to getting their attorneys and staff back into the office, one of the most prominent firms in the country has announced a plan that will allow its employees to gently dip their toes back into office life.

According to our sources, Davis Polk — known most recently as a compensation trendsetter for the [special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/) that have twice [swept the industry](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/) — announced at an April 22 town hall meeting that the firm would remain in a “voluntary return posture” until Labor Day, and would then switch to a hybrid return model, the details of which are likely to be announced after the July 4th holiday.

During the same meeting, the firm also announced that it was setting up two days in May for a “Spring Back to the Office” program. To entice people to head back to the office, Davis Polk will reimburse up to $40 for lunch or dinner expenses. Here are the [details from a memo](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2021/04/23/davis-polk-planning-office-days-as-optional-first-step-toward-return/) on the event:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“On May 13 and May 24, we will welcome our New York employees to work in the office and see their colleagues. We are excited for this fully optional first step towards a return to the office,” [managing partner Neil] Barr said in the memo.

The memo said New York workers must make reservations to return to the office, subject to a 50% capacity limit. Consistent with current firm guidelines, the reservations and a “completed health attestation” are required to enter the office, while usage of masks and social distancing will be followed, the firm’s memo said.

“An important part of returning is having the opportunity to see colleagues in person,” the memo said.

The email memo attached a list of restaurants offering outdoor seating and takeout around the firm’s New York office at 450 Lexington Ave, which has about 700 lawyers. The firm is also offering free snacks.

“Many of us have been away from our office for so long that the idea of returning may seem a bit disconcerting,” Barr noted in the memo. “I hope that you will use these two days as an opportunity to get reacquainted with being together again in the workplace.” No arrival time has been specified, and casual dress is encouraged.

Will other Biglaw firms organize similar programs now that Davis Polk has spoken? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for what their return to work will look like.

As soon as you find out about reopening plans at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# Some Clients Won't Consider Lawyers For Larger Legal Matters
## Will that small matter you handle at a very favorable rate actually turn into more work from the same client later on? It can be a crap shoot.

When I first started my law practice, I often accepted smaller matters from clients. I sometimes struggled to find legal work to handle, and smaller matters were better than handling no matters at all. I also sometimes thought that if I handled smaller matters for clients, and they saw how well I performed, they would consider my law firm for bigger and more lucrative matters in the future. In some instances, I even agreed to favorable fee arrangements on the smaller matters with the hope that this would get my foot in the door with larger clients that could lead to additional work. In my experience, handling smaller matters for clients does not always translate into additional work, and lawyers should be cautious about offering favorable fee terms to handle smaller matters in anticipation that it might lead to more lucrative referrals.

Shortly after starting my law firm, the general counsel of a decently sized outfit reached out to me about a small matter that the company needed a lawyer to handle. The general counsel said that the matter would not take too much time, and that the company preferred a lawyer who would work on the matter on a flat-fee basis as the matter was not worth too much money to the client. I eventually agreed to handle it on a flat-fee basis, and I figured that handling the matter could lead to more work from that client in the future.

As it turns out, the matter required much more work than anticipated. I ended up spending many hours working on it, and my efforts eventually paid off. I was able to solve a problem the client faced for over a year in only a few days. My papers were excellent, and the client achieved a result that was beyond their expectation. I surely thought that this meant the client would consider my firm for bigger matters in the future.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Over the years, this client has contacted my firm about various smaller matters, which usually did not rise to the level of work that my firm eventually handled once our practice started to develop. At one point in speaking with the general counsel of this client a while ago, the lawyer conveyed that she was on the lookout for “small” matters to refer to our firm. This ticked me off since my law firm handles large matters for publicly traded companies and other substantial outfits that dwarf the client for whom this general counsel worked. For whatever reason, this general counsel believed that my firm was a “small matter” law firm instead of a shop to which the general counsel could refer larger matters.

At another point in my career, I was referred a relatively small litigation matter from a source that seemingly had a lot of work. The referral source implied that if we offered a good rate to the client on this matter, the referral source might consider us for additional work. It is not uncommon for lawyers to perform work at a lower billable hour rate in exchange for more volume, so we accepted this deal.

My law firm performed solid legal work on the matter, and it eventually resolved on favorable terms for the client. However, we never received any additional work from that client. The client likely just used the promise of additional work to negotiate lower compensation for the matter we handled, and it is unclear if the client ever planned to refer additional matters to our law firm.

All told, lawyers should try not to think about the potential for future work when negotiating compensation terms, especially if a client refers a smaller matter. Clients may not have any intention of referring larger matters to lawyers, and attorneys should keep this in mind when accepting matters.

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

According to data collected by Decipher, by what percentage is Biglaw associate hiring up this year, over the previous three-year average?

Hint: The hiring spree is reportedly making firms loosen their traditional standards. “Firms are all the sudden open to those associates if they have any of the requisite experience,” said Summer Eberhard, managing director at legal recruiter Major Lindsey & Africa. “Their open-mindedness is looking beyond law school grades to, ‘Are you somebody that can come in and get ramped up?’”

# New Partners Tell All: The Inside Scoop On Making Partner In Biglaw
## The process can be frustratingly unclear.

Biglaw firms aren’t always great about sharing information. And the process of becoming partner can be harrowing, made worse by a lack of information. Are you really being considered? Should you be looking for another job? It can all be frustratingly unclear.

Even if folks at your firm are tight-lipped, there are still some ways to garner information. Like the[ American Lawyer New Partners Survey](http://www.law.com/sites/americanlawyer/2017/11/01/the-sometimes-murky-path-to-partnership/). The survey compiles information from 400 lawyers promoted to partner in 2015, 2016, or 2017, and lets you know what they really think about the process.

There is some really honest information, like this tidbit from Jai Massari of Davis Polk, who confessed the process was an opaque one:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“You know you’re being considered but can’t do anything about it,” says Massari, a securities and bank regulation lawyer. Even though she had close mentors at the firm in two senior female partners, the crystal ball remained cloudy. “I got positive indications as a sixth- or seventh-year and was getting signals not to accept any other job,” she says, but her promotion “was never clear until the last moment.” Massari, based in Washington, D.C., became an equity partner three months ago.

There are some bright spots — an impressive 88 percent of partners surveyed that said they’d been adequately prepared for partnership. Almost 80 percent said their business development, compensation, and information about their firm’s finances has increased since getting the partnership nod.

However, training and mentorship once you’ve crossed into the promised land of partnership is very uneven. About a third of respondents said they’d received project management training after becoming partner. But if you’re left without training, well, it can be rough. Just take a look at this choice quote from the survey:

“[The] firm appears to promote associates to partner to keep from losing them to competitors. Once promoted, equity partners do little to support them, no longer take time to work with them and mentor them [or] visit with clients,” this partner wrote. “They seem to view new partners as competition rather than resources to be utilized like when they were associates.”

Cutthroat.

And the bad news is worries about your career don’t stop once you’ve made partner. There are just new benchmarks to hit, and you still might be working without perfect collaboration:

“Job security is still a question mark,” another new partner wrote. Several others took issue with how equity or senior partners refused to share or pass down clients or work in a way that empowered new partners. “We seem to be content tending to our own gardens on the theory that we are judged based on those and less on how the rest of the gardens are growing, or whether we could work together to build a new, bigger garden,” one new partner wrote.

Plus, you know, there’s the whole “state of the industry” concern over a profession slow to change with clients that increasingly demand innovation:

One hit right on the industry’s 1,000-pound gorilla: Asked what most concerns her about her firm, this lawyer responded, “Law firm competition and potential future obsolescence in general.”

At least it’s better to worry about these issues from the relative safety of inside the partnership than to be on the outside looking in.

If you’re using an acronym, then I don’t understand it.

That’s true for briefs, of course. But I’m thinking more broadly today; I’m thinking about life.

Perhaps your seminar about OFFBR is fascinating; I wouldn’t know. But I’m sure not going to register for it unless you tell me, in actual words that I can understand, what you’ll be discussing. Your email offering insights about OFFBR — from leading experts in the field!!! — just doesn’t do the trick.

Perhaps your employer, GDH, is a fine institution; I wouldn’t know. But I’m sure not taking your call or opening your email if I don’t recognize the name of your outfit.

Within your own company, perhaps the ARR on the SNHI account by the JGSC unit is worth analyzing; I wouldn’t know. But recipients of your email can’t help with the analysis if they don’t know what you’re talking about.

You think I’m kidding here; I’m not. I recently witnessed — or heard about, or dreamed, or hallucinated; I don’t reveal confidential information on the web — a meeting in which a memo about an investigation referred repeatedly to the SPOC. The group was about to act on the recommendation until someone asked, “What does ‘SPOC’ mean?” There were a dozen people in the room; no one knew the meaning of the words they were reading.

(Okay, okay: “Single point of contact.”)

If you guessed it, you’re a better man than I am (which, on reflection, sets a mighty low bar).

Where was I?

Oh, yeah. Second point:

If you’re using shock quotation marks, then you don’t know what you’re saying.

If the “run-off” won’t be credited “dollar-for-dollar” against the revenue, then the “client” won’t “live with it.”

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“Run-off” is ambiguous. “Dollar-for-dollar” might actually mean something, but the shock quotes make the meaning uncertain. Is the person really a “client,” or is he something else? (If a client, what do the shock quotes signify? If not a client, how about telling me what he is?) And in what sense won’t the client “live with it”? Will he complain? Fire us? Or really not live with it, because the mere offer will prompt apoplexy?

Shock quotes don’t aid the reader’s comprehension; rather, they expose your lack of command of the language. Do you “understand” what I’m “saying”?

Instead of using imprecise words set off in shock quotes, use ordinary English words and phrases according to their usual meanings. That avoids the need to invent new meanings and then set incomprehensible words off in quotes. Your readers should be able to understand your sentences without devoting a lifetime’s study to your personal hermeneutics.

Two down, two to go:

If you’re using business jargon, then I won’t (1) connect with you on LinkedIn or (2) continue reading your email.

I know, I know: Your LinkedIn profile is entirely accurate. There’s just no other way to put it: You’re a high-energy, adrenal-pumping, high-falutin’ business executive who prioritizes tasks, achieving significant synergies. You leverage your network to amplify your messaging.

Good for you, I guess. Whatever you do, I don’t need it.

I’m not hiring you, or reading any further, or encouraging any more communications between us.

For two reasons: First, life is too short. Second, I don’t understand what you’re saying, and I honestly don’t believe that you understand what you’re saying. I think that your mind is mush, and you’re hiding behind meaningless jargon.

Incentivize your colleagues to level-set before they operationalize without me, thank you very much.

Finally:

If you’re using a sentence that’s more than 3 1/2 typed lines long, then I forgot where I was and had to go back and re-read the thing.

That annoyed me.

I’m a reasonably intelligent guy, and I should be able to understand stuff as I read it. If your sentence is so convoluted that an average reader gets lost in the middle and must go back and re-read to divine what you’re saying, then your sentence is no good.

You owe me, the reader, better than that. (If the reader is a judge, you surely owe the judge better than that.)

Writing run-on sentences is rude. It offends readers. It causes many readers simply to plow ahead, continuing to read words without comprehending substance. It causes litigators to lose cases, and business folks to alienate colleagues and fail to communicate.

And it’s inexcusable to write run-on sentences. You can fix your error in a heartbeat: Look at what you just wrote. Is any sentence more than 3 1/2 typed lines long? If so, find an excuse to stick a period in there.

Got it?

# What In-House Counsel Really Want For The Holidays
## Here are some ideas for you on what in-house counsel like, based on some very unscientific focus group/crowdsourcing.

Confession: as outside counsel, I didn’t send holiday gifts to clients. As a senior associate, I was sensitive to the perception that I was trying to “usurp” or encroach upon partners’ client relationships and left the relationship-building with firm clients to said relationship partners. For my own clients, I used Lunar New Year as a time to send holiday cards to differentiate myself, and I tended to send little gifts throughout the year as appropriate, instead of all at one time during a prescribed season.

But now as in-house counsel, I see the light — or at least the strategy — and how not sending something could be a missed opportunity. In my very unscientific surveying of in-house colleagues, the absence of something during the holidays could be misinterpreted as the lack of care for the relationship, especially if there was substantial spend that year. Of course, this is subjective, and as I note below, there may be very good reasons not to send anything.

I do need to note, however, that many companies may have policies about what gifts they can accept from a business partner. The policies may range from “cannot accept anything” to “only below a specific value” to “please only send something the entire department can enjoy.” If you are in-house counsel reading this, go ahead and take a moment to check if you have a policy and whether you need to disclose the gift to your ethics and compliance team. If you are outside counsel, you may want to make a note to check in with your clients about what their policy is.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
My view on gifts from both my perspective as former firm lawyer and now in-house counsel is this: no one is going to give you business just because you bought them something. Or at least, they shouldn’t. And the more extravagant the gift, the more scrutiny your relationship will likely get. Look at the “why” behind the gift — it’s probably something along the line of “this is a little something to let you know that I am thinking of you, client, during the holiday and value our relationship.” Knowing your audience is key — and my disclaimer is that this is very subjective.

With that in mind, here are some ideas for you on what in-house counsel like, based on my very unscientific focus group/crowdsourcing:

-
- Personalization — something that came up again and again as memorable was when the gift was personalized, whether to the client or the lawyer. For example, maybe you know that the client is obsessed with their dog, so you send a unique dog toy, or the client really loves fiction, so you send a thoughtful book. One friend received a customized bat, another a personalized hard hat. I think this comes from the fundamental need of every human being to feel seen (and not like a number or checkbook). One person liked receiving a bottle of liquor with their outside counsel’s faces on it, olive oil from their Italian counsel, maple syrup from their Canadian counsel.
- Practical — Some really liked unique practical gifts (usually gadgets) that they could use — such as a phone stand that also charges or an Apple airtag (although you may want to determine whether your client is an Android user) or a bottle of wine (but find out whether they drink). The group was less enthusiastic about coffee mugs, water bottles, and generic marketing swag that is usually given away at a conference.
- Sharable — For some who lead a team, they felt better when the gifts, such as snacks, sweets, or an experience, could be shared with their team. Mini-cupcakes from Baked by Melissa was an honorable mention.
- Experiences — This will definitely vary by client, their culture, and where they fall on the extroversion scale, but some appreciated an experience — like tickets to a sporting event or a nice dinner, where there is opportunity for team-building between in-house counsel and outside counsel. There were definite votes for holiday events like pictures with Santa and going to the movies where family could come too.
I share all this to say that while the annual premade gift basket — you know, the one with crackers, sausage, cheese, and the occasional random breadsticks or tea — is something, if you’re going to make the effort to send a gift, you might as well make it a little bit more memorable. The difference in reaction between an “Oh, that’s nice, thanks” to a “Wow! That is so funny or thoughtful or I could definitely use this” might be worth it.

They should never, ever have Russian clients again. This bloody money will bring them neither joy, nor happiness. Lawyers are all about money but there is always something more than that. Dignity, for example.

— Judge Ivan Mishchenko of the Ukraine Supreme Court, urging international law firms to close their offices in Moscow, Russia, in an interview with [The Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/war-in-ukraine-pull-out-of-moscow-armed-judge-urges-british-law-firms-p7qml0x73). Mishchenko left the bench to defend Ukraine, and his battle brethren [refer to him as “Judge Dredd.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/ukrainian-supreme-court-judge-earns-fierce-nickname-after-leaving-bench-for-battle-against-russia)

# Morning Docket: 05.14.18
## * Could it be? Will another Biglaw firm be dragged into this mess [after Skadden](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/former-skadden-associate-is-first-to-be-sentenced-in-mueller-probe/)? Michael Avenatti, lawyer to Stormy Daniels, thinks that special counsel Robert Mueller ought to take a look at Squire Patton Boggs, the firm that's been working hard to disavow its ""strategic alliance"" with Michael Cohen, the president's personal attorney. [[Newsweek](http://www.newsweek.com/avenatti-923419)] * ""[Y]ou can’t have one rule for Democratic presidents and another rule for Republican presidents."" Chairman Chuck Grassley of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who recently suggested that any Supreme Court justice who was thinking about retiring do so right f**king now, claims that he won't hold any hearings or votes for a Supreme Court nominee during the lead-up to the 2020 election [[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-11/grassley-says-he-d-resist-any-supreme-court-nomination-in-2020)] * The American Bar Association is planning to do away with its requirement that accredited law schools use a standardized admissions test to admit students. Will any law schools actually go so far as to admit students without any test scores at all? More on this later today. [[Law.com](https://www.law.com/2018/05/11/aba-moves-forward-with-plan-to-end-law-school-admission-test-requirement/)] * The end of the latest Supreme Court Term is drawing near, and if you've been watching goings-on at the high court, you know what that means: justices seem to be more likely to injure themselves now than during any other time of the year. Cross your fingers and hope that no one else sustains any broken bones -- or worse -- before the end of June. [[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/12/politics/supreme-court-broken-bones/index.html)] * Public law schools are usually cash cows for their associated undergraduate universities, but one law school is doing the complete opposite thanks to a dip in applications. But for a gigantic annual subsidy from main campus ($7.5 million), the University of Minnesota School of Law wouldn't be able to balance its budget -- and the school will need even more by 2020 ($12 million). Yikes! [[Duluth News Tribune](https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/education/4444390-university-minnesota-law-school-subsidy-soars-applications-drop)]

Joe Biden will be the 46th president of the United States. That is a fact, not liberal wishcasting. But in our post-fake news era, even the seemingly obvious needs to be said, out loud, again and again (as I was reminded after spending a chunk of yesterday in a social media argument with a childhood friend who now seems to embrace his status as a low-information voter).

Not helping the quest for truth and facts are GOP operatives that insist on parading on cable news spreading specious rumors about voter fraud in the 2020 election. And Biglaw’s own was one of the culprits.

Foley & Lardner partner [Cleta Mitchell](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/cleta-mitchell/) (who you may remember for her charming [anti-gay rights crusade](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/04/cleta-mitchell-of-foley-lardner-an-anti-gay-gay-icon/), or from [not wearing a mask](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cleta-michel-freedomworks-rose-garden-covid-trump_n_5f7b74f2c5b688b05a5954d7) at the [Amy Covid Barrett](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/amy-covid-barrett-discovers-how-nicknames-actually-work/) nomination celebration, or from working to keep the Steve Bannon PAC [donor rolls secret)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/25/bannon-hires-mueller-skeptic-cleta-mitchell-to-represent-his-nonprofit.html) appeared on cable news — Fox, natch — to repeat the line the Trump campaign has been peddling about so-called widespread voter fraud, as[ reported by](https://www.law.com/2020/11/07/dead-people-having-voted-foley-lardner-partner-says-trump-has-proof-of-illegal-ballots/) Law.com:

Foley & Lardner partner Cleta Mitchell, who appeared Saturday on the Fox News Channel, said the president’s team has been evaluating voting records, and have uncovered widespread irregularities.

“We’re already doublechecking and finding dead people having voted, or maybe people have voted across state lines—voted in two states—illegal voting, voting by non-citizens and that sort of thing,” Mitchell said. “We are building that case. We think that there will be evidence that we will have. We already know that there is evidence of that sort of thing, and there are malfunctions in the equipment, improper denial of Republican poll-watchers in certain … counties.”

Of course, there are legitimate reasons for many of these things Mitchell claims are fraud, such as someone casting an early or mail-in ballot before dying or moving. And it turns out, these plausible explanations have been true. Like when the Trump campaign’s key example of voter fraud turned out to be military members and their families who voted after being transferred:

Indeed, it should be noted that none of the legion of lawsuits filed thus far by the Trump campaign have alleged widespread voter fraud, as opposed to small and discrete issues that would not be enough to turn the election. Now, is that gap between what Trump lawyers are saying in court versus what they’re saying on TV because members of the bar have to hit a higher standard of evidence and proof before appearing in front of a judge in a court of law as opposed to the sinking standard of merely being able to keep a straight face in front of a camera in the court of public opinion? Well, yes. And where little evidence of fraud exists, those cases are being [thrown out of court](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-vote-lawsuits/2020/11/05/77f8a284-1f84-11eb-90dd-abd0f7086a91_story.html). (Legal nerds rejoiced at a [Michigan judge blasting ](https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/come-on-now-michigan-judge-scoffs-at-and-tosses-trump-campaign-lawsuit-backed-by-hearsay-evidence/)“inadmissible hearsay within hearsay, and plaintiffs have provided no hearsay exception for either level of hearsay that would warrant consideration of the evidence.”)

All this might be exactly why Mitchell pivoted to a canned line about “illegal votes” when host John Roberts asked if the goal of these litigation challenges was merely to cast doubt on a rightfully elected president:

“Are we trying to cast just skepticism on the entire process, Cleta?” he asked Mitchell. “What’s the goal?”

“The goal is exactly what the president said: We want every legal vote counted,” Mitchell responded. “We want all those illegal votes thrown out.”

It’s also worth repeating — one more time for the folks in the back — that the legal challenges the Trump campaign has filed (about small, discrete issues) have [not been successful](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-election-irregularities-claims/2020/11/08/8f704e6c-2141-11eb-ba21-f2f001f0554b_story.html). And besides, the allegations in those cases are not widespread enough to change the outcome of the election.

# All The Things That Can Go Wrong During On-Campus Interviews

It’s that time of year again! Second-year students in law schools around the country are interviewing for their ideal summer position, which, if all goes according to plan, will turn into post-graduation employment.

While we here at Above the Law certainly hope everything goes well and you all are able to easily secure the job of your dreams, we’re not that naive. There are a seemingly infinite number of things that can — and will — go wrong.

Maybe a [tragedy](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/interview-horror-stories-when-tragedy-strikes/) interrupted your interview mojo, maybe the interviewer was a [racist](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/interview-horror-stories-how-to-respond-to-a-raging-racist/), maybe the guy interviewing you was just a [dick](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/interview-horror-stories-interviewing-with-an-emperor/). Or maybe [a case of TMI](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/beware-the-biglaw-lunch-interview-there-be-dragons/) struck you mid-interview. There are really millions of ways interviews can go pear-shaped.

# After All These Attorney Departures, Does Anyone Still Work At Norton Rose?
## There's been a string of departures from Norton Rose recently, and today the firm took the biggest blow yet.

Yesterday afternoon, I received a short tip out of the blue about Norton Rose Fulbright’s DC office. According to the tipster, the office “has been hemorrhaging attorneys since the beginning of the year” with senior associates and “partners who have been at the firm for decades” all decamping to greener pastures over the last few months.

To be honest, it’s not something that had appeared on my radar. Going back through the press releases of lateral moves for the year to date, there’s definitely something to this tip — laterals seem to be heading out of that office more than they’ve been heading in. Winston had nabbed [8 infrastructure and energy lawyers](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/sites/americanlawyer/2018/02/01/norton-rose-fulbright-energy-infrastructure-group-decamps-for-winston-strawn/) earlier in the year and [Rohit Chaudhry](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2018/02/15/kirkland-lands-project-finance-pros-from-norton-ro/) and [Brian Greene](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2018/03/09/norton-rose-sees-dc-departures-covingtons-revenue-bump-advice-from-chuck-rosenberg/) had both left, seemingly legacy Chadbourne attorneys who didn’t want to make a go of it at the new firm. But it wasn’t anything that would strike any but the most dedicated lateralphile as a trend.

Until today of course.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
That tip turned out to be the canary in the proverbial mine, as today brought news that at least 16 attorneys — including Jared Kushner’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell — have left Norton Rose. That’s… a bad day.

Reed Smith picked up 15 of the attorneys from the firm’s Life Sciences/Health Care Team in Washington, New York, and Austin. Five of those defections were partners at Norton Rose, while an additional two were senior associates who will join Reed Smith as partners.

Meanwhile, Abbe Lowell is moving to Winston, a firm that [hopefully has tighter email controls](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/a-brand-new-email-screw-up-for-abbe-lowell/), and takes a marquee criminal law practice with him. While it’s easy to think Chadbourne lawyers are generally souring on the Norton Rose merger, Lowell explains that his reasons for leaving were [much more practical](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/05/23/abbe-lowell-counsel-to-kushner-joins-winston-from-norton-rose-fulbright/?kw=Abbe%20Lowell%2C%20Counsel%20to%20Kushner%2C%20Joins%20Winston%20From%20Norton%20Rose%20Fulbright&et=editorial&bu=The%20American%20Lawyer&cn=20180523&src=EMC-Email&pt=Am%20Law%20Daily%20Breaking%20News):

“Norton Rose and Chadbourne are a powerful combination,” Lowell said by phone Wednesday, “[but] I was running into a number of conflicts and other issues in this 4,000-person firm.”

The next time someone preaches a merger as the cure to a law firm’s ills, this is one of the very serious consequences that they’re probably overlooking. Mergers can create all manner of administrative headaches that, far from capitalizing on economies of scale, mire the new firm in unforeseen slowdowns for years until it can reach equilibrium. Sometimes that’s going to generate a few high-profile firm casualties.

But, to answer the question posed by the title, “yes, lots of people still work at Norton Rose.” Just not nearly as many as worked there yesterday. But with 4000, they can afford to spare a few before we start to get concerned.

# Breaking Open The Black Box Of Partner Compensation
## In the age of both shifting partnership structures with the rise of non-equity partnership ranks and mercurial and mysterious compensation formulas, approximating your business’s value on the open market is a daunting task.

In 2023, the news broke that Cravath, one of the famous hold-outs of the adoption of a non-equity partnership structure, was moving ahead with the two-tiered system, with rumblings that Paul Weiss[ might join this year](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/10/25/paul-weiss-could-adopt-nonequity-partner-tier-in-2024/). We [wrote many years](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/07/mandatory-law-firm-retirement-succession-planning-and-you/) ago about the glut of senior associates facing an impending exit from Biglaw as the colossal baby boomer population that largely comprises the partnership ranks continued to[ work later and later](https://doi.org/10.1002/ajim.22694) than their predecessors. It seems to be a partial answer to this dilemma, firms are leaning more and more toward non-equity tiers of partners to retain these talented lawyers. This is evidenced by the increasing rate at which non-equity positions continue to be replenished, per[ Thomson Reuters’ analysis](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/legal/two-tiered-partnerships/). Unsurprisingly, as a whole, the number of non-equity partners has grown from 19,289 in fiscal year 2012 to 26,888 in fiscal year 2022.

The implications of this restructuring are yet to be fully realized vis-a-vis the pay of equity partners. As salaried partners focus on servicing rather than generating work, non-equity partners are fixed costs that are baked into the firm’s overhead. As sharers of company profits, equity partners have seen their average compensation rise as net profits continue to soar. The average equity partner compensation has risen from $1,513,442.26 (adjusted for inflation) in 2012 to $2,079,240 in 2022 per ALM.

A law firm’s compensation model for partners is oftentimes as mysterious as Amelia Earhart’s disappearance. When partners look for new firms, they generally have a shortlist of expectations, such as a good culture, strong practices and platforms, stable finances without too much debt, stellar reputations, and last but certainly not least, healthy compensation. Achieving this can be difficult in practice. We track compensation structures across and beyond the Am Law 200 and hardly any firms have the same structure. Between firms, origination, and working credits vastly differ in their compensation, structure, and scaling, which means you can become severely undervalued if you choose a firm whose compensation formula is a poor fit for your book of business.

This antiquated notation that the compensation scales linearly with a book of business from firm to firm is easily dispelled by graphing originations vs PPP.



The reality is, that in the age of both shifting partnership structures with the rise of non-equity partnership ranks and mercurial and mysterious compensation formulas, approximating your business’s value on the open market is a daunting task.

Nonetheless, at every value for originations, some firms significantly outpace others in performance for equity partner compensation. For firms with a formulaic compensation model, there is not much wiggle room to influence your numbers, the positive is you will have a clear idea from the outset about your take-home compensation. For firms with closed compensation systems, like the “black box,” a partner uses peer firms with formulaic models to benchmark what he assumes is the market. Some firms are somewhere in the middle, open but subjective or semi-open and semi-formulaic. Most are closed, however. There is not much consistency, so there is no real market to peg your value on unless you create one for yourself. One of the best ways to do this is to work with a veteran legal recruiter who, using knowledge of different firm compensation structures, can negotiate the best deal for you by creating a bidding war for your services. While it sounds easy in practice, the firms that can actually absorb your bill rates, meet your personal preferences, and clear conflict checks are few and far between, and difficult to find on your own.

When a book of business crosses the two million mark (i.e., 2,000 hours at $1,000 an hour), the actual take-home return begins to diverge from the expected return as the single book of business starts to cost the firm more resources between associates, service partners, and administrative staff. We see this in the relatively uniform grouping in the graph above of compensations vs. originations for originations under the two million dollar mark. This association is approximate and varies from firm to firm, nonetheless, the general trend holds in all of Biglaw. It does, however, illustrate that it is important to find a firm that will reward your increased originations with congruous increases in your take-home compensation.

We meet with every Am Law firm to learn not only about their lateral needs but also compensation structures and their platforms to better service our partner clients. We use our insider knowledge to put together a holistic perspective of the best fit for your business. In addition, we know when the firm is willing to be opportunistic, and handsomely reward a lateral partner. The bottom line is that it is our job to maximize your options, and [my colleagues and I](https://laterallink.com/directory/) at Lateral Link are happy to help.

# Always Mind Your Surroundings
## Trying a case is about a lot more than just law and facts.

Yes, being a trial lawyer is a job where we spend a lot of time in our minds — thinking, analyzing, writing — but when hearings and trials come, don’t forget to focus as well on what’s around you and address logistics.

My last jury trial before the pandemic involved a very long running dispute where there was more than a decade of history between parties in a joint venture that had related entities in half a dozen countries. We represented the parties in multiple state and federal trial and appellate courts, as well as worked with lawyers in two other countries. It was a huge logistical challenge to deal with everything, and there were a host of interesting and difficult factual and legal issues to address in all the disputes.

[My colleagues and I](https://balestrierefariello.com/) know when trying a case that we certainly have to have all of that in mind when it comes time for trial. But my preparation went well beyond knowing my case, and knowing the relevant law (we were in front of a very good business dispute judge who challenged all the lawyers on a host of issues), and knowing the specifics of what to ask on direct or what to ask on cross.

I also had to be ready to try this specific case, before the specific jury we had, in that specific court room. I needed to realize a lot of light was streaming in from the big windows right behind the jury, such that it would be hard to see the jurors’ faces when opening, and closing, and I had to let my witnesses know that as well if they wanted to face the jury from the witness stand. I needed to understand that the audiovisual set up in the beautiful, but old, courtroom was not conducive to the more than 1,000 PDFs we’d need put up on screens (so my team had to work out another solution). I kept in mind that, as the plaintiffs sitting very close to the jury given the courtroom setup, I had to take care of which papers we had on our counsel table so that the jurors could not see them.

Trying a case, then, is about a lot more than just law and facts. It’s about logistics. And if you don’t try cases — or have evidentiary hearings, or even handle a lot of oral arguments — it’s easy to forget this. It’s not enough to know the case, but you have to be able to present it in the specific time and place where you’ll present it. And so much being done by Zoom doesn’t change any of this: is there a backlight behind you? Do you know how to share the screen to put up exhibits, or is someone else going to do it? And where on your service or in the cloud will the exhibits be? Do you have a wired connection for your out-of-office witnesses so that they’re not victims to their kids hoarding Wi-Fi by playing online video games while they are testifying?

The simple word for all of this is logistics. You need to know all the logistics, or you will get tripped up in trying to make your case. I think of this, as noted in the title of this essay, as being aware of your surroundings: how will those surroundings in that evidentiary presentation work for you? For you to win for your clients, you must know a lot more than law and facts. You must know how exactly the mini-theater of your evidentiary presentation will play out.

# Megan Thee Stallion Lawyers Up To Fight Lawsuit
## Spiro has a knack for snagging high profile clients.

On a good day, media coverage of Megan Thee Stallion ranges from teasing a new album or [reminding everyone that she’s a canon member of the Marvel Cinematic Universe](https://youtube.com/watch?v=IZXzVGGMwwI). Unfortunately, not all days are good ones. Recent headlines have centered on claims alleging Megan had an inappropriate work relationship with one of her photographers. [Blavity](https://blavity.com/megan-thee-stallion-sued-by-former-employee) has coverage:

The Houston native’s former photographer Emilio Garcia joined her team in 2018. He was terminated last June after working with her for nearly five years. On April 23, he filed a lawsuit against Megan, alleging she put him in an inappropriate position that ultimately tarnished their work relationship. Garcia’s suit claimed he was left emotionally and mentally traumatized after he allegedly witnessed the 29-year-old have sexual relations with an anonymous woman during a tour stop in Ibiza, Spain, according to NBC News.

The filing also stated that Garcia alleges he was told, “Don’t ever discuss what you saw” by his boss the next day. He also claims that while in Ibiza, Megan called him a “fat b**ch” and told him to “spit your food out” and “you don’t need to be eating.”

Megan is being represented by Quinn Emanuel’s Alex Spiro. He had this to say in response:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Here’s the statement from Megan Thee Stallion’s attorney Alex Spiro on the new lawsuit:

“This is an employment claim for money — with no sexual harassment claim filed and with salacious accusations to attempt to embarrass her. We will deal with this in court.” [pic.twitter.com/QY51jNiKIK](https://t.co/QY51jNiKIK)

— Meghann Cuniff (@meghanncuniff) [April 24, 2024](https://twitter.com/meghanncuniff/status/1783145080003629057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

As stressful as fighting a lawsuit is, the last thing Megan has to worry about is if Spiro knows what he’s doing. He’s represented his fair share of big name musicians like Jay-Z, Mick Jagger, and 21 Savage. It seems like it would be much easier to represent Megan than to represent Elon Musk again. Who needs [more](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/elon-musk-lawyers-respond-to-sanctions-motion/) sanctions motions, right?

# Ruth Bader Ginsburg Claps Back At Neil Gorsuch

No wonder Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg still [likes being called “Notorious RBG”](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-still-loves-being-called-the-notorious-r-b-g/) — girl knows how to bring it.

Yesterday the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Gill v. Whitford, the case that is challenging Wisconsin’s partisan gerrymandering scheme. Prognosticators are opining the decision will come down to [Justice Anthony Kennedy’s swing vote](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/is-math-legal-gill-v-whitford-will-determine-if-we-can-have-nice-things/), as the four conservative justices seem likely to side with the state and the four liberal justices will seemingly vote against the gerrymandering. And if the questioning from Justice Neil Gorsuch is anything to go on, it appears as though he’s already made up his mind.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
After about an hour of oral arguments, Gorsuch channeled the persona of an eager, Fed Soc-bound 1L, in the guise of a question to [Paul Smith](http://www.campaignlegalcenter.org/team/paul-m-smith), who was arguing on behalf of the Campaign Legal Center that the Wisconsin gerrymandering is unconstitutional. Gorsuch lobbed a pedantic query that sought to bring the questioning back to his textualist worldview, arguing the Constitution fails to provide the Court authority to redistrict:

Maybe we can just for a second talk about the arcane matter of the Constitution.

Sure Neil, you’ve been part of an hour-long conversation about the constitutionality of a state government’s action, but sure, pretend that wasn’t about the “Constitution.” Go ahead, ask your question:

And where exactly do we get authority to revise state legislative lines? When the Constitution authorizes the federal government to step in on state legislative matters, it’s pretty clear—if you look at the Fifteenth Amendment, you look at the Nineteenth Amendment, the Twenty-sixth Amendment, and even the Fourteenth Amendment, Section 2, says Congress has the power, when state legislators don’t provide the right to vote equally, to dilute congressional representation. Aren’t those all textual indications in the Constitution itself that maybe we ought to be cautious about stepping in here?

You know what? This is why [you don’t have friends](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/how-badly-is-neil-gorsuch-annoying-the-other-supreme-court-justices), Neil. Sitting there in your goddamn stolen seat and tryin’ to backdoor lecture your peers on the Court — people with more experience in the job, mind you — on “the arcane matter of the Constitution”? What the hell, man? See, that’s how I would have responded, but I have neither the grace nor wisdom of RBG. Jeffrey Toobin of the New Yorker perfectly [describes](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ginsburg-slaps-gorsuch) her response:

Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is bent with age, can sometimes look disengaged or even sleepy during arguments, and she had that droopy look today as well. But, in this moment, she heard Gorsuch very clearly, and she didn’t even raise her head before offering a brisk and convincing dismissal. In her still Brooklyn-flecked drawl, she grumbled, “Where did ‘one person, one vote’ come from?” There might have been an audible woo that echoed through the courtroom. (Ginsburg’s comment seemed to silence Gorsuch for the rest of the arguments.)

Boom.



And bonus points for managing to silence the [chatty Gorsuch](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/neil-gorsuch-isnt-the-justice-we-need-but-hes-the-justice-we-deserve/).

For the record, Smith took Ginsburg’s cue and passed the election law pop quiz, responding:

That’s what Reynolds v. Sims and Baker v. Carr did, and a number of other cases that have followed along since.

Yes, as Justice Gorsuch is obviously aware, there is more than just a 230-year-old piece of parchment that guides decisions — there are tomes of case law and precedent that play a vital role in determining the constitutionality of state action. That is, after all, what we go to law school to learn.

# First-Years Get Raises... Everyone Else Gets A Warm Glass Of Confusion
## FEBRUARY?!? They don't get the money until FEBRUARY?!?

Honestly, people. We all see right through these coy attempts to get off the “[Biglaw Naughty List](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/the-firms-that-are-losing-the-battle-in-biglaws-salary-wars/)” by raising first-year salaries and then mumbling something about further evaluation of senior salaries.

Another firm joined that trend today, with Foley & Lardner trumpeting a move to $180K for the first-years in New York, Boston, Chicago, Washington, and all of its California offices. Other offices will get a $20K raise on top of their current salary. But all those past their rookie season have no idea what’s happening. The firm’s memo says only:

We will distribute the full salary schedule effective February 1 for each office, including increases at all levels, later in the year.

Ahem. “February 1”? And here we thought it was a cruel slight to make associates wait until September. February?!? Wow.

From a tipster:

Apparently they’re raising first year salaries 20k… and salaries for the other “tiers” and “levels” in Foley’s compensation system are not going to be announced until “later this year,” whenever that means.

I haven’t talked to others yet but my reaction as [a mid-level] is disappointment with the delayed implementation of an unknown raise.

Another is more blunt:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
All senior counsel and associates at Foley just got this email. Needless to say, everyone is pretty pissed. Not to mention the fact that I have never heard of an associate receiving a market-level bonus. There is no way associates won’t be leaving in droves.

When this tipster says they’ve “never heard of an associate receiving a market-level bonus,” they’re talking about Foley & Lardner’s curiously named “newly enhanced bonus program” (you [can read about it here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/first-years-get-raises-everyone-else-gets-a-warm-glass-of-confusion/3/)) that’s just a whole mess of vague, but seems to suggest one could work their tail off and still not get a market bonus. It appears that a lack of clarity is a tradition when it comes to associate compensation here.

The one thing all Foley & Lardner associates do know is that the minimum billables will be going up from 1850/year to 1900/year. That’s not too offensive considering anything below 2000/year seems low in the Biglaw world, but get this: the hours increase takes effect in November 2016. Bad form, folks. Synchronize those dates! It’s called quid pro quo.

Good luck, Foley & Lardner associates!

(The memo is available on the next page….)

Ed. note: This is the second in a new series on work-life balance. [Read the first installment here](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/how-busy-lawyers-can-find-more-work-life-balance/). 

For many attorneys, the concept of “work-life balance” can seem like an urban legend, except even more far-fetched.

Indeed, maintaining time for a robust life outside the office can seem like a mythical concept — like a beautiful unicorn or a Harvard alum who never mentions where they went to school.

At Paragon Legal, we aim to provide both flexibility and high-level work, allowing lawyers to finally make work-life balance a reality.

And from the client’s perspective, happy lawyers are better positioned to deliver top-quality work than those who are burned out.

In the [first installment of this series](https://paragonlegal.com/how-busy-lawyers-can-find-more-work-life-balance-part-i/), we noted how lawyers can audit, guard, and schedule their time. Here, we provide additional tips to manage your day.

Try Time Blocking

Time blocking is when you [divvy up your day](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/time-blocking) into blocks of time, during which you focus on specific tasks.

For instance, you may only check email messages for 10-11 a.m. and 4:30-5:30 p.m., allowing you to avoid constant email interruptions while you’re working on projects.

When you decide to do certain tasks is also important.

For some people, it’s easier to tackle important tasks in the morning, while others may find they have better focus in the afternoons. Try scheduling tasks that require more concentration for when you have better focus.

(For even more on [when to schedule certain tasks](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/30/daniel-pink-how-to-time-your-day-for-peak-performance.html), check out [When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing](https://www.danpink.com/books/when/) by Daniel Pink.)

Reduce Multitasking

From Slack notifications to news alerts, we live in a distraction-heavy world.

But each of those interruptions can come with a time cost — it takes an average of 23 minutes and 15 seconds to get back to the task at hand, [according to Gloria Mark](https://www.fastcompany.com/944128/worker-interrupted-cost-task-switching), a professor at the University of California, Irvine.

To protect your focus, minimize switching between tasks as much as possible.

Mute that group chat, turn off unnecessary social media notifications, and even consider putting your phone in silent mode or in a drawer while working on a project.

Use a Timer

Using a timer can also be immensely helpful in keeping you focused, while also encouraging short breaks to keep your brain fresh.

The [Pomodoro Tracker](https://pomodoro-tracker.com/) will help you use the [Pomodoro Technique](https://www.themuse.com/advice/take-it-from-someone-who-hates-productivity-hacksthe-pomodoro-technique-actually-works), which is a popular time management system in which you focus on a task for 25 minutes, followed by a five-minute break.

Similar apps exist for your phone, like [Focus Keeper](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/focus-keeper-time-management/id867374917) or the [Bear Focus Timer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bft-bear-focus-timer/id1328806990), which acts as both a timer and a way to stop you from checking your phone screen. There are also a [plethora](https://memory.ai/timely-blog/anti-distraction-apps) of tools — such as [Dewo](https://memory.ai/dewo) and [Freedom](https://freedom.to/) — that will help you reduce pesky app distractions.

Outsource, Delegate, Just Say No 

Sometimes, the best way to find more time is to get rid of a task altogether. In [Time Smart](https://www.amazon.com/Time-Smart-Reclaim-Your-Happier-ebook/dp/B0842X6L2C), Harvard professor Ashley Whillans advocates for outsourcing tasks that you especially dislike, noting that shelling out a bit on “time-saving services — like shopping, cleaning, and laundry — can reduce time stress and increase happiness.”

Similarly, don’t be afraid to [delegate tasks](https://hbr.org/2012/07/why-arent-you-delegating), even if it means giving up some element of control. There’s no sense in lengthening your workday by insisting on doing things you could be giving to others (as long as they have room on their plate for it).

And if you’re a perfectionist who struggles with delegation, keep in mind how perfectionism could be stealing your time in other ways — for instance, by spending 20 minutes perfecting an email that really could have been written in 10.

Finally, harness the power of saying no. This can be tricky for people pleasers or folks who are eager to show they’re team players. But attending every meeting or taking on too many projects can make you feel like there aren’t enough hours in the day.

When possible (and we know it isn’t always possible, but go with us here), try gently excusing yourself from unnecessary meetings or extra projects.

And hey, if there’s no way you’re getting out of that hefty request that a partner just emailed you, at least you’ve got these other time management tips to help.

Paragon’s mission is to provide legal professionals with meaningful work outside the traditional path, while delivering the highest quality talent and service to our clients. [Visit us to learn more](https://paragonlegal.com/).

# The Biglaw Firm You Count On For Summer Bonuses
## This firm tends to beat the market as far as bonuses are concerned.

Although [Simpson Thacher](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/) was the first to do it this year, which Biglaw firm rewarded its associates with summer bonuses for five years straight (and possibly even longer)?

Hint: We first began covering this firm’s “mid-year bonuses” in 2010, and they’re usually delivered to associates in July (on top of special bonuses and regular bonuses associates typically receive each winter).

# Kamala & Doug: A Love Story

With the selection of California senator Kamala Harris as the Democratic [vice presidential nominee](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/kamala-harris-is-joe-bidens-pick-for-vice-president/), there’s come an intense amount of scrutiny. Sure, [some of it has been downright racist](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/newsweek-says-kamala-harris-essay-not-racist-birtherism-psst-its-totally-racist-birtherism/) (and more is likely on the way). But as almost a salve to that upsetting drivel, there’ve also been articles designed to humanize the candidate (and wash away the lingering doubt from the left about putting[ a former law enforcement agent on the ticket](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/no-real-surprise-minority-voters-prefer-policy-heavy-warren-for-vp-over-an-ex-lawyer-cop-of-color/)). The [latest effort from the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/relationships/doug-emhoff-kamala-harris-husband/2020/08/18/a6c64db6-e15c-11ea-8181-606e603bb1c4_story.html?utm_campaign=wp_post_most&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&wpisrc=nl_most) celebrates the “newlywedism” of Harris and her Biglaw husband, Doug Emhoff.

As a Biglaw partner, a litigator from DLA Piper, we’ve covered [Emhoff](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/doug-emhoff/) quite a bit at Above the Law. He’s currently on[ leave from DLA ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/biglaw-partner-takes-leave-to-join-his-wife-kamala-harris-on-campaign-trail/?rf=1)to hit the campaign trail and now his relationship with the wannabe VP is under a microscope. Personal relationships have always been a part of elections, and Emhoff has been [public in his support of Harris in the past.](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/biglaw-partner-shows-he-knows-how-to-stan/) But it is unique to see such affection on display. Part of that may well be how relatively new their relationship is — their sixth anniversary is this weekend. As Barbara Perry, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center, tells WaPo, “They still seem to radiate newlywedism,” saying that Emhoff and Harris are “really besotted with each other.”

And an active social media presence helps to reify the image that the relationship is a strong one:

With an assist from some Emhoff heroics:

When a protester jumped up onstage and lunged at Harris in 2019, Emhoff hopped into action and helped usher the protester away, another gesture that screamed: I’ve got you. “There was something kind of superhero-ish about it,” says Barbara Perry, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center.

It’s a throughly modern relationship as well, with the family blending different backgrounds:

At their 2014 wedding, Emhoff wore a flower garland around his neck to honor Kamala’s Indian heritage; they smashed a glass per Emhoff’s Jewish tradition. It’s Harris’s first marriage and Emhoff’s second — he has two children from his previous one. According to the Pew Research Center, remarriage is on the rise — as are unions of two people of differing faiths and races.

Harris [has written that](https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a27422434/kamala-harris-stepmom-mothers-day/), “I was already hooked on Doug, but I believe it was Cole and Ella [Emhoff’s children from a previous marriage] who reeled me in.” The kids affectionately call Harris “Momala.” And Harris joins Emhoff’s ex-wife at the kids’ events saying, “We sometimes joke that our modern family is almost a little too functional.”

As Emoff looks to potentially take on a new role as [Second Gentleman, ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/this-biglaw-partner-may-soon-become-the-first-ever-second-gentleman/)he’ll be put into a historic position redefining gender roles and what’s expected from political spouses. But don’t worry too much about the Biglaw partner — Perry calls Emhoff “a bit of a chameleon in a good way.” And that “whatever role he needs to play, he seems to glide easily into it.” Let’s hope we all have the opportunity to watch him grow into that role.

# Shearman & Sterling’s Revamped New York Headquarters Sets New Bar For Legal Workplaces
## Wellness, sustainability and inclusivity take center stage at the global law firm’s new future-facing property model.

The carefully preserved travertine walls that adorn the conference center are likely the only element that has remained the same at [Shearman & Sterling’s](http://bit.ly/3X0mrH2) recently revamped global New York headquarters. In partnership with architecture firm Perkins & Will, the vast reimagining of the global law firm’s office at 599 Lexington has given the office a completely new look and feel. Planned pre-COVID-19 pandemic and beginning in 2020, the transformation has focused on future-proofing the 340,000 square-foot space to support and anticipate the needs of tomorrow’s workforce and clients.



Having been largely remote since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the firm’s personnel returned this year to find their Manhattan headquarters transformed. The previously dim, enclosed offices which came in various sizes determined by seniority have been replaced by glass-fronted, one-size-fits-all suites, rethinking the segregation, exclusivity and hierarchy that were historically commonplace in the legal industry. A simple canteen has become the Sterling Café, complete with bright textural art, cooking stations, salad and breakfast bars, comfortable seating and a cornucopia of fresh and nutritious options – allowing for engaging conversations to take place between the firm’s people and clients. There’s even a wellness complex with an onsite nurse-practitioner, a fitness studio, nap pods and completely touch-free restrooms. In just two years, this nearly 150-year-old law firm has created the office of the future, a concept that’s set to be incorporated into its most recent buildouts across its property portfolio.



“We need spaces that are simultaneously human-centric and built for a more digitized future. Today’s professionals are hyper aware and focused on relevant issues taking place on a global-scale, outside of their jobs,” says Director of Global Real Estate Arsha Cazazian-Clement, who had a large hand in the redesign. “If you’re going to ask people to come into the office, you have to invest in the space and let them know that they’re your greatest asset,” she added. 

The wellbeing and evolving needs of both employees and clients are at the very heart of the new design. Having become the first global law firm to participate in WELL at scale, committing its 22 offices to pursue WELL certification or WELL ratings, Shearman & Sterling is doing more than just paying lip service to lofty aspirations. The human-centric model — which incorporates design-balance, natural patterns, a customizable light and shade system to align with the body’s circadian rhythms, antibacterial surfaces, enhanced air filtration, air ionization technology, filtered water and sit-stand desks for all — is designed to make staff and clients feel both comfortable and cared for in the workplace. The home-away-from-home atmosphere the team has cultivated compliments the firm’s hybrid work policy of three days in the office and two from home, as well as remote working options for two weeks before Thanksgiving and before the upcoming New Year.

“When a workplace is designed properly, it’s an extension of your home,” says Cazazian-Clement. “This new space allows us to forget the politics of the office and really focus on achieving a work-life integrated model.”

New facilities, including the Shearman Room, an 80,000-square-foot state-of-the-art double-level conference center, are set to benefit the local community and allow for client meetings and events to take place. The firm’s community outreach work — which has ranged from providing pro bono support to managing helplines during the pandemic — will be brought right into the building, allowing for more meaningful, constructive partnerships and aiding the firm in its ambition to help revitalize New York. 



“This redesign is a physical manifestation of our values in action,” says Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer Kenneth Johnsen. “We’ve taken this approach to support our clients, our people and the communities we live in.”

Sustainability was also at the forefront of the redesign. What was previously a poorly insulated, energy-guzzling space is now on track for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification. The 599 Lexington space, which has shed five floors is now encased in double-insulated glass and powered by low-voltage recycled ethernet cables. Much of the construction waste and decommissioned furniture has been donated, repurposed or recycled. A light and shade system, which can be incrementally adjusted depending on the weather and time of day, reduces the need for excessive heating and cooling. Meanwhile, sensors — recording everything from temperature to occupancy to air quality — will feed data back to the building’s “brain” to allow for further learning and optimization.

“We wanted the renovation to reflect our investment in our people and community, and we continue to take concrete steps to make a difference,” says Johnsen.  

The new space, which has been internally dubbed “599 Reimagined,” is a continuation of a global investment in the firm’s culture and a commitment to a more connected, inclusive and diverse workforce. There are improved acoustics in the boardroom and a robust art program designed to support emerging and diverse artists around the world. Administrative professionals, who previously worked in a separate office a block away, have been relocated onsite to offices identical to those of attorneys, further driving the message of equity and equality for all. 

“All of our people deserve to feel welcomed and taken care of by the firm,” says Johnsen. 

“The art, lighting, layout and spaces of this rebuild have become the mortar that holds us together, generating excitement to come back to the office and take pride in our firm,” adds Cazazian-Clement.

# Lawyer Sues Ticketmaster Over 'Hamilton' Tickets He Purchased For Wrong Day
## He's young(ish), scrappy, and hungry -- and he's not throwing away his shot.

People are still going crazy over the hit musical “Hamilton,” including Texas attorney [Joshua Davis](https://www.thejdfirm.com/about-us/about-josh-davis), who is not throwing away his shot to see the show on the date he really wanted to see it instead of on the date he accidentally purchased tickets to see it thanks to a technological glitch, so of course he’s suing Ticketmaster over it.

The [Texas Lawyer](https://www.law.com/texaslawyer/2019/01/09/houston-lawyer-stuck-with-hamilton-tickets-for-wrong-day-sues-ticketmaster/) has the details on exactly why Davis is suing the ticket broker that’s being almost as obnoxious as King George III (but trust us — Davis won’t be back):

In [Davis v. Ticketmaster](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5680876-83336887.html), he alleged that he intended to buy three tickets for “Hamilton” in New York on March 14 or 15 for him, his wife and his oldest daughter. The tickets would have been a birthday gift for his daughter, who turns 12 on March 9.

When he clicked the “back” button on his browser, Davis alleged, his ticket purchase changed from a March date to Jan. 17. He thought he had stopped the purchase by leaving the web page, but his credit card was still charged $2,325.20 for the three Jan. 17 tickets.

Davis said he immediately called Ticketmaster to correct his purchase, but “after a prolonged hold, and then speaking to a ‘resolution specialist,’ Ticketmaster refused to make the change or refund the money.”

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Davis claims that the only resolution he was offered was to resell the tickets through Ticketmaster’s platform, with a fee, and for nothing less than the $2,325.20 he paid for them. On that note, he’s suing Ticketmaster for fraudulent inducement and breach of contract, further alleging that the company is violating the Sherman Antitrust Act because it’s cornered the market on ticket sales.

“Thank goodness I have a law license,” Davis said. Alexander Hamilton would be proud of this young(ish), scrappy, and hungry lawyer. We hope his lawsuit stays alive.

# Take This Fit And Shove It: The In-House Counsel Hiring Process
## HR in the in-house world cares about one thing and one thing only: FIT.

I admit it. There are times when I yearn for my Biglaw days. I particularly miss the hiring process. Like all Biglaw firms, we had a top-notch HR department on the payroll, a non-Uggs and yoga pants wearing team (I’m looking at you my current HR business partners, read the freaking dress code, why don’t you? Your department allegedly drafted it).

In anticipation of hiring season, my former Biglaw HR team ran tough mudders and picked bar fights with Chuck Norris and watched the Gerard Butler scene from 300 (you know, the scene) just to make sure they were in the right frame of mind. Careful culling of thousands of résumés of the ivy elite. Rejections for the slightest infraction — the em dash an instant dismissal. Meticulously constructed interview schedules and slick pamphlets on our comp and benefits. Perfectly balanced recruiting lunches of just the right mix of attorneys all pedaling the same, consistent message. The hours are hard, but the pay is unmatched and the opportunities are limitless. Come to the dark side. We have candy.

Because in Biglaw, every single one of us knew that we were only as good as last year’s talent pool, so we had to strive to get the best and brightest. In-house? Not so much.

Now, I’m lucky if I get a 30-minute heads-up before an interview. Maybe the résumé. Maybe not. Sometimes the job description. Sometimes not. Occasionally, the recruiter delivers the interviewee to the correct room. More often than not, I find the applicant wandering the halls in stuffy, formal attire clutching a folder of résumés on vellum and looking desperately lost.

Once in a while, I am offered a set of interview questions. I’ve stopped looking at them since it makes it hard for me to keep a straight face in front of the applicants. One time, a guide suggested that I should gauge the candidate’s pep on a scale of 1 – 5. I was tempted to cross out 5 and write in “Ready to challenge Sandy to a death match for control of those hot, black pants in the end credits of Grease.” Why? Because I’m 100 percent certain HR doesn’t read our notes on whether we think the candidate is qualified, has an actual law degree, or has been flagged as “more likely to aid in a cover-up of an SEC violation than prevent one.” HR doesn’t read. Everybody knows that.

No, no. It’s more than that. HR at my place cares about one thing and one thing only: FIT.

To be fair, past experience isn’t particularly illuminating. Every applicant is completely qualified and equally unqualified for the role. I’m sorry, Biglaw associate, I know you’re aces at running complex closings and drafting debt offering docs, but we don’t do any of that here. What I’m trying to suss out is how you behave at three in the morning when you get the call that the press release going out before market open tomorrow has to be completely rewritten. And an 8-K will need to be filed shortly thereafter. Not that that happens around here either, but I need to know how you handle the crazy. Because there’s a lot of it when you’re in-house and I can’t have you losing your shit and running screaming for the exit.

And since it’s impolite to come right out and ask you how you handle the crazy, a lot of the questions we ask and the answers you give don’t help us either. No really, I’m sure that description of a situation you could have handled better was completely accurate. They never found that first-year associate, did they?

By the way, here’s a hot tip, you Biglaw associate reading this blog and thinking of interviewing for an in-house counsel position: you’re familiar with the classic interview technique where the interviewer asks you to name your biggest weakness, yes? Everybody always says that they take on too much responsibility. That’s a load of crap. And so is your answer to “Why do you want to go in-house?” Honestly, if I hear one more person tell me they’re “tired of being a hired gun at a big firm” and all they’ve ever wanted is to “learn the business as well as the legal side of a company,” I’m going to lose my shit and run screaming for the exit. Try harder. There’s no shame in admitting you’re questing after the mythical “work-life integration” beast.

So apart from a few basic qualifications (do you have a law degree, are you in good standing, have you killed someone in this state in the last five years, etc.), HR has nothing else to hang their hats on other than fit.

In my experience, discussions about fit are endless and inane. These debrief sessions inevitably take place at 11 o’clock on a Monday when I have a metric ton of emails to get through before lunch. Or they’re scheduled during lunch (because HR is a bunch of monsters). HR does all the talking and almost always has a preordained candidate in mind, but they still feel the need to strong arm you into agreeing that on a team like Legal, fit is the most important and sacred thing. Fit is everything. A bad fit can mean the sacrifice of the success of the entire team. Resistance is futile. The longer you hold out, the more HR will drag out words like value proposition and vision and whatever else they have in their bag of tricks to help you see things their way.

Because after all, HR wants a good fit because they don’t want to have to start this process over in six months when when the candidate quits and runs screaming for the exit. It’s a noble aspiration, the shirking of work, but it doesn’t always get you to the right candidate. Sometimes it just gets you to the most likable candidate or in the absence of likable, the least offensive. And hell, we need offensive and defensive linemen on this team.

For what it’s worth, fit is pretty simple for me. Do I think you can do the job without alienating the business in a manner that would cause them to circumnavigate you to get to me? No? Great. You’re a perfect fit.

Do you know when you’re being patently misled by the business and are you gracious about rectifying the situation and guiding it to a satisfactory, risk-mitigating conclusion? Yes? You’re freaking hired.

Now, go get a shovel, there’s a tide coming in and we’ve got to start shoveling.

# Cybersecurity Incident Shuts Down Biglaw Network

On the plus side, the cybersecurity incident at Troutman Pepper does not appear to have compromised any client data. So, in a sense, the system worked.

But as a damage recovery matter, leaving attorneys using personal email accounts and locally saved documents for over a day highlights that for all the talk about protecting data, the unheralded impact of a cyber breach tends to be leaving the firm technologically adrift for extended stretches while tech professionals perform clean up.

Troutman [ed. Note: See above (and below) where we say “Troutman Pepper” explicitly? At this point we are abbreviating the name stylistically, but this does not mean we’re talking about any other firm that might have “Troutman” in its name. Do not worry about those firms… they’re all good on data.] attorneys received this email notification yesterday:

As you might imagine, that “several more hours” timeline proved overly optimistic. The firm blasted another message telling folks to consider working remotely today because the network continues to be down.

People still use Hotmail? Why not turn on the AOL access while you’re at it?

Once this crisis is averted, the firm has a new logistical headache on its hands in making sure all those emails get properly handled under the firm’s document retention policy. Firms need a plan for all the downstream issues a breach and service interruption causes.

But, yeah, at least the incident is not thought to have reached client data.



Good luck to Troutman on cleaning this up and getting back online quickly. And for everyone else out there, maybe today is a good day to think about exactly how your firm would handle a total tech shutdown.

# Top 20 Biglaw Firm Shows Associates Some Holiday Cheer With Raises
## There’s nothing more festive than a salary increase! Congratulations!

The new year has finally arrived, but we’re still hearing about firms that increased associate salaries just before 2023 ended. That’s right: yet another top law firm decided to stuff its associates’ holiday stockings with cash.

To that end, we’ve now confirmed that King & Spalding — a firm that brought in $2,020,354,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 17 in the most recent Am Law 100 — has chosen to use the Cravath scale for its salary increases, meaning these are the salaries associates at the firm will see, effective January 1:

- Class of 2023 – $225,000
- Class of 2022 – $235,000
- Class of 2021 – $260,000
- Class of 2020 – $310,000
- Class of 2019 – $365,000
- Class of 2018 – $390,000
- Class of 2017+ – $420,000
New associate salaries will be reflected in the firm’s internal HR system later this week, on January 4.

As far as bonuses are concerned, associates should expect to hear about them “soon.” According to our sources, K&S offers additional money for every 100 hours billed over the firm’s minimum hours target of 1950. Combined with these new salaries, partner-track associates at the firm will be earning quite the pretty penny.

Congratulations to everyone at King & Spalding!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from the firm.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of compensation updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or email us (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus/Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

The attorney was late to court because he has to drop his daughter off at summer camp. [[Monticello Live](http://www.monticellolive.com/when-your-lawyer-doesnt-show-up-for-your-murder-trial/)]

* Former Subway pitchman Jared Fogle, who was sentenced to nearly 16 years in prison for charges related to child pornography and sex with minors, had his sentence affirmed on appeal by the Seventh Circuit. He claimed that he’d been sentenced inappropriately for his crimes. Poor Jared will remain behind bars to get his footlongs.

# Seyfarth Layoffs: Confusion And Chaos Reign
## Seyfarth says salary increases didn't spark layoffs.

When Seyfarth Shaw shocked the legal world with [deep cuts to its workforce](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/huge-layoff-report-biglaw-firm-lays-off-associates-staff-and-partners/) — upwards of 40 attorneys is the number tipsters consistently pass along — the most shocked of all might have been Seyfarth attorneys themselves. For every tipster passing along the story, there was another long-time source within the firm who hadn’t heard any inkling of layoffs hours after the firm started showing people the door.

One report we received zeroed in on the speculation that Seyfarth’s reticence to increase salaries last year played a role in this week’s announcement. Apparently, the firm had been telling everyone that the increases hadn’t hampered the financial outlook:

Everyone is caught off guard. Despite the Poor e-mail on salaries last year, the whole story had been that we are doing very well. Everyone here is shocked; even high level equity partners were/are surprised.

Another tipster put it more bluntly in the hours after Above the Law posted our initial story and the firm made a statement:

People freaking out.

Indeed. Ultimately, Seyfarth did issue a statement in the form of an email from Seyfarth chair and managing partner [Pete Miller](http://www.seyfarth.com/PeterMiller) circulated internally:

Amid a shifting market for legal services, we have an obligation to continue managing our business as effectively as possible, while being responsive to the needs of our clients and the market at large. We’ve recently completed a careful review of our business to maximize performance and best serve our clients, while continuing to execute our growth plans.

To meet these objectives, we have made the difficult yet necessary decision that some individuals, both lawyers and staff, will be leaving the firm. We are grateful for the contributions of those impacted, appreciate their service and are working to ensure their transitions are as smooth as possible.

Looking ahead, the firm remains strong, focused, and growth-oriented as we approach the midpoint of the year.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
That’s an appropriately optimistic outlook, but the word on the street is that the firm had a lackluster Q1 and decided to jettison a number of folks who — for whatever reason — weren’t billing enough.

Low billers are out. Doesn’t depend on seniority. Cuts across firm.

Often low billing is a symptom of a specific practice group falling on hard times and — coincidentally or not — a couple of practice groups seem disproportionately hit:

Looks like mostly impacted were in corporate and real estate groups.

The firm held a meeting yesterday to discuss the layoffs and from what we’re hearing, they’re doubling down on the message that the remaining associates have nothing to fear but fear itself:

Definitely somber in tone. They wouldn’t give us specific numbers other than to say it affected people across departments. Not at all related to salary increases according to them. They stressed that point. No hours increases or salary/pay reductions.

The salary boost may not have triggered these layoffs, but one has to believe that prior to last summer, a firm like Seyfarth could weather a down quarter without making wholesale cuts. If their finances were really as good as they said they were, a move this bold could have waited at least until after Q2 — or been handled stealthily by a slow trickle throughout the year.

Still, no hours increases or pay reductions suggests the firm isn’t worried about another down quarter pushing them to take further drastic steps.

At least for now.

All of a sudden, [women are] at this intersection between a core part of being a mother—feeding your child—and being a professional. It literally feels like a choice between being a good mom, or good lawyer.

— [Michelle Browning Coughlin](http://www.wyattfirm.com/professionals-detail/michelle-browning-coughlin), founder of [MothersEsquire](https://www.mothersesquire.com/), a group with 3,000 lawyer-moms from across the country, commenting on the fact that breastfeeding accomodations for nursing mothers working as lawyers are [still not up to snuff](https://www.law.com/2018/10/31/for-breast-pumping-lawyer-moms-accommodations-often-fall-short/). MothersEsquire created a breastfeeding accommodations advisory committee in 2017, and the group is currently pushing for better accomodations in courthouses.

I like the fees. Hourly rates are boring.

— [Dan Brockett](http://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/brockett-daniel-l), a senior litigation partner at [Quinn Emanuel](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/quinn-emanuel-urquhart-sullivan-llp/), explaining why he enjoys his [contingency-fee practice](https://bol.bna.com/bored-by-1000-an-hour-pay-a-lawyer-hunts-wall-street-scores/). Brockett’s practice group is the only one at the firm that doesn’t bill by the hour. He’s won 90 percent of his cases, and keeps a framed photo of a $250 million legal fee award hanging over his desk.

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Biglaw Firm Matches Bonuses... After A Little Drama
## Another 11th hour switch.

[UPDATE: Moments after posting this story, we received an update. Follow the whole story but know that the moral of the story is that the firm reversed course after associates voiced concerns.]

It seems as though firms are committed to using the final week of 2022 to announce disappointing bonus news. After [Shearman’s bonus match](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/shearman-bonus-2022/) came attached with a new and previously unannounced hours requirement, another firm has put out a “match” that only applies to associates who exceed the long-standing hours benchmark.

The good news is that Foley Hoag is matching the market scale… for some people. As a reminder, here’s the market bonus scale that we’re talking about.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
2022 $15,000 (prorated based on start date)
2021 $20,000
2020 $30,000
2019 $57,500
2018 $75,000
2017 $90,000
2016 $105,000
2015+ $115,000

Counsel will be getting $125K.

BUT… this only applies to associates and Counsel in good standing who exceed 2000 billable hours this year. That’s a brand new requirement and a requirement that the firm is imposing retroactively. Per a tipster:

Most notable is Foley Hoag has had an 1850 billable target for years and that’s what is told to law students during recruiting. Even throughout this year, the firm acknowledged it was a generally slow year and that the billable target continues to be 1850.

However, as noted in the email memo, the new billable target is 2000 hours, which was announced on Dec 27 and applies retroactively.

For those who met the target that Foley Hoag asked associates to meet until this week, but didn’t meet the unannounced 2000 target, the firm is only issuing 70 percent bonuses. The memo does not do the math — probably because it doesn’t want to put these numbers in writing to be easily pasted into a future document that might alert prospective associates that the compensation figure comes with a heavy caveat — but we’ll do the math for them.

2022 $10,500 (prorated)
2021 $14,000
2020 $21,000
2019 $40,250
2018 $52,500
2017 $63,000
2016 $73,500
2015+ $80,500

Counsel would get $87,500 in this scenario.

While this is better than stripping associates of bonuses altogether based on a last second ploy to foist the partnership’s pain of a bad year on the employees least responsible for the shortfall, it’s still a rotten way to end the year for associates who made their own business decisions this year based on the expectation that billing 1850 would put them in the firm’s good graces. More importantly, it pulls the rug out from under associates who stayed with the firm during a slow year thinking that they’d be getting that much needed student loan repayment balloon check.

So partial congrats, I guess?

The memo is reproduced on the next page.

UPDATE: But THEN, two days after issuing this bonus memo, the firm changed course. In a memo sent out today, the firm notes:

After issuing our memo describing the 2022 bonus policy earlier this week, a number of associates spoke to firm management about a memo issued in connection with the 2021 bonus policy that they believed applied to future years, including 2022. We are persuaded that this is a viable reading of the 2021 memo, and we think it is important to satisfy the good faith expectations of our exceptional associates and counsel, without whom the firm could not have achieved the successes of the past year. Therefore, for 2022, we will be following the 2021 policy by paying the “Cravath” scale to associates and counsel in good standing starting at 1850 billable hours, and by paying 70% of Cravath scale to associates and counsel in good standing with between 1700 and 1849.9 billable hours (and will pay Cravath scale to the class of 2021 regardless of billable hours). Bonuses below 1700 billable hours remain discretionary. Revised memos and additional payments will be issued shortly to impacted associates and counsel. We will revisit this issue for 2023, as it has always been the firm’s intention to address bonuses on a year-to-year basis. We apologize for the confusion, and once again thank everyone for their hard work this year.

Congratulations everyone and good for the firm for making it right!

# When Biglaw Firms 'Needed Bodies,' They Just Offered Partnership Titles To Associates
## What an interesting way to get laterals in the door.

Firms used this as a way to lure those senior associates away from one firm to another. They needed bodies. The only way they could get people to jump ship was to offer partnership on day one.

— Adam Oliver, CEO and co-founder of Firm Prospects, commenting during an interview with [Law360](https://www.law360.com/legalindustry/articles/1479262/more-associates-are-exiting-to-take-partner-job-offers) on Biglaw firms that have offered counsel or partner titles to associates as leverage during the lateral hiring process.

# Morning Docket: 07.16.18
## * A White House spokeswoman claims that Judge Brett Kavanaugh ""had never heard any allegations of sexual misconduct or sexual harassment"" made against Judge Alex Kozinski prior to last year when everyone else found out, and an extern who worked in Kozinski's chambers while Kavanaugh clerked is backing him up. [[Washington Times](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jul/13/kavanaugh-unaware-claims-sexual-harassment-mentor/)] * The art of the deal don't: United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May says that President Trump told her she should sue the European Union instead of negotiating when it comes to Brexit options. There's no real cause of action, so she says that won't be happening -- not like that's something that has ever stopped Trump before. [[Vox](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/7/15/17573274/theresa-may-trump-brexit-sue-eu)] * President Trump leaned heavily on Biglaw partners for his latest nominations to the federal judicary. Perkins Coie, K&L Gates, and Barnes & Thornburg could soon see representation on the Ninth Circuit, the Western District of Washington, the Western District of Pennsylvania, and the Northern District of Indiana. [[The Recorder](https://www.law.com/2018/07/13/trumps-latest-judge-nominees-heavy-on-big-law-include-perkins-coie-partner-for-ninth-circuit/)] * After months of debate, a panel has finally recommended that Florida State rename the law school building via legislative action. It currently recognizes former Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice B.K. Roberts., a "" staunch segregationist"" who once tried to deny a black student's admission to U. Florida's law school.

A former Linklaters partner in Germany has been sentenced to more than three years in prison for the sexual assault of a student that occurred in 2014 at a firm party. According to [LawFuel](http://www.lawfuel.com/blog/sexual_assault-2/), that student was reportedly an intern at the firm.

Thomas Elser, a former tax partner at Linklaters, reportedly came to blows with Laurenz Schmitt, another former partner at the firm, in the aftermath of an office Oktoberfest party. [Legal Cheek](http://www.legalcheek.com/2014/12/two-linklaters-partners-fall-on-swords-after-oktoberfest-punch-up/), which reported on this story when it occurred, noted that Schmitt was attempting to protect the female intern from Elser’s advances. Schmitt punched Elser in the face (a crime for which Schmitt later received a seven-month suspended sentence), and both partners left the firm after the incident following an internal investigation. [Legal Cheek](http://www.legalcheek.com/2014/12/two-linklaters-partners-fall-on-swords-after-oktoberfest-punch-up/) has more on what happened:

[S]ources close to the firm suggest that the two lawyers — both partners in the Munich office — had a disagreement over how much one of them should impinge on the personal body space of a young female student attending the party.

It is understood that Schmitt took the view that Elsner had stepped over that invisible line, so he landed several punches in a bid to get the tax specialist to back off.

Linklaters partners, both current and former, served as witnesses during Elser’s trial. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/international/2018/02/15/former-linklaters-partner-sentenced-to-three-years-in-prison-for-sexual-assault/) has some additional details on the investigation and trial:

“We have always been mindful that there is a young student at the center of this case,” a Linklaters spokesperson said. “That concern has guided our behavior and priorities throughout.”

Linklaters conducted its own internal investigation of the incident, which was led by London-based litigation partner Christa Band and former senior partner Robert Elliott.

A number of current and former Linklaters partners were called as witnesses during the trial including Band, Frankfurt banking partner Carl-Peter Feick, Frankfurt tax partner Jens Blumenberg, Munich tax partner Rainer Stadler and former German private equity head Rainer Traugott, who left the firm for Latham & Watkins in early 2016.

Elser was sentenced to three years and three months in prison.

# Bonus Matching In New York And Silicon Valley!

Last week, Kramer Levin joined the ranks of the Cravath matching firms with a full match for all of its U.S.-based associates in its New York and Silicon Valley offices. We’re sorry we didn’t get this news out to the masses sooner, but we only learned ourselves with a tipster noticing that we had never received word before now.

Is it that these amounts seem so ho-hum that no one is truly jazzed to get them? After the adrenaline rush of the summer salary bump, maybe these amounts feel too de rigueur to associates. Be careful about taking these numbers for granted. Over the life of Above the Law, bonuses have been both much higher and much lower, so don’t fool yourselves into thinking this is a schedule everyone should just expect.

Maybe some good old-fashioned Biglaw passive aggression is what we need around here to remind everyone to let us know the moment their firms announce bonuses. So here we go: It’s okay tipsters, we’re not mad… we’re just disappointed.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)

In any event, Kramer Levin joins the ranks of firms handing out:

2018 $15K prorated
2017 $15K
2016 $25K
2015 $50K
2014 $65K
2013 $80K
2012 $90K
2011 and earlier $100K

While Kramer Levin did get its announcement out in a timely manner, paying out in a timely manner is a different story altogether. The firm’s memo notes that bonuses are “expected” — whatever that means — to be paid on February 15, 2019. That’s a mighty fine set of golden handcuffs you folks got there!

Check out the memo on the next page.

— Legal consultant Kent Zimmermann, commenting on the fact that Biglaw firms planning for a return to a pre-pandemic relative normalcy of in-office work [may not ever see that day come](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/01/07/with-two-years-of-experience-big-law-takes-a-different-approach-to-covid-surge/). Flexible face-time policies have worked for many elite firms for some time, and throughout the coronavirus crisis, remote work has brought “financial fortunes” to Biglaw and has not affected attorney performance.

# Jobs Of The Week: In-House And Boutique Opportunities
## A totally remote in-house job -- the hire can be based anywhere in the United States.

As this tumultuous year draws to a close, [bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/bonuses/) get paid out, and COVID-19 vaccines give hope that the end of the pandemic might soon be in sight, now is a good time to explore new career opportunities. Here are two for your consideration.

First up: an entirely remote in-house opportunity, which we are handling exclusively at Lateral Link. An exciting and dynamic technology company that went public earlier this year is looking for a securities lawyer with at least five years of law firm or in-house experience to handle preparation of the company’s SEC filings. Because the company is in the process of going completely remote, you can sit anywhere in the United States, giving this job incredible flexibility. You must be admitted to a state bar, but which state bar doesn’t matter.

The hours are expected to be extremely reasonable. The company offers excellent benefits — health insurance (75 percent of costs covered), dental insurance, a 401(k) with a generous match, 24/7 mental health counseling, career coaching, and more — and boasts a wonderful, friendly culture. If you’re a securities or capital markets lawyer who has been looking for an in-house opportunity, look no further.

Second, for litigation associates with three to four years of Biglaw experience, a plaintiff-side securities litigation boutique in New York is looking to hire. The work is interesting, dynamic, and fast-paced; you won’t be stuck on these giant Biglaw cases that drag on for five or 10 years. Expect to have stand-up opportunities, such as arguing motions, very soon after arriving. If you’re tired of going to court but never getting to speak, then you might appreciate this post.

This boutique is open to considering associates from a fairly wide range of backgrounds. We’re also working with a number of other litigation boutiques that seek associates with strong academic records from top schools, federal clerkship experience, and a year or two of experience at a top Biglaw firm. Compared to their Biglaw counterparts, boutiques offer smaller (and often more collegial) environments, more responsibility at an earlier stage of your career, and enhanced partnership prospects.

If you might be interested in any of these opportunities, please reach out to me by email: [dlat@laterallink.com](mailto:dlat@laterallink.com). Thanks, and happy holidays!

# A Big Week For Not Knowing The Law
## From Elon Musk's deposition to law school protests, a lot of folks forgot to look up the actual law this week.

And we know exactly [who to blame for breaking these rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/us-news-law-school-rankings-disregard-holdouts/). Elon Musk recently went in for a deposition defended by Quinn Emanuel’s Alex Spiro and [earned a motion for sanctions](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/quinn-emanuel-proposes-using-time-travel-to-avoid-sanctions-motion/). And a [Berkeley Law protest goes viral](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/berkeley-student-dinner-protest/), but all the “free speech” talk misses the mark.

# Another Biglaw Firm Shaves Associate Salaries In What Is An Increasingly Common Move
## More Biglaw salaries take a hit.

Manatt, a Biglaw firm with $313,200,000 in 2018 gross revenue making it 107th in the Am Law 200, finds itself in a similar position as many of its peers. The economic uncertainty surrounding the novel coronavirus sweeping the globe is weighing on firms, and they’re looking for ways to cut costs and preserve cash flow until this whole mess (hopefully) blows over. In Biglaw, one of the go-to methods to trim costs has been to slash salaries, and it looks like Manatt is on board with this approach.

According to tipsters at the firm, Manatt has cut the paychecks of all attorneys by 20 percent — annualized to a 13 percent pay cut. Certainly not as[ severe a pay cut](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/50-percent-pay-cut-schiff-hardin/) as some firms have undertaken, but also [a far cry](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-biglaw-firms-rolling-out-good-news-for-now/?rf=1) from those that have managed to get by without any austerity measures. Hopefully, this will be the only cut the firm needs to make to get through the COVID-19 craziness.

While numerous businesses have invested in contract lifecycle management technology, these systems rarely deliver insights about contracts’ actual contents — let alone analyze what contractual language means in ways that enable smarter, faster decisions. 

To do that, businesses need a CLM system supported by world class analytics.

And while CLM and contract analytics are inherently intertwined — or, in some cases, converging, as companies like DocuSign quickly advance toward full integration — understanding the differences between these solution types is a critical distinction for any business leader. 

In this white paper from our friends at DocuSign, you’ll learn:

- The difference between CLM systems and contract analytics;
- The unique problems that only contract analytics solutions can solve; and
- The key benefits investing in this technology can bring to businesses.

# Resources, Not Brains, Give Biglaw Firms An Edge
## If attorneys at smaller firms were paid the same as Biglaw lawyers, and had the same resources, they would be able to provide similar services.

Many might believe that Biglaw firms are better at serving clients because they have brighter and more talented attorneys.  Indeed, numerous top graduates from good law schools end up at Biglaw shops, [since these firms pay more money than attorneys might receive in other roles](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/law-school-tips/).  And there is some truth to the fact that brighter individuals might make better attorneys, especially with cases that involve complicated legal issues.

However, [as someone who has worked at both big and smaller law firms](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/about-jordan/), I have seen firsthand how resources really distinguish Biglaw shops more than intelligence or talent ever could.  As I have said in a few prior articles, [it is my experience that the success or failure of a case is usually preordained by the facts and law of a given matter](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/10/biglaw-attorneys-tend-to-make-some-pretty-weird-arguments/).  Nevertheless, the resources available at top firms give Biglaw attorneys a better chance at obtaining favorable outcomes for their clients.

One of the biggest resources of a large law firm is a highly-compensated and dedicated workforce.  Since Biglaw attorneys make insane sums of money, they can be expected to work on nights and weekends and log long hours in order to serve their clients.  This is especially important when tight deadlines need to be met or matters must be handled on an exigent basis.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Attorneys who work at smaller firms [are not paid as much](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/extra-money-main-job/), and usually do not work the type of hours that lawyers at Biglaw firms do.  Indeed, attorneys at smaller law firms usually enjoy a more predictable work week [that does not include too much work after hours](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/balance-side-hustles-main-job/).  As a result, they might not have the time to take advantage of certain strategies that require tight deadlines to execute.

In addition, the larger fees charged by Biglaw firms, and the larger budgets for cases, ensure that attorneys at large law firms usually only work on a handful of matters at a time.  Indeed, when I was working in Biglaw, I usually only worked on three or four large cases at once.  However, when I was working at smaller law firms, I was responsible for handling three dozen or more lawsuits at the same time.  When attorneys handle numerous matters, they are usually not able to devote as much attention to each case, and this is another reason why the resources of a Biglaw firm give attorneys at these shops an edge.

Furthermore, Biglaw firms typically have the time and money to think about and plan cases in a way that is not possible at smaller shops.  When I was working in Biglaw, we often had strategy sessions in which we were able to pool our ideas and prepare for each stage of a matter in detail.  This had a positive impact on our cases, since we had more minds thinking about legal issues, and we were able to plan detailed strategies for the matters we handled.

When I was working at smaller law firms, I usually had to handle each case by myself.  Sometimes I received advice from a partner or other attorneys when we socialized around the office, but there were no other lawyers assigned to my cases who could share my workload.  As a result, I was not able to plan each of my cases to the extent possible at larger law firms, and this had an impact on the matters I handled.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

In addition, I did not receive the same type of administrative support at smaller law firms that I had at a Biglaw shop.  When I was working at a large law firm, I had a secretary who could handle administrative tasks, and paralegals who could conduct great legal research.  In fact, the Biglaw shop at which I worked had a library and other resources that were unavailable at other firms.  Furthermore, my Biglaw shop had attorneys in numerous offices who handled a ton of different types of matters, and I could reach out to lawyers in different practice areas if I ever had a question.

When I was working at a smaller shop, my firm only had a few offices, and the one time I asked questions of an attorney in another office, I got a pretty cold response.  In addition, the only resource we had at the smaller firm was access to a legal research platform, and our subscription was limited.  This lack of resources had an impact on my cases and I likely would have been able to do better work if I had the resources of a Biglaw shop.

All told, I am pretty confident that if attorneys at my smaller firm were paid the same as Biglaw lawyers, and had the same resources, they would be able to provide similar services to attorneys in Biglaw.  Of course, there are times when brains and ingenuity can greatly impact a case, and as such, the credentialed attorneys of Biglaw might make the difference in certain scenarios.

However, I have also seen instances in which attorneys at large firms tripped up because they did not know rules about practice that any attorney at a smaller shop would understand because of their experience.  Indeed, the facts and law of a matter limit the extent to which smarts and ingenuity can impact a lawyer’s representation of a client.  In any case, it seems to me that resources, and not brains, give Biglaw firms an edge when representing clients.

# Paul Weiss Goes Dark On Compensation
## Transparency only stands in your way when going after top laterals.

In order to boost efforts to recruit the top lateral partners, Paul Weiss has moved even further away from  modified lockstep partner compensation. They’re [reportedly](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/01/11/paul-weiss-hides-partner-pay-inside-black-box-as-firm-shells-out-for-top-laterals/)  adopting a “black box” system that will obscure partner compensation in order to minimize discontent and tensions within the partnership.

As reported by Law.com:

The adoption of a nontransparent pay system comes as leaders at Paul Weiss seek to reduce tensions among partners as the firm widens the spread of compensation with large investments in recruiting and retaining rainmakers from competitors, the people said. In 2023, Paul Weiss recruited a trio of Kirkland & Ellis transactions partners believed to have scored $20 million in annual pay.

Chair Brad Karp hasn’t responded to these reports, but has [previously said](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/09/29/elite-firms-revisit-comp-formulas-as-star-talent-has-extraordinary-leverage/) the firm will do what it needs to do on partner pay in order to say on top of the heap, “We are not doctrinaire and we have adjusted our system in recent years to deal with changing market realities and to maintain our competitive edge.”

Part of the new plan will be a bigger bonus pool for partners — all the better to nimbly respond to changes in a practice area profitability without changing the partners’ shares within the compensation system. As consultant Kent Zimmermann previously noted, “If you’re producing a certain value for firms consistently and then you have a spike, the bonus allows for additional compensation for that spike.”

Other top firms that have moved to a black box on partner comp include Ropes & Gray, Fried Frank, and Jones Day.

# Managing Stress As A Lawyer
## The 2022 ALM survey reveals alarming statistics on the mental health of lawyers, with 75% admitting that the profession negatively affects their mental health and almost a quarter having contemplated suicide.

It’s no secret that lawyers are stressed out, anxious, and struggling with mental health. In the 2022 [ALM survey](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/05/10/pandemic-anxiety-wanes-but-legal-industrys-mental-health-struggles-persist/) on Mental Health and Substance Abuse, 35% of respondents said they felt depressed, two-thirds reported having anxiety, 64% said their relationships have suffered due to their work, and a whopping 75% admitted that the profession has had a negative impact on their mental health. Nearly a quarter of respondents had contemplated suicide.

In the face of such grim data, it’s easy to feel discouraged. Many of the factors contributing to these challenges can’t be fixed simply through individual behavioral change. But even so, we shouldn’t do nothing. Managing stress as a lawyer is hard, but your personal choices and actions can make a big difference. As the saying goes: the best defense is a good offense.


Taking a realistic approach

You already know the basic steps to help reduce stress: exercise, limit screen time, set boundaries, get good sleep. Sadly, following those methods isn’t always realistic in the workplace, especially for lawyers. Acknowledging the inherent constraints of the profession, here are some realistic suggestions on how to disconnect and manage stress.

Move your body — even a little bit

Maybe you can’t make it to the gym for an hour every day. But did you know that physical movement releases “[hope molecules](https://medium.com/curious/your-body-can-produce-hope-molecules-9b015ce088e1)” directly into the bloodstream, in as little as 13 minutes? According to Kelly McGonigal, PhD, “every time we move our muscles, we give ourselves an intravenous dose of hope.” Other [studies](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-athletes-way/201602/neuroscience-pinpoints-unique-way-exercise-fights-depression#:~:text=The%20UC%20Davis%20researchers%20found,in%20the%20Journal%20of%20Neuroscience.) have shown that physical movement can replenish the neurotransmitters in the brain that, when depleted, are associated with major depressive disorders.

Just [10-13 minutes](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/exercise-endorphin-high-time-how-long-motivation-study-10-minutes-wiggle-a8325661.html) of vigorous exercise can release “happy chemicals” in the brain. Not a fan of intense exercise? Can’t make it to a yoga class? Try [“joyful movement,” ](https://www.bpl.org/blogs/post/beyond-body-positivity-what-is-joyful-movement/#:~:text=Joyful%20movement%20means%20moving%20your,for%20you%20in%20that%20moment.)which is exactly what it sounds like: moving your body just for fun. On a long conference call but not doing much talking? Put the phone on speaker, stand up, and lightly move. You can walk in place, swing your arms around, stretch your neck, etc. Leave a resistance band in your office and use it to stretch between calls. Short walks around the office are a great idea, and don’t even get me started on the mental health benefits of [sunlight](https://www.tricitymed.org/2018/08/5-ways-the-sun-impacts-your-mental-and-physical-health/) (go outside!). 

Regulating the nervous system

The idea that humans can [rewire their ](https://psychcentral.com/anxiety/how-to-train-your-brain-to-alleviate-anxiety#neuroplasticity-and-anxiety)nervous systems isn’t new, but it’s increasingly talked about in wellness circles. Long story short: the brain’s function is to keep us safe, not to keep us [happy](https://medium.com/personal-growth/your-brain-doesnt-want-you-to-be-happy-it-wants-you-to-be-safe-44d3498229ba#:~:text=But%20the%20most%20overlooked%20fact,brains%20are%2040%2C000%20years%20old.). When the body perceives a threat, stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline are released to prepare to “fight or flight.”

The fight or flight response was essential in helping our ancestors evade predators, but it’s [harming](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/understanding-the-stress-response) us in modern life, where the stressors are more like heavy traffic, an important deadline, or too many emails. Research [now shows](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/newsroom/releases/stress) that such long-term activation of the stress system can have a hazardous, even lethal, effect on the body, increasing the risk of obesity, heart disease, and depression. 

While we can’t entirely shut off the body’s stress response (nor would we want to), we can train the brain and body to perceive and respond to “threats” with greater accuracy. A growing number of studies show that [meditation](https://www.apa.org/topics/mindfulness/meditation#:~:text=In%20a%20review%20of%20meditation,reactions%20in%20times%20of%20stress.) and [diaphragmatic breathing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5455070/) (aka “breathwork”) are incredibly effective for helping regulate the nervous system, thereby eliminating feelings of stress. Next time your thoughts begin to race, your temperature rises, and you sense your heart rate increasing, try practicing [box breathing](https://www.webmd.com/balance/what-is-box-breathing). Slow and steady deep breathing communicates to the body and brain that you are safe, helping to eliminate the stress response.

Be intentional with your free time, and use money to buy more of it

It’s a given that lawyers work long hours and have limited free time, so be sure to use the little time you do have to create habits and routines that can boost your mood and actually help you disconnect from stress. Instead of [doom scrolling](https://www.webmd.com/balance/what-is-doomscrolling#:~:text=Doomscrolling%20can%20send%20your%20mind,you%20usually%20enjoy%2C%20research%20suggests.) on Instagram every morning, take that time for yourself to practice gratitude, stretch, or meditate. 

Another thing you can do is use your golden handcuffs — I mean, salary — to expand your free time. Delegate tasks like cleaning and meal prepping by hiring a professional service. Spend the additional free time (and some more of that money) on effective wellness modalities that aren’t typically covered by insurance, like acupuncture. Alternatively, use your purchasing power to test out some gadgets that may boost mental health: shakti mats, LED therapy lights, infrared sauna blankets, or wearable devices like heart rate trackers. If money keeps you attached to an environment you know isn’t the best for your mental health, at least use that money to invest in yourself and stave off burnout.

Practice mindfulness

Often, it is our own racing or negative thoughts that trigger the body’s stress response. Inner self-critique, self-judgment, and worry about the past or future can easily activate fight or flight. Luckily, [mindfulness](https://wellness.ucsb.edu/challenges/happiness-challenge/ucsb-happiness-challenge/happiness-challenge-mindfulness) can help. By using some of the tools mentioned above (like wearables, or breathwork and meditation), lawyers can become more present, and thus more aware of their own internal dialogue, nervous system, and mood.

At the end of the day, stress responses cause [cognitive dysfunction](https://www.cambridgecognition.com/blog/entry/can-stress-at-work-affect-cognitive-performance) and an inability to problem-solve. So, worrying, stressing, and beating ourselves up will never lead to a better outcome in a situation where something can or has already gone awry. In contrast, being intentional with time, regulating the nervous system, and practicing mindfulness are scientifically proven to get you back on track quicker, so you can be more effective at navigating stressful situations and solving all those mounting problems — even the ones you created.

Also, it is important to bear in mind that a proficient recruiter can assist in improving your circumstances if your present firm is causing you stress, anxiety, and depression.

# Morning Docket: 11.02.18
## * Justice Brett Kavanaugh isn't the only one who's relying upon calendars as a defense to sexual misconduct allegations. President Donald Trump says he'll turn over portions of his calendars and journal entries to combat allegations that he forcibly kissed Summer Zervos, a former Apprentice contestant. [[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/10/31/president-trump-disclose-calendars-summer-zervos-defamation-lawsuit/1836278002/)] * Do you support term limits or a mandatory retirement age for Supreme Court justices? If yes, then a majority of Americans agree with you. Fix the Court polled 1,000 people, and 78 percent of them said they'd like to restrict the length of service for SCOTUS justices. [[The Hill](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/414264-majority-of-americans-support-term-limits-for-supreme-court-justices)] * Per a new survey conducted by Diversity Lab and ChIPs called the Inclusion Blueprint, the Biglaw firms with the best policies to build gender equity are Brooks Kushman and Sheppard Mullin. We may have more on this later. [[Big Law Business](https://biglawbusiness.com/new-survey-rates-big-law-policies-to-build-gender-equality/)] * Shocking absolutely no one, now that Cooley Law is magically in ""compliance"" with the American Bar Association's accreditation standards, the school has dropped its lawsuit against the ABA. This is terribly convenient, isn't it? [[ABA Journal](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/now_reportedly_in_compliance_with_admissions_standard_cooley_law_drops_suit)] * Ieshia Champs, the 33-year-old single mother of five children whose [inspirational graduation photos went viral](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/ieshia-champs/) this past spring, recently found out that she passed the Texas bar exam. Congratulations! All of your hard work paid off! [[Fox 10 KSAZ](http://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/us-world-news/pasadena-single-mom-of-5-passes-bar-exam-after-graduating-law-school)]

Listen, you’re a busy lawyer. You don’t have time to keep up with the vastness of the internet. Plus, in case you haven’t noticed, there is an impeachment trial going on. That spectacle, presided over by Chief Justice Roberts, is sucking any spare time you might have. But that doesn’t mean some hilarious ish isn’t going down on the interwebs.

Take, for example, the Twitter feed of George Conway. Conway is notable in Biglaw as a litigator at Wachtell who had some conservative-leaning political aspirations. But, as we all know by now, he is also married to counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway. And he doesn’t like his wife’s boss. Like, not at all. Like he’s started a fund, [The Lincoln Project](https://lincolnproject.us/), to make sure Trump gets defeated in 2020 and his wife is out of a job.

As interesting as that is to watch from afar, Conway has doubled down on the Trump attacks. Just the other day, he went on a Twitter screed slamming the president for some of the most egregious mistakes he’s made while in office. It’s a shade-filled walk down memory lane; actually, it bypasses shade and gets to full-on dunking on the president. Anyway, it would be an entertaining thread regardless of who put it together, but once you know Conway’s personal connection to the president, well *chef’s kiss*.

Enjoy!

# Michael Cohen Put Up His Home As Collateral -- Now What Are The Chances He'll Flip On Trump?
## Is Michael Cohen in a ""fight for his family's financial life""?

Desperate men do desperate things. There’s now hope — at least amongst the segment of Americans opposed to President Trump — that Donald Trump’s fixer Michael Cohen might be a little closer to striking a deal with federal prosecutors and spilling all the tea on the president.

Bloomberg has a [new report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-08/trump-lawyer-cohen-puts-up-family-apartment-against-bank-debts) that reveals, according to public filings, the taxi business owned by Cohen and his wife owes as much as $12.8 million on loans to Sterling Bank. That loan had been secured by taxi medallions, but with the success of Uber and other ride-hailing services, the value of that collateral has dropped 80 percent. Now the Cohens have placed their home as collateral on the debt owed to Sterling Bank:

Cohen and his wife have now pledged their apartment in the Trump Park Avenue — a 10th-floor spread combining three units — as additional collateral to the bank, which valued it at $9 million, according to filings of the April 22 transaction.

The exact details of the transaction are unclear — indeed, in a text to Bloomberg Cohen puffed, “With all due respect, you don’t remotely understand my loan.” But the experts have some insight into what may be going on behind the filings:

“It looks to me like the lender probably said you have to guarantee these existing loans, and by the way you have to pledge your real estate to backstop your guaranty,” said Joshua Stein, a Manhattan real-estate attorney who reviewed the public filings.

The next best question is whether this new information about Cohen’s finances increases the likelihood he will cooperate with the government investigation. Certainly some commentators think this “fight for his family’s financial life” puts a lot more pressure on him:

The reality is fighting the full resources of the federal government in court takes a lot of your own resources.[ Much has been made](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-27/will-cohen-cooperate-tenuous-finances-may-provide-crucial-clues) before about Cohen’s struggling taxi business and the financial strain he appears to be under. Now that we know Cohen doesn’t have the value of his home to leverage in his legal battle, well, the prospect of being a government witness seems a lot better.

# The Biglaw Firms Where Lawyers Did The Most Pro Bono Work (2022)
## Which law firms were the best at giving back?

Law schools across the country are gearing up for early interview week, and many students have their future careers on their minds. With so many things to take into account when considering their livelihoods, how can law students create meaningful distinction between firms? Perhaps they can take a look at the firms’ pro bono numbers.

Over the course of the last year, members of the legal profession sprang into action to deal with crisis after crisis after crisis, offering their services without cost to those in need. From immigration and asylum work thanks to the war in Ukraine to racial justice initiatives to protecting reproductive rights in America’s post-Dobbs legal landscape, lawyers across the country were inspired to do their very best to help those who needed their assistance the very most.

But which law firms were able to contribute the most to society?

The American Lawyer has compiled a ranking of Am Law 200 firms based on their pro bono work in 2022. Half of their scores come from the average number of pro bono hours per lawyer, while the other half represents the percentage of lawyers who performed more than 20 hours of pro bono work.

Here are the top 10 firms for the rocky legal year that was 2022:

- Covington & Burling
- Munger Tolles & Olson
- Jenner & Block
- Orrick
- Arnold & Porter
- WilmerHale
- Patterson Belknap
- Hughes Hubbard
- Dechert
- Hogan Lovells
It should be noted that at [each firm listed](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/07/11/post-pandemic-reset-affects-pro-bono-hours-in-2022/), the average attorney performed 133.7 hours or more of pro bono work last year, and the Am Law 200 as a whole contributed about 5.01 million hours of pro bono work. These numbers are up from 2021, but still lag behind the hellish year that was 2020 (when the Am Law 200 contributed 5.45 million hours of pro bono work), but leaders in the pro bono space know that meaningful pro bono work is still widely available for attorneys. “The need is just so great now,” said Debbie Berman, co-chair of Jenner & Block’s pro bono practice, in an Am Law interview.

Congratulations to the Biglaw firms where attorneys chose compassion during yet another busy year. Your efforts will not be forgotten.

As the legal industry begins to emerge from the pandemic lockdown, millennial lawyers are poised to play a key role in reshaping its future operations.

And in today’s environment of salary wars and ever-growing lawyer demand, law firms must intensify their focus on attracting millennial talent to remain competitive.

To help law firms better understand millennial lawyers and evolving workplace dynamics, we have partnered with our friends at Major, Lindsey & Africa for the third time to dig deep into the cultural changes that this generation has brought to law firms.

We surveyed the Above the Law audience to find out about the priorities and goals of millennial lawyers, as well as generational differences that may exist between this group and its older counterparts.

# Ample Supplies Of Stupidity Still Available
## Don't bother rushing on down to the stupid store. They never run out of stock, and they're open 24/7. Take your time.

We all know that there are lawyers and judges who engage in stupid behavior. Why they risk their licenses, their judicial offices, their professional dreams, mystifies me and always will.

So, here’s a little roundup of some of more recent situations of lawyers acting stupid and paying the price. I’ll get to the bench in a little while.

In Vermont, an attorney was arrested for [brandishing a gun](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/lawyer-angry-about-social-distancing-pulls-gun-on-store-clerk-according-to-police/) in a retail store. She (yes, a she) apparently didn’t like the store’s sign that called for social distancing. I don’t know about you, but I’d comply with the social distancing rather than risk a criminal charge and possible disciplinary action. What’s the big deal about six feet?

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
This one is a variation on the “use a gun, go to prison” slogan so popular for many years. Two attorneys in Texas are accused of a murder for hire. They were willing [to pay the huge sum](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/2-attorneys-arrested-in-alleged-murder-for-hire-plot/) (cue the sarcasm) of $300 for an undercover agent (whoops) to buy a gun to kill the former husband, also a lawyer, of one of the attorneys. Any relation to the gang that couldn’t shoot straight?  Murder for hire is apparently cheap in Texas, at least in this case.

Of course, lawyers are disputatious, that’s how we make our living. A disbarred Florida lawyer has filed a pro se lawsuit, claiming that the Florida governor lacked the authority to order the state’s lockdown. The former attorney [filed a quo warranto lawsuit](https://weartv.com/news/local/banned-lawyer-files-lawsuit-over-florida-governors-lockdown), so it goes directly to Florida’s Supreme Court. Of course, no one knows how many more Floridians would have died without the lockdown. At last count, the death toll there was more than 2,250, but who is counting, beside me?

Then there’s the disbarred Rhode Island lawyer, guilty of theft and two counts of mail fraud, sentenced to the clink for a year and a day for [stealing his dead client’s pension](https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20200529/disbarred-providence-lawyer-sentenced-to-year-and-day-for-stealing-dead-clientrsquos-pension). The theft totaled almost $250,000. The sentence is less than the two years the government sought, but the attorney’s age and susceptibility to COVID-19 cut him some sentencing slack from the court. So, can you now use COVID-19 for a reduced sentence or to even get out of prison early? (See Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen.)

Two New York City attorneys, including one former Biglaw associate, have been charged with throwing a Molotov cocktail into an empty NYPD police cruiser. The Biglaw attorney was furloughed from his job in April. More collateral damage from COVID-19? Will the fallout from the virus ever end? And [what purpose does it serve](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/furloughed-biglaw-associate-charged-in-molotov-cocktail-attack-released-on-250k-bond/) if they lose their licenses to practice? What’s the point? Surely, there are other ways that lawyers can work for social and racial justice.

Of course, this roundup would not be complete without at least one story about inappropriate touching. The Indiana attorney general has had his license lifted for 30 days. Indiana’s Supreme Court determined that he had [groped several women](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/attorney-generals-law-license-suspended-over-groping-incident/?utm_campaign=Above%20the%20Law%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=87777258&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_bL7M0wfxm7gOIt8dsJsK0_EpVkYuzvNFlrGE4Gu8pNUUjPXLRz6wkUhDxFOHv0Ak0yX6KhVzUcDkT-_HZI7x2kHdZ6A&_hsmi=87777258) at a party celebrating the end of the legislative session. I think it was way back in kindergarten that we were taught to keep our hands to ourselves. Remember? Some elementary lessons are better learned than others.

A Biglaw partner represented Chevron in an employment mediation. Opposing counsel claimed that the Biglaw partner had [shaken his butt at counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/butt-shaking-biglaw-partner-out-of-biglaw-but-avoids-sanctions/?utm_campaign=Above%20the%20Law%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=87560629&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_FaDsov3L7YXbdYF_s38bPpavsyzdZlAq3nIWH2Z0pU0qd9qVVPJIA9FORcbJFNvQnEgNv4eMhSpUf7HzuSuq565o5Mw&_hsmi=87560629) at mediation. The court denied plaintiff’s counsel’s motion for sanctions, ruling that the $10,000 request for attorney’s fees was excessive. The court said that the hit to the partner’s reputation and his lost ability to generate business (the incident went viral) were sanctions enough. True. The partner is no longer at the Biglaw firm.  Just as you should keep your hands to yourself, don’t shake your butt at opposing counsel. No ifs, ands, or buts about that. (Sorry, I couldn’t resist.)

Hooray for the New Jersey Supreme Court that [removed a judge](https://njcourts.gov/attorneys/assets/opinions/supreme/d_100_18.pdf) who had asked a sexual assault victim if she had tried to close her legs to prevent the assault. I know. You can read that sentence several times if you like. What term would you use to describe this judge? I can think of several unprintables that don’t belong even on this legal website, but do you think “moron” might work? Apparently, this was not the judge’s first misconduct rodeo.

I wonder if the judge has ever had any women working with him or for him, whether he’s married to a woman, and whether he has any daughters. Unless he was hatched, he surely has or had a mother. This case is a primer of what not to ask, and how not to act, for those interested in ever being appointed to the bench. How hard is it to stifle yourself, even if you are a judge?

And then here in California, vastly different facts but the same result. The Commission on Judicial Performance has [issued an order](https://cjp.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2020/06/Johnson_PR_DO_6-02-20.pdf) removing appellate justice Jeffrey Johnson for 18 acts of prejudicial misconduct comprising more than 40 proven allegations. The Commission found that the justice’s lack of candor aggravated the misconduct. Here’s [the Commission’s opinion](https://cjp.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2020/06/Johnson_DO_Removal_6-2-20.pdf).

After all that has happened in the past eight days, starting with the murder of George Floyd, read the words of the poet Langston Hughes. His poem “Harlem” starts [with a simple question](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46548/harlem): “What happens to a dream deferred?” The poem is very brief. My answer? Deferred dreams cannot be deferred forever.

# Is The Problem With Partnerships The Partnership?

The vast majority of Biglaw firms are structured as limited liability partnerships. Under the LLP structure, firms regularly tally up profit to distribute to their equity partners. A partner’s share of the pie is heavily dependent on the dollars they themselves generated that year and the size of their book of business.

The standard Biglaw model is great for short-term profits but abysmal at facilitating long-term thinking. Say a firm’s IT systems are woefully outdated and need $1 million to bring them up to speed. An associate hoping to spend the next few decades with the firm would want that investment made sooner rather than later. They care about building and maintaining the platform on which they’ll grow their own book of business. But the market pressure to maximize profits per partner might cause many firms to skimp on IT investments in favor of pushing out more cash.

The net result is firms don’t make necessary investments in the future.

 It’s for these reasons, and surely many others, that few areas of the larger business world operate like law firms. One prominent academic, [Jonathan T. Molot of Georgetown Law](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/jonathan-t-molot/), argues law firms ought to follow the lead of the business world and jettison the traditional partnership model.

[According to Molot](https://southerncalifornialawreview.com/2014/11/07/whats-wrong-with-law-firms-a-corporate-finance-solution-to-law-firm-short-termism-article-by-jonathan-t-molot/), one way Biglaw is missing the boat is by not offering its lawyers permanent equity. Instead of simply cashing out a percentage of your personal production and book of business, firms would offer equity in the firm itself — equity that would last even after the attorney was no longer working there.

In almost any other field of business, entrepreneurs who build a valuable company can hold the equity in that company permanently and can profit off that equity in perpetuity. If they can train a team to operate the company entirely without the owner’s presence, the owner can sit back and make profit in their sleep. Alternately, they can capitalize on what they’ve built by selling the business to a third party. The more independently the business operates without the owner, the higher a purchasing multiplier that owner can command. Both of those long-term exit scenarios are deeply appealing, but neither is available to an attorney at most law firms today.

But permanent equity doesn’t just benefit people at the top of the food chain. Employees in the broader business world are routinely awarded equity by their employers in the form of stock and stock options. This can have myriad positive effects on workplace performance and culture. Employees with stock in hand has skin in the game. They’ve been rewarded for their hard work, and now have incentives to grow the company smartly and sustainably to keep that stock value high. Stock options with a vesting period are also a valuable tool for employee retention, as employees who are considering leaving the company knows they’re leaving some portion of what they’ve worked for behind. Everyone has that extra desire to see the company be successful.

Building The Future Today

Historically, the notion of permanent equity in a law firm was impossible under the ethics rules governing fee-sharing and nonattorney ownership of law firms. But those aren’t the problems they used to be. Several jurisdictions, such as Arizona, Florida, and Utah, have either loosened or done away with those ethics rules in recent years, and would make ideal test beds for this kind of new firm structure.

Importing these benefits to a law firm could be revolutionary. Many of the bad incentives of the current model get turned on their head. Whereas our current model pushes senior partners to prefer short-term profits, a law firm offering permanent equity would allow those senior partners to also see the benefits of long-term planning. Attorneys who know they’ll be seeing many years of dividends from the good decisions they make today will be more likely to take a long-term perspective and make needed investments.

Stock and stock options in a law firm could also improve the life of associates. Associate compensation could begin to include either outright equity grants or grants of shares vesting over time. Associates who know they’re literally building equity in a firm are less likely to move laterally in search of a marginally bigger paycheck, while the partners supervising them may be more inclined to treat those associates as the stewards of their long-term investments instead of short-term profit centers. Offering permanent equity blurs the lines between associate and partner — in a good way. It creates both actual and perceived ownership of a company that will improve associate morale as well as retention.

With outmoded ethics rules no longer stopping us, there’s no reason law firms can’t follow the lead of successful nonlegal businesses. It would take a major shift in thinking, but the rest of the business world has operated on this system for years, and lawyers are smart people. We can figure it out.

Taking Stock

Permanent equity isn’t a magical cure-all for the larger problems of Biglaw, and it certainly has its drawbacks and obstacles. The fact so few states would currently permit the structure stands as an impediment to many of the largest firms experimenting with the model. It would also require a tremendous amount of campaigning to secure the buy-in necessary to effect this change under most partnership agreements.

But for those willing to try it, it might provide a tool to steer away from harmful short-term thinking and toward a mindset of investing appropriately in the future of our firms and in our people. If nothing else, it could give us new ways to build our teams, positively impact culture, and reward our people.

So perhaps it’s time to take stock of where your firm is and the possibilities of permanent equity.

The hits keep coming for Biglaw firms thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, and this time, an Am Law 200 firm has found itself battered and bruised.

Ed. note: This article has been updated.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Sources tell us that Ballard Spahr, currently ranked at #91 in the Am Law 100, recently announced firmwide salary adjustments in light of the COVID-19 outbreak. We’ve been told the firm is cutting salaries by 10 to 15 percent for all employees, except for those who make less than $75,000 annually. Specifically, non-partner employees who make between $75,000 and $250,000 will see a 10 percent pay cut, while non-partner employees who make more than $250,000 will see a 15 percent pay cut. Partners are also bearing some of the brunt here, reducing their draws by 25 percent. In perhaps the worst news of all, we’re told that the firm will not be issuing its annual raises for staff in July.

Ballard Spahr Chair Mark Stewart issued this statement on the firm’s behalf:

We made the hard decision to enact painful but necessary cost-cutting measures now in the hopes that it will put the firm on better footing when things improve. The burden will be shared by partners, other lawyers, and staff who earn more than $75,000 a year. We hope to avoid layoffs and to remain as busy as we have been, guiding our clients through this turmoil and back to normalcy as soon as possible.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs/Salary%20Cuts) or text us (646-820-8477).

# How Much Are You Getting Paid Next Year?
## A new survey shows just how much lawyers are making across the country.

It’s nice to say that you’re not in the legal game for the money, but at a certain point that’s all hokum. Even with the best of intentions, the level of student debt foisted upon young lawyers guarantees that unless you’re Little Lord Fauntleroy, Esq., you’ve got to keep one eye on what you’re getting paid just to keep your head above water.

The [2016 Salary Wars](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2016-salary-increase/) made everything just a little bit better for lawyers out there, either by driving up their salaries directly or putting the pressure on the rest of the market to cough up more cash to maintain their access to talent. That said, first-year matches didn’t always translate into full Cravath scale matches up the ladder, with senior associates getting smaller raises on a “scrunched” scale. And because law firms are generally not stupid, the firms offering these skimpier raises usually hid behind a black box compensation structure making it impossible to tell just what’s going on across the industry as a whole.

Thankfully, the good people at Special Counsel have some insights. They’ve just released their [2018 Salary Guide for Legal Professionals](http://www.specialcounsel.com/resources-legal/legal-salary-guide/), the result of over 5,000 survey responses from various law firms in 38 American major cities. The responses were evenly distributed between small (“50 or fewer attorneys”), medium (“51-250 attorneys”) and large firms (“more than 251 attorneys”). I don’t know what happens if you have exactly 251 attorneys, maybe if your firm has exactly 251 attorneys you are completely off the grid! You could, say, [represent the New York Times while simultaneously undermining their reporting](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/david-boies-takes-responsibility-for-enabling-harvey-weinstein/) and no one would even notice.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The legal industry infamously boasts a [bimodal salary distribution curve](https://www.nalp.org/class_of_2014_salary_curve) — the fancy way of saying a lot of lawyers make a lot and a lot more make a little and there’s not too many in-between — making the mean numbers reported here are an imperfect guide. Even breaking down the numbers by size of firm can’t fully capture the phenomenon, with high-end boutiques driving up the small law numbers with salaries that often match (or exceed) Biglaw. Still, it’s a valuable estimate:



Hey, the average has clawed its way into the six-figure range — even for the staff attorneys out there. That’s probably good news if, like me, you’re concerned that law firms are going to transition to a staff attorney heavy model and pull back on the more expensive associate jobs. With clients [refusing to pay for associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/biglaw-is-doomed-if-this-becomes-a-trend/) and technology replacing the most common junior tasks, associates aren’t the investment they once were. Especially with a glut of experienced attorneys laid off in the financial crisis floating like lost souls through the legal landscape. Hire a class of 2007 lawyer at a discount and thrill the client by charging (relative) peanuts for an attorney with that background. At least it’s not terrible money.

Check out the full report from Special Counsel to see their insights on non-attorney positions and legal technology jobs. That’s all part of the overhead, after all.

# Law Firm Merger Set To Create New Am Law 200 Firm That Will Dominate The Southeastern Market
## What exciting news. Congratulations!

The new year is getting off to a great start as far as law firm combinations are concerned. Competition is getting fierce in the Southeast, and there’s no better way to corner the market than to satisfy the urge to merge — and become an Am Law 200 firm in the process.

Alabama-based Maynard Cooper & Gale and Carolinas-based Nexsen Pruet announced today that they’d be merging to create a 550-lawyer firm, effective April 1. The successor firm, Maynard Nexsen, will be one of the largest firms in the Southeastern portion of the country, with lawyers stationed across offices in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, and Tennessee. Not to be forgotten are the firm’s lawyers in California, New York, Washington, D.C., Texas, and Iowa, for a total of 23 offices in all.

According to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/01/05/maynard-and-nexsen-to-merge-creating-550-lawyer-southeast-powerhouse/), the merger between Maynard Cooper and Nexsen Pruet is likely to catapult Maynard Nexsen into the Am Law 200 based on the firm’s financials. (Nexsen Pruet earlier reported that last year, the firm’s revenue was in the $110 million to $115 million range, and the merged firm’s revenue will “probably be about $300 million,” per its managing shareholder.) Here’s what the future leaders of the merged firm said in a press release:

“Maynard Nexsen is a merger of two thriving firms that share the same culture, vision, and commitment to excellence,” said Jeff Grantham, CEO and Managing Shareholder. “With deep relationships and decades of experience in our respective markets, the firms fit together in a way that positions Maynard Nexsen for accelerated growth and collective success. Our newly combined firm will build on our common culture of client-centered service, collaborative teamwork, and entrepreneurial spirit. At over 550 attorneys strong, Maynard Nexsen will elevate our service and value proposition for our clients through greater capabilities, expanded geographical reach, and deeper bench strength that will allow us to handle any matter.”

“This is an incredibly exciting new chapter of growth as we come together as one,” said Leighton Lord, President and Chief Strategy Officer. “Maynard Nexsen is the result of two firms that share a client-centered culture and commitment to continued growth and evolution. Together, we are a powerful national force – broadening our capabilities and services to clients. I am honored to work together with Jeff Grantham and unite our talented teams.”

Congratulations to everyone at Maynard Nexsen on this exciting new venture.

# How To Survive As A Legal Secretary
## This strategy is admittedly a bit hard to implement.

We’ve written in these pages before about the [yawning chasm](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/alt-legal-the-biglaw-caste-system-an-impediment-to-innovation/) between [lawyers and “non-lawyers”](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/the-wall-between-lawyers-and-non/) in Biglaw. It’s an unfortunate and damaging divide that doesn’t do anyone any good.

Many Above the Law readers work in law firms in non-legal or staff capacities, and we greatly appreciate their insights and information. Here’s an interesting email we recently received from one such reader:

I have worked for large law firms since 1994, and I, and a large number of my colleagues, read Above the Law often, if not daily. As you are probably aware, many of the items that interest the legal side of the house also interest the administrative staff, but usually in a very different light.

For instance, the increase to a [$180,000 starting salary for associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) is definitely seen with trepidation by general staff. We know the layoffs (“early retirements”) are coming. We just hope it’s not us.

Your [Best Law Firms to Work For](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/the-best-law-firms-to-work-for-biglaw-quality-of-life-rankings/) piece was interesting in that at least three of the top ten are a nightmare to work for if you’re in the IT or Billing/Finance departments. This is based not just on my personal experience, but on the reported experiences of many of my co-workers.

Reputations of firms from a staff perspective are communicated, verified, and passed on in our little community. We take care of our own, as it appears firms either don’t know and/or don’t care how they’re perceived from our point of view.

This probably comes as no surprise to you, but just thought I would put it out there.

The past few years have been hard on administrative personnel at law firms. Just scroll through our past stories on [staff layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/staff-layoffs/), and you’ll see a slew of reductions in the ranks of secretaries, paralegals, and other staff (including at least [two](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/bad-timing-alert-layoffs-follow-raises/) [reports](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/nationwide-layoff-watch-staff-feeling-the-pinch/) from the post-$180K period). Firms claim that, thanks to advances in technology and in lawyer comfort levels with tech, they simply don’t need as many staffers as they used to.

So how can one survive as, say, a legal secretary? A [fun profile in the Sunday New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/17/nyregion/ida-van-lindt-secretary-for-robert-m-morgenthau-is-still-on-the-case.html) of one high-profile legal secretary provides one possible path:

“I’ll be right with you, Mr. Morgenthau,” Ida Van Lindt said to her boss, Robert M. Morgenthau, the famously longstanding Manhattan district attorney who retired in 2009.

Ms. Van Lindt, 77, worked for him for his entire 35 years as D.A. Before that, she served 17 years for his predecessor Frank S. Hogan, in whose office she began working in the stenography pool in 1956.

She occupied narrow offices outside her bosses’ much larger ones, and still does. She and Mr. Morgenthau left their government jobs in 2009 and moved together to [Wachtell Lipton] on West 52nd Street, where Mr. Morgenthau advises, sits on numerous boards and works on special cases….

She can still order Mr. Morgenthau’s lunch without asking him — his default choice is tuna salad with a lot of vegetables.

She still signs his checks, and since he does not use a computer, she tends his emails, printing them out for him.

“He likes everything on hard copy,” said Ms. Van Lindt, who keeps an electric typewriter on hand, for checks and other odd tasks.

Ida Van Lindt’s secret to job security: find a 96-year-old boss who doesn’t use a computer.

Alas, as younger lawyers [embrace technology](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/how-technology-can-make-you-a-better-lawyer/), this particular path isn’t easy to follow. But Van Lindt’s experience can be translated into advice of broader applicability: make yourself indispensable to your boss, your colleagues, or your organization.

As legendary litigator David Boies memorably [put it](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/12/associate-bonus-watch-big-bucks-at-boies-schiller-plus-an-interview-with-david-boies-himself/2/), law firms are not eleemosynary institutions. They don’t exist to provide charity or to give out jobs to people who otherwise couldn’t find employment.

If you want to survive at a law firm, make it so that the law firm can’t survive without you.

# Another Raise Shy Of The Cravath Scale
## Another firm in the quasi-Cravath raise camp.

The wild frenzy of big players making the move to Cravath has settled a bit, leaving [a bunch of associates out in the cold](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/angry-associates-ask-wheres-my-money/) at some firms you really would have expected to make the move by now.

While we wait on those major players to get their acts sorted out, we’ve started to see some shakeout among some mid-sized players that just aren’t quite Cravath peers… though they want to advertise that they’ve “gone to $180K”

Add to that list Texas-based Thompson & Knight, who announced raises on Friday. From what we’ve been told, here’s the Thompson & Knight story:

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

1st $160 to $180
2nd $170 to $190
3rd $185 to $200
4th $210 to $220
5th $230 to $240
6th $250 to $260
7th $260 to $280
8th $270 to $300

This reminds me of the Barack Ferrazzano raises [we reported on last week](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/well-at-least-first-year-associates-will-be-happy/), with the recruiting-friendly bump to $180K followed by a compression up the scale to leave the senior associates undercompensated relative to their peers at the big firms.

So congratulations to the younger associates. For the older associates… well, maybe you’ll make partner and never have to worry about this again.

UPDATE (6/27/16 1:35 p.m.): Despite raises shy of the full Cravath match, senior associates are generally pleased according to a tipster:

For what its worth, the payraise was very well received despite not exactly matching Cravath – as the partners indicated that bonuses would likely be comparable to last year’s bonuses. Once bonuses are factored in, we expect to be in a slightly better position than some of our peer firms (Haynes Boone, Locke Lord), probably in roughly the same position as other peer firms (Andrews Kurth, Bracewell, V&E, Baker Botts, Jones Day) and likely much better off than certain peer firms (Fulbright, Winstead, Jackson Walker).

So there you go. We’ve touched [on the bonus question](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/answering-your-complaints-about-the-cost-of-living-post/3/) — whether some firms will “match” but reveal disparities over rivals come bonus season — before. Looks like Thompson & Knight is already looking to that option.

Remember, when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Law Firm Partners Made BANK Last Year And There's Nothing Clients Can Do About It
## Partners saw big increases in their rates last year. And got paid for them.

Every few years, law firms announce raises for their associates — usually on the order of about 5 percent — and clients collectively lose their minds. “This better not be passed along to me!” they collectively wail, knowing that it will absolutely be passed along to them and they’re [absolutely going to pay it](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/biglaw-firms-may-be-raising-rates-but-clients-are-still-paying-up/). The raises are [almost always below inflation](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/clients-complaining-law-firm-rates-inflation/) when you take into account the length of time between compensation bumps, but that doesn’t stop the complaints.

Meanwhile, no one ever seems to complain about the partners raising their rates. Maybe clients just value partner work more. Or maybe they can’t look their business relationship in the eye and threaten to yank money the same way they can rail against faceless associates. Either way, partners are costing clients roughly 3 percent more every year.

Except for last year, that is, when partners boosted their billing rate by a whopping 5.4 percent on average. And that’s coming off a 2022 cycle where rates went up 4.5 percent. At least according to the [2024 CounselLink Trends Report](https://x.com/KingOfConvexity/status/1749911432555012124) from — unsurprisingly but I needed a way to get this link in there so just roll with it — [LexisNexis CounselLink](https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/products/counsellink/default.page).

The cost of living over the last two years saw more inflation than normal. And while, at this point, that’s [almost entirely housing and car insurance](https://x.com/talmonsmith/status/1770442652648948209) (with [a bit of market manipulation for good measure](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/major-sugar-producers-sued-over-alleged-us-price-fixing-scheme-2024-03-15/)), the partner rate boom is noticeably out of line with the long-standing trend.



Of course these increases are driven more by Biglaw than anyone else, with the largest firms accounting for a major step up from their smaller peers.

That’s not surprising though. What is a little surprising is the market with the highest median partner rates. Did you think New York? Well, then you don’t understand what the word “surprising” means.



Boston? It’s an important market but that’s an absurd rate hike for one year.

There are a ton of additional observations in the report that you should check out to better understand how to value your practice. Or, if you’re a client, it’s a good rage read while you’re signing checks.

# Biglaw Firm Enacts Voluntary Leave Amid COVID-19 Upheaval
## All in all, a fairly kind austerity measure.

Troutman Sanders is still prepping for its merger with Pepper Hamilton. The combination was originally scheduled to be completed by April 1, but due to the coronavirus, that was postponed to July 1. But even with a merger to prepare for, the pandemic sweeping the globe is continuing to put pressure on businesses — law firms being no exception — that require austerity measures to keep cash flowing.

Tipsters report that austerity has been on the table at the firm, with folks taking leaves of absence. When reached for comment, the firm confirmed that the leaves were voluntary with staffers across all offices asked if they wanted to participate in the program:

Effective May 1, Troutman Sanders will implement a voluntary temporary leave of absence program for professional staff, across all offices. Participating employees will receive a weekly stipend plus paid health insurance premiums. We greatly appreciate the continued resilience and commitment of Troutman Sanders staff to the firm and to our clients during these tumultuous times. The voluntary leaves are expected to be three months, however Troutman Sanders plans to call people back earlier if circumstances allow.

# Porzio Managing Principal Shares His Thoughts On How Law Firms Can Grow During Turbulent Economic Times

Vito Gagliardi, Jr.

The legal profession has been through the wringer over the course of the past year or so. With economic uncertainty in the air and layoffs top of mind for attorneys at larger law firms, some smaller firms are still trying their best to achieve growth, despite these trying times. How can this be done when the odds seem to be against them?

Who better to answer this question than the leader of a notable smaller firm?

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
I recently had the pleasure of chatting with [Vito Gagliardi, Jr.](https://pbnlaw.com/attorneys/gagliardi-jr-vito), the managing principal of [Porzio Bromberg & Newman](https://pbnlaw.com/), an NLJ 500 firm with eight U.S. offices, to get his thoughts on the matter. Here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our lively conversation on how law firms can focus on opportunities for growth and innovation amid a challenging fiscal year.

Staci Zaretsky (SZ): Over the past year or so, the legal profession has experienced some disruption due to the economy. How do you think law firms can continue to grow during times like these?

Vito Gagliardi, Jr. (VGJ): Disruption can be uncomfortable, there’s no doubt. And serious economic disruption — like that accompanying the Great Recession — can cause a lot of pain for the profession (not to mention individuals). But disruption creates opportunity. Law firms can stay healthy not by thinking about growth, but about what new client needs are being created by the disruptive changes in their areas of expertise. Is the government enacting responsive regulations that they need to understand? Does their client base have a need to reduce its legal spend? Considerations like that drove us to create Porzio Life Sciences, which automated compliance-related tasks for pharmaceutical companies and was an engine of our growth for years.

SZ: How has the private equity sale of Porzio Life Sciences, the firm’s legal tech subsidiary — which I believe was a first for a U.S. law firm — helped the firm expand its resources?

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
VGJ: As far as we know, it was indeed the first sale of a law firm subsidiary to a private equity portfolio company. The sale certainly added to the financial resources behind Porzio Compliance Services, our subsidiary dedicated to assisting clients with compliance issues across a variety of industries and helping them decrease their organizations’ risks. We are aggressively expanding our capabilities into areas such as education and cannabis compliance, as well as licensing and distribution in life sciences and other key industries. Equally important, the sale acted as proof of concept, confirming that we can develop tools to automate our clients’ work that are truly valuable to them — and us — and that law firms can successfully act as incubators of innovation. We are energized to continue looking for opportunities to make legal and quasi-legal tasks easier to perform.

SZ: In today’s legal landscape, clients are increasingly seeking innovative and cost-effective solutions. How can firms keep up with evolving client demands and foster innovation within the firm?

VGJ: Necessity is the mother of invention, they say. If you understand that you have to innovate or get left behind, you’re halfway there. There’s nothing to do but get serious about it.

But not all law firms realize that it’s necessary for them to introduce innovations that increase their productivity and reduce their clients’ costs. They will keep doing business the same way and probably get along fine for a number of years to come. Eventually, though, they are going to get passed up, and then it will be too late. We will not be in that position.

SZ: What strategies can firms employ to recruit and retain exceptional legal professionals, and how does this contribute to growth objectives?

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
VGJ: Before a law firm can land talent that is going to help it grow, it has to take a preliminary step: figuring itself out. What are the key qualities of the firm, and why would someone want to work there? If you can’t answer that, no one can. We have a clear identity. We’re a relatively small general practice firm, headquartered in New Jersey, with elite practitioners (including several former judges and prosecutors) and a history of helping clients in highly regulated industries, including pharmaceuticals. We value excellence in our work and take an entrepreneurial approach to the practice of law. Significantly, we adopted the following philosophy over 20 years ago: we are serving the best interests of our clients by serving the best interests of our people.

Firms are on the right track when they can describe themselves with enough specificity that they turn some prospects off. If that’s true, they’ve probably painted an accurate enough picture that others — the right people for them — will be drawn in.

SZ: What advice do you have for an associate who may be considering making a lateral move to a firm like yours?

VGJ: Sleep on it. We don’t want lateral associates who are in a rush to make a move. We want laterals who are acting from a long-term view and see an advantage for themselves in being in a smaller environment, where they will know the names of all their peers and have ample room — if not expectation — to become a leader in their own area. They should also have an appetite for taking some business risk in exchange for potential reward. Every lawyer at our firm benefitted from the sale of Porzio Life Sciences, whether they were directly involved with it or not.

On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, we’d like to thank Vito Gagliardi, Jr. of Porzio Bromberg & Newman for taking the time to help answer some pressing questions on how law firms can continue to grow during tough economic times.

# Top White House Lawyer, Don McGahn, And Reince Priebus Turn To Biglaw Giant As They Lawyer Up
## Is this a bad sign for the administration?

Sometimes it feels like the biggest contribution of the Trump regime is gainful employment for white-collar defense attorneys. It seems everyone associated with Donald Trump and his campaign has a need for their own lawyer. Think about it: Attorney General Jeff Sessions has hired Chuck Cooper of Cooper & Kirk; Trump’s personal attorney Michael Cohen hired McDermott Will & Emery partner Stephen Ryan; Donald Trump Jr. hired criminal defense attorney Alan Futerfas; Mike Pence hired McGuireWoods’s Richard Cullen; Jared Kushner hired WilmerHale’s Jamie Gorelick and Norton Rose Fulbright’s Abbe Lowell; campaign advisor Roger Stone hired Robert Buschel; former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn hired Covington & Burling’s Robert Kelner; Paul Manafort hired WilmerHale’s Reginald Brown and Miller & Chevalier’s Kevin Downing; White House communications director Hope Hicks hired Trout Cacheris & Janis’s Robert Trout — hell, there’s even talk about setting up a [legal defense fund](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/349929-legal-defense-fund-could-be-set-up-for-white-house-staffers-in) for White House staffers.

Everyone — even lawyers — need lawyers, especially when you are working for, or have formerly worked for, a fledgling administration that is under investigation. Now Law360 is [reporting](https://www.law360.com/articles/937051/exclusive-priebus-mcgahn-hire-quinn-emanuel-in-mueller-probe) that White House Counsel Don McGahn and Reince Priebus (who got his JD from the University of Miami) have hired Quinn Emanuel partner [William Burck](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/burck-william/) to advise them on Robert Mueller’s investigation. It is interesting that McGahn, formerly a partner at Jones Day and Patton Boggs, went to Quinn for his lawyering needs.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
It’s been [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/spicer-priebus-hicks-among-six-current-and-former-trump-aides-mueller-has-expressed-interest-in-interviewing-for-russia-probe/2017/09/08/3b32779e-949a-11e7-aace-04b862b2b3f3_story.html?utm_term=.d55677dd70c7) that the investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller is expect to include interviews with both McGahn and Priebus, which likely spurred the move, though the anticipated content of the interviews is different. As Law360 notes, McGahn is facing questions about the firing of James Comey:

McGahn is expected to be asked what he knew about why President Trump fired former [FBI Director James Comey](https://www.law360.com/agencies/federal-bureau-of-investigation) in May, as part of Mueller’s widely reported investigation into whether Trump obstructed justice in firing the official leading an investigation into his campaign, according to the person familiar with the hiring. McGahn is more likely to be interviewed as a witness rather than a party to Trump’s potential obstruction, the person said.

While Priebus will talk about the Trump campaign’s infamous meeting with a Russian lawyer:

Priebus is expected to be questioned about his potential knowledge of Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting at Trump Tower last June with a Russian lawyer.

Trump Jr. confirmed that meeting in July, posting an email exchange that showed him agreeing to meet with a “Russian government attorney” for potentially damaging information about his father’s election rival, Hillary Clinton.

Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Cravath Raises Bonuses -- Clerkship Bonuses, That Is
## Bountiful bonuses at Cravath!

Cravath gets a lot of credit for being a [Biglaw compensation leader](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/cravath-announces-raises-comes-over-the-top-of-milbank-scale-for-some-associates/). But the truth is, when it comes to [clerkship bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/clerkship-bonuses/), they haven’t been at the top of the heap. It’s been litigation boutiques and a select few Biglaw firms that have moved the needle for bonuses for attorneys who have completed one to two years of a federal clerkship into the six-figure range. But that’s all changing.

Eagle-eyed tipsters spotted this on the Cravath[ website](https://www.cravath.com/careers/legal-hiring/life-at-cravath-1/benefits-1.html):

Incoming associates who have completed a qualifying clerkship receive a clerkship bonus of $125,000; those who have completed a clerkship of two years or two one-year clerkships will receive a bonus of $150,000 (in lieu of the $125,000 bonus described above). Incoming associates will receive a year of credit for compensation purposes, up to a maximum of two years, for each year they clerked. Incoming associates who have completed a U.S. Supreme Court clerkship (and at least one other qualifying clerkship) will receive an additional bonus and two years of class credit for all purposes.

That’s a notable bump for attorneys looking to land at Cravath post-clerkship.

So, which other firms are offering six-figure bonuses to former clerks? The elite [Susman Godfrey offers](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/elite-law-firm-will-offer-150000-in-clerkship-bonuses/) $125,000 for one clerkship, and $150k for two. There’s  [California plaintiffs firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/boutique-law-firm-dovel-luner-wows-with-mega-clerkship-bonuses-that-beat-the-market/?rf=1) Dovel & Luner, which offers an impressive $140,000 as a clerkship bonus. And Quinn Emanuel has a clerkship bonus of [$125,000](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/careers/us-compensation-and-benefits/) for folks with only a single year of clerkship experience are eligible for that bonus, with an additional $25,000 if the applicant completes a second qualifying clerkship. Robins Kaplan[ offers $100,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/another-elite-firm-wows-with-six-figure-clerkship-bonuses/?rf=1) bonuses to former federal clerks. Fish & Richardson made headlines with an [impressive number to former clerks](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/april-brings-showers-of-115k-bonuses-for-federal-clerks/) ($115,000), but that only applies to folks with Federal Circuit experience and it requires two years of service as a clerk. [Munger Tolles pays](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/mto-clerkship-bonuses/) a bonus of $80,000 for a single federal clerkship, and $105,000 for those with two federal clerkships under their belt. Hueston Hennigan [pays $125,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/elite-firm-now-offering-125000-clerkship-bonus/) to former clerks. And [Boies Schiller gives](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/leading-biglaw-firm-now-offering-110k-signing-bonus-for-federal-clerks/) a $110,000 signing bonus to federal law clerks.

Despite this good news, most Biglaw clerkship bonuses are still in the $50,000 – $75,000 range. So what are the other firms waiting for? Now that Cravath has upped the ante, will other firms react the way they do with year-end bonuses and match this new rate? We’ll have to wait and see.

# Britney's New Lawyer Calls Out Biglaw Firm In Bid To End Conservatorship

After years locked in a conservatorship, Britney Spears has a new lawyer and an opportunity to get out of the arrangement that see says leaves her with a meager stipend and involuntarily stuck on birth control. Mathew Rosengart, a former Souter clerk from the justice’s days on the New Hampshire bench, represents Britney in the fight now and just filed a 120-page petition to remove her father as sole conservator.

The petition alleges Jamie Spears paid himself $16,000 a month — more than Britney is allowed to make — and took percentages from Britney’s deals as if he were a manager or agent, despite performing neither of these roles.

But mixed in among the series of shocking allegations of financial abuse are some jabs aimed directly at Biglaw.

[From NPR](https://www.npr.org/2021/07/27/1021139922/britney-spears-lawyer-remove-father-conservatorship):

Additionally, Rosengart argues, Mr. Spears has brought in multiple expensive teams for his own legal representation — which Britney Spears has ultimately paid for. One such firm, Holland & Knight, has charged the estate over $1.3 million just from Oct. 2020 to June 2021 to represent Mr. Spears in litigation matters. Until earlier this month, Ms. Spears was only represented by one court-appointed attorney.

Holland & Knight’s involvement has made headlines before. Back in April, the firm went to court to [defend its fees from an objection lodged by Britney’s mother](https://people.com/music/jamie-spears-law-firm-slams-britneys-mom-lynne-after-she-objected-to-their-fees/). We rarely question the propriety of Biglaw fees — indeed, the fee request reflected hourly rates between [$500-$900/hour](https://pagesix.com/2021/03/31/britney-spears-dad-wants-her-to-pay-the-bill-in-their-legal-battle/) which isn’t out of the ordinary — but it certainly feels like overkill to amass over a million in fees while sparring with a court-appointed attorney who, it appears, failed to inform Britney that she even had the right to challenge the conservatorship.

Indeed, most of that fee dump didn’t even involve legal services. According to the conservatorship request, the latest tranche of fees [mostly paid for the Holland & Knight communications team](https://pagesix.com/2021/03/31/britney-spears-dad-wants-her-to-pay-the-bill-in-their-legal-battle/) having to respond to media inquiries over the nature of the conservatorship.

“This Conservatorship has been the subject of increasingly intense media scrutiny both in traditional news media as well as on social media and also documentary films,” Jamie’s court documents read, referencing fans’ #FreeBritney campaign and the New York Times documentary “Framing Britney Spears,” which premiered in February.

“H&K has assisted Mr. Spears in dealing with domestic and global media matters relating to the Conservatorship in order to maintain the privacy of the Conservatee and for the protection of the Estate from inappropriate and/or unwarranted intrusion.”

Apparently, H&K wants us to know that they wouldn’t be spending this much of her money if we’d all stop asking questions about why a 39-year-old woman is barred from [removing her own IUD](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2021-06-25/la-et-ms-britney-spears-conservatorship-iud-planned-parenthood). The irony, of course, is that the communication team charged with putting a happy face on the conservatorship managed to make its own bills a negative headline in the upcoming legal battle. Hopefully it’s not too expensive for them to run damage control on that.

# Associate Layoffs Come To Top 50 Biglaw Firm
## Don't be distracted by Biglaw raises -- layoffs are still a real issue in the industry.

As salary hikes and bonuses are [dominating Biglaw news](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2023-associate-salary-increase/), it’s easy to get the impression all is shiny and bright in Biglaw, and whatever [layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/layoffs/) were reported in the industry are in the past. But the latest news is a stark reminder that not every big firm is throwing money around. The American Lawyer is [reporting](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2023/12/08/layoffs-at-kl-gates-hit-associates-in-chicago-boston-d-c-pittsburgh/) top Biglaw firm K&L Gates is conducting associate layoffs in at least four of the firm’s offices: Chicago, Boston, Washington, and Pittsburgh.

And the thing behind the layoffs? A lack of billable hours.

“The person I talked to was totally blindsided and shocked,” said one legal recruiter, who commented for this story on the condition of anonymity. “It was a lack of work; that was the explanation they got.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The firm’s comment on the headcount decreases indicates the overall health of the firm may not be implicated by the “personnel decisions”:

Every year, K&L Gates manages headcount based on “personnel performance, client demand and related reviews,” which typically result in “personnel decisions,” the firm’s representative said in a statement.

“This year was no exception,” the statement said, which went on to assure the firm’s financial health. “The firm is performing quite well, with year to date revenue up strongly over last year, which was itself a record revenue year for the firm.”

The scope of the layoffs isn’t yet known. But Above the Law wishes everyone who suddenly finds themselves out of work the best of luck.

If your firm or organization is reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through deferrals, open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive.

What’s that over there? Could it be Clifford the Big Red Dog? Nope! It’s Clifford the Big Red Bonus! (Apologies, but things like this happen when you’re working from home and trying to keep a two-year-old entertained.)

Anyway, word on the street is that Magic Circle firm Clifford Chance is handing out bonuses to its U.S. associates, and it’s a match.

Here’s the bonus scale, in case you’ve forgotten what it looks like:

- Class of 2022: $15,000 (pro-rated)
- Class of 2021: $20,000
- Class of 2020: $30,000
- Class of 2019: $57,500
- Class of 2018: $75,000
- Class of 2017: $90,000
- Class of 2016: $105,000
- Class of 2015+: $105,000
Bonus eligibility at the firm is based on overall performance, quality of work, contributions to the firm, teamwork, and pro bono work. Associates can expect these bonuses to drop on January 13, 2023.

Congratulations on your bonuses, Clifford Chance associates!

(Flip to the next page to see the full Clifford Chance memo.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# The Key To Wachtell's Success? How They Pay Their Partners
## Wachtell has a unique philosophy when it comes to money.

The Biglaw firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz has quite the reputation as a [prestigious institution](http://www.vault.com/company-rankings/law/vault-law-100), even if they do things a little differently. Within the world of Biglaw, the firm is relatively young (founded in 1965) and fairly small (260 attorneys), but they’re still regarded as one of the very best law firms — and one with a reputation as the[ hardest firm to get a job at](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~wstarbuc/mob/wachtell.html).

[Big Law Business](https://biglawbusiness.com/ma-power-wachtell-could-be-last-true-law-partnership/) has put together a close look at what makes Wachtell well, Wachtell. Key to the firm’s success has been the influence of name partner, Martin Lipton. Sure, he’s a well-respected legal mind — he’s the legal mind behind using poison pills to stop hostile takeovers — but it’s his management philosophy that gets the most attention in this piece.

The firm is styled as a “true partnership” with no written partnership agreement, but only “a handshake between friends.” (Which, honestly, sounds like something the firm would advise a client against, but that’s neither here nor there.) But what does, at least informally, govern the firm is a list of 35 management principles that Lipton came up with and is displayed in his office. These principles are why the firm doesn’t do any marketing, why expansion of the firm’s headcount has been limited, and why the firm only has a single office.

But the Lipton principle that gets the most credit for making Wachtell so unique is the way it pays its partners. No complex formula where origination credits are battled over between partners, but a lockstep compensation system that is solely tied to seniority:

Perhaps most important is how the firm pays its partners through what’s known as a “lockstep” system. Compensation is tied to firm seniority, rather than hours billed or business brought in.

These principles—and the culture they’ve helped create, where attorneys meet on Tuesdays for lunch to stay close—have been held up by Wachtell partners as “genius,” a playbook worthy of a Harvard Business School case study offering broader lessons for corporate America.

They’ve also helped make Wachtell something of an outlier. It’s the only major law firm where, at least to Lipton’s knowledge, not one partner has joined another law firm for a bigger paycheck.

Senior partners only make about three times what junior partners make, which is a lot more equitable than at some other firms. You might think that’d make younger partners with profitable business books ripe to be picked off by competitor firms, but so far no one has left the partnership over money. And Lipton thinks he knows why:

“Money isn’t the last thing in their lives,” responds Lipton, who believes in the old-school ethos that the law is a profession, not a business, and that money should be viewed as a byproduct of the work, not the chief reason for it.

# Biglaw Firms Put Lateral Hiring On Pause Due To Coronavirus Crisis
## Biglaw puts a pin on associate hiring for the time being.

First came the [Biglaw layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-announces-associate-layoffs-and-other-cost-cutting-measures/), and now come the Biglaw recruitment problems.

Just a few weeks ago, people were pretty confident that the lateral recruitment process would go on as usual, but thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s come to a grinding halt at some Biglaw firms. [Law.com International](https://www.law.com/2020/03/27/slaughters-linklaters-halt-associate-recruitment-amid-pandemic-disruption-292-64265/) has the details:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
A spokesperson at Slaughters said in a statement to Law.com International’s Legal Week: “Given current circumstances, we have paused recruitment processes while ensuring we have the right resources in place to help our clients through the current challenges.”

Meanwhile fellow Magic Circle firm Linklaters is “pausing all bar the most essential recruitment” as a result of the uncertainty caused by the pandemic, a spokesperson confirmed to Legal Week. …

Meanwhile a person with knowledge of the situation said CMS has also halted its associate recruitment program. A person at the firm said the firm is currently progressing “some key hires” but has stopped recruitment that was in the early stages. The person added that there will be a “higher bar” for new approval of hires.

Meanwhile, firms like White & Case and Bird & Bird are both reevaluating their associate hiring amid the uncertainty that’s been caused by the coronavirus outbreak.

Perhaps Biglaw will circle back to associate recruiting in a few months, but for the time being, if you were hoping to leave your firm, you may be waiting for a while.

# Beware CES’s Gallery Of Flops: Some Lessons For Legal Tech

One of the things that happens when you get a media pass to the big consumer electronics trade show, CES, is that you start getting tons of emails from vendors. All hawking their wares and asking you to be sure to come by their booths.

I get so many that it’s hard to keep track. But one stood out: an invitation to the second annual “[Gallery of Flops](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XCmHQD8RAS3fTvOkJDcNbChEUU05idjAM5vSqgLiqTw/edit?usp=sharing).” The email promised to feature some of the most embarrassing product failures over the years.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
It turns out the Gallery was a cleverly conceived marketing effort by [Prelaunch](https://prelaunch.com). Prelaunch offers consulting services to companies — big and small — on how to avoid costly product failures such as the ones in the Gallery. The Gallery itself was nicely done with the actual products displayed, along with a description of what happened with each one.

I ultimately visited with Prelaunch founder[ Narek Vardanyan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/narek-vardanyan/) at the Company booth where the flops are displayed. Vardanyan says the products failed because of insufficient testing of customer interest pre-launch. Or the product was showcased to people pre-launch who really didn’t want it. Or the pre-launch input was sought from prior customers of a company who were not necessarily the customers for the new one. Each flop was a lesson in market misalignment. As it turns out, Vardanyan has some interesting ideas on market research and how to prevent these kinds of flops from occurring.

But first, the flops. Here are some of the biggest ones in Prelaunch’s Gallery:

- The Amazon Fire Phone-Amazon just assumed people would want the phone. They didn’t.
- Microsoft Zune-Microsoft’s answer to the iPod. It was five years too late.
- TwitterPeek-a cell phone that only did one thing: tweet. Want to make a call, use another cell phone.
- Oakley Thump-bulky glasses with low quality headphones at a high price. 
- Sony Google TV Remote-a remote that was hard to use, confusing and didn’t do what it was supposed to do. (Sounds like some legal tech products.)
- Harley Davidson Cologne-cologne from a maker of motorcycles. I don’t need to say anything more.
- Nike Magneto Glasses-glasses that athletes could magnetically clip to their temples. Right, just what Michael Jordan wanted.
- Bic Perfume-was the ink maker talking to Harley Davidson when it came up with this idea?
- Nike Fuel Band-a product a little before its time. It ran out of fuel pretty quick. Nike had problems with the software and didn’t get what people wanted it for.

There are several others in the Gallery. You can access the complete list at this [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XCmHQD8RAS3fTvOkJDcNbChEUU05idjAM5vSqgLiqTw/edit?usp=sharing).

So, how would Prelaunch have prevented these flops? Vardanyan believes flops are caused by not knowing what customers want or need prelaunch. Or because the maker of the product or service really doesn’t understand the customer’s business. They don’t recognize who makes the real purchasing decisions. In short, not knowing your customer.

But Prelaunch’s solution to these problems is unique. Vardanyan says when you pay people to evaluate your product pre-launch, you get biased results. People who are paid tend to favor the product, even if subconsciously. The participants will consciously or subconsciously tell the product maker what they want to hear, says Vardanyan. This approach may also result in input from people who are not the customers who will buy the product. Their opinions really don’t matter very much.

Instead, Prelaunch, through study and research, determines who a customer for a particular product will be. It finds people who would be interested in buying the product being developed. It then asks those potential customers to participate in product evaluations and comment on what they want. Instead of paying for this input, Prelaunch asks the participants to pay Prelaunch a nominal amount. In return, they get a future discount on the product if it is ultimately launched. If it doesn’t, then the participants get their investment back.

Vardanyan believes this “skin in the game” results in genuine, unbiased feedback — feedback from people who are actual potential buyers, not passive survey participants. This methodology not only garners authentic insights but also fosters a sense of ownership and investment among the evaluators, aligning their interests with the success of the product.

Prelaunch also solicits comments and suggestions from the participants during product development. These comments enable the maker to make changes in product design based on real input from customers. Those participating are much more willing to give all sorts of feedback, says Vardanyan. This feedback can prevent an expensive flop down the road.

What Vardanyan says is plausible. We see problems similar to those he identifies in legal tech product development and marketing. Vendors who don’t understand law firm business models like the billable hour. They offer products that take too long to learn to use and wonder why lawyers who bill by the hour won’t take time to learn to use them (hint, that’s non-billable time). Or they offer products that do something but don’t solve any lawyer’s or legal professional’s pain point. They don’t understand the byzantine decision process of law firms, so they tailor their pitch to IT instead of the lawyers who make the final decision.

When they do pre-launch surveys, they often ask a group of legal professionals in their community for input. But these people are the ones with the time to do the surveys. But the real customers are those who don’t have time on their hands to do survey work. And as Vardanyan says, the input of those paid to do the surveys may be biased in any event.

Legal tech vendors would do well to listen to people like Vardanyan and be more thoughtful about product evaluations. No one wants to be in the Prelaunch Gallery.

The holidays are upon us again, and while partners hurry to wind up business and associates wait around for their bonuses, the firms are spreading holiday cheer through creative video cards to spread cheer to clients and colleagues alike.

We have ten nominees for our 11th Annual Holiday Contest, plus one honorable mention which we’ll talk about at the end. Without further ado:

1. [Morse:](https://readymag.com/MBBP/2019Holiday/) The New England firm offers a list of things to do and see with loved ones during the holiday season. From the nominator: “As usual, everyone at the Firm was welcome to contribute to our Ultimate Holiday To-Do List, and we’re always pleased to see the mix of participation – from attorneys to staff to paralegals… Our employees are such great team players who took the time to consider their own holiday traditions and decided to share them with our clients, contacts and friends of the Firm – and now all of you! After all, how many other e-cards are crafted by more than just the Marketing Department?”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
2. [Heyman Enerio Gattuso & Hirzel LLP:](https://hegh.law/2019-card.html) BoHEGHian Rhapsody launches us on a journey that’s really just for that one title joke and it’s not all that imbued with holiday cheer, but the Delaware firm fully commits to the Wayne’s World premise.

3. [Harness Dickey](https://ecards.vividgreetings.com/harness_dickey/v/jGSG9Cqxb-HlQEkpBrSPZg): The patent and IP attorneys of Harness Dickey forge the perfect marriage of holiday spirit and foregrounding the brand with a video card focusing on vintage patented works for the holiday season. The firm’s tagline is “Where IP Comes Alive” and the card plays right into that message.

4. [Bilzin Sumberg](https://www.bilzin.com/general/2019-holiday-card): From the nominator: “Don’t be fooled by the simple, straight forward approach to the eCard (hey, who said lawyers are always long-winded?). Once you click, you will be transported to the wonderful world of wintertime in Miami. A magical place where you can find corporate attorneys riding bicycles around downtown and litigators drinking VitaCoco on the bay, you know typical winter activities. While they are at it, attorneys thank clients and friends for the opportunity to collaborate and wish them a Happy Holidays. Enjoy!”

5. [McBrayer & MML&K Government Solutions](http://www.mcbrayerseasonsgreetings.com/): “We make our e-cards totally in-house, and it’s an opportunity for us to show some of our personality… our yearly holiday card is a chance to let down our hair a bit.” Indeed. This delightful take on the 12 Days of Christmas manages to be funny, warm, and inform the viewer about the firm all in one concise song.

6. [Troutman Sanders](https://holidaycardtroutmansanders.com/charity/): “As a law firm, we understand that a lot of life is spent on the go. Sometimes it is not so much about cooking the perfect turkey dinner, but about who you are spending your time with. We hope that however you spend your holiday, it is joyful, peaceful and inspiring.” Troutman may be hoping to [spend the holiday with Pepper Hamilton](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/pepper-hamilton-and-troutman-sanders-planning-to-merge/).

7. [Goodman Allen Donnelly](https://www.webbycards.com/2019/goodman/holiday-ecard.html): This card features original artwork by one of the firm’s founding partners, [Michael Goodman](http://www.goodmanallen.com/people/attorney-bio/michael-l-goodman) and it’s clear he’s a very talented cartoonist (he’s been featured as an Editorial Cartoonist in the Richmond Times-Dispatch Sunday Business Section and his work has been nationally syndicated). This year the firm partnered with the talented animators at [Webby Cards](https://www.webbycards.com/ecards/pc/home.asp) to bring Goodman’s artwork to life and tell the tale of Goodman’s 2019. “Santa has more than enough to fit under your tree, but as a Quid Pro Quo, he wants extra cookies and spiked egg nog,” Goodman explains.

[Wolf Greenfield](https://info.wolfgreenfield.com/happy-holidays-from-wolf-greenfield-2019): The champions of the [2017](https://info.wolfgreenfield.com/happy-holidays-from-wolf-greenfield) and [2018](https://info.wolfgreenfield.com/happy-holidays-from-wolf-greenfield-2?utm_campaign=2018%20Holiday%20Card&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_bl1kGuT2vW7pltZvViPDYQ11aXrXRljsmBDickMuAFpBeRWRcNiTIFdgqPl2Wt5WUsEPQ) ATL Holiday Card Contests return with another stop motion tale. As they put it, “At this time of year, it’s easy to get trapped in the hustle and bustle of the season without stopping to smell the freshly baked cookies—gingerbread is our favorite. Whether people are escaping on vacation or staying local, in snow or in sun, this year we hope they can kick back, relax and soak in the holiday spirit. After all, don’t we all deserve that?” There’s also a [behind-the-scenes look](https://info.wolfgreenfield.com/behind-the-scenes-of-our-2019-holiday-card) at the stop motion animation process containing photos and a time lapse of the work in progress.

9. [Larson • King](https://www.larsonking.com/lk-holiday-card/): Another take on the 12 days of Christmas song, but this time changed to incorporate well-known holiday characters and their legal problems. The firm’s made the ATL finalists list before, but with a recent brand refresh, they’ve switched up their usual illustration style and animation this year.

10. [Latham & Watkins](https://www.lw.com/content/Holiday2019/Holiday2019.html): This is the Hallmark Channel movie entry of the year. If you wanted to know if lawyers have heart, here are profiles of Latham attorneys being good people and earning the love of friends and family this season.

Honorable Mention:

[Davis Wright Tremaine](https://holiday.dwt.com/): We wanted to recognize this one, a word-scramble game thematically tied to a contribution to Toys for Tots. It’s not exactly a holiday card as much as a holiday activity but it deserved mention for the work that went into it and the good cause.

Now it’s time for our audience to vote. We’ll keep the polls open through WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 1, 2020, at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time). This gives you ample time to campaign for your pick over the holidays (but please, please, please don’t cheat).

Thanks to all the entrants and nominators, good luck to the finalists, and happy holidays to everyone! Above the Law is happy to celebrate holiday cheer with you!

# Ex-Skadden Counsel Has Honor Of Being First Prominent Democrat Charged In Mueller Probe
## It's not a surprising indictment, but still a juicy one.

Greg Craig

We knew something like this was coming. Way back in April of last year when former Obama White House Counsel [Greg Craig was unceremoniously pulled from the Skadden’s website](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/amid-mueller-probe-prominent-skadden-counsel-disappears-from-website/) and several hours later it was confirmed he’d “retired” from his role as of counsel at the Biglaw giant, you knew that was only the start of his woes. Yesterday, federal prosecutors charged Craig with making false statements to the Department of Justice in connection with his work at Skadden.

As you may recall, Paul Manafort engaged Skadden Arps on behalf of the Ukrainian government, and the firm wrote a report justifying the prosecution of former Russian-aligned Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych’s political rivals. The report has been [a featured part](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/the-biglaw-bill-taking-center-stage-at-the-second-manafort-trial/) of the Mueller investigation’s case against Manafort. And former Skadden associate, Alex van der Zwaan, already [pleaded guilty](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/former-skadden-associate-who-pleaded-guilty-in-mueller-probe-begs-for-no-jail-time/) to lying to investigators in the Russia probe about his communications with former Trump campaign aide Rick Gates.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/04/11/greg-craig-former-skadden-partner-charged-with-lying-about-ukraine-work/) Law.com, Craig’s arraignment is scheduled for this afternoon, and his case has been assigned to Judge Amy Berman Jackson who has handled several cases stemming from the Mueller investigation. Mueller had [referred the case to the Southern District of New York](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/skadden-counsel-tagged-in-mueller-probe/), but that office has not brought these charges. Federal prosecutors in Washington filed them on the recommendation of the National Security Division of the DOJ.

Skadden has already agreed to pay $4.6 million to resolve claims the firm violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act for not reporting this work to the DOJ. But that hasn’t altered Craig’s assertion he is not guilty:

“This indictment accuses Mr. Craig of misleading the FARA Unit of the Department of Justice in order to avoid registration,” his defense lawyers William Taylor III and William Murphy of Zuckerman Spaeder said in a statement Wednesday. “It is itself unfair and misleading. It ignores uncontroverted evidence to the contrary. Mr. Craig had no interest in misleading the FARA Unit because he had not done anything that required his registration. That is what this trial will be all about.”

You can read the full indictment below.

# Norton Rose Fulbright Giving Partial Backpay To Associates, Might Make More Payments If Associates Keep On Billing
## Don't stop billing -- not if you want your whole salary.

[Back in April,](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/norton-rose-fulbright-lays-off-associates-cuts-salaries-amid-covid-19-upheaval/?rf=1) megafirm Norton Rose Fulbright made a series of COVID-19 related cuts. And more than just the salary cuts that swept the industry in the early days of the pandemic, they also laid off associates. And those that survived saw a 15 percent salary cut for all those making over $50,000. [Then in September](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/billion-dollar-biglaw-firm-backs-off-of-salary-cuts/?rf=1), they reversed those cuts, returning salaries to full, pre-pandemic levels.

Now in a firmwide email the management committee revealed the firm is giving folks some backpay — approximately 55 percent of any reduction. Then they dropped this line, “Further, the Firm is considering an additional payment to be made during the first part of the New Year. This additional payment, however, will be dependent on the firm closing strong at year end.”

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
While the firm’s intention may have been benevolent, to some tipsters it reads as an “absurd” threat. As one insider wryly noted, “Nice to see the firm using our own salary as a carrot leading in to the New Year.”

Here’s the full email from the firm:



If your firm or organization is slashing salaries or restoring previous cuts, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs/Salary%20Cuts) or text us (646-820-8477).

# Am Law 100 Firm Slashes Salaries, Furloughs Staff Lawyers And Staff

With another day comes another law firm that’s put austerity measures in place to carry it through the economic upheaval that’s been brought about by the coronavirus crisis. From salary cuts to furloughs to layoffs, we’ve seen it all as the largest law firms in the country try to steer clear of being put out of business. Even firms that are very well ranked among the members of the Am Law 100 are doing what they can to cut costs.

We’ve learned that Katten Muchin — a firm that recently saw a 5.5 percent increase in revenue to $669,709,000 and a 10 percent increase in profits per partner to more than $1.8 million — will be putting its employees’ [salaries on the chopping block](https://www.law.com/2020/04/29/katten-pairs-pay-cuts-furloughs-with-assistance-fund-for-idled-lawyers-and-staff/) while furloughing others.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As far as partners are concerned, Katten will be suspending their monthly draws for two months, meaning that equity partners won’t receive payouts for April or May. Salaries for both attorneys and business professionals at the firm will be cut by up to 20 percent for those who make over $100,000, but no one will have their pay reduced below that level. Those who already earn less than $100,000 will not have their salaries cut. Starting on May 1, the firm will also be furloughing some business professionals and staff attorneys, but the total number of those affected was not clear. The firm’s summer associate program will likely be pushed back to start in July, but an official decision has not yet been made.

“Given the continuing public health and economic crises, we, like many, had to take a careful look at everything and make tough but necessary decisions in order to maintain the strength of our firm,” Katten chairman Roger Furey said in a statement. “We are mindful of the enormous challenges that individuals and families are facing. Doing our best to take care of our people through these trying times is a priority.”

On the bright side, Katten has created a Supplemental Unemployment Benefits (SUB) Fund, which will increase furloughed employees’ pay over what they’ll receive from governmental assistance funds that will bring them back to around 80 to 100 percent of their pre-furlough pay levels.

Best of luck to everyone at the firm as they navigate the pandemic.

# Biglaw's Exploding Offers Are Adding Unnecessary Stress To Law Students' Lives
## Maybe precruiting isn't all that it's cracked up to be.

Early recruiting, or precruiting, is trending when it comes to the entry-level recruiting scene for Biglaw firms, with 66% of the largest of law firms and 34% of law firms overall attempting to fill their summer associate classes before formal OCI programs have even started. Many firms are [finding great success with precruiting](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/say-farewell-to-oci-hell-biglaw-firms-are-now-relying-on-precruiting-to-fill-their-summer-associate-classes/), with 23.3% of all offers to second-year students (3,145 offers, to be exact) coming as a result of early recruiting as firms try to beat the competition to the punch.

But what happens when Biglaw firms step away from the formal rules that go hand in hand with the OCI process?

Exploding offers are apparently the name of the game, and law schools are not happy about the added stress this may add to their students’ lives.

(For what it’s worth, if you’re wondering who to blame for exploding offers, it would be fair to point a finger at NALP. The organization approved of exploding offers back in 2018 with its [new set of “rules”](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/new-nalp-rules-for-law-school-recruitment-seem-to-promote-organized-chaos/) — if they can really be called that — for entry-level recruiting.)

The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/09/15/with-exploding-offers-and-advancing-elitism-early-law-school-recruiting-gets-mixed-reception/) has additional details:

The stress early recruiting can cause students as they near the end of their first year can be exacerbated by “exploding offers,” when firms tell students they have to make a decision before the OCI process begins or else their offer will “explode.” Gray said it’s a phenomenon she’s hears about from members “quite frequently.”

“It’s a very unfortunate situation,” [NALP executive director Nikia] Gray said. “It’s a pressure tactic. [The students] don’t know if they’ll receive another better offer.”

To that end, some law schools have openly commented on their disapproval of the precruiting movement. For example, Dean Erwin Chemerinsky of Berkeley Law told [Am Law](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/09/15/with-exploding-offers-and-advancing-elitism-early-law-school-recruiting-gets-mixed-reception/) that the school “doesn’t support precruiting.” Here’s more:

The law school’s online policy called recruiting that takes place before the school’s Early Interview Week (EIW) an “unfair process that disadvantages qualified candidates who happen to be less obviously credentialed or as well-networked as their peers.” But in response to “market realities,” the law school is no longer prohibiting employers registered for EIW from interviewing rising second-year law students before EIW.

So, how can law student better manage what may become the new normal when it comes to Biglaw’s entry-level recruiting? For what it’s worth, Gray says students “have more power in the process than they realize.”

“They are the commodity that law firms are trying to get and they have power in this process,” Gray said. “They have the ability to negotiate an exploding offer and say, ‘I appreciate the offer, but I want to do OCI and see what my options are.’ They may even decide they want to go with another firm that doesn’t put pressure on them.”

Career services offices are more than willing to assist with any questions that students may have when it comes to the job hunt (including how to deal with an exploding offer). Best of luck out there, law students, because it seems like you may need it this year.

“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”
– [Third law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws) of science fiction writer [Arthur C. Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke).

Next week, I will attend [CES](https://www.ces.tech/about-ces.aspx?https://registration.experientevent.com/ShowCES241/&gclid=CjwKCAiAnL-sBhBnEiwAJRGiggq0o_hX7_vzAbF4P1qD-DxU3aT9nL_vVa1XO3vHJW5T-0Hbv0OmihoCnuAQAvD_BwE), the world’s preeminent consumer electronics trade show, as a media representative. It’s scheduled to kick off on January 9 in Las Vegas, appropriately enough. (CES used to be called the Consumer Electronics Show. But that’s a moniker that makes the show’s sponsor, the [Consumer Technology Association](https://www.cta.tech), today shudder). This year marks the 100th anniversary of the founding of the CTA, a testament to how far we’ve come in consumer electronics in particular and tech in general.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

The event is a melting pot of innovation and technology, with over 3,500 exhibitors, including over 1,000 startups. Exhibitors and attendees span almost every industry. Healthcare, transportation, AI, beauty tech, smart home solutions, sustainability, and gaming, among other things, will be out in force. The multiple expo halls are filled to the brim with new gadgets and prototypes.

Last year’s show drew over 100,000 people. It’s a massive conga line stretching from the Convention Center at the north end of the Strip to Mandalay Bay at the south end. It’s part computer science, part giant party, part marketing and part, well, schmaltz.

Why CES Matters to Legal Tech 

I am one of the few legal tech journalists who regularly attend CES. So what’s one poor little lawyer turned legal tech blogger doing here amidst all the glitz and glamour? Three reasons.

1. The Future of Consumer Tech Products

CES is all about the future. What is possible. What is coming for consumer products. CES has historically introduced tech that, in different forms, later finds its way into the mainstream and for that matter, legal.

Learning about these products helps me anticipate how emerging tech could change the legal landscape. These changes are particularly important with the development of Gen AI.

Gen AI will change legal perhaps more than Google search, iPhones and the internet combined transformed our ability to access and use information. And Gen AI will be at the forefront in this year’s show.

Yes, the legal industry is behind consumer tech when it comes to adoption. But it’s good to get some notion of what is possible — now and in the future. (As far back as 2020, CES speakers were saying that AI would permeate every facet of our commerce and culture. Who would have predicted how right they would be?)

2. Identifying Trends and Their Legal Implications

Last year, CES highlighted trends like decentralization — removing the middle person from transactions — and AI’s growing influence. These trends have profound implications for the legal profession, from how we handle financial transactions to the evolution of e-discovery. It’s not an overstatement to say that understanding these trends is crucial for anticipating future challenges and opportunities in legal.

Oh, and by the way, unlike law firms, the Big 4 accounting firms attend CES as both presenters and exhibitors. (Deloitte gives guided tours to the exhibit floor). One has to ask: What do they see that legal doesn’t?

3. The Energy of Innovation

CES is the ultimate entrepreneurial spirit and innovation hub. It’s about exploring the possible. It’s the energy and attitude of the entrepreneurs there. It’s the feeling that they are looking for solutions and new things instead of focusing on what can’t be done. To quote the science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke’s second law, “The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.” 

That mindset is in stark contrast to the cautious and risk-averse legal sector. We want perfection first time all the time. We talk too much about why some technology just won’t work for legal. That it’s unreliable, and the coup de grace: It creates potential ethical issues. We don’t see the magic.

There’s another reason exposure to fresh ideas is critical. One of my clients used to say, let’s be careful. We don’t want to find ourselves in the closet talking to ourselves too much. As a reporter and observer of what happens in the legal world, it’s easy to fall victim to the closet phenomenon. Most of us go to the same shows, see the same people, say the same things. It’s nice to get out into a different world. It helps see things in legal for what they are. Or what they are not.

Exposure to the entrepreneurial spirit that permeates CES helps me maintain a fresh and open-minded approach to technology in law. To focus on possibilities rather than limitations. 

The Magic of CES 2024: What to Expect

This year, CES will focus on four key themes. The themes are access to technology, partnership with the UN’s Human Security initiative, and the centennial celebration. And, of course, more than anything else, Gen AI. CES promises each theme will offer a unique lens through which we can view technology’s current and future state. 

And while last year’s show took place shortly after the introduction of ChatGPT and Gen AI was not front and center, this year’s will be all about Gen AI. It will be all about what it can do. Gen AI will appear in cars, scooters, headphones, speakers, and cameras, among other things introduced at CES. It’s rumored that Intel, Qualcomm, and AMD will announce chips that will work to process AI on devices that carry them. This will reduce the need to upload information to the cloud and speed up response time exponentially.

And always a big draw is [Eureka Park](https://www.ces.tech/topics/topics/startups.aspx), which showcases the over 1,000 startups. Eureka Park is housed in the basement of the Venetian Expo convention center. Here, crammed in aisle after aisle of exhibit space, are startups hoping to make the next big thing. Here is where you find people pursuing their passions and dreams. A place that offers a glimpse into the future through the eyes of hopeful entrepreneurs. 

CES is not just about technology; it’s a blend of computer science, marketing, and revelry. The event turns Las Vegas into a giant, interconnected stage for innovation. It makes me think of Arthur Clarke’s first law: “When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.”

As I prepare to attend CES for the sixth time, I hope to bring you some insights and stories. Whether exploring the latest in Gen AI, delving into the potential of the Metaverse, or simply soaking in the entrepreneurial energy, CES 2024 is always an enlightening experience. 

Stay tuned.

# Biglaw Still Isn’t Getting It

For all the chaos of these times, at least some things remain comfortably predictable. The business world has fundamentally changed in the past three months, yet, same as always, the legal industry drags its feet and pretends things will soon go back to how they used to be.

Home Office Is The New Office

Consider the new white-collar normal, working from home. What started purely as a safety measure is turning into a permanent change in how people do business. Tech industry leaders like Facebook and Twitter have announced that many of their employees may work remotely [permanently](https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-many-remote-work-is-becoming-permanent-in-wake-of-coronavirus-11590100453), even after the COVID-19 crisis has subsided. Other industries are following suit. A recent Gartner survey found that nearly 75% of CFOs surveyed are planning to permanently shift at least 5% of their workforce to remote work once the virus is under control. About 50% plan to shift 10% or more. The promise of widespread telework that we’ve been talking about since the 1990s is finally arriving.

The justifications for a robust work-from-home movement are the same as they ever were. Studies have long shown that employee productivity doesn’t take the hit that many law firm partners might expect. In many cases, productivity actually [increases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiUyyZPIHyY) without the distractions, busywork, and commute times that are part and parcel of the in-office experience. Remote working options increase worker satisfaction and increase productivity. What’s not to love?

And that’s just the employee-facing side of things. From management’s perspective, the balance sheet benefits can be huge. Businesses around the globe are already shrinking their physical footprint. It’s a lot cheaper to soak up the one-time cost of a laptop, phone, and desk for at-home workers than it is to pay rent to house them every single month. Remote work also greatly increases the candidate pool for new positions, which could be great news for people living in economically struggling regions with low costs of living. The remote-working revolution may be as much a boon for worker happiness and mobility as it is for corporate bottom lines.

Yet many law firm leaders I’ve spoken to are itching to get everyone back in the office as soon as possible. This astounds me. Lawyers are uniquely suited to work from anywhere. We’re not manufacturing widgets in a shop here. We sell advice, Word docs, and PDFs for a living. We can generate those as easily in a home office as we can in a downtown high-rise. When we have to meet in person or go to court, we still can — but that doesn’t require a daily in-office presence.

Let’s go even more fundamental — how is the business world handling its cashflow? Many, if not most, companies are working hard to increase collections, decrease delinquency, and build a war chest to survive the coming months. Even as lending rates remain at new historic lows, cash will likely remain king until the market’s volatility calms. There are serious [discussions to be had](https://www.ibmadison.com/Blogger/ExitStageRight/April-2020/Business-in-the-COVID-19-world-Where-cash-is-king-and-strategy-is-queen/) about the ideal trade-offs between reinvestment in the company and maintaining high liquidity, but the discussions are at least occurring.

At least they’re occurring in the normal business world, where management’s interests in keeping a company strong are usually weighted more heavily than ownership’s interests in taking cash out of the till. In small businesses where ownership and management are tightly held in just a few hands, ownership generally needs to keep their chief asset, the company, humming. If they don’t, they risk killing the golden goose. In large public businesses, ownership is often dispersed among a large class of shareholders. At firms around the globe, some shareholders do not care one whit about the health of the company over their own returns. Instead, the management team entrusted with keeping the company going will hopefully strike the right balance between reinvestment in the company and payout to ownership.

Many law firms, on the other hand, exist in a strange middle space. Law firm equity partners have the same motivations as everyone to make as much money as possible. But equity partners are also typically in demand and have mobile books of business, which means they may not worry as much about keeping the lights on once they’ve gotten their payout. They also may have the votes and political clout to prioritize short-term payouts over long-term reinvestment that may not benefit them directly.

We see these competing incentives reflected in the [typical law firm fiscal model](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/06/23/if-cash-is-king-do-law-firms-need-to-change-their-business-model-to-keep-up/?kw=If%20Cash%20Is%20King,%20Do%20Law%20Firms%20Need%20to%20Change%20Their%20Business%20Model%20to%20Keep%20Up?&utm_source=email&utm_medium=enl&utm_campaign=dailypaid&utm_content=20200623&utm_term=tal): strip the firm’s accounts dry on the last day of the fiscal year, distribute everything left over to the equity members, and start again fresh at midnight. This model allows for some reinvestment within the firm during the fiscal year, but also incentivizes keeping cash in the bank so it can end the year in partners’ pockets. This model has kept the peace between the competing interests of ownership and management in many firms for decades. It may be a significant hindrance to smart business survival in the wake of the coronavirus, though, where the need to have cash on hand to survive a potential recession or depression is becoming paramount. If firms want to survive the COVID-19 crisis, they may need to reformulate their basic financial model. Yet how many equity partners, in the face of all this uncertainty, want to cut back their take-home pay to keep the larger firm healthy?

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Hesitance to embrace change is nothing new to our industry. It’s perhaps easy to understand why there’s so much fear about changing what is, for many, the fundamental concept of how a law firm functions. Some management teams may fear losing the sense of community and camaraderie they’ve built up. Some may not want to spend the money and do the hard work when it seems like none of their peers is doing the same thing.

That’s the thing about adapting to the times: you choose to make it happen or you don’t, but the world keeps on changing around you regardless. You either grow and survive, or you wither and die. Fear is understandable, but if you want to be afraid of anything, be afraid of the consequences of doing nothing. The broader business world is moving with the times. We can’t afford to be left behind.

# In Time Of Political Unrest, Former Biglaw Managing Partner Told To 'Go Back To [His] Own Country'
## This is incredibly troubling.

With tensions seemingly at an all-time high in a nation that’s been largely torn asunder thanks to a political campaign that encouraged racism, xenophobia, anti-immigrant sentiment, and sexism, a deluge of hate crimes have been reported across the country since Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election. Perhaps you believed that events like this only happened in small towns in red states, and perhaps you believed that such things would never occur to those who work at Biglaw firms — but you were wrong.

We’ve already reported on a horrifying tale told by a Hispanic paralegal working at a Biglaw firm in the South, who claimed that an [unnamed associate sexually assaulted her](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/the-pink-ghetto-biglaw-sexual-assault-in-the-days-following-donald-trumps-election/) and threatened to do so again, stating, “Next time, I’ll grab you by the pussy, beaner.” Today, we have a chilling account of an incident that was experienced by the former co-managing partner of a prominent Biglaw firm in one of the most liberal states in America.

[William Lee](https://www.wilmerhale.com/william_lee/), a graduate of Harvard College and Cornell Law School, is an accomplished intellectual property litigator who served as the managing partner of Hale & Dorr from 2000 to 2004 before the firm merged with Wilmer Cutler & Pickering to form Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr, which is now known as WilmerHale. Thereafter, he served as co-managing partner of the merged firm from 2004 to 2011. Lee was the first Asian-American to lead a major American law firm. Lee is also the first Biglaw partner to speak out about the racial animus he’s experienced in this time of great political upheaval.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Lee was wearing a suit and tie this summer and filling up the tank of his Mercedes-Benz SUV at a gas station in Wellesley, Massachusetts, when he was approached by a man wearing a “Wellesley Hockey Parent” shirt. The [Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/top-stories/id=1202772789992/In-Wake-of-Election-Wilmers-Bill-Lee-Reveals-Troubling-Incident?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=7) has the rest of Lee’s story:


Bill F. Lee

“Where does a guy like you get a car like that?” the man said to Lee, looking at the litigator’s vehicle.

Lee, whose parents came to this country from China in 1948, tried to defuse the situation. “From Herb Chambers,” he said, referring to a local car dealer.

“Why don’t you go back to your own country,” the man said, according to Lee.

“I don’t understand you,” Lee said.

“You mean, you don’t understand English,” the man said.

“I don’t understand ignorance,” Lee replied.

The Wilmer partner drove away, but the man followed in his car. When Lee pulled into a nearby police station, the man vanished.

Lee, who grew up as the only Chinese student in his school district, said he hadn’t heard a comment like that in four decades, and believes that the man was emboldened to say such a thing because of the current political atmosphere. “In the bluest of blue states, Massachusetts, a mile from Wellesley College, if someone tells you to go back to your own country, this can happen anywhere,” Lee said. “If this can happen to the managing partner of an Am Law 200 firm, what’s happening to the rest of the country?”

Lawyers, please recognize that these outrageous incidents can, do, and will affect even those who have reached the highest echelons of the legal profession. Racial animus does not stop just because one is a partner at one of the profitable law firms in the country. Stand up, speak out, organize, and support one another in these times of uncertainty. The law is supposed to be a noble profession — let’s band together do what we can to prevent incidents like this from happening to each other and to other Americans.

# Paul Weiss Jumps On The New Annual Bonus Bandwagon
## Here come the bonuses.

After a couple weeks of eerie silence in the Biglaw world, we’re seeing some fast and furious action when it comes to bonuses. Despite raising the bar, the market didn’t seem quite convinced that Cravath hit the right note when it released its new, higher annual bonuses. But even though Biglaw offered a collective “that ain’t it, bro,” no one knew what “it” was going to be.

Earlier this morning, Davis Polk offered its answer to the question, matching Cravath’s schedule and raising it to the tune of another round of “special” bonuses. No one wants to raise bonuses so high that it sets an expectation for next year, so structuring the latest premium as a special bonus allows firms to have their new recruit-enticing cake and eat it too. Has DPW found the right balance?

Paul Weiss seems to think so, responding to the DPW news with an announcement roughly an hour later that it would be matching the new scale.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  


Remember, Paul Weiss already had a pool of money for [discretionary top-off bonuses](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/paul-weiss-special-bonus-discretional/) for attorneys — speculated to be a premium to help retain attorneys in white-hot markets. So if you’re an in-demand attorney at Paul Weiss, there’s a whole lot of money coming your way.

Will we see a groundswell of matches today? Will Cravath try to re-raise to seize back its place as the firm that sets the market? It’s going to be a busy week!

We depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Yup, Nonequity Partnership Is Used Disproportionately For Minorities
## This is a disturbing, though not unexpected trend.

If you’ve been paying attention to Biglaw trends, this is not a surprise. The [growing trend of nonequity](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/repeat-after-me-partnership-without-equity-is-not-a-partnership/) or income partners[ has long been seen](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/addressing-the-elephant-in-the-room-biglaws-problem-with-diversity/) as a kind of legal career limbo that lets firms tick off diversity boxes while not truly diversifying the top levels of the partnership. And now we’ve got some hard numbers that correspond to the trend many have seen.

American Lawyer [has looked at five years worth of data](https://www.law.com/2019/10/08/minority-partners-disproportionately-placed-in-nonequity-partnership-tier/) at 148 firms that have this increasingly popular two-tiered structure. And that found that minority lawyers are being “promoted” to the nonequity ranks at triple the rate of white lawyers. Yikes.

That’s right, between 2014 and 2018, minority nonequity partners grew 34 percent compared with 10 percent growth for white nonequity partners. If you were a minority attorney you were also more likely to become a nonequity partner — 54 percent of minority partners were denied equity status. While white attorneys fared differently — they were more likely to become equity partners with 58 percent of them moving to the equity ranks.

While it is true the nonequity ranks at firms are growing in general — what better way to boost those profits per equity partner numbers, after all? The data shows a disturbing trend of minority lawyers being disproportionally impacted by the profit-driving trend. And, to be clear, it matters who is getting the nod to join the highest levels of law firms:

“Equity partners are the ones that have the power at a law firm. Who’s being hired, who’s getting choice work. They’re the ones that control the politics of the firm,” said Michelle Fang, chief legal officer at alternative rental car company Turo, who wrote an open letter in January signed by more than 200 general counsel demanding increased diversity in the legal profession.

As you might imagine, some firms were better than others when it comes to making minorities equity partner. American Lawyer specifically called out a handful of Am Law 100 firms for their “notable discrepancies in their minority and white nonequity partner representation,” which are: Proskauer Rose; Latham & Watkins; McDermott Will & Emery; Crowell & Moring; Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw; Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan; and Duane Morris.

Duane Morris’s diversity and inclusion officer, Joe West, blamed the firm’s lateral strategy as part of their issue:

“We’ve grown organically by following the business and by adding groups in subject matter and geographic areas that make sense for our strategy,” he said. “You have much less control, and that act alone could skew the numbers.”

Crowell & Moring’s management committee chair Philip Inglima pointed to larger systemic changes that need to happen to more meaningfully diversity leadership at the firm:

Both Duane Morris and Crowell & Moring say they are making systemic changes to try to get more minority lawyers on the equity track—overhauling their assignment systems to reduce bias and working with outside organizations such as Diversity Lab, for example.

“That kind of change is needed to overcome the effects of multiple generations of lawyers at firms like ours which had few diverse partners,” he said.

It’s certainly true that Biglaw has a long way to go.

# This Top Biglaw Firm Is 'Aggressively' Searching For A Merger Partner
## 'Hey, baby, want to see our PPP?' Maybe the firm isn't being *that* aggressive.

Law firm merger activity has been hot, hot, hot in 2023, and one top Am Law firm is doing its damnedest get in on the action.

McGuireWoods — a firm that brought in $953,548,000 gross revenue in 2021, putting it in 54th place in the most recent Am Law 100 — is “looking to grow” and has the urge to merge. According to its chairman, Jonathan Harmon, the firm is “aggressively” seeking a partner. “I believe that the market’s consolidating and that you’re going to have to have scale,” he said in an interview with [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/mcguirewoods-aggressively-seeks-merger-partner-chairman-says). Here are some addition details about the firm’s growth aspirations:

McGuireWoods … eyes growth in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Texas and California. …

The firm aims to marry its growth goal in the five states with getting bigger in five practice areas—private equity, health care, energy, high-stakes investigations and litigation, and financial institutions and alternative lenders, according to Harmon.

McGuireWoods has been talking to potential merger partners for almost four years, but thus far, has been unlucky in law firm love. According to Harmon, “Finding the right firm to acquire, merge with, is hard.” But unlike some of its competitors, Harmon is being very open about the firm’s plans. “I’m more frank about it,” he told Bloomberg. “If you’re coy and you’re pretending ‘Hey, I don’t want to date,’ you may not get one.”

Is your firm single and ready to mingle? Revenues at McGuireWoods have risen by 16% over the last five years, and the firm is looking for a partner to share the wealth with. Come on, let this Am Law 100 firm show you a good time.

As the old saying goes, third time’s a charm! And that’s increasingly the motto of Biglaw firms trying to stay on top of the compensation heap.

The latest firm to announce raises — their *third* round of them — is Irell & Manella. The firm made $132,903,000 in gross revenue in 2020, making it 183rd in the Am Law 200. Irell[ previously announced ](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/west-coast-biglaw-firm-joins-milbank-scale/)raises, back when the Milbank scale was the top of the market. Then Davis Polk increased that scale for midlevel and senior associates, which[ the firm promptly matched](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/irell-re-raises-22/). But then[ Cravath went and spoiled that](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cravath-raises-22/). But Irell is committed to the top of the compensation scale, so a third round of raises is in order.

Yesterday, the firm announced the following compensation scale:

Class	Base Compensation
1st year	$215,000
2nd year	$225,000
3rd year	$250,000
4th year	$295,000
5th year	$345,000
6th year	$370,000
7th year	$400,000
8th year	$415,000
The increases are retroactive to January 1. You can read the [full memo on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/irell-re-re-raise-22/2/)

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm That Laid Off Associates Hands Out Market Bonuses If You Bill Enough
## It's been a bumpy 2020 for the firm, but it looks like they've turned a corner.

2020 has been a helluva ride for Winston & Strawn.

[Back in September, we reported](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/associate-layoffs-and-staff-cuts-come-to-am-law-50-biglaw-firm/) that the firm, ranked #40 on the latest Am Law 100 list, was letting go a number of associates and staff, and that was after they’d already[ cut partner compensation](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-top-50-firm-cuts-partner-compensation-in-half-over-covid-19-concerns/) as part of their COVID-19 austerity measures. But there’s been a return to normal, and just yesterday the firm announced year-end and special bonuses.

The scale below reflects the size of the bonuses, and lucky associates (who bill enough) will have the opportunity to make full market compensation at the firm.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  


Notice that “up to” notation in the special bonus column? You see, at Winston it isn’t as simple as all associates get the full special bonuses. The memo goes on to clarify:

Associates who meet or exceed their target hours: 100% of special bonus
Associates who meet 75% or more of their hours targets: 75% of special bonus
Associates who are below 75% of their hours targets: 50% of special bonus

The memo also noted, that, as they [have in the past](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/winston-bonus-2019/), “the Firm will pay additional bonuses to eligible associates who substantially exceed the Firm’s productivity goals.” You can read the [full memo on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/winston-2020-bonuses/2/)

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Associate reaction has been mixed — at least judging by a sampling of the Above the Law tipsters. Some are disappointed the firm’s hours threshold hasn’t been changed by COVID:

Associate bonuses announced at Winston & Strawn. As in prior years, year-end bonuses are tied to hours thresholds set by the firm, and which have not changed to account for covid. Some associates are frustrated that a decrease in hours completely out of their control will lead to zero year-end bonus.

While others are happy there’s a bonus available for associates that don’t hit their hours:

Kudos to Winston for living up to its self-described status as a market-paying firm. Our leadership expressed skepticism about COVID bonuses in the fall, so this is a pleasant surprise. And paying partial COVID bonuses to associates who missed their hours is a nice touch—some of our peer firms didn’t do this, and the Firm clearly has been paying attention to the negative reactions to those decisions.

I guess it’s just a matter of perspective (and how many hours you’ve been able to bill).

Welcome back to [The Pink Ghetto](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-pink-ghetto/), a series where we take a look at some of the most appalling stories from one of the most sexist industries in the world: the legal profession. Countless tales of sexual harassment have emerged in the days and weeks since the Harvey Weinstein scandal was brought to light, and as women in this industry know all too well, a law degree will not [insulate you from sexual harassment](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/metoo-no-a-law-degree-doesnt-insulate-you-from-sexual-harassment/). Today, we’ll take a look at a story from a woman who faced intense sexual harassment during law school at the hands of a well-known Biglaw partner. These are always real emails that we’ve received from real readers.

When you see things like this happening, say something. Together, we can inspire the change necessary to stop this disturbing behavior from being so prevalent in the law. We owe it to ourselves and to future generations of women in the law.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
While I was in law school in Los Angeles, I met a partner of a prominent law firm on a visit to Sonoma County, whom we will call “A.” A said he was based in the Bay Area, but frequently came to Los Angeles to visit clients. Sure enough, A soon invited me to come out to one of his client’s events, a tech company’s launch event at the Viceroy Hotel in Santa Monica. As I was job-hunting that summer, I was excited at the networking opportunity with this big time attorney, who had clearly been practicing for many years.  He also mentioned we could grab dinner following the event if I was free because he was staying at the hotel. Since we had discussed my background in entertainment and my interest in IP law, I thought he was genuinely interested in potentially lending a hand to my career.

When I arrived to the Viceroy, A met me at the door. He noticed my large purse and said, “Oh, do you want to put your bag in my room?” I thought that seemed odd, but I hoped it was nothing and replied, “That’s okay, thanks.” Can you say RED FLAG?! The actual event was uneventful. I remember hoping people knew I was there in a professional capacity, because A kept introducing me as “his friend Amanda,” a “future hotshot attorney.” (While I am not sure of his exact age, he graduated law school in 1991… when I was THREE. Suffice it to say, he was significantly older than I was.) As the event wrapped up, A suggested going to dinner at Capo across the street. I felt it would be rude to decline the offer. And after all, this would be my chance to discuss his firm and really sell him on my capabilities as an attorney…. or so I thought.

During dinner, A proceeded to ask me deeply personal questions. He told me about his divorce and how much he hated his ex-wife. The conversation soon veered into romantic and sexual territory. A asked me if I found him attractive and if I had any fetishes in bed. I felt extremely uncomfortable. He then proceeded to FEED me some of his pasta, which was beyond awkward. Over the course of the dinner, I kept declining more wine, and reminding him I had to drive home. At one point, he stood up from the table, walked over to me, and kissed me. In front of the ENTIRE restaurant. At this point, I was mortified and I felt frozen. I kept thinking, just get through the dinner. I briefly thought about leaving while he was in the bathroom, and I should have. The concierge came over to check on me, but I didn’t say anything because I could tell this attorney was a highly respected client of the restaurant. The worst part is, even though I was so disgusted, I remember thinking I still didn’t want to offend him. Toward the end of the dinner, A kept bringing up how much he loved poetry. He suggested I come back to his hotel room so he could read me some of his favorites. Or we could even “sit by the pool.” All I kept thinking was how I wish I hadn’t parked at the hotel. Unfortunately, I had left my car with the hotel valet so I had to walk back with him.

We started walking back to the hotel. A took my hand and suddenly suggested we go for a walk on the beach. He put his arm around me and kept gently steering me toward a very dark, isolated alley which led down to the beach. I took a few steps, but kept saying, “you know, I really need to be going” to no avail. A then grabbed me and kissed me again, except this time it was much more aggressive. He started groping my ass and attempted to put his hands up my dress. I removed them and said something like, “Sorry, this isn’t happening.” I kept trying to politely say “No.” I must have said “no” a hundred times. I remember him laughing at me and saying, “Oh, you’re so cute. I like that, how you say no, no, no.” Like it was nothing. Anyway, at that point, we finally walked back to the hotel. He was visibly irritated with me, but let me leave in peace.

Afterward, I kept asking myself, “Did I so something to make him think I was interested in more than a professional relationship?” The answer is NO. This was not my fault. While this experience certainly did a number on me, I am well aware of how lucky I am. Lucky, because this is the “worst” account of sexual abuse I have personally experienced. Lucky, because who knows what would have happened if I had ended up in his hotel room.

# 'We Need All Lawyers In The Office' Says Bank Definitely Not Freaking Out About Commercial Real Estate Portfolio
## Morgan Stanley doth protest a lot about working from home.

No, I’m not looking at our exposure… I just care so much about mentorship!

Morgan Stanley’s senior leadership really, really wants everyone back in the office five (or more) days a week.

A month ago, Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman issued an ultimatum to his employees that remote working is over and [they must return to the office](https://nypost.com/2021/06/15/morgan-stanley-chief-expects-bankers-back-in-nyc-offices/). “If you can go into a restaurant in New York City, you can come into the office,” he said, mercilessly murdering a straw man. Last week, he [doubled down on this claim on an earnings call](https://nypost.com/2021/07/15/morgan-stanley-ceo-doubles-down-against-working-from-home/), this time adding some boilerplate about the limits of telecommuting when it comes to mentoring, forgetting that on a typical day, most professional workers only interact with supervisors over the phone even when inside the office. Apropos of nothing, [Morgan Stanley profits are booming right now](https://www.wsj.com/articles/morgan-stanley-profit-rises-11626350000) while employees continue to work remotely.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
On Thursday, [Morgan Stanley Chief Legal Officer Eric Grossman sent a memo](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/morgan-stanleys-legal-chief-wants-law-firms-back-in-the-office) to the bank’s stable of law firms and legal service providers encouraging that they buck the emerging 3- or 4-day office work week trend and bring everyone back full-time… with a heavily implied “or else.” “[Our profession cannot long endure a remote work model](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/07/16/our-profession-cannot-long-endure-a-remote-work-model-morgan-stanley-clo-tells-law-firms/),” he said, noting “I strongly believe that firms that return to the office will have a significant performance advantage over those that do not,” despite the top law firms Morgan Stanley works with [achieving record profits in 2020](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/02/01/after-profits-soared-in-2020-firms-optimistic-about-revenue-uptick-this-year/). In his defense, firms do owe a chunk of that profitability to cost-savings from a year without travel, but revenue was still up roughly in line with recent trends.

So we have empirical proof that working remotely isn’t hurting the bottom line at law firms. If Grossman believes his outside counsel have delivered sub-par work for the past year, he’s seemingly not rushing to fire firms. So why is there a lockstep commitment among the bank’s senior leadership to pushing workers — its own and those of its outside vendors — back into the office? And why is Morgan Stanley more or less alone on an island making a public — or at least consciously leakable — spectacle about returning to the office?

Not to get all “follow the money,” but when a bank is making huge profits working from home, and its law firms are making huge money working from home, there aren’t too many angles left but to conclude that Morgan Stanley must be really, really worried about the commercial real estate market.

And that’s not totally crazy. To some extent, every bank is dabbling directly or indirectly in commercial real estate and the sort of short-term collapse that could hit when companies realize they can eliminate a floor or two will burn a lot of folks. But Morgan Stanley’s aggressiveness here suggests they have it worse than some of their peers if things go sideways.

Of course, there’s also the possibility that Gorman and Grossman are just sincerely concerned about professional mentorship. If they are, I think they’d be pretty shocked to learn how many partners are already working from home during the work week. Because I’ve covered office redesigns over the years and “we shrunk these rooms because our head of X group only comes in three days a week” is something I’ve heard more than once.

But Morgan Stanley’s leaders are savvy enough to know this, which is why this mentorship talk is just another manufactured canard. Putting aside the “virtual law firms” [out there doing high-end work](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/former-clo-and-biglaw-partner-joins-virtual-law-firm-as-managing-partner/) and [landing in the Am Law 200](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/01/12/fisherbroyles-says-2020-revenue-hit-113m/), the law firms that Morgan Stanley works with aren’t talking about a 100 percent remote workforce. The firms taking tentative steps into flexible office models are talking about lawyers working from home one or two days of the traditional work week. Do these guys honestly think that mentorship is impossible when everyone’s in Tuesdays-Fridays? If the profession requires permanent in-person mingling, then why stop at a five-day week? Why not seven?

Which, of course, Biglaw already has. The dirty secret of these 3- and 4-day office work week models is that all it does is create an additional Saturday where you bill from home. Biglaw attorneys presume at least one weekend day is going to be spent billing, now there’s going to be one where it’s mandatory too. That’s it. And, just like those Saturdays and Sundays, there will come a time — sooner rather than later — when the client meeting or the deposition or the closing is going to happen on the lawyer’s work from home day and you know what will happen then? They’ll come in to the office.

If you’re going to try and push people back into the office, at least put some work into it and air some vague concerns about confidentiality or cyberattacks. That’s the sort of thing that people fear and fail to understand in equal measure. But appealing to productivity amidst record profits and mentorship against the backdrop of one additional day working from home is not cutting it.

# More Biglaw Bonus Bucks: The Latest Firm To Match The Market

The closer it gets to the end of the business day, the more anxious associates become as they wait for their Biglaw firms to announce special bonuses. One New York-based firm just saved its attorneys and special counsel some stress by letting them know that the firm would, in fact, be matching the prevailing market bonus rate.

Stroock & Stroock & Lavan just rolled out a bonus memo, letting everyone know that they’d of course be matching the generous Davis Polk scale. Here’s what that looks like at the firm (full memo available on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/stroock-special-bonus-2021/2/)):

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Special bonus payments will be available to those who annualize 2000 hours (1800 billable and 200 non-billable legal) and will be paid on June 30 and November 30. Those unable to meet the hours requirement for the June payment will receive the entire bonus in November if all hours requirements are met. Those in the firm’s Los Angeles and Miami offices better cross their fingers that others match nationwide, because Stroock plans to “incorporate local market factors” for their bonuses.

Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/stroock-special-bonus-2021//2/) to see the full memo from Stroock.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.
