Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris is hitting the campaign trail hard for the November election, and she’s taking her husband with her.

[Doug Emhoff](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/people/e/emhoff-douglas-c/) would make history as America’s first ever second gentleman if the Democrats win this fall. While he may be a successful DLA Piper partner — on average, partners at the firm raked in $1.951 million in profits in 2019 — he’s leaving all of that behind, temporarily, so the nature of his work won’t serve as a liability. Here are some additional details from the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/08/17/emhoff-kamala-harris-spouse-taking-leave-from-dla/):

A DLA Piper spokesman on Monday confirmed that Emhoff, a litigator in the firm’s Los Angeles office, is in the process of transitioning his clients to different attorneys in the firm.

Ever since Joe Biden named Harris his running mate, questions have swirled about Emhoff’s role in the campaign, especially since the Biden campaign has sought to connect Harris with voters in the last week. Emhoff’s law firm profile, which currently says he represents “large domestic and international corporations” in complex disputes, likely won’t resonate with some voters.

Emhoff is doing the best he can to support his wife, as evidenced by [his Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/DouglasEmhoff/):

⁦[@KamalaHarris](https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)⁩ and I are so proud to be a part of the Biden Family! Join us and let’s win this thing. Text READY to 30330 now. [pic.twitter.com/xiEB6kRHrU](https://t.co/xiEB6kRHrU)

— Doug Emhoff (@DouglasEmhoff) [August 14, 2020](https://twitter.com/DouglasEmhoff/status/1294321652751368193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Best of luck to this power couple as they take on the nation!

Informed people understand most law firms are wrestling with overcapacity. Most firms have room to strengthen performance by addressing overcapacity. The negative buzz goes for a couple of days or a week, and then it’s gone. [T]he cost of not addressing chronic overcapacity is usually far greater.

— [Kent Zimmermann](https://www.consultzg.com/consultants/kent-zimmermann/) of the Zeughauser Group, offering his thoughts in the wake of the [mass layoffs at Seyfarth Shaw](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/huge-layoff-report-biglaw-firm-lays-off-associates-staff-and-partners/) on the [impact, or lack thereof](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/05/23/how-much-do-clients-care-about-law-firm-layoffs/), that law firm layoffs tend to have on clients and prospective clients. [Tom Clay](http://www.altmanweil.com/clay/) of Altman Weil agreed, noting, “You know if people aren’t busy you are going to let them go. Clients aren’t going to see that as a big revelation. We all know in our hearts and minds we have too many lawyers, and too many that don’t have enough work.”

# Dentons Faces New, Explicit Sexual Harassment Claims
## A new lawsuit claims Dentons personnel advised a harassment victim to keep quiet. If true, that's deeply troubling.

Dentons is the largest law firm in the world, so it shouldn’t come as a shock that it would eventually find itself on the wrong end of a harassment claim. Not that firm size excuses bad behavior by any means, it’s just that statistics would suggest a #MeToo moment was inevitable. And, indeed, it’s [already happened](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/dentons-partner-out-after-investigation-into-misconduct/). But as easy as it is to blame the firm when these allegations surface, firms can’t always control for every bad actor that might walk through their doors.

What they can control is their response to the situation.

Yesterday, Krunali Parekh, a Business Development Specialist at Dentons, [filed suit](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/06/11/alleging-treatment-as-sexual-object-dentons-employee-sues-firm/) in New York state court alleging a pattern of sexual harassment by Alton Delane, the Managing Director of Dentons’ Venture Technology Group. You know the complaint — [available here](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/dentons-faces-new-explicit-sexual-harassment-claims/2/) — is damning when there’s just a page of bullet points like these:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
-  Professing to Ms. Parekh that he is “in love with her.”
-  Telling Ms. Parekh that “I want to fuck you.”
-  Asking Ms. Parekh if she “ever wondered what it’s like to be with a Black guy?”
-  Asking Ms. Parekh if she “ever thought of being with me?”
-  Telling Ms. Parekh: “I want to stick my dick up your ass.”
-  Asking Ms. Parekh if she “ever had anal sex?”
-  Telling Ms. Parekh: “I want to fuck you in the asshole.”
And those are less than half the bullet points! It’s safe to say these allegations advance far beyond the realm of screwball misunderstandings. The complaint alleges that alcohol contributed to Delane’s behavior, which would seem to support the decision some firms have made to [phase out “boozefests”](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-summer-programs-phasing-out-boozefests-to-create-all-new-worse-sexual-harassment-opportunities/) — though these allegations suggest that would just be passing the buck because Parekh claims alcohol was just a convenient excuse for, rather than the cause of, Delane’s alleged behavior.

Bringing us back to the original point — what does a firm like Dentons do when confronted with allegations like this. In a statement, the firm explained that it’s put Delane on administrative leave and is taking the matter seriously:

Dentons has a robust Code of Conduct, which includes a discrimination and retaliation prevention policy and we are deeply troubled by the allegations against a non-lawyer employee, which are contrary to our values and culture of respect. We take any concern about discrimination or unfair treatment seriously. The Firm is committed to a workplace free from discrimination and harassment, and to fostering an inclusive and diverse culture. Upon first learning of the detailed allegations through threatened litigation, Dentons placed the individual who is the subject of these allegations on administrative leave while we continued an ongoing investigation. Upon conclusion of the investigation, we are committed to taking appropriate and additional action as necessary.

We are proud of the many women in global leadership positions in our Firm, including the five women who sit on our 16 member US Board, and our industry leading commitment to diversity and inclusion.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
That’s exactly what a firm should do when faced with allegations like this. Unfortunately, the complaint claims that Dentons wasn’t always as eager to address harassment as they are in the wake of this suit:

Though Dentons is doubtlessly aware that the anti-discrimination laws in place are intended to encourage women to speak out about these abuses and that there has been a broad societal push towards empowering women, when Ms. Parekh raised complaints about this conduct to her supervisor and to Human Resources, she was simply told “do not discuss this with anyone else inside or outside the firm.”

That allegation would seem to undermine that “robust Code of Conduct.” Obviously, we don’t have the full context. If the quote were “do not discuss this with anyone else inside or outside the firm… until we conclude our thorough investigation and report back to you” that direction would be entirely prudent. We’ll find out more about this in discovery, but it’s worth remembering there’s a possible innocent interpretation here and the truth needs to get fleshed out.

Even though this behavior doesn’t involve any lawyers, it reaffirms the importance of driving a nail in the practice many firms have employed of forcing employees into mandatory arbitration and shady nondisclosure agreements. As Parekh notes in the complaint, one of her goals in the suit is to increase awareness that law firms aren’t immune to harassing behavior, and coming to grips with that is the first step in dealing with it effectively.

Hopefully the rest of the Biglaw world is getting the message.

# Is Your Biglaw Firm 'Ill-Positioned' To Match Cravath's Salary Raises?

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

This could be the year [the pool of firms following Cravath shrinks].

— [Michelle Fivel](https://www.hhflegalsearch.com/michelle-fivel), a legal recruiter at Hatch Henderson Fivel, in comments given to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/cravath-salary-increases-pressure-rivals-who-cant-afford-match) on the Biglaw firms that may be “ill-positioned” to follow in [Cravath’s footsteps](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/cravath-announces-raises-comes-over-the-top-of-milbank-scale-for-some-associates/) and raise associate compensation, with salaries ranging from $225,000 to $420,000 and higher. [Peter Zeughauser](https://www.consultzg.com/people/peter-zeughauser), a law firm management consultant at the Zeughauser Group, echoed Fivel’s statement, saying attempts to match Cravath’s raises will “stress a lot of firms.”

# 'Yeah, There's Going To Be Attrition': Biglaw Firms Grapple With Losing Lawyers
## Making associates feel 'connected' to their firms may help.

Yeah, there’s going to be attrition, because there’s some level of burnout, there’s some level of frustration with how long this is going on. And some people just want a change. And if you feel you’re not connected to an organization, it’s easier to make that move. But if you feel connected, it becomes harder. We want people to feel this is their home, that they’re mentored, that they’re given an opportunity to be successful.

— [Jay Rothman](https://www.foley.com/en/people/r/rothman-jay-o), CEO of Foley & Lardner, in comments given during an interview with the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/10/12/law-firms-struggle-to-stave-off-mass-attrition/), on what law firms can do in their battle against the Great Attrition. Rothman is a firm believer that the office may be a solution, but says that firms need to make sure they’re a safe destination for lawyers, and give them “good reasons” to return.

# Abbe Lowell Falls For Internet Prank, Still Gives Good Advice
## Jared Kushner's attorney gives the world a lesson in cybersecurity 101.

Abbe Lowell

If you’re a lawyer, and especially if you’ve a lawyer who has taken on a high profile role in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s ongoing investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election, you have to mind your Ps and Qs when it comes to cybersecurity, lest you fall for an internet prank or worse. That should be pretty obvious.

The latest case study comes from Norton Rose Fulbright partner, [Abbe Lowell](http://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/people/147736/abbedavidlowell), who’s become a current events fixture due to his representation of Jared Kushner. Yes, Kushner has a J.D. from NYU, but he’s smart enough to know that he needs an expert like Lowell if he’s going to weather tropical storm Mueller heading right at him.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In any event, Lowell recently received an [email from kushner.jared@mail.com](https://twitter.com/SINON_REBORN/status/912686341594460161) asking his advice about dealing with… embarrassing emails sent to his personal email address from a White House official. The only rub? That email address belongs to a prankster, not the presidential son-in-law. Kushner’s personal emails have become a hot topic of conversation — and a potential focus of the Russia investigation — after a startling bit of hypocrisy revealed that six members of the Trump administration, including[ Kushner](http://theslot.jezebel.com/jared-kushner-used-a-private-email-for-white-house-busi-1818710770) and his wife [Ivanka Trump](http://theslot.jezebel.com/ivanka-reportedly-did-government-business-on-private-em-1818739926), used their personal emails to conduct White House business. Those “lock her up” chants have fallen silent lately.

The humorous exchange, first [published by Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/jared-kushner-lawyer-email-prankster-private-2017-9), seeks Lowell’s advice on what to do with some… erm, adult content sent over email:

On Monday, the prankster wrote to Lowell from the email address kushner.jared@mail.com asking what he should do with “some correspondence on my private email … featuring adult content.”

“Can I remove these?” the prankster asked.

“Forwarded or received from WH officials?” Lowell responded.

“I think one was forwarded from a White House official, we had discussed a shared interest of sorts,” the prankster said. “It was unsolicited. Then there are a handful more, but not from officials.”

“I need to see I think all emails between you and WH (just for me and us),” Lowell wrote. “We need to send any officials emails to your WH account. Not stuff like you asked about. None of those are going anywhere.”

“But we can bury it?” the prankster responded. “I’m so embarrassed. It’s fairly specialist stuff, half naked women on a trampoline, standing on legoscenes, the tag for the movie was #standingOnTheLittlePeople :(”

Lowell replied: “Don’t delete. Don’t send to anyone. Let’s chat in a bit.”

Lawyers associated with the Trump administration have had questionable responses to emails sent by [scammers](http://www.businessinsider.com/ty-cobb-emails-prankster-drone-reporter-2017-9) and[ critics](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/ty-cobbs-hilarious-emails-and-what-they-say-about-biglaw/) alike. When these are made public — as these things tend to do — they’ve become a source of [embarrassment](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/marc-kasowitz-writes-angry-emails-and-everyone-completely-overreacts/). But Lowell pretty much aces this test. It’s such good, succinct advice:

“Don’t delete. Don’t send to anyone. Let’s chat in a bit.”

Lowell is entirely correct to give broad, correct advice over email and then suggest a phone conversation to deal with specifics. Some lawyers can be lazy and assume because emails are privileged too that they can go into embarrassing and potentially client damaging detail in them, but it’s incredibly easy to spoof an email address. So there’s a lesson here — don’t say stuff over a potentially insecure channel that could hurt your client’s reputation. That’s just cybersecurity 101.

# 3 More Tips For IP Summer Associates
## How should 2022’s summer associate class handle their first foray into a law firm IP group, whether in a Biglaw or boutique setting?

About 150 columns ago, back in June 2019, I laid out in a [column](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/3-tips-for-ip-summer-associates/) three tips for incoming IP summer associates. There, I discussed how important it is for incoming summers to demonstrate gratitude and humility, despite the significant academic achievements that put them in the position to land a summer associate spot in the first place. I also reminded incoming summers of how avoiding gossip and not oversharing personal details is essential in a law firm setting. At the same time, however, I also discussed why it is so important to learn what you can from new senior colleagues over the course of the summer associate experience, while also being cognizant that displaying genuine interest and curiosity is the key to unlocking positive feelings from those you are interacting with.

At bottom, I tried to reinforce what the goal is for any summer associate experience — “to leave the firm feeling secure that you can be brought on full-time right out of law school.” That’s what it is all about. And now, with nearly all Biglaw firms coming off banner financial performance in 2021, it is not a surprise to see that summer associate programs are expected to get back in full swing this summer. In fact, there have already been reports that 2022 summer associate classes may be the largest ever at some firms, even as many firms are still working through their post-pandemic return-to-office plans.

For example, one [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/law-firms-hope-see-summer-associates-office-least-most-week-2022-05-06/) piece discusses how firms are planning to rekindle the social events that were such a big part of the summer associate experience before the pandemic. With a twist, of course, to accommodate the hybrid working schedules that are such a big part of today’s Biglaw work rhythm. Likewise, firms are adopting flexible in-office schedules for summer associates, both to align their in-person attendance with days that the office is more fully staffed, as well as to give summer associates a taste of how Biglaw has operated — indeed thrived — virtually from the onset of the pandemic to now.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
In perhaps one of the most interesting developments, Skadden is reportedly going to introduce “summer lectures on subjects such as financial well being, nutrition and stress management” — in yet another example of how firms want to keep younger associates primed to stay both physically and mentally healthy in spite of the challenges of joining a Biglaw firm during a boom time. Taken together, it looks like the 2022 summer associate class is in for an interesting ride, even as firms flush with cash look to both pamper and educate in the hopes of discovering which of today’s neophytes has what it takes to develop into tomorrow’s top billers and firm citizens.

So how should 2022’s summer associate class handle their first foray into a law firm IP group, whether in a Biglaw or boutique setting? For starters, I continue to believe that the advice in my 2019 column is evergreen, as well as a good starting point for thinking about how to best portray oneself in a new professional environment. But there is always more we can do to excel, so here are three more tips for IP summer associates to consider as they head into one of the most exciting, yet binary, experiences they will have in legal practice. Binary, because at the end of the summer, there will either be an offer of full-time employment post-law school, or a polite communication that the prospective associate is not cut out for success at firm X. The former category is a lot more pleasant.

To start, I would suggest that 2022’s summer associates educate themselves as thoroughly as possible about changes that the pandemic wrought on the IP practice that they are being recruited into. Is the group expanding or contracting? How busy has everyone been — and does it look like the boom times will continue? Are there any new areas of IP that the firm is looking to expand into — such as branching into an area of litigation, like trade secrets, that the group was not previously active in? In short, do your best to learn about the group you are joining. And pay careful attention to any disparities between what you have read and heard and what you see with your own eyes when you spend time in the group. In particular, keep an eye on whether the senior associates are a happy or grumbling lot. If the latter, recognize that these are some of the firm’s most profitable assets — and if they are not happy, that may not speak well of the firm’s culture as a whole.

Second, it is important for summer associates to try to create some kind of concrete work product over the course of the summer. Whether it is co-authoring an article with a partner — everyone loves a research volunteer — or working up a draft brief in a pro bono or paying client matter, it is important to have something to point to as your own written work product when at all possible. Besides being good practice for the type of marketing you will be doing as a more senior associate or partner, your writing may have future uses that can’t be anticipated. At such a formative stage of a legal career, it is important to remember that there may never be a more opportune time to get in the habit of writing as during the  summer associate days. When else will you be drawing the equivalent of a full associate’s weekly salary without the billable expectations?

Lastly, I believe that modern IP associates must develop a passing familiarity with two topics at the earliest practicable stage of their legal careers. Those two topics? Litigation finance and crypto/NFTs. As with writing, your summer associate days are well-suited to dive into these and other topics of interest, free from the burdens of schoolwork or the need to bill enough hours to justify one’s continued employment. Why these two topics? For one, many older lawyers remain less than fluent in these areas, but may have already started to see the impact of developments in those species on their own practices. As such, a younger associate with a real knowledge base in these areas will be of outsized help. Likewise, there is no doubt that both litigation funding and crypto/NFT work will continue to have a significant impact on IP practice for the foreseeable future. Building a solid foundation in those areas could be a great way for a younger IP associate to distinguish themselves should they manage to turn their summer associate position into full-time employment post-law school. Eyes on the prize everyone … and best of luck to the 2022 IP summer associates.

Richard Hsu

“I’m not a business man / I’m a business, man!” — [Jay-Z](https://genius.com/17918)

Earlier this week, Richard Hsu [announced](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-i-left-biglaw-partnership-become-legal-recruiter-richard-hsu?trk=v-feed&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_recent_activity_details_all%3Bplc5%2F3%2FfgrNa5Vx6XyoEaA%3D%3D) his last day as a practicing attorney at Shearman & Sterling LLP and first day as a legal recruiter at Major, Lindsey & Africa.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
At Shearman, Hsu was the Global Head of the IP Transactions practice, Co-Chair of the Privacy and Data Protection practice, and Co-Head of the Technology, Media, and Telecom (TMT) Industry practice. Prior to Shearman, Hsu was the former Managing Partner at Townsend LLP (n/k/a Kilpatrick Townshend & Stockton LLP) and an attorney at King & Spaulding LLP, among several other [notable legal gigs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardhsu/).

Prior to attending Columbia Law School, Hsu graduated from Caltech and spent several years as an engineer at Oracle. As an introverted high-school student, Hsu felt somewhat awkward and was a bit of a loner. But he felt like he was able to develop his EQ over time by being continually curious about others and taking advantage of the opportunities to mentor colleagues in his various management positions throughout his career.

Nowadays, many of us are familiar with Hsu as the gregarious host of [HsuUntied](http://hsuuntied.com/), one of the most popular podcasts in the legal industry.

A friend helped him come up with the name of his podcast, based on its casual conversation with attorneys (and now other special guests) about side hobbies and other non-work activities. Richard’s name is pronounced like “shoe.” Thus, the “shoe untied” reference was a natural fit for the unbuttoned, casual conversation with his guests. His logo is a drawing by his daughter of an untied bowtie, a look he often sports.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Hsu may now be a Managing Director of the Partner Placement Group at MLA, but he still plans to continue hosting his entertaining podcast.

Needless to say, it is quite rare for a current global head of a practice group and former managing partner of a law firm to exit his or her traditional role and join the recruiting end of the table. This certainly piqued my interest, and I hope my chat with Hsu engages your curiosity as well.

Without further ado, here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation:

Renwei Chung (RC): What attracted you to the law and how did you choose Columbia Law School?

Richard Hsu (RH): I studied engineering in college, so the last thing on my mind was to be a lawyer; but after working as a software programmer at Oracle, someone said, “You should be an intellectual property lawyer.” I think I barely knew what a patent was at the time.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
I chose Columbia because I had lived my whole life in California so I wanted to live on East Coast, and what better place than New York City at a great school like Columbia?

RC: You are based in Silicon Valley. What do you enjoy most about Silicon Valley and the Bay Area in general?

RH: Short answer—the weather.  Longer answer—everyone always talks about how the Bay Area is the hub of innovation and technology; but since I grew up here, I just think of it as home.

RC: Many know you as the host of [HsuUntied](http://hsuuntied.com/), a prolific podcast featuring attorneys and other special guests. Some of your recent interviews include such notable names as Mark Cuban, Guy Kawasaki, Salle Yoo, Paula Boggs, Steve Wozniak, and our very own [David Lat](http://hsuuntied.com/dlat/). What motivated you to begin podcasting, and what have you learned from it?

RH: I started the podcast because I wanted to interview some lawyers I knew who had very interesting hobbies; but over time, it has organically expanded to include many entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, authors, and other celebrities.

RC: You have hosted well over 100 podcast episodes since May 2014. And now it’s almost the halfway point of 2017.  What three people would you love to have on HsuUntied before the end of the year?

RH: Tony Robbins (whom I’m waiting to schedule), Charlie Munger (because not many people know that he was actually a student at Caltech), and William Shatner.

RC: As a former managing partner, global head of an intellectual property group, and co-chair of several other legal practices, what do you believe are some of the toughest aspects of leadership and management positions?

RH: The toughest part about leadership and management is to get people to feel like they’re part of a team and working towards some common goal or purpose.  Without that, it’s just a bunch of individuals sharing common resources.

RC: What advice do you have for law partners who are contemplating switching law firms?

RH: It’s important to bounce ideas off someone else who understands your situation, whether it’s a friend, colleague or a recruiter, in order to get an outside perspective.  My advice to many attorneys that I have counseled in the past is: “You should stay where you are – you are in a good place.”

RC: What advice do you have for recent law school graduates and young attorneys for choosing a law firm?

RH: Choose a law firm where you think you will have a good mentor because a good mentor is absolutely critical to having a successful career.  My advice on how to choose a good mentor is to look for someone who they themselves had a good mentor.  Someone who had a good mentor is much more likely to be a good mentor themselves.

RC: It was great chatting with you. Is there anything else you would like to share with our audience?

RH: I’ve had a fantastic legal career and have met some very talented and interesting lawyers.  I am really looking forward to meeting many more and helping those I know in their careers.  Thank you for the opportunity to share my story.

On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, I would like to thank Richard Hsu for sharing his story with our audience. We wish him continued success in his career.

# Stealth Layoffs Come For Junior Associates At Top 20 Biglaw Firm
## The firm is reportedly letting associates go following performance reviews.

Hot on the heels of news of [stealth layoffs taking place](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/stealth-layoffs-arrive-at-worlds-richest-biglaw-firm/) at the wealthiest law firm in the world, we’ve discovered that stealth layoffs have taken place at yet another top Biglaw firm.

According to a report from [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/cooley-axes-corporate-associates-as-tech-sector-feels-crunch), Cooley is the latest firm to conduct a wave of layoffs within its corporate practice — although the firm refused to describe the cuts as such. Cooley is currently ranked in the top 20 of the Am Law 100, but a great deal of its clients are ensconced within the tech sector, which is currently suffering under the weight of the economic downturn. Here are the details:

A Cooley spokesperson confirmed that an unspecified number of associates have been let go.

“The firm concluded its annual mid-year associate performance review process this past summer,” the spokesperson said. “Any attorney separations that have occurred to-date are a result of that process.”

Three sources familiar with the situation described the cuts as “layoffs” not related to performance. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said many of those let go were junior associates in Northern California.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Just like Kirkland & Ellis before it, Cooley — a firm that brought in $1,986,777,000 gross revenue in 2021 — is couching these layoffs in terms of performance. The fact that these reductions in associate headcount happened during a major slowdown in corporate work was just coincidental, of course. This toxic business practice is designed to push the blame for the cuts on the associates themselves, when, if the economy remained just a bit stronger, those same associates would likely still be getting stellar reviews and full bonuses.

This is just the latest we’ve heard of problems occurring at the firm. Cooley went on a corporate hiring spree in 2022, scooping up lateral associates and partners in droves. Back in September, however, when things were just starting to go south, the firm was said to have [implemented an associate hiring freeze](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/hiring-freezes-and-stealth-layoffs-hit-top-50-biglaw-firms/), but denied the official existence of such a program at the time.

Once upon a time, I used to try cases.

Now, as an in-house head of litigation, I sit in the back and watch other people try cases.

Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

But I’ve been collecting thoughts on trials I’ve observed. A few of these things have been said widely, but litigators (even good ones) seem to ignore them. A couple of my other observations are hidden slightly beneath the surface.

First, think about the sequence of your questions. Suppose, on cross-examination, you first ask the adverse expert: “In your entire life, you never worked at a bank, isn’t that right?” The witness says, “Yes; that’s right.”

Then, you start doing the details: “You worked at Institution A, and Institution A wasn’t a bank, right?” You’re likely to draw an “asked and answered” objection to that question, shutting you down in your tracks. The question was in fact asked and answered, because you phrased your original question broadly: “You never worked at a bank . . . .”

But if you simply reverse the sequence, you avoid the objection:

“You worked at Institution A, and Institution A was not a bank, right?”

“You worked at Institution B, and Institution B was not a bank, right?”

“You worked at Institution C, and Institution C was not a bank, right?”

After you go through every place the expert has worked, it is still not asked and answered to end with: “Indeed, in your entire life, you’ve never worked at a bank, isn’t that right?” (The expert might have worked someplace else, and that last place might have been a bank.)

Pay attention to sequence; that may allow you to wallow in the details at more length. Do things in the right order.

Second, anyone who thinks about examinations will tell you to avoid questions that create double negatives:

“No one ever told you X?”

“No.”

That’s the way we talk, of course, but it creates an ambiguous record: Did anyone ever tell the witness that, or not?

Remarkably, lawyers — even good ones — ask these questions all the time. Don’t!

Strip the negatives out of your question, or ask the question in a way that avoids ambiguity. You could, for example, ask: “Did anyone ever tell you X?” Or, if that question makes you nervous (because it’s not leading): “No one ever told you X, is that correct?” When the witness answers, “That’s correct,” you’ve avoided ambiguity.

Third, everyone has seen trials on TV. Imitating lawyers on the tube, bad counsel ask: “Tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury” whatever. That’s bad. It implies that you’re a very smart person, who already knows whatever, and the ignoramuses on the jury have to be educated on that subject. That’s no way to make friends.

Don’t ask witnesses to “tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury” anything. It’s far better to say: “Please tell us” whatever. You thus place yourself on the same level as the jury, avoiding the implicit condescension.

Third, break up the monotone! I know that you naturally speak at a certain pace and volume. But you can surely get a little faster (or slower) or a little louder (or softer) just a few times during the examination to make it bearable for the jury. Don’t do every examination at the same pace and in exactly the same tone of voice throughout.

Fourth, remember that your witness is not necessarily the most important witness in the case. This is particularly important for the junior member of the trial team, who’ll be examining just a couple of witnesses (to get experience). If you’ve been assigned witnesses who really aren’t very important (in the greater scheme of things), don’t assume those witnesses are important just because you’re doing the examination. A witness who merits a half hour on the stand should not be cross-examined for three hours simply because it’s your opportunity to show off. (The senior member of the trial team should control this, making sure that the outline the junior person is using for the examination is fit for the occasion.)

Fifth, be flexible. I know that you’ve typed up your entire cross-examination in advance, along with citations to the impeachment material that you’ll use if the witness tries to wiggle. But you still have to listen to what’s happening in court. Perhaps the witness will give you an opportunity: “Now that you mention it, I never saw any confidential material in the entire 10 years I worked at the company.”

Don’t blow it.

You could just go on to your next question, because you generally got the answer you wanted.

Or you could seize opportunity when it strikes. Drop your jaw; put your arms out Christ-like; ask with disbelief: “You managed 15 people? You saw all their salary and benefits information? You saw scores of social security numbers of other people? And you never saw any confidential information!?”

Don’t be so caught up in your notes that you miss what’s going on around you.

Sixth, don’t be nasty.

It’s obvious that some practicing lawyers watched Arnie Becker (or someone) on television, and decided that sneering and saying, “Well, I guess the document does speak for itself,” is a good idea.

It’s not.

Be nice. That’s what the jury will notice.

Make your points and sit down. You don’t help your cause by being a jerk.

(On some days, I miss the old [Above the Law commenters](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/a-farewell-to-comments/). Surely, after reading the title of this column, one of them would have asked: “Hey, Mark! Can you tell us again which two were worth reading?”)

# Amber Heard Looks To Biglaw For Appeal Of Defamation Verdict
## They're taking lots of shots at the trial court.

If you thought the legal wrangling between exes Johnny Depp and Amber Heard ended with the split decision — finding both sides defamed one another although to different dollar amounts — well, you don’t know about appellate attorneys. As expected, both sides have filed appeals (Depp[ filed his](https://deadline.com/2022/11/johnny-depp-appeal-amber-heard-trial-rihanna-1235163280/) a month ago, and Heard [more recently](https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Heard-Brief-of-Appellant-VCA.pdf)).

For Heard’s appeal, she’s picked up a different set of attorneys, looking to David L. Axelrod and Jay Ward Brown of Ballard Spahr for the appellate process. Of course, the Biglaw attorneys have a ton of experience, but specific recent defamation experience, defending the New York Times against claims by Sarah Palin.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Heard’s [brief details 16 different errors](https://jezebel.com/amber-heard-s-appeal-lists-16-ways-the-court-screwed-he-1849853495) by the trial court, foregrounding the forum selection issue:

“None of the conduct relevant to Depp’s defamation claims occurred in Virginia,” the document reads. “Depp is a resident of California. The incidents that led to Heard obtaining the restraining order took place in California, not Virginia.”

Virginia, the attorneys argue, is “a wholly inconvenient forum with no connection to Depp or any meaningful connection to his claims.” The document also contends that it played a significant role in why few people were able to testify on Heard’s behalf. “Numerous courts interpreting Virginia law have concluded that the place of the wrong for internet defamation claims is where “plaintiff incurs the greatest reputational injury,” which typically is their “home state.”

Because of the choice of location, Heard “suffered substantial prejudice,” given her former team was not able to subpoena witnesses to testify on her behalf. Heard’s attorneys directly referenced a statement made in court by Depp’s attorney, Camille Vasquez: “You may have noticed that no one showed up for Ms. Heard in this courtroom other than her sister. Other than a witness who traveled to Virginia for her as a paid expert. This is a woman who burns bridges. Her close friends don’t show up for her.”

The brief also takes issue with how a prior decision from the U.K. was handled at trial, “This case also should never have gone to trial because another court had already concluded that Depp abused Heard on multiple occasions… After Depp filed this case, the United Kingdom High Court of Justice ruled in a separate defamation action brought by Depp that Heard’s abuse allegations were true.” They go on to write, “The trial court should have given preclusive effect to that 129-page decision, which followed a three-week trial at which Depp, Heard, and 24 other witnesses testified.”

The split nature of the jury’s decision is also a reason to go after it, “To find in favor of Depp, the jury must have concluded that Depp did not abuse Heard and that Heard knowingly lied in accusing him of abuse.” “But, to find in favor of Heard, the jury must have concluded that Heard told the truth about being a victim of domestic abuse by Depp. Accordingly, the verdict against Heard cannot stand.”

And the brief points to the “chilling effect on other women who wish to speak about abuse involving powerful men” the decision has.

The brief seeks either judgment in favor of Heard or the case remanded for a new trial.

# Just Do Your Damn LPQ -- The Dreaded Lateral Partner Questionnaire
## Is it really too much to ask? Too much work to fill out a form that will take one hour of your time so you can leave a firm you're not happy with?

In the mid 1990s, the great former New York Jets wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson was frustrated with his lack of touches, knowing full well he was the star of the team. So one day he unloaded to the media and declared, “Just Give Me the Damn Ball.” He knew that his lack of touches was the bottleneck in the whole operation. If they could just get him the ball and let him do the rest, the team would dominate.

In lateral partner recruiting, I feel that way about the LPQ — the lateral partner questionnaire. It’s the proverbial ball we need filled out by the partner candidates because we cannot win without it.

We all know the scenario: You’re interviewing with multiple firms and you’ve narrowed it down to a few, or maybe you already decided on the one. After months of the dance, you know who can pay and who was just window shopping. You know whose bill rates will never be low enough for your clients and which firms grind their partners into mulch. You know which firm’s practice will legitimately help you cross-sell and which ones are more siloed than Trump’s tax returns. You’re excited and on the verge of getting an offer from your dream firm. You feel a big number coming. But wait… they want you to fill out an LPQ?!

For the uninitiated: what is an LPQ? After preliminary meetings to establish that you might actually fit in with the target firm both culturally and from a business standpoint, most law firms will ask you to complete a lateral partner questionnaire (LPQ) to facilitate that process. Due diligence is an essential part of the lateral partner hiring decision. Law firms must verify your book of business, avoid client conflicts, and manage risks as much as possible. Factors taken into account include your reputation, revenue, originations, client relationships, and business portability. The data included is biographical and economic — a three- to five-year year history of originations, collections, billings, client date, realization rates, and projections for your future, etc. Yes, we concede it’s a bit annoying.

So your inner voice takes over: “Why? We were getting along so well! They need to actually verify my business is what I say it is? Isn’t my word good enough to close a potentially seven-figure deal between lawyers? Shockingly, it isn’t? Oh God, just forget it. Just forget the whole thing. It’s too much work.” Step back and ask yourself: is this me?

Look, we get it. Maybe some of you are just lookie loos, and that’s okay, now is the time to gracefully bow out/ghost us completely. But a lot of you have expressed a deep unhappiness and a strong desire to move to a better platform, and we believe you want to do something about it. So ask yourself: does it really make sense to put up such a stink over the LPQ?

Is it really too much to ask? Too much work? Too much work to fill out a form that will take one hour of your time versus the last 10 or 20 thousand hours you’ve burned at a firm you’re not happy with. You already have all the information. You literally just have to type it into a short document. Sort of like what you do every day. Except you get paid much less for that. Literally typing your information into an LPQ may be the most valuable time you ever spend in your career. That one hour that you keep pushing off is an hour some other partner just spent drinking your milkshake and taking that dream job from you. I’ve seen it happen so many times, but during the pandemic it’s especially egregious to delude yourself into thinking you just don’t have the time.

No more BS. You have the time. S**t or get off the pot. We recruiters work hard to try to put our partner candidates in a position to improve their prospects. We cannot do that if you stubbornly refuse to do the most important part. So I implore you, on behalf of all recruiters, and on behalf of all the firms that really want to hire you and welcome you to a better life: In the words of the great Keyshan Johnson, “Just Do your Damn LPQ.”

Or if your football references are all from Jerry Maguire, then let me just scream, “Help ME help YOU!”

# Biglaw Malpractice Case Takes Turn After Wild Internal Email Uncovered
## Supervisors thought lead partner was damaging clients, but never moved him off the case.

A while back, we mentioned that Seyfarth found itself in a malpractice suit with a bankrupt restaurant over blown deadlines that the restaurant says prejudiced its position. Well, that case is still going and now Seyfarth is going to produce a 30(b)(6) witness to testify about its relationship with the now terminated partner, Ralph Berman, at the center of it all.

To recap, Blue Dog was a planned NY restaurant that entered bankruptcy and hired Seyfarth as its special litigation counsel in a suit against the landlord who allegedly frustrated efforts to open the restaurant and was looking to repossess the space. Then things got twisty. The deadline for expert reports got blown and Blue Dog ended up without expert testimony backing its claims. Seyfarth negotiated a settlement at mediation but that fell apart and Blue Dog sued for malpractice. Seyfarth countered, alleging that Blue Dog was [taking bad advice](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2019/09/10/seyfarth-says-ex-lawyer-who-bribed-judges-tied-to-legal-malpractice-suit/) from a lawyer disbarred as part of the Pennsylvania “kids for cash” scheme.

But now discovery seems to have turned up an email from within Seyfarth saying that Berman needed to be removed from his cases because he was doing harm to clients. This email is attached to a proposed amended complaint that looks to be under seal, but it’s discussed in a July hearing and… doesn’t sound good! Notably absent from any staffing shuffle that Berman’s supervisors were talking about was the Blue Dog file, which Blue Dog’s attorneys see as a red flag:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Instead, they kept this entirely secret from Blue Dog. Blue Dog had no idea that the supervising partner and that the group head for litigation in the New York office were having a discussion regarding this danger presented by the lawyer assigned as lead counsel to this case. And that’s information that a client is entitled to know. That’s information that any client would want to know and would expect to be told, and Seyfarth chose, knowingly, to withhold that information.

YES, THAT DOES SEEM LIKE A PROBLEM! Seyfarth’s attorneys from MoFo characterize this as an email sent out of frustration, which doesn’t really make it better. Coupled with testimony from Berman about having a history of deadline problems and admitting that it had come up with his partners, Blue Dog sought 30(b)(6) testimony from Seyfarth on exactly what the firm was thinking about Berman: the complaints or disciplinary actions taken against him and whether he was ever actually transitioned off of other matters.

Other potential topics are getting converted into interrogatories — like the question of whether Berman was let go as part of a layoff or specifically fired — or the subject of stipulations — such as the firm admitting that they had not committed any ethics oversight in the New York office at the time. But even though Blue Dog got pushback on a number of discovery fronts, this 30(b)(6) deposition feels like a doozy. A Biglaw firm is going to have to produce someone to testify about the firm’s handling of client and internal complaints against a former partner. Playing it out in my head, it’s unclear how this works out in Seyfarth’s favor either way. The firm either had amassed a number complaints against this partner and let him work the case anyway or they hadn’t formally compiled a record despite two senior partners casually characterizing him as a threat to clients. That doesn’t necessarily mean Seyfarth ends up on the hook for the massive malpractice case, but it doesn’t put them in a great position going forward.

It’s going to be an interesting few weeks in this matter, but regardless of what happens in this case specifically, now would be a good time for firms to consider what protocols they have in place for supervising their partners to avoid this kind of mess.

Have you heard the term “big data” bandied about, but don’t really know what it means? And do you know, as a litigator, how big data can help you score big wins for your clients?

Tomorrow, June 20, at 12 p.m. (Eastern), join seasoned law firm and in-house litigators, David Tsai (Vinson &amp; Elkins) and Mark Herrmann (AON), who will share what they are seeing in their practices and offer insights on the broader litigation landscape. (Their views are their own and not those of their organizations, of course.)

They will be joined by lawyer and technologist Owen Byrd of Lex Machina, a pioneer in applying data and analytics to the practice of law. Byrd will demonstrate Lex Machina’s award-winning Legal Analytics® platform, which is expanding into its largest practice area yet: commercial litigation. Legal Analytics is a combination of data and analytics software that provides unprecedented strategic insight at your fingertips to craft winning litigation strategy.

Elon Musk tried to own the libs so hard that he [ignored basic legal advice from skilled transactional lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/twitter-complaint-demonstrates-that-every-lawyer-everywhere-always-is-smarter-than-elon-musk/). When he realized he didn’t actually want to consummate the deal, Twitter hired Wachtell to sue Musk in Delaware in a [slam-dunk litigation](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/elon-musk-will-beat-twitter-wsj-says-its-obvious-assuming-you-change-every-single-fact-and-law/). Since then, Musk turned $44 billion [into $15 billion](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-twitter-worth-a-third-of-its-44-billion-price-tag-fidelity/) (and falling) and has resorted to [sending empty legal threats](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/elon-musk-meta-facebook-threat/). The moral is… listen to your lawyers.

That’s what Twitter did during the acquisition, and that’s the subject of Musk’s latest bid for some kind of win. Well, his latest bid for some kind of win is [a dick-measuring contest](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/92263/elon-musk-calls-zuckerberg-cuck-then-proposes-literal-dick-measuring-contest/index.html), tough talk for a guy [whose mommy just stepped in to protect him from a fight](https://futurism.com/the-byte/elon-musk-mom-not-allowed-fight-mark-zuckerberg).

But his mother hasn’t stopped him from [filing a lawsuit against Wachtell](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2023/07/Twitter-Wachtell-.pdf) (UPDATE: presumably the Wachtell we all know and love, though the complaint gives the wrong address for the venerable law firm and relocates them 10 blocks away), seeking to clawback the fees the firm racked up representing Twitter and forcing Musk to go through with the Twitter deal.

Wachtell exploited a corporate client left unprotected by lame duck fiduciaries who had lost their motivation to act in Twitter’s best interest pending its imminent sale to Elon Musk and his entities, X Holdings I, Inc. and X Holdings II, Inc.

I suppose we can all agree on one thing: it was absolutely not in Twitter’s best interest to make Musk buy the company. Though it was in the best interest of Twitter’s former shareholders and that’s the constituency the fiduciaries actually served at the time.

The crux of the complaint is that Wachtell shifted its fee structure from hourly billing to feature a “success fee” payable upon the firm securing Musk’s compliance in shelling out $44 billion for the company. At that point, the roughly $17 million that Wachtell had billed by the hour transformed into $90 million.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
SCANDALOUS!!! Why would a company agree to such a wild fee arrangement that pays the firm so much more than the hours billed? Well, as one firm put it…

We believe that success-fee arrangements are the best way to synchronize the interests of the client and the lawyer. By in essence betting on ourselves, we make the client’s main priority, which is to achieve a favorable result, our own main priority.

Once engaged, we think about each case as if we were the client. Whereas traditional law firms and most of our competitors often have large cadres of associates who are focused on maximizing billable hours and generating fees, our trial teams are dedicated to one thing: preparing our clients’ cases for trial. Our fee arrangements are based on the notion that our compensation is tied to our clients’ success. Their win is our win too.

That’s from [Reid Collins & Tsai](https://reidcollins.com/why-us/success-based-fee-arrangements/)… who represent Musk in this case.

While the complaint they drafted brands the payment as “unconscionable,” $90 million in exchange for making the company’s shareholders $44 billion seems like a sweet deal. It’s a 0.2 percent contingency fee! It may make headlines to point out that this one matter accounted for around 10 percent of the Biglaw firm’s gross revenue, but that’s how it goes when firms handle arguably the highest profile non-Con Law litigation in the world last year on contingency.

So what is the basis of this complaint? Musk’s arguing that the deal breached California ethical rules because success fees must be negotiated at the outset of an engagement and Wachtell and Twitter had agreed to an hourly arrangement at first.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
This is a fair argument but the deeper one gets into the complaint, the more complicated it becomes. After Musk relented to buying Twitter, the line between litigation and M&A started to blur. Wachtell, presumably, participated in those discussions as part of getting the client to the finish line while preserving its rights in court if Musk tried to pull out again.

And the complaint seems to acknowledge this:

Wachtell’s October 20 fee memo to Sean Edgett stated, “You have asked us to supply information regarding fee arrangements comparable to the arrangements contemplated in WLRK’s Twitter engagement.” See Exhibit 7. The memo first discussed “Engagement fees as a percentage of banker fees,” claiming that “[a]s we discussed, in engagements related to pending transactions as to which a premium fee is contemplated, our Firm often receives a fee in the range of 60 to 80 percent of the fees paid to investment advisors.”

This sounds like a transactional agreement. So, was the firm really changing the terms of its litigation engagement or opening new talks on the comprehensive fees involved in both litigating and advising on a deal?

The complaint notes that the October 20 memo doesn’t explicitly spell out this distinction, though the fact that there’s even a colorable reason why a firm might seek a new fee structure seems troubling for Musk’s case. The complaint criticizes the idea that Wachtell could seek a success fee after “deal closing was imminent,” given the “extremely unlikely event that the merger failed to close at the last minute” even though the buyer HAD ALREADY FORCED EVERYONE TO COURT FOR NOT HONORING AN IRON-CLAD AGREEMENT ALREADY.

The complaint opines that Twitter is an unsophisticated party exploited by the much smarter lawyers and… good luck with the “legal officers for global tech company as widows and orphans” argument. But failing that, the complaint argues that the Twitter executives were disgruntled and openly defying closing directives:

The Closing Day Directive was an unequivocal statement on behalf of Twitter’s residual claimants of the corporation’s preference to pause outbound payments pending that day’s closing so that the company’s new owner could have “a reasonable opportunity to review such payments.”

This wasn’t the intent of the allegation, but “the former executives were on notice that we intended to breach the company’s contractual obligations” isn’t the killer argument Musk thinks it is.

And, abstracted from the technicalities, is the whole issue. To what extent can a disgruntled buyer clawback the funds spent forcing him to buy the company? Because if that’s the precedent, why would any firm represent a target corporation? The firm would essentially be agreeing to a “failure fee,” only able to guarantee payment if it failed to close the deal and open the door for the acquirer to void the engagement terms.

Obviously, there can be some hypothetical scenario where a law firm is really trying to unethically screw over the acquirer. But the standard for enforcing that sort of second-guessing has got to be awfully high.

Like, this kinda high.

# Putting Humans First: Solving Real-Life Problems With Legal Innovation
## Placing the end-user at the heart of the process allows innovators to identify pain points and create solutions that directly address the unique needs and challenges individuals and businesses face.

“Legal industry must focus on solving end-user problems,” Art Shaikh, founder and CEO of DigitalWill.com, passionately declared over dinner, bringing attention to a crucial perspective often overlooked in discussions about legal innovation. While the legal field tends to revolve around lawyers, documents, regulations, and filings, an equally important parallel world of personal problems is intertwined with legal issues. Similarly, within the business realm, a symbiotic relationship exists between business problems and legal problems. Art firmly believes that true legal innovation should start by addressing the human experience within these interconnected worlds.

To ensure legal innovation stays true to its purpose of solving human problems, Art recommends several other key considerations that must be kept in mind:

Understanding the human context surrounding the legal issue at hand is absolutely crucial. This is especially important when considering the challenges individuals and businesses face when using complex legal tools. Taking the time to empathize with the end-users affected by these tools provides invaluable insights into their unique needs, the difficulties they encounter, and their aspirations. 

Notably, the adoption rates of essential legal tools, such as wills, remain alarmingly low, with [68% of Americans](https://theconversation.com/68-of-americans-do-not-have-a-will-137686) currently without a will. Recognizing the barriers and frustrations experienced by end-users in accessing and utilizing these tools, legal innovators can craft intuitive, user-friendly, and highly effective solutions, ultimately making a meaningful impact in the lives of those they serve.

Adopting a user-centered approach is of the utmost importance in legal innovation. Placing the end-user at the heart of the process allows innovators to identify pain points and create solutions that directly address the unique needs and challenges individuals and businesses face. Engaging stakeholders throughout the design process, actively seeking their feedback, and involving them in decision-making fosters a collaborative environment that leads to iterative refinement and better outcomes. 

Moreover, paying careful attention to the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) is crucial. A well-designed UI/UX enhances the usability and accessibility of legal solutions, enabling users to navigate the complexities of the legal landscape with ease, and promoting efficiency and satisfaction. By creating intuitive interfaces and seamless interactions, legal innovators can empower end-users and deliver transformative experiences that align with their evolving needs.

Workable AI technology plays a pivotal role in legal tech innovation, offering transformative possibilities for the legal community. By harnessing AI technologies like natural language processing, machine learning algorithms, and workflow automation, the application of Workable AI presents a transformative solution to these challenges. Through user-friendly AI-guided applications, individuals can easily navigate the complexities of will and estate panning.

Embracing these advancements streamlines processes optimizes efficiency, and enhances the accessibility and affordability of legal services. Online dispute-resolution platforms and AI-powered legal research tools are examples of Workable AI solutions that bridge the gap between human problems and legal solutions, revolutionizing how legal professionals serve clients. 

Furthermore, simplifying complex legal processes, language, and procedures cannot be overstated. The legal system often appears intimidating and overwhelming, posing significant challenges for individuals and businesses seeking legal guidance. However, by simplifying these complexities, legal innovators can create a more user-friendly environment that eliminates unnecessary jargon and fosters confidence in navigating the legal landscape. 

Clear and concise communication, plain language, and intuitive interfaces play a crucial role in empowering individuals to understand their legal rights and obligations. By breaking down barriers and demystifying legal concepts, innovators bridge the gap between legal expertise and everyday users, enabling them to navigate the legal system with ease and certainty. This focus on simplification enhances accessibility, promotes transparency.

Data privacy, security, and ethical considerations must always take center stage in legal innovation. Upholding ethical standards and prioritizing the protection of individuals’ rights and privacy are of the utmost importance. Innovators should be proactive in addressing potential ethical implications throughout the development and implementation stages, ensuring transparency and fostering trust with users.

Legal innovation must prioritize solving human problems. Legal innovators can create transformative solutions by understanding the human context, adopting a user-centered approach, embracing technology, simplifying complex processes, enhancing access to justice, fostering collaboration, and emphasizing ethical considerations. 

It is essential to remember that law exists to serve humanity, and legal innovation should never lose sight of that fundamental truth. Art’s realization highlights the inherent interconnectedness between personal life, business operations, and the law, emphasizing the need for legal innovation to address human experiences effectively.

# Taylor Swift's Biglaw Attorney Has A Blank Space Where Constitutional Law Should Be
## Sometimes the client is wrong -- it's the lawyer's job to tell them.

Taylor Swift (Photo by Karwai Tang/WireImage)

The blog PopFront [published an article](http://popfront.us/2017/09/swiftly-to-the-alt-right-taylor-subtly-get-the-lower-case-kkk-in-formation/) presenting a fairly detailed argument that Taylor Swift is at the very least unwittingly seen as an icon by the forces of racial hatred and at worst willingly fanning the flames of that base. It’s a thought-provoking piece and should inspire Swift to reconsider a number of her artistic and personal choices as a public figure.

But instead it inspired her to engage an attorney to write a ridiculous cease and desist letter. Taylor’s been known to [hang out with Barbra Streisand before](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/b9/aa/7e/b9aa7ee48208a2c31cff83d8990aa029--barbra-streisand-taylor-swift.jpg), and apparently she’s now taking [Barbra’s lessons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect) on how to deal with the Internet, because it’s probably safe to say more people have read PopFront’s post in the last 24 hours than did during its initial publication.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The unlucky lawyer who’ll be forever attached to Swift’s laughable effort to intimidate PopFront is Venable LLP partner [William J. Briggs II](https://www.venable.com/william-j-briggs/). Oh, Taylor, look what you made him do!

In his long cease & desist letter to Meghan Herning, the Executive Editor of PopFront, Briggs offers the standard overreaching factual misrepresentations and hyperbolic threats about defamation per se (the last refuge of the impugned celebrity!), but provides an exceedingly light helping of caselaw for a four-page letter. He’s got a blank space, baby, and he’ll write your name, assuming your name isn’t a citation to any legally binding precedent.

But the real knee-slapper is in the last paragraph [of the Briggs letter](https://www.aclunc.org/docs/REDACTED_v1_Taylor_Swift_PopFront_letter.pdf):

That’s not how this works. That’s not how any of this works. (UPDATE: And [it’s been tried before](https://randazza.wordpress.com/2014/11/04/i-declare-confidentiality/) and it wasn’t how it worked then either.)

The generous interpretation is that Briggs had some inkling that this was ridiculous, but threw this in when his client freaked out that she wanted the legal equivalent of having her cake and eating it too: successfully bullying a critic without anyone ever hearing about it. At that point Briggs threw together the only concepts he could brainstorm that might silence an online essayist without access to legal counsel. But the customer isn’t always right, and it’s the attorney’s job to protect the client from themselves. That said, that’s the generous interpretation — we shouldn’t rule out completely that he honestly thought the Copyright Act protected his cease and desist letter.

Unfortunately, either way Briggs and Swift underestimated the possibility that a beleaguered writer might pique the interest of the ACLU of Northern California. In a scathing response, attorneys Michael Risher, Christine Sun, and Matt Cagle systematically dismantle the Briggs letter, with legal acumen and pointed wit. However, they save some of their most devastating swipes for the claim that cease and desist letters cannot be published. After noting that legal threats aren’t confidential (“you cannot really expect that a person who receives a letter like this will feel any duty to keep this matter a little secret between the two of you”), the letter walks through the basics of Fair Use:

Attaching the letter to this one transforms it from a clumsy legal threat to suppress constitutionally protected speech into an exposé of that attempt in order to educate others who might receive these types of letters that they need not be intimidated. Although the text of the letter has not changed, the use has, which weighs in favor of fair use.

Assuming fair use is even at issue when there’s no real copyright claim to the underlying letter:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Copyright is meant to “promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts,” not to allow lawyers to send threatening, speech-suppressing letters in secret. See U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 8. It cannot be used “as a sword to suppress publication of embarrassing content rather than as a shield to protect … intellectual property.” Online Policy Grp. v. Diebold, Inc., 337 F. Supp. 2d 1195, 1205 (N.D. Cal. 2004). In short, you may no more use copyright law to hide the contents of your letter from public scrutiny than a kidnapper could use it to prevent his victim’s family from giving a copy of the ransom note to the police.

Dear William Briggs, I’m going to let you finish, but the ACLU of Northern California has written one of the best letters of all time.

Welcome back to [The Pink Ghetto](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-pink-ghetto/), a series where we take a look at some of the most appalling stories from one of the most sexist industries in the world: the legal profession. Today, we have a story about a serial sexual harraser who has moved from Biglaw firm to Biglaw firm, racking up “HR issues” along the way. These are real emails that we’ve received from real readers.

When you see things like this happening, say something. Together, we can inspire the change necessary to stop this disturbing behavior from being so prevalent in the law. We owe it to ourselves and to future generations of women in the law.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
I write to you today to tell you about a Biglaw partner, a well-known misogynist and sexual harasser who has bounced from one firm to another, riding the coattails of the competent lawyers around him while using his power to oppress and abuse women. He came to our firm under a cloud of suspicion that his departure was related to sexual misconduct at his prior firm. But it didn’t take long for his prologue to become present. He was horrifically misogynistic — condescending and abusive to women, chummy and respectful to men. He was known to subject young male associates to all manner of “locker room talk” about women. Despite being married, he conducted an extremely ill-concealed affair with a paralegal. This was all conducted in the open, and our firm tolerated it with rolled eyes. When he left for another firm, management was left to clean up what they politely called “an HR issue” in his wake.

There is nobody with an ear to the legal market who does not know who and what this man is. And when he rapes a summer associate someday, we will all say, “We knew something, but we never thought that would happen” — and we will all be lying.

Do you have a law school or law firm story you’d like to see appear in The Pink Ghetto? [Email me](mailto:staci@abovethelaw.com?subject=The%20Pink%20Ghetto) (subject line: “The Pink Ghetto”) or find me on Twitter, [@StaciZaretsky](https://twitter.com/stacizaretsky).

More Biglaw bonus news! The list of which firms are stepping up to pay associates the generous market bonuses — ~15 percent over last year’s annual bonuses plus special bonuses — is constantly growing, with yet another top firm ponying up money for its attorneys.

O’Melveny & Myers, which took in $835,097,000 in gross revenue in 2020, making it 54th on the Am Law 100, announced their bonuses today. As is their tradition, OMM announced bonuses via voicemail, so there’s no memo to share with everyone. But, we understand the firm is paying full market bonuses as well as special bonuses. Here are both of those bonus scales, in case you’ve somehow forgotten:

At OMM bonuses are paid in February, meaning folks will have to be a little patient to actually take home their bonus money.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks for all of your help!

# Biglaw Firm Gives Great News Before The Holiday Weekend -- All Salary Cuts Are Over
## And the firm is considering make-whole payments before the end of the year.

Labor Day is the official end of summer, so it makes sense that the summer of COVID-19 austerity measures is over right before the holiday. Tipsters at Troutman Pepper — the newly merged entity that combined Troutman Sanders and Pepper Hamilton — tell Above the Law that salary cuts are officially done at the firm.

[Right before Memorial Day](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/announcing-salary-cuts-the-friday-afternoon-before-a-3-day-weekend-leads-to-some-angry-associates/) Troutman Sanders took a carving knife to salaries — 20 percent pay cuts for associates, 25 percent cuts for income partners, and equity partners took at 30 percent hit. ([Pepper Hamilton announced similar cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/biglaw-firm-cuts-associate-salaries-as-it-continues-soldiering-on-with-merger/?rf=1), the merger wasn’t official [until July 1](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/biglaw-firms-complete-big-money-merger-during-pandemic/).) And even though associates at the firms understood the cuts would go on through the end of 2020, the firm announced today that, effective September 1, the cuts were done.

And as added good news, the firm noted in the announcement that it is their “goal to repay all amounts previously withheld before the end of the year, depending of course on the financial performance of the Firm.” Hopefully the firm will be able to follow through on these make-whole payments.

# What I Learned From My First Day In An Office In 4 Years
## Spending at least some time in the office might be helpful for many lawyers.

Virtual work has been all the rage since the COVID-19 pandemic began because many workplaces needed to promote remote work in order to socially distance due to the virus. Of course, virtual work existed for many years before COVID-19 hit, and I started working virtually in early 2019 when I started my own law firm. However, shortly after I opened my own law firm, I secured a physical office so that I would have a place to store files and meet clients, but I rarely went there. If I did travel to this office, I only spent an hour or two at a time at this location. I reasoned that traveling to and from an office was inefficient, and I could save money and time by simply working from home. However, my law firm recently secured a much larger office, and I decided to spend my first full day in an office since I started my own law firm around four years ago. The experience was positive, and made me believe that at least some office time might be helpful for many lawyers.

The first thing I noticed about working in an office rather than working at home is the energy I got from being in an office. My firm’s main office is located in midtown Manhattan, and the office has views of the bustling streets below. Seeing the sights of the city and hearing the sounds of the metropolis definitely added to my energy levels and impacted how I felt about my job. Most of the time I work from home, I work in my gym clothes with my TV on in the background. However, dressing up in business clothes and working in my office in the city was definitely a change of pace that made me feel more confident. I am unsure if this impacted my work product, but I definitely felt like I was taking myself more seriously when I was working our midtown Manhattan office than when I work from home.

Another thing I noticed about being in an office is the socializing effect being in an office can have on a firm. When most people talk about why it is important to have an office, they speak about collaboration and how it is easier to share ideas when people see each other in an office. I am not too convinced that this is the case, and people can collaborate in many ways, including through text, WhatsApp, or through a variety of other mediums.

However, it is much more difficult to have impromptu, unplanned, social interactions with people remotely than when people work in an office. When people are at the same workplace, they can bump into each other, talk about their weekends, share a joke, or otherwise socialize in ways that are much more difficult through remote means. Indeed, when I was in the office, the only other person around was my partner/brother, but we had a good time chatting and joking around throughout the day, as well as collaborating about client tasks.

Although it might not be readily apparent, informal social interactions are really important for creating a team mentality. When people collaborate on projects, it is much easier for people to know how to communicate things or approach certain parts of a task if they have a better understanding of their teammates through social interactions. Fostering a team mentality can be important to group projects and other tasks associates and staff complete in the course of their days, and fostering social interactions is important to making everyone on a team more efficient.

Another thing that I noticed about working in an office is that people can definitely be more productive in offices than at home. When I am at home, there are tons of distractions all around me, since the gym is a short walk away, my TV is literally inches from my desk, and I am more tempted to handle personal chores during the workday. However, when I was in the office for that one day, there were none of those distractions, and it was much easier to grind away at work tasks. Of course, I often arrange my days while working from home so that work and personal tasks are intertwined so I do not get burned out by devoting all of my energy to work. However, it is hard to dispute that people are far more likely to be more productive in offices than at home since there are fewer things that can distract attorneys and staff from work tasks.

All told, after working in an office for a full day for the first time in years, I definitely came to appreciate how useful at least a little office time can be. Of course, I’m still in favor of a mostly virtual work environment, but adding at least a day or so a week in an office can have a number of benefits.

# Small Law’s Big Thank You To Biglaw For Raising Associate Salaries
## Where do you think small law firm lawyers come from?

Dear Biglaw,

As I write this letter, [seven](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises-2018/) members of your illustrious family have followed [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/)’s lead and [upped starting salaries for incoming associates](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/Some_law_firms_match_milbanks_190k_starting_pay_for_associates/?icn=most_read) to a stratospheric $190,000. Yet sadly, your benevolence has generated nothing but nasty criticism from [ungrateful clients](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/the-tone-deafness-is-astounding-an-in-house-hot-take-on-the-190k-salary-scale/) unwilling to subsidize your generosity or [envious competitors](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/greenberg-traurig-explains-why-its-too-cheap-to-raise-associate-salaries/) who’ve sniped that these higher salaries will put more pressure on already overworked associates to work even harder. So that’s why I wanted to reach out and offer you support from the unlikeliest corner of the legal profession: the solo and small firm community.

I’m guessing that my letter will catch you off-guard. After all, as Biglaw, you probably expect us solo and small law firm owners to envy the largesse that you’ve conferred on baby associates by dint of their GPAs, law review credentials and clerkships. Well then, you’d be surprised. Many of us solos and smalls are doing [quite well](https://myshingle.com/2018/05/articles/future-trends/solo-small-firm-lawyers-average-198k-year/), thank you very much and we relish the satisfaction that comes from the [innovation](https://myshingle.com/2018/05/articles/future-trends/biglaw-attorneys-get-paid-to-innovate-solos-smalls-innovate-to-get-paid/) and [constant hustle](https://myshingle.com/2011/03/articles/web-tech/always-on/) that it took us to get here.

Still Biglaw, as you know better than anyone, the practice of law today is a competitive business, demanding efficiency and cost-effective practices. As a result, many solo and smalls who seek to hire associates or of counsel to grow their practices don’t always have the resources to attract smart newbies by matching Biglaw salaries. But now that you’ve raised incoming salaries to $190,000, those new associates can pay down debt more quickly, making them available to solos and smalls as a potential source of labor at an even faster rate.

Moreover, even if those ungrateful corporate clients of yours refuse to pay you to train new associates, many of those who depart your hallowed halls will leave with useful experience acquired on your dime and your time. If your clients won’t let you staff cases with newbies, chances are, you’ll have them gain skills through alternative means such as handling pro bono projects to gain litigation experience, attending pricy CLE, earning [billable hours credit for mastering new tech](https://myshingle.com/2018/05/articles/future-trends/biglaw-attorneys-get-paid-to-innovate-solos-smalls-innovate-to-get-paid/), or best of all, assuming marketing tasks like writing blog posts or participating in social media. In short, after their time at Biglaw, those associates will be ripe for practice at solo and small law firms.

Now, I suppose that you’re thinking that I’m assuming facts not in evidence — specifically, the fact that your well-compensated associates will want to leave behind what many view as the brass ring of the legal profession to slum it down at the county courthouse with solos and smalls. Wrong again. Just as technology has changed Biglaw practice, it’s changed solo and small firm practice too. Every day, tech is responsible for creating [practice areas that didn’t exist](https://myshingle.com/2018/01/articles/future-trends/40-legal-practice-areas-that-didnt-exist-15-years-ago/) and that touch the majority of the population. So you’ll find solo and small firm lawyers in the most pedestrian practice areas like probate or family law dealing with cutting-edge issues like Bitcoin (how to account for it in a will or divorce), assisted reproductive technology (who gets custody of the embryos and what happens to them when the parents die), just to name a few. Likewise, privacy law, cannabis law, cyberbullying have opened other practice opportunities for solos and smalls.

Biglaw, the bottom line is this: your associates went to law school for a reason. Those who went to get rich will soon discover that Biglaw salaries are paltry compared to what they might make running a law firm or starting a legal tech company. Those who went to law school to represent [real clients](https://myshingle.com/2009/01/articles/operations/solos-do-everything-biglaw-does-only-backwards-and-in-high-heels/) or [leave a legacy behind](https://myshingle.com/2017/07/articles/inspiration-encouragement/trading-big-law-for-legacy/) will soon tire of waiting, no matter how comfortable they are (as for those content to stay, most of us solos and smalls wouldn’t want them anyway). And those women who went because they wanted to have a career that would allow them to spend time with family will leave when they discover the [paucity of opportunities](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/why-doesnt-the-legal-profession-view-women-owned-solo-and-small-law-firms-as-relevant-to-diversity/) available to them, particularly if they seek work alternatives. Once your associates are debt-free and wake up and wonder what’s next, they will rappel from your steel towers and open workspaces and old boys’ networks for more rewarding pastures, including solo and small firm practice. Where my colleagues and I will embrace them with open arms.

Biglaw, you get a bad rap. The media portrays you as a greedy institution that cares only about profit. Yet with this next round of salary increases you’ve shown that you’re willing to care for and train solos’ and smalls’ future employees and colleagues, and your future competitors. What could be more selfless than that?

All the best from your lowly relations,

# The 2016 Am Law 100: Trouble Ahead?
## Some firms did exceptionally well, such as Silicon Valley powerhouses and Wachtell Lipton, but for many other firms, danger looms on the horizon.

Call me Chicken Little. I’ve been waiting for the sky to fall on Biglaw for a while now. But this year I might be right. Last year was marked by slowing growth, which is generally the transition from boom to bust.

Yesterday the American Lawyer issued its eagerly anticipated [Am Law 100 rankings](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202489912232/The-2016-Am-Law-100-Growth-Slows-for-Big-Law--?mcode=1202615717726&slreturn=20160326104553). In 2015, for the sixth year in a row, the nation’s 100 biggest law firms by revenue enjoyed overall growth in critical measures like overall revenue, revenue per lawyer, and profits per partner. But as noted by Am Law, “despite a record year for U.S. mergers and acquisitions, the continued flattening of demand for legal services and patchy conditions in core markets, particularly in Europe, saw growth slow to its lowest level since the Great Recession seven years ago.”

Before we talk about specific firms, let’s check out the overall stats about how the Am Law 100 performed in 2015:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
- Total revenue: $83.1 billion, up by 2.7 percent (a new record).
- Total net income: $328.1 million $32.8 billion, up by 3.3 percent.
[UPDATE (4/27/2016, 10:15 a.m.): An alert reader raised this typo with us; we raised it with Am Law, and they corrected it.]
- Average revenue per lawyer: $894,253, up by 2.6 percent.
- Average profits per partner: $1.61 million, up by 4 percent.
So 2015 witnessed weaker growth than 2014, when these same figures grew by 4.6 percent, 7.4 percent, 3.7 percent, and 5.3 percent, respectively. As Am Law [points out](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202755430908), “excluding the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, when The Am Law 100 contracted across most metrics, you’d have to go back more than two decades, to 1993, when the U.S. was still recovering from another recession, to find lower year-over-year increases in collective top and bottom lines.”

And headcount, another indicator of Biglaw health, didn’t tell a happy tale either. The total number of lawyers in the Am Law 100 stayed basically flat, at just below 93,000, and the total number of equity partners actually dropped by 0.6 percent, to 20,337. That dip – the first annual decline since 2009, per Am Law – caused profits per partner (PPP) figures to look better than they should have. Of the 77 firms that grew PPP in 2015, 10 would have actually posted declines in PPP if not for their reduction of equity partners.

Here are some additional themes identified by the American Lawyer’s [Chris Johnson](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202755430908):

— Despite mediocre growth overall, several firms had a stunning year. And the gap between firms at the top of The Am Law 100 and the bottom grows ever wider.

— West Coast beats East: Elite New York firms struggled for growth despite a bumper year for high-end M&A, while those in Silicon Valley feasted on a frothy tech market.

Am Law mentions Wilson Sonsini and Cooley, which each grew revenue by almost 14 percent, and Fenwick & West, which enjoyed an 11 percent increase in revenue. All three firms enjoyed lots of IPO and M&A work in 2015.

— Consolidation continued to reshape The Am Law 100, with major law firm mergers and acquisitions helping two firms charge up the rankings.

— The makeup of The Am Law 100 changed little from last year. (Yes, Latham, you’re still No. 1.) Three new firms joined the list; three dropped off. A noticeable absence: Dentons, which no longer qualifies as a U.S. firm, which we define as having a plurality of lawyers in the U.S., after its merger last year with China’s Dacheng.

Congrats to the three returning firms: Ballard Spahr, Cozen O’Connor, and Mintz Levin. Condolences to the three departing firms: Bracewell (fka Bracewell & Giuliani), the now-defunct Bingham, and the aforementioned Dentons.

Now let’s dig into specific metrics: the top firms by gross revenue, revenue per lawyer, and profits per partner….

Former Holland & Hart partner Christopher Kulish, 62, died earlier this week after he reached the summit of Mount Everest. Kulish began his career as a patent attorney in 1997. And from 2002-2009, he was a partner in the Boulder office of Holland & Hart.

The firm offered a statement [on Kulish’s passing:](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/05/28/holland-hart-mourns-ex-partner-who-died-during-everest-climb/)

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“Chris was a partner in our patent group in the Boulder office from 2002 to 2009,” Holland & Hart said in a statement. ”Chris will be remembered as a friend and an excellent patent attorney. We are deeply saddened to learn of his death, and extend our sympathies to his family and friends.”

After leaving Holland & Hart, Kulish opened his own firm. He remained a solo practitioner until his death.

As [reported by](https://biglawbusiness.com/former-holland-hart-partner-dies-on-mount-everest) Big Law Business, like so many attorneys, Kulish found his passion outside of the legal profession:

Mark Kulish described his brother Christopher as an attorney in his “day job.” He said his brother was an “inveterate climber of peaks in Colorado, the West and the world over” and a member of the “7 Summit Club,” as he had reached the summit of the highest peaks on every continent.

In a statement, his brother noted Kulish accomplished his goal of summiting the peak before he passed:

“He saw his last sunrise from the highest peak on Earth,” his brother, Mark Kulish said in a Monday statement to The Denver Post. “We are heartbroken at this news.”

The increasingly dangerous conditions on the famous mountain are getting a lot of attention recently. A record 381 permits were issued to scale the mountain this year, with “traffic jams” noted on clear days.

This pic of the line to the Everest summit has gotten a lot of attention, but apparently many news orgs/photo agencies haven’t given credit to the photog [@nimsdai](https://twitter.com/nimsdai?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw). He also hasn’t been paid for it.

He risked his life to take this photo…he had to take his gloves off at 29k feet! [pic.twitter.com/88lEii83Ev](https://t.co/88lEii83Ev)

Thus far, 11 people have died on Everest this year, including another American, Don Cash of Utah.

# How To Cost Your Biglaw Firm $62 Million
## Not the best way to handle conflicts of interest.

You might suffer from imposter syndrome and feel like you have no idea what you’re doing, but at least you didn’t cost your Biglaw firm $62 million. So you’re doing better than Husch Blackwell partner [Charles Renner](https://www.huschblackwell.com/professionals/charles-renner).

According to [reporting by](https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article271554162.html) the Kansas City Star, Husch Blackwell found itself on the losing end of an arbitration against engineering firm Burns & McDonnell. The engineering firm blames Husch Blackwell and Renner for losing out on a contract to build the new Kansas City airport, arguing that Renner used his position as outside counsel for the city council to tank Burns & McDonnell’s bid in favor of Edgemoor Infrastructure and Real Estate, a company Renner represented.

But the story gets even messier — that’s because Husch Blackwell and partner [Ken Slavens](https://www.huschblackwell.com/professionals/ken-slavens) have represented Burns & McDonnell since 1981. In fact, between 2007 and 2017, Husch Blackwell sought conflict of interest waivers 11 different times from Burns & McDonnell, something that weighed in the engineering firm’s favor, according to the arbitration panel.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
In 2017, Burns & McDonnell began conversations with city officials about a “sole-source” airport proposal where they would raise the funding for the project — initial projections for the amount of public funding required for the project proved politically untenable — and receive an exclusive contract for the airport. When these behind-closed-door negotiations became public, that’s when Burns & McDonnell says the sabotage began.

When word of a possible deal began to leak, Renner, an attorney specializing in public-private partnerships, pitched his services to Burns & McDonnell. Would their firm be interested in retaining him and Husch Blackwell for the KCI project?

“Renner’s email solicitation was politely declined,” the panel writes.

The following day — May 11, 2017 — Renner began pitching council members on hiring him and Husch Blackwell as outside counsel for the city on the airport project. He also offered his opinion that Burns & McDonnell’s no-bid deal would be bad for the city and that it should be opened up for a competitive bid process.

Renner was quoted in a May 12, 2017, KSHB story on the airport proposal and was critical of it. This raised the attention of Burns & McDonnell’s in-house counsel who asked Slavens about it. However, internal documents quoted in the arbitration panel’s decision reveal Renner denied talking to the press about the airport project, writing to Slavens,  “I never spoke to that reporter other than to decline an interview. I have made no comment about the bidding process on this deal to the media at all.”

But that’s not what the documents reveal. In fact, the panel wrote, “Renner intentionally misled Husch’s client about his activities,” because he certainly seemed to have a lot of opinions on the project he was sharing with the press.

Just a few days before, Renner had given a KSHB reporter permission to use a quote he’d previously given to the Business Journal, recommending that the airport project be opened up to more competition. “That quote is from a while back but it is an accurate quote,” Renner wrote in an email to the reporter.

Renner also failed to disclose to Slavens (and ultimately Burns & McDonnell) that he had been emailing information on public-private partnership “best practices” to a Star reporter. These off-the-record communications, which were tacitly skeptical of the Burns & McDonnell plan, had occurred just two hours before Renner’s call with Slavens.

But the press weren’t the only ones getting an earful of Renner’s thoughts on the project.

Nor did Renner mention that he’d spent the past few days expressing skepticism of Burns & McDonnell’s plan to council members, telling them that it was “uniquely lacking,” “bad for the city” and “has more of a ‘back of the napkin’ feel,” according to emails and texts that surfaced during the arbitration dispute.

These actions were particularly noteworthy to the arbitration panel, as they wrote, “There is no dispute that Renner knew that Burns & McDonnell was a client of the Husch law firm. His failure to disclose comments he had made to members of the City Council is a violation of his duty of loyalty to the firm’s client.”

A short time later, Renner and Husch Blackwell were hired by the city (along with WilmerHale) as outside counsel on the airport project.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Two firms working together, Maryland-based Edgemoor and the local firm McCownGordon Construction, also became contenders for the airport job. Renner’s previous work for Edgemoor was disclosed to the city council. The city determined that Renner’s legal entanglement with Edgemoor ended in May 2016, and he could serve as outside counsel on the project without conflict.

But that’s not what the arbitration panel said, “[Renner and Husch] failed to disclose their continued contacts and communications … with executives of Edgemoor and McCownGordon regarding the KCI airport terminal project. Ongoing meetings, dinners, emails and phone conferences occurred throughout all of 2016 and into 2017.”

Though the city opened up the bidding to other firms, Burns & McDonnell initially had the right to match or exceed other proposals. However, Renner convinced the city council to drop that Swiss Challenge provision. He also got the city counsel to extend the deadline to submit proposals, something Edgemoor’s managing director called “good news” in correspondence with Renner.

Renner’s work on both sides of the negotiations — as the city’s outside counsel while at the same time doing work on the airport project for Edgemoor — was in conflict with the firm’s longstanding obligations to Burns & McDonnell.

And in August 2017 — while Renner was serving as counsel for the city — Husch lawyers drafted a term sheet and memorandum of understanding for Edgemoor to design and build the new airport, unbeknownst to Burns & McDonnell.

“While Husch was preparing these documents and billing the city for the legal work, Renner still maintained favoritism and a legal confidential relationship with Edgemoor, all in direct competition with, and adverse to the interest of, Burns & McDonnell in the competitive bid process,” the panel wrote. “This conflict continued and went undisclosed by Renner and Husch. Burns & McDonnell was unaware of the material facts relating to this conflict of interest. The acts described above amount to a separate and ongoing conflict, and breach of Renner and Husch’s duty of loyalty to Burns & McDonnell.”

Edgemoor was awarded the airport contract with members of the city council testifying that they were told by Renner they couldn’t vote for Burns & McDonnell’s proposal since it was out of compliance with city’s master bond ordinance. That master bond ordinance was later amended when it was discovered the winning bid from Edgemoor was out of compliance with it.

Because the dispute was resolved via confidential arbitration, neither party has offered a comment on the case:

“Husch Blackwell and Burns & McDonnell have a dispute relating to the professional services provided by Husch Blackwell to Burns & McDonnell. Husch Blackwell and Burns & McDonnell agreed to submit their dispute to confidential and binding arbitration. Because of the confidential nature of the arbitration proceedings, the parties are unable to comment on this matter.”

The arbitration panel awarded Burns & McDonnell $62 million, which equals the profit they expected if awarded the airport contract.

And professional responsibility law professors were gifted a wild set of facts they can pull hypos out of for years to come.

# Biglaw Partner Bracketing Clause And Writing 'F*#k,' Sufficient To Get Malpractice Claim To Trial
## What's $636 million among friends and attorneys?

Proskauer’s effort to avoid trial in a $636 million malpractice claim failed yesterday as Suffolk County Superior Court Justice Kenneth Salinger [denied the Biglaw firm’s motion for summary judgment](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/proskauer-malpractice-636-million-trial/2/). There are a lot of reasons laid out in the order, though one detail that doesn’t earn a starring role in the opinion might be the most problematic for the firm.

The action, brought by former Proskauer client Robert Adelman, alleges that he missed out on his share of a multibillion-dollar hedge fund because the underlying agreement allowed the fund’s manager to unceremoniously boot Adelman. Now represented by Susman Godfrey, Adelman blames Proskauer attorneys for overlooking the offending clause. Per [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/law-firm-proskauer-must-face-trial-636-million-legal-malpractice-case-2023-05-16/):

Adelman accused the firm of committing a “botched cut-and-paste” job with the partnership agreement. He cited handwritten notes from Proskauer partner Sarah Cherry, who allegedly drew brackets around the key provision that gave Aghazadeh broad authority and wrote the word “fuck” next to it, indicating a mistake.

Maybe they were just admiring their work. You know… like, “fuuuuuck, man!” Something like that? No? Fine.

For its part, Proskauer, represented by Williams & Connolly, argued that it can’t be blamed for the actions of the fund’s manager. That the fund’s manager could only take those actions based on the clause in the agreement apparently loomed a bit larger for the court. At least large enough to turn over to a jury.

The case advances to a July pre-trial conference unless the parties work out a settlement.

If they do settle, maybe give that agreement a good once-over before signing.

# Without Layoffs Or Salary Cuts, Some Biglaw Firms May Not Survive COVID-19
## At-risk firms are running out of time, and more than a handful could close their doors as a result.

I don’t see how all 81 of the low-margin, no-comp-cut, firms can survive. Let’s say either the data are wrong, or the revenue outlook is stronger, for a half of these firms. That would mean 40 firms come under partner departure pressure. If departures take hold at, say, just a third of these firms then, in round numbers, ten to fifteen firms will go under.

— [Hugh A. Simons](https://twitter.com/simonshugh?lang=en), formerly a senior partner and executive committee member at The Boston Consulting Group and chief operating officer and policy committee member at Ropes & Gray, arguing that more Biglaw firms [need to cut salaries or conduct layoffs](https://www.law.com/2020/04/27/why-more-firms-should-cut-salaries-sooner-rather-than-later/), because, as he notes in his well-reasoned essay, “Absent significant movement, and soon, this will not end well.”

Ralph Baxter

[Ralph Baxter](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.ralphbaxter.com_&d=CwMFAg&c=4ZIZThykDLcoWk-GVjSLm9hvvvzvGv0FLoWSRuCSs5Q&r=uSo4FDmaZWT61HmkVAWAWO-8HP5Xy7ugCdYJbJf4qhbTsy3l5iPz3vHdiRZOi_KO&m=IhOe07tq_lLV3C3tAIaEvGKU9HmiL5_X65jUeMIPQV4&s=0Kvyk7-JNjJN4a3tHjpRLO5MqthkQq1ndY7JzVnExyI&e=) wanted to be a lawyer “mainly because [he] loved Perry Mason.” This young Perry Mason worked hard and gained a tremendous reputation as an attorney, eventually assuming leadership of [Orrick](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.orrick.com_Pages_default.aspx&d=CwMFAg&c=4ZIZThykDLcoWk-GVjSLm9hvvvzvGv0FLoWSRuCSs5Q&r=uSo4FDmaZWT61HmkVAWAWO-8HP5Xy7ugCdYJbJf4qhbTsy3l5iPz3vHdiRZOi_KO&m=IhOe07tq_lLV3C3tAIaEvGKU9HmiL5_X65jUeMIPQV4&s=hY9ky6G4vI5dC6cP357b8Vq3SQ3eE5TfTumMyVJm6_A&e=) and heading the firm for an astonishing 23 years as chairman and CEO. Under his tenure, Ralph grew the California firm into a global powerhouse with over 1,100 lawyers across 25 offices. Ralph was recognized as a top attorney by everyone and anyone: “Top 100 Most Influential Lawyers” by the National Law Journal, “Most Innovative Managing Partner” by Law 360 for two years in a row (2011 and 2012), and the accolades go on and on.

So what’s left after a legal career like that? On his blog, Ralph describes himself now as an “advisor, writer & speaker on the legal profession.” Eschewing a life of resting on his laurels, Ralph turned his unstoppable energy to the alt.legal movement. In Mason-like fashion, he is well-known for investigating and masterfully wrestling with today’s issues in the legal industry from the perspective of innovation and technology. Today, Ralph is a godfather and revered voice in the alt.legal community, advising startups and transforming the practice from the outside.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Naturally, we could not be more excited to spend time with Ralph, but importantly, we’re even more excited today because – drum roll, please – Ralph has agreed to let us share our conversation with him through our inaugural alt.legal podcast, debuting today ([hyperlink here](http://legalexecutiveinstitute.com/podcast-becoming-agent-change/), and [here](https://soundcloud.com/user-238684373/altlegal-podcast-with-ralph-baxter))! Our interviews with legal innovators have been really eye-opening for us, and we wanted to be able to share them in their entirety with you. Thanks to Thomson Reuters for letting a couple of ex-lawyers stomp around their professional recording studio in Times Square. So please, thank our friends at TR by sharing, liking, and sending our [podcast](https://soundcloud.com/user-238684373/altlegal-podcast-with-ralph-baxter) along to friends . . . it makes a huge difference. Now, back to our story.

Today, law firms are starting to make some noise around innovation, but at alt.legal we have been a little skeptical that even highly trained legal minds will be able to compete with the best technology and managed services providers. Importantly, Ralph pointed out that “[a] law firm is not an ideal organization for innovation for lots of reasons, but law firms need to push themselves to innovate.” In his view, Biglaw needs “to push themselves beyond their natural tendency to rely on precedent and do things the way they’ve always done.”

Nevertheless, new innovation will come from “new organizations…that are created as businesses,” or as we call them, alt.legal companies. Post-Orrick, Ralph has dedicated himself to improving the legal system through new business models. Ralph works different angles to usher in this change, both in business and in academia. From the business side, Ralph served on the Board of Directors of [Lex Machina](https://lexmachina.com/) and is on the Board of Advisors of [Ravel Law](https://www.ravellaw.com/). On the academic side, Ralph has advisory or board positions at three little law schools, known as Stanford, Harvard and Georgetown. Finally, Ralph serves as the Chairman of the [Legal Executive Institute](http://legalexecutiveinstitute.com/) at Thomson Reuters, a forum designed to spur engagement with legal executives and “offer[] keen insight into the profession of law and the legal marketplace.”

In sitting down with Ralph for the podcast, and through other encounters, one gets the sense that this flurry of activity isn’t just keeping him busy, or occupying his time. Rather, it’s clear that Ralph’s passion for this alt.legal work increases with every step forward.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Ralph is clearly informed by his perspective and intimate familiarity with the inner workings of a global law firm. He exhorts others to draw on that perspective, to close the mental gap between people innovating new solutions and the attorneys that will actually use them. For any alt.legal company trying to sell a law firm, “job one would be getting everybody to think and talk in the way that a law firm does.” As former Biglaw associates now working in and writing about the alt.legal market, this was an affirmation of our approach and generally a high-five to our professional existence.

But as former litigators, we perceived something else about Ralph’s thoughtful approach, something ineffable about his manner at a meta level. It wasn’t just that Ralph brought intel from the depths of Biglaw. No, his instincts for masterful persuasion permeate the advice itself, as if every potential alt.legal engagement is a federal trial and every potential attorney-cleint was a member of a jury.

Ralph’s eyes lit up as he explained: “If you want to get your idea adopted by a law firm, you have to… do what you do if you want the jury to vote your way in a trial.… If you want to motivate anybody to do something you’ve got to tell them a story that will get your point across in a way they will hear, they will believe, and they will trust.”

You can take the managing partner out of the law firm, but you can never take the Perry Mason out of Ralph Baxter.

Finally, Ralph is optimistic about the future, but he warns the current crop of lawyers that “[y]ou can’t go in [to your career] with a blueprint,” you need to “figure it out and be successful.” He acknowledged that the legal industry is “fundamentally different and changing in ways that are more profound than during most of my career.”

[UPDATE: A source close to the committee described in this report says the report is false and no final word on raises was communicated at this meeting. If that’s true, the fact that sources in multiple offices say they’ve received this news amounts to a different but no less severe communication breakdown.

For the time being, consider that one of two things happened: (1) the firm announced no raises after promising an update months ago or (2) the firm made no announcement at the year-end meeting and is still not issuing raises at this time and multiple associates have interpreted this as the last straw]

When the Biglaw market moved [to the $215K scale in January](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/), it seemed only a matter of time before every major firm adopted that scale. Most moved in the first month of Milbank’s announcement. It was an almost existential decision for firms staring at a white-hot lateral market and bursting at the seams with new business. If the firm couldn’t keep up in the talent fight, it could be lost.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Troutman Pepper did not join the $215K party in January. That wasn’t too surprising because the firm persistently drags its feet on compensation though it [usually gets there eventually](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/troutman-pepper-raises/). But this time, it didn’t move all year. In May, the firm held its associate retreat and announced that an update on the salary situation would come “shortly.” According to tipsters, the firm followed with silence despite associates requesting an update on salaries at every meeting of the Associate Development Committee since the remarks in May.

But they finally got their answer this week… no raises.

Troutman Pepper sits at [47th on the Am Law 100](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=171030&name=Troutman-Pepper-Hamilton-Sanders) with profits per equity partner at $1,386,000 at last accounting. And yet, the firm has eschewed raises JUST IN TIME FOR THE HOLIDAYS! While there’s always a chance that some ghosts can visit the partners on Christmas Eve, it’s more likely that associates are just going to have to find some other way to cover Tiny Tim’s surgery.

While a bitter pill to swallow after being teased with an update for months, somehow it gets worse. According to multiple tipsters, the partnership didn’t even bother to issue a firm-wide announcement of the decision to keep associates below market, opting instead to have the Associate Development Committee deliver the news, “to a few select associate liaisons… which the associate liaisons then communicated to their constituents.”

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Partners were very quick to put the whole firm on blast when trying to [get everyone back to the office in mid-2021](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/troutman-pepper-email-back/), but when it comes to stiffing associates after stringing them along all year, that news gets delegated to liaisons. Associates put in hard work and staved off lateral opportunities believing that the grass on the other side was only temporarily greener. The firm reaped the benefits all year and the associates are left staring longingly at the fence.

Troutman Pepper may have excuses — and they might even be “good” excuses — but the firm can only be judged by the communication the associates actually get. And it was sorely lacking here.

Perhaps the firm had a bad year and found itself unable to cover a salary boost it had hoped to deliver? It happens! We won’t really know until this year’s Am Law numbers are reported out. But even if profits are down, this announcement is a management failure. Leadership needs to get ahead of news like this with transparency and accountability.

And if profits were actually up… well, there will be a lot of questions from the associates.

When the firms fell all over themselves handing out $180K-scale salaries all across the country, most observers expected static (or lower) bonuses and heightened billable expectations to follow not long behind. Which is why it’s so surprising to see a firm that historically lags a little behind the market on bonuses announce that they’re doing the exact opposite of everyone’s expectations.

Last year, we received [a lot of angry tips](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/associate-bonus-watch-very-disappointing-below-market-bonuses/) from [Baker Botts](http://www.bakerbotts.com) associates lamenting that the firm’s “levels” system — which replaces the industry-standard class years — systematically left associates behind their counterparts at the major Biglaw firms. A big contingency win resulted in [some additional bonus cash](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/associate-bonus-watch-a-big-win-spawns-special-bonuses/) in their pockets, but that was a unique event.

This year, things are different. From managing partner [Andrew Baker’s](http://www.bakerbotts.com/people/b/baker-andrew-m) memo this week:

In prior years, associates were generally required to record 2,300 credit hours (including chargeable, pro bono and MANB hours), in tandem with a number of subjective factors, to receive so-called “NY market scale” bonuses….

Beginning in 2017, the hours threshold for paying U.S. associate bonuses at the NY market scale will be reduced to 2,000 credit hours.

Wha? That’s not what we expected to hear in 2017, with demand still so sluggish.

Moreover:

In addition, to reward truly exceptional performance, enhancements to the NY market scale ranging from 10% to 50% of these amounts will be made to associates with substantially higher levels of credit hours. A minimum of 2,150 credit hours will be required for consideration of bonus enhancements.

So an associate who expected to grind for 2300 hours to get New York market can now do the same work and expect 1.1x to 1.5x market? That’s a tremendous development.

Baker Botts isn’t eliminating its “levels” system that groups multiple class years together, and that means Baker Botts associates may lag behind from time to time, but it all works out over the course of a whole career. One helpful tipster created a chart to show what the Baker Botts compensation scheme looks like at this point:



Needless to say, the tipster feedback we’ve gotten is positive.

Congratulations to Baker Botts associates!

In a world of copycats, kudos to the one willing to strike out on their own. Irell & Manella decided to get creative, as IP powerhouses are wont to do, and went outside the box when it announced that it would join the seasonal bonus game on Friday.

And by “outside,” we mean more. A hefty amount more.

Rather than just distribute a scale, Irell’s announcement depends on their associates to do a little math, which the hard IP eggheads there are more than happy to do. To that end, the spring bonus will be a function of the associate’s base salary. So what does that mean? Well, first, here’s a reminder of the salary scale at Irell:

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
- 1st Year: $190,000
- 2nd Year: $200,000
- 3rd Year: $220,000
- 4th Year: $250,000
- 5th Year: $275,000
- 6th Year: $295,000
- 7th Year: $315,000
- 8th Year: $330,000
The spring bonuses will be 10 percent of the associate’s base salary. A little back of the envelope accounting and that means, associates are looking at spring bonuses well in excess of the standard, backloaded spring bonus. Here’s what Irell is eyeing with a reminder of how much that beats the backloaded payout:

- 1st Year: $19,000 (+$14,500)
- 2nd Year: $20,000 (+$14,000)
- 3rd Year: $22,000 (+$10,000)
- 4th Year: $25,000 (+$8,500)
- 5th Year: $27,000 (+$7,500)
- 6th Year: $29,000 (+$6,800)
- 7th Year: $31,500 (+$7,500)
- 8th Year: $33,000 (+$9,000)
That’s all well and good, but what about the tail end of the backloaded effort? That’s where the standard model catches up quite a bit. Friday’s announcement also addressed the fall bonus schedule and Irell announced that they’d be mirroring last year’s fall bonuses. As a reminder [those were](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/irell-bonuses/)…

- 5th Year: $32,500
- 6th Year: $37,000
- 7th Year: $40,000
- 8th Year: $40,000
Which generally tracks the fall payouts for people backloading! So Irell associates are getting the same fall bonuses as most other firms, but with an extra $7,500-$14,500 depending on class year getting deposited in the spring.

Congrats, everyone!

Okay, Sutherland, you waited until the last minute, but at least you have a sense of humor. Managing Partner Mark D. Wasserman just sent associates an email that starts like this:

I know everyone is happy that this is not my July 4th email (that is coming later) or a reminder to get time in by today’s deadline (but PLEASE be sure you do).

That’s right, because it’s raise time, b*tches.

Associates in all offices except Atlanta will be moved to the $180,000 scale. Though it isn’t a pure lockstep move, senior associates at the top end of the firm’s range will have a base salary of $315,000 (same top as the Cravath scale). Atlanta associates will be paid between $155,000 and $240,000, depending on seniority.

The individual emails to associates let them know their salaries will be distributed later this month, BUT the raises will be retroactive to July 1.

We are covering this story as market conditions develop, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

So the question we’ll be answering over the next few weeks, is which firms are able to match? Now a Magic Circle firm — Clifford Chance — has answered in the affirmative. Earlier today, the firm announced the following bonuses for all U.S. associates:

# Fired Biglaw Partner Resurfaces To Blame Cancel Culture For The Consequences Of Her Own Actions
## Personal responsibility? Don't know her.

Looks like former Hogan Lovells partner Robin Keller isn’t done trying to wring the last juice out of her 15 minutes of infamy.

Keller last made news this summer, when in the wake of the Dobbs decision, she — on a work call with ~400 attendees — spouted her problematic views on abortion and race. (Audience alert: remove any animals from the room as there are dog whistles ahead.)

[As I described the incident at the time](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/white-partner-at-biglaw-firm-spreads-inappropriate-and-offensive-theories-about-abortion-with-seemingly-no-consequences/):

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
A white partner who attended HoLove’s women’s meeting felt it appropriate to chime in with her support of the Dobbs decision. As a tipster at the firm described it, “Robin Keller, in front of nearly 400 women, shared her views that Dobbs was rightly decided and that Black women are disproportionately getting abortions and conducting ‘Black genocide’ which she finds ‘tragic.’” Yikes.

Another tipster described it as “spouting out racial vitriol about Black women abortions being a genocide that luckily Dobbs stops.” According to accounts, another partner “eloquently shut her down to the ground,” and asked Keller to leave the call. But, tipsters report that wasn’t the end of the screed, as Keller “wrote in the Zoom chat that we should channel our ‘rage’ into understanding other people’s point of view.”

Reaction to the incident from insiders at the firm reflects how troubling it was. One person described being “traumatized and hurt,” saying, “It was unreal.” Another was more blunt: “A woman needs to be fired.”

Now she’s taking a[ page from Paul Clement’s book](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/paul-clement-laments-kirklands-cancel-culture-or-capitalism-as-the-case-may-be/) and crying in the op-ed pages [of the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-dissent-allowed-at-hogan-lovells-abortion-dobbs-roe-v-wade-meeting-safe-space-forum-genocide-lawyers-outrage-11669753147?mod=opinion_lead_pos10) that Hogan Lovells “kowtowed to a woke faction inside its workforce” when she was let go from her job following an internal investigation.

Yes, the firm hired outside counsel to conduct an investigation, a process Keller says she participated in, and found her comments in violation of the firm’s anti-harassment policy. But Keller would rather gin up the disingenuous rallying cry of twisted First Amendment talking points than take any personal responsibility for what she said.

Keller’s comments were not dry support for an esoteric point of law. She specifically blamed Black women for GENOCIDE. It should not be shocking [that this is considered inappropriate in the workplace](https://twitter.com/imillhiser/status/1597958720377745409?s=20&t=G5QPqEn5amKZmfj6rPmiHQ). People much smarter than me have pointed out just how fucked up this exact rhetoric is. But to make the point as succinctly as possible, Shyrissa Dobbins-Harris [writes in The Myth of Abortion as Black Genocide: Reclaiming our Reproductive Cycle](https://escholarship.org/content/qt0988p9xp/qt0988p9xp.pdf) that these messages about abortion are “full of misogynoir,” and places “the struggle for Black survival squarely within the wombs of Blackwomen” over the “numerous social ills facing Black people” including “rates of police brutality… or the social determinants of health, or mass incarceration, or the alarmingly high rates of new HIV infections among Blackwomen.” And it’s paternalistic to boot as it “considers Blackwomen incapable of making their own reproductive choices.”

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

But the really sad point about the decline of the judiciary in this country is that this only gets to be a debate — and in the WSJ — because she couched her vitriol in a SCOTUS decision. If anyone came into a big meeting a spouted harmful rhetoric that academics say is “full of misogynoir” there’d be no argument in defense of what she’d done. But because the Court gave space to half truths and a twisted version of history to undo 50 years of reproductive freedom, it gifted cover to racists and sexists to say the quiet part out loud.

The attention this patently wrong (factually and morally) view has received as a a result of the Dobbs decision is exactly what Keller points to as an excuse for her behavior. She writes, “Never mind that this view has been expressed by numerous mainstream commentators, black and white, including in [the WSJ] pages.” But it is dangerous to assert that just because a statement has been repeated within the right-wing echo chamber makes it acceptable — particularly in a workplace. And it certainly doesn’t mean Keller gets to eschew responsibility for imposing her problematic views on her colleagues.

UPDATE: A firm spokesperson provided the following comment:

“As a firm we fully encourage our people to share their views on important issues that matter to them, but we expect our people to conduct themselves in accordance with firm policies. We value our differences, which make us stronger as a firm.”

# Global Biglaw Firm Launches Online Store So You Too Can Lounge In Their Branded Crap
## Corporate swag handouts are one thing. This is totally different.

It’s not unusual for a firm to create some branded swag to hand out to their employees. The corporate world, of which Biglaw is no exception, imagine that an umbrella with a firm logo will generate the sort of esprit de corps that will keep everyone happy in ways a salary bump and summer bonus never could.

What is unusual is creating an online store so anyone can go buy a firm’s branded crap. But Squire Patton Boggs is an unusual firm. The global firm, who to our knowledge has not raised salaries, has opened a swag store for those in the EU (though, presumably, you could get them shipped to the U.S.). [Squirestore](http://www.squirestore.eu), as it’s called, is your one-stop shop for all your Squire Patton Boggs ribbon needs! And, yes, they sell ribbon.

UPDATE: Squire Patton Boggs informs us that this site is designed to make it easier for different offices to order swag. That certainly makes sense from a certain perspective, on the other hand, is there no firm intranet for this sort of endeavor? It would seem that there are better tech fixes than this.

Legal Cheek [noticed the Squirestore earlier today](https://www.legalcheek.com/2018/09/squire-patton-boggs-leisurewear-is-an-actual-thing/) and brought joy to all our hearts in the process.



Those are some aggressive T-shirts. Generally, the corporate logo is added inconspicuously on the breast but this is like some Squire Patton Boggs “Juicy” rip off or something. Is anyone going to wear something like this? Sadly, the answer is probably yes.

Look, if you’re going to create stuff like this, just hand it out at parties! Trying to earn a buck off of it not only won’t get you very far, but it’s just tacky to try and sell it. The firm may as well launch a GoFundMe to pay for its bonuses.

It’s a weak move. Don’t do this.

# Biglaw Firm's Work For The Trump Administration

Michael Pack was CEO of the U.S. Agency for Global Media an agency that oversees, among others, Voice of America under the Trump Administration. While he was in charge of USAGM, Pack alleged there was a “deep state” within the agency acting in opposition to his directive and that there were security concerns. Unable to just axe the agency executives that drew his ire, he suspended them and ordered an investigation into potential wrongdoing. But instead of using inspectors general or civil servants for the investigation, Pack signed a no-bid contract with McGuireWoods to do the work.

As [reported by](https://www.npr.org/2021/03/04/973765185/trump-appointee-at-voa-parent-paid-law-firm-millions-to-investigate-his-own-staf) NPR, nonprofit organization Government Accountability Project filed Freedom of Information Act requests to find out exactly what McGuireWoods was doing on the taxpayer dime.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The invoices reflect that McGuireWoods’ legal team, among other duties, reviewed social media posts, “news articles relating to Michael Pack” and an “[Office of Inspector General] audit on Hillary Clinton’s email breach.”

It was not immediately apparent what the controversy involving the former Secretary of State had to do with the investigation of the suspended USAGM executives. Clinton by then had already been out of office for more than seven years.

“The engagement constitutes gross mismanagement, gross waste of taxpayer dollars and abuse of authority,” David Seide of the Government Accountability Project, wrote in a letter Thursday to congressional committees with oversight of the USAGM.

“The ‘deliverables’ provided by McGuireWoods are — always were — of questionable value,” he wrote. “The investigations produced nothing that could justify the kind of discipline Mr. Pack sought to impose on current USAGM employees he did not like — he wanted them fired (they have since been reinstated). Investigations of former employees also yielded nothing.”

According to the records, five partners, six associates, two counsel, two staff attorneys, seven paralegals, three case assistants, 14 other timekeepers, and 11 outsourced attorneys were all on the engagement. The engagement was led by partner [John D. Adams](https://www.mcguirewoods.com/people/a/john-d-adams), who has a ton of conservative bona fides as a former GOP candidate for Virginia attorney general and as a former Clarence Thomas law clerk.

Seide also says political appointees aren’t supposed to oversee federal contracts, except…

Yet the documents show the law firm’s point of contact at the agency was Sam Dewey, a political appointee who was a top adviser and attorney for Pack, who had separately investigated several Voice of America journalists for perceived anti-Trump bias.

“CEO Pack’s decision to engage McGuireWoods was lawful as were all subsequent matters of which I am aware related to McGuireWoods’ work for USAGM,” Dewey tells NPR. “I cannot comment further as USAGM has not authorized me to speak on this issue.” Dewey has left the agency.

As coincidence would have it, McGuireWoods told Pack their investigation was complete on January 19 — the day before newly inaugurated President Biden asked Pack to step down from his role.

# Lawyers Need To Be Perfectly Pedigreed To Earn Top In-House Pay
## How much will your in-house earnings be affected? Let's find out.

Lawyers who dream of someday going in-house need to know that their legal pedigree — their law school alma mater and the law firms they’ve worked for — will follow them throughout their careers, affecting even their future in-house earning power.

According to a new report from recruiting firm BarkerGilmore, those who went to a Top 50 law school earn an average of 30% more than those who attended law schools ranked 100 or lower, while those who went to a Top 50 law school and also worked at an Am Law 50 law firm, earned 76% more than those who didn’t.

[Corporate Counsel](https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/2023/05/09/study-reveals-how-pedigree-of-law-schools-law-firms-influence-in-house-pay/) has some additional details:

Beyond highlighting big-picture trends, including that companies pulled back on bonuses last year, the study took a rare look at the extent to which the pedigree of law schools and law firms shape in-house pay.

A general counsel who went to a Top 50 law school received $650,000 in compensation last year, as opposed to $511,000 for general counsel who attended a school ranked between 51-100, and $455,00 for general counsel who attended law school ranked below 100, the report found.

That’s a 43% difference between the highest- and lowest-ranked schools. The disparity was narrower for managing counsel and senior counsel—25% and 22%, respectively.

Credentials can be costly, according to BakerGilmore founding partner John Gilmore. “If you’re going to hire a lawyer that can check both boxes, they come at a premium,” he told Corporate Counsel. “As much as people say it is a soft market, it’s still not easy. It’s not like these highly credentialed lawyers are in abundance. They’re not. Companies are being more selective than ever and they’re definitely credential-minded.”

# Biglaw Firm Sued Over Role In Cyber Scam
## Plaintiffs allege the wire transfer went wrong.

If law firms need (yet another) reminder to take cybersecurity seriously, well, talk to Holland & Knight. The Biglaw firm recently found themselves on the wrong side of the v, and are defending themselves against allegations they should have done more to prevent a cyber fraud scheme in which scammers walked away with over $3 million.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2020/07/22/holland-knight-sued-over-botched-wire-transfer/) Law.com, back in December 2019, Holland & Knight was hired to handle a stock transfer. Now, Holland & Knight, the transfer agent Continental Stock Transfer, and Tassel Parent Inc. are being sued by Sorenson Impact Foundation and the James Lee Sorenson Family Foundation. According to the complaint, a “malicious third party” intercepted the correspondence and assumed the identity of the plaintiffs, forged documentation, and had the law firm direct the $3,124,940 payment to a Hong Kong bank account. According to the complaint, plaintiffs have been unable to recover the money.

Plaintiffs allege Holland & Knight and defendants did nothing to vet the account the money was sent to, nor did they not contact the plaintiffs to confirm the the transfer details, a step they say was set out in the underlying agreement:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“Plaintiffs and defendants would have discovered the fraudulent emails, fraudulent Letter of Transmittal and Letter of Authorization if H&K and Continental had contacted plaintiffs in person over the phone to confirm the fraudulent wire instructions,” the complaint reads.

The complaints alleges breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and negligence against the Biglaw firm. Holland & Knight has yet to comment on the lawsuit.

# Suspended Biglaw Associate Sentenced To Jail Time After Molotov Cocktail Attack
## It's taken more than two years for this to happen. How much time will he serve?

When we last checked in on suspended Pryor Cashman associate Colinford Mattis and housing attorney Urooj Rahman, both charged in May 2020 for their [involvement with a Molotov cocktail attack](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/furloughed-biglaw-associate-charged-in-new-york-molotov-cocktail-attack/) on a police vehicle in Brooklyn, New York, in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, they’d been [disbarred after pleading guilty](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/suspended-biglaw-associate-disbarred-after-guilty-plea-in-molotov-cocktail-attack/) to charges of conspiracy to commit arson and possess an explosive device — charges which carried with them sentences of 18 to 24 months.

Now, more than two years after the fact, both attorneys have finally been sentenced for their crimes. The [New York Law Journal](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2023/01/26/we-really-needed-you-ex-pryor-cashman-associate-sentenced-to-1-year-in-molotov-cocktail-case/) has the details:

Mattis was sentenced to a year and a day in federal prison Thursday, two and a half years after he was arrested and charged with firebombing an unoccupied New York City Police Department vehicle during protests for racial justice in Brooklyn.

Mattis and his co-defendant, former tenants’ attorney Urooj Rahman, pleaded guilty in June to conspiracy to commit arson and to make and possess an unregistered destructive device. Rahman was sentenced to 15 months in prison in November.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Judge Brian Cogan of the Eastern District of New York said that although Mattis was a “good guy” who made a bad decision, he was unable to “get past the seriousness of these crimes.” Here’s more on that, from the NYLJ:

When protests were taking place across the city and country following the police killing of George Floyd, Cogan said Mattis could have set an example but did not.

“On that horrible night all over the country, we really needed you,” Cogan said. “We really needed the lawyers to step up and say ‘Did you see that tape of what that police officer did to him? There’s going to be punishment for that’…we needed you to do that. We needed all lawyers to do that, and instead you went the opposite direction.”

In her sentencing memo, Mattis’s lawyer, Sabrina Shroff, asked that her client be sentenced to time served, as he is the foster parent of his late mother’s three foster children, and has been attempting to adopt them. It’s incredibly sad, but that request seems to have fallen upon deaf ears.

To our knowledge, Pryor Cashman has yet to officially fire Mattis, but now that he’s been sentenced, we expect that shoe to soon drop. When that happens, the soon-to-be-former Biglaw associate’s case will finally come to a close.

Robert Darwell

Robert Darwell is a Biglaw partner at Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton with a sexy — well, as legal practices go — entertainment practice. He works on the development, finance, production and distribution of big-name movies like Brokeback Mountain and Traffic. So, how should people prepare themselves for such a high-profile practice?

Be a server. I bet you thought the answer was going to be a federal clerkship or some other elite opportunity. Nope, in an [interview with Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/05/01/say-cheese-big-law-partners-instagram-feed-captures-life-in-the-tasty-lane/), Darwell credits being on the waitstaff of a TGI Fridays for giving him the skills necessary to be a Biglaw partner:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“Nobody wants to hear about a problem at the next time table, or, in my case, another client,” he said. “Nobody wants you sending someone else in to handle a task.”

While serving customers at the TGI Fridays in Scottsdale, Arizona, Darwell learned to how to read people’s moods—a skill he still uses.

“When you walk up to the table, you have to analyze who you’re taking care of. Are they in a bad mood? Do they want to be entertained? Do they want to be left alone? That same skill set applies to the practice of law,” he said.

Darwell has taken his appreciation of servers (and bartenders) to the next level. He has a popular Instagram feed, [The Daily Server](https://www.instagram.com/thedailyserver/), where he features the hardworking people that make eating and drinking out so much fun. The feed reflects Darwell’s globetrotting ways, with servers from a variety of states and countries featured.

Enjoy some of the best of Darwell’s images, and don’t forget there are a wide swath of experiences that help make great lawyers.

# Why Didn't Biglaw Firms Lower Salaries During The Great Recession?
## Reducing salaries versus mass layoffs does seem like a gentler way to contend with economic issues.

As this website has reported at length, many Biglaw firms have implemented austerity measures to contend with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Some firms have laid off employees, and other shops have implemented furloughs or relied on dreaded stealth layoffs to deal with the current economic environment. However, the most widespread tactic used by Biglaw firms to contend with COVID-19 is salary reductions. Although salary cuts differ from firm to firm, most shops have implemented salary reductions of around 10 to 20 percent, however some firms have implemented even deeper cuts.

The salary reductions of firms in the current environment is markedly different than the tactics used by Biglaw shops during the Great Recession. During that time, firms relied on mass layoffs to deal with economic conditions. Most Biglaw firms never reduced their starting salaries during that time, and salaries at many Biglaw shops remained mostly constant for around a decade. Of course, reducing salaries versus mass layoffs seems like a gentler way to contend with economic issues. However, the position taken by many Biglaw firms in the present has made me wonder: why didn’t Biglaw shops try lowering salaries during the Great Recession? Although some smaller firms reduced salaries during the Great Recession, Biglaw shops maintained extraordinarily high salaries during the prior economic downturn, which increased the salary stratification between Biglaw firms and other shops.

I am no expert on Biglaw or the Great Recession. Although I attended law school during the height of the Great Recession, I did not enter the legal workforce until 2012. In addition, I only spent a little more than a year at a Biglaw shop (no one should consider the year and change I spent at dearly-departed Sedgwick LLP to be Biglaw experience!). I am really hoping that people reach out to me with their own theories, and I usually get insightful emails from readers. However, here are a few of my own spitballed ideas (in the 900 words of so I have) about why Biglaw firms are now implementing salary cuts when they did not do so in prior economic downturns.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
One theory why Biglaw shops are trying salary reductions in the current environment is that management at these firms believe that the current economic downturn is temporary. At the beginning of the crisis, it may have been thought that the current situation would not last long, and that economic issues because of COVID-19 would be resolved within a relatively short amount of time. As a result, firms would only experience an economic downturn for a short period, and firms wanted to lower salaries rather than terminate employees to keep people on the payroll in case the economy recovered. The Great Recession may have been seen as a much more problematic and long-lasting issue for law firms, necessitating that shops terminate employees rather than merely lower salaries.

What makes me worried about this theory is that it appears that economic issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic will not disappear anytime soon. Although the stock market has improved, many retailers, restaurants, and other companies are facing lagging issues because of social distancing guidelines and safer-at-home orders. This could affect the demand for legal services for a long time to come, which could have a lasting impact on the legal sector. If the economy does not recover soon, the unique salary reductions implemented during the present economic crisis may transform into the layoffs seen in prior economic downturns.

Another theory why Biglaw firms did not implement salary reductions during the Great Recession is since many Biglaw shops have issues “keeping up with the Joneses.” Biglaw firms typically move in lockstep with each other so that firms which have all types of metrics can plausibly include themselves in the elite tier of law firms in the country. For instance, numerous Biglaw shops implement a uniformly high starting salary to keep up with the Joneses. However, some firms just have the illusion of paying a high starting salary, and actually use nonpartnership track and staff attorney programs to pay many lawyers as little as possible. In addition, Biglaw firms often take cues from each other when it comes to bonuses, vacation policies, summer programs, and other initiatives.

If a firm lowered salaries during the Great Recession while other shops did not, it could signal that the firm that lowered salaries was not a shop that should be considered part of the elite tier of law firms, or that they were experiencing unique financial challenges. In addition, since other law firms were laying off attorneys during the last economic downturn, it provided cover for other shops to implement similar strategies. However, in the current economic environment, some of the earliest firms to announce austerity measures implemented salary cuts instead of laying off employees. This accordingly gave other firms the cover they needed to also lower salaries without seeming like they were out of step with the other top law firms.

All told, it remains to be seen how far law firms will go to stay afloat given the current economic realities. If the ongoing economic crisis deepens, it is possible that Biglaw shops will react with widespread layoffs as occurred during the Great Recession. However, it is interesting how law firms in the present at least initially lowered salaries to deal with the current crisis while shops during the Great Recession went straight to laying off hordes of attorneys and staff.

# Jones Day Argues That Everyone's Happier Not Knowing They're Underpaid
## Jones Day can't quite figure out if they're a black box or an open book and it's starting to have repercussions for their case.

Jones Day (Photo by David Lat)

Not to downplay all of the more important issues at play in the [$200 million gender discrimination lawsuit against Jones Day](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/new-discrimination-lawsuit-against-jones-day-is-already-getting-messy/), but the simplest takeaway from the brewing battle is this: Jones Day would rather fight a pitch battle over gender discrimination than join the rest of Biglaw in being upfront and honest with its employees about compensation.

The firm could defuse discrimination concerns quickly by opening up its black box — that it hilariously claims is [not a black box](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/jones-day-to-gender-discrimination-plaintiffs-you-dont-deserve-to-be-paid-on-the-cravath-scale/) — but it doesn’t want to invite all the criticism that comes with it. Is this because the firm is systematically discriminating against women (and minorities) as the lawsuit suggests? Keeping compensation under wraps was infamously how Lilly Ledbetter found herself on the short end of decades of discrimination. Or maybe the firm just knows it risks reputational damage if they told the world that they are not capable of keeping up with the big kids. Whatever it is, the firm feels that fighting this case tooth and nail — including [seeking sanctions](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/jones-day-files-for-sanctions-in-ongoing-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/) against the attorneys bringing the claim — is better than the disinfectant of transparency.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It’s in pursuit of sanctions that Jones Day offered up its Orwellian defense of keeping associates in the dark about pay:

“When compensation is individualized and merit-based, confidentiality helps to promote collegiality by avoiding jealousy, bitterness, and anger (on the part of the lower-paid) and arrogance, superiority, and ego (on the part of the higher-paid),” the firm wrote. “It also prevents embarrassment both for those who make less than their peers and those who make more.”

This is, of course, the party line of any employer trying to pull a fast one past the workers. Hiding between the lines of the superficially fair statement is how an employer banks on those feelings of private embarrassment to keep undercompensated employees from opening up and, potentially, learning that the excuses made to short their pay had no impact on a similarly situated co-worker. Attorneys are professionals… feel free to treat them that way.

Despite claiming that everyone’s happy because compensation is a black box, Jones Day argued without missing a beat that the plaintiffs’ attorneys should be sanctioned because they could have easily figured out their whole pay scale by just emailing around the firm and asking. Apparently the arrogant top earners and the embarrassed paupers are expected to be totally open amongst themselves about pay? It’s a mind-blowing pivot.

It’s almost as though the zeal to levy sanctions is getting in the way of the rest of the Jones Day defense. The firm claims that discovery is bearing out their claim that pay varies on a gender neutral basis and yet, it argues, the plaintiffs shouldn’t have needed discovery because it was so easy to unravel this admittedly confidential system without the legal process.

Do they have two different teams working on the sanctions and the case proper? Because if so, the sanctions team should be paid less.

In the very near future, we’ll be unveiling a form to allow attorneys — at Jones Day and elsewhere — to confidentially inform us of your compensation. You’ll stay anonymous but your contribution to this project will help us report on firm pay patterns going forward. Keep an eye out in the coming days and please chip in, even if you’re paying a relatively boring lockstep salary.

Bruce Stachenfeld

Many years ago I was working at a big law firm, and I knew my days were numbered. I was a real estate lawyer and this was about 1990 and there was no real estate going on. I wasn’t being paranoid – I was being realistic.

So I have never been the type that just shuts down in a crisis. I go down swinging!

I thought about it and quickly concluded that if real estate was down the odds were that bankruptcy and insolvency would be up, so if I were a “bankruptcy lawyer” who knew a lot about real estate I would be better off than a “real estate lawyer” who knew a lot about bankruptcy.

So I went to the firm’s library and took out every treatise I could find on bankruptcy and especially real estate and bankruptcy. I also took out the bankruptcy code itself and the prior code that had been superseded. And I started to read and read.

It actually didn’t take long (since, as I mentioned above, I had little else to do) before I started to develop some expertise and a working knowledge of the bankruptcy code and how it would apply to real estate transactions. After a while, I felt like I really knew this stuff! I had done it – I was now (sort of) a bankruptcy lawyer.

Now that I had transformed myself – by acquiring additional intellectual capital – I was confident that I would be able to not only keep my job but thrive as a “go-to” person in this hot area.

I was wrong…..

I was indeed let go, along with another 150 associates, all on the same day. It was a bleak time for me indeed, since real estate was going into a deep depression.

Fast forward a mere 18 years to 2008 when the real estate world was again falling apart and my firm was almost entirely a real estate shop. This time around things worked out very differently…….

I was in a leadership position at this time and was able to spearhead the formation of a Distressed Real Estate Practice Group, which was a combination of our real estate lawyers, our litigation attorneys and our bankruptcy partner. My knowledge of real estate and bankruptcy was suddenly very useful and stood me, and my colleagues, in very good stead. Of course I relied heavily on my bankruptcy partner, but it was helpful I could talk the talk and I had a working knowledge of how bankruptcy and insolvency situations were likely to play out.

Our Distressed Real Estate Practice was a major success and indeed likely saved the firm from going down during that rocky period.

Today there is little distress in the real estate world, but in real estate no matter how rosy things ever look, distress can always be around the corner. And who knows what the current stock, high-yield debt, and CMBS market turmoil may presage. It may be closer than we all think.

However, armed with my knowledge of bankruptcy and insolvency, I feel pretty good about my chances to stay employed. I guess being the managing partner might help a bit too…..

More seriously, I have two points to make here:

First, if your practice is getting whacked by external events – and in a roughly 40-year career, the odds are that it will be – then don’t just sit there and wait for the axe to fall. Do something about it! And the best thing you can do, in my view, is to acquire additional intellectual capital that will increase the value that you can bring to the table. If you are lucky, that value will become immediately apparent; however, even if not, the odds are good that this intellectual capital will be very valuable to you at a later point in your career.

Second, while it is a great thing to have deep knowledge of a discipline, it is also useful to have knowledge of disparate areas, which will connect in ways that aren’t necessarily apparent.

# Being A Bitch Is Now A Criminal Offense, Apparently

If “free will” is to mean anything, you cannot “suicide” a person to death. You can murder someone, you can accidentally murder someone, you can pay someone to murder someone for you, you can set up a criminal organization under which murders occur on your behalf, you can even set up conditions so inherently unsafe that you are criminally responsible for anybody who happens to die. But you can’t kill a person who kills themselves. The self-killing breaks the causal chain between your actions, however reprehensible, and the death.

Until today.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Judge Lawrence Moniz in Massachusetts found Michelle Carter [guilty of involuntary manslaughter](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/16/us/suicide-texting-trial-michelle-carter-conrad-roy.html?_r=0) in the death of Conrad Roy. Roy killed himself with carbon monoxide poisoning in his car in a Kmart parking lot. But I guess, according to Moniz, Roy didn’t really kill himself, because Carter sent him a lot of mean texts and phone calls encouraging him to commit suicide.

Carter’s texts to her then-boyfriend were undoubtedly mean. Abusive even. She encouraged him to kill himself, believing, she claims, that he really wanted to do it and that he would be happier in heaven if he did. She also called him on his cell phone, encouraging him to go through with it. Allegedly, at one point Roy got out of his car and Carter told him to get back in.

Roy died. It is a tragedy. At trial it came out that Roy had tried to kill himself once before, but reached out to friends and family and was talked out of it. This time, clearly, he picked the wrong friend.

But Roy also picked out the method for his suicide, after doing research on the internet. He picked out the generator and water pump he eventually used to fill his car with deadly toxins. He picked the time, he picked the place. Michelle Carter picked… words.

Carter was not disturbing the peace. She was not inciting a riot. She didn’t push him into the car and lock the door. She didn’t turn on the gas. She didn’t threaten to kill him if he didn’t do it himself. She told him that if he wanted to kill himself that he absolutely should. I’ll bet you $50 that Mike Pence tells that to Donald Trump every night before he tucks him in.

If we’re going to live in world where words kill people, and self-inflicted wounds are not self-inflicted if somebody tells you to inflict them, how far back in the causal chain are we willing to go? My mom says I’m not fat, I’m just big-boned, will somebody arrest her if I have a coronary? How far back does it go even in the instant case? Who told Michelle Carter that heaven “existed” and was a nice place? Haul their asses into court. Would Roy have killed himself if he knew that only worms and darkness awaited on the other side?

If you don’t want to blame religion, what about Kmart? Don’t they have cameras in their parking lots? And if not, shouldn’t they? The person in the last best position to save Roy probably wasn’t Michelle Carter, but rather some Kmart employee who noticed a car loitering and did nothing. Find that man. Bring him to court. Let justice be done upon him!

The prosecution of Michelle Carter clearly isn’t about justice. It’s about revenge and deterrence. We want to punish Carter because her texts were so mean, and we want to warn teens not to bully each other online because there will be consequences. Convicting someone for texting a man to death is a perverse miscarriage of justice, but if it stops one teen from body-shaming a fellow teen on Instagram, most parents will be cool with the conviction.

Not me. I’m [on the record](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/10/bullying-shouldnt-be-a-crime-no-matter-how-many-people-kill-themselves-because-of-it/) as not accepting the bullied-into-suicide argument. Michelle Carter seems like an awful person, and I don’t think saying that makes me culpable should she later decide to kill herself. The law is designed to prosecute people who do awful things, not people who say awful things.

# Trend Alert: Another Biglaw Firm Expands Gender-Neutral Parental Leave
## Kudos to the firm!

The Biglaw trend of generously expanding parental leave, and ensuring it is gender neutral, is continuing. Munger, Tolles & Olson recently announced an expanded leave program, effective August 1, for all attorneys.

The new benefit provides parents with 18 weeks of paid parental leave. That leave make be taken consecutively or they can split it up into two chunks of time, allowing them to take some time at the arrival of the child and then later, perhaps when their partner’s parental leave ends. Birthing mothers may also take six to eight weeks of paid disability leave, meaning, at the high end, a new parent can have up to 26 weeks of paid leave.

The expanded leave program is Munger Tolles’s latest effort to create a truly family-friendly firm. They offer on-site, subsidized childcare — and have since 2010. Additionally, the firm provides subsidized back-up childcare, up to 20 days per year for each child.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
While the expanded benefits for new parents are certainly nice, there’s been a lot of[ talk recently about whether it’s smart for your career to use the benefits](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/american-lawyer-wonders-why-more-men-dont-take-paternity-leave-days-after-advising-lawyers-not-to-take-parental-leave/). The good news is that associates don’t have to wonder if taking leave will permanently damage their career prospects, because Munger Tolles has plenty of positive examples in their partnership. Indeed, this year’s partnership class includes three attorneys — Rose Leda Ehler, Laura K. Lin, and Kuruvilla J. Olasa — who took leave in the year leading up to making partner.

# Santa Just Gave Out Associate Raises
## More raises before we end 2018.

Just when you thought the associate salary raises were completely behind us and we’d moved on entirely to bonuses, Santa decided to drop some associate salary increase news on us before we head out the door for Christmas.

This comes from Venable, a firm that dodged the summer flurry of raises, sticking to its existing pay scale which amounted to the $180K scale for the first three years followed by a “range” of salaries for more senior associates that maxed out at the market rates. It created the weird quirk where [fourth and fifth year associates could theoretically make less than third years](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/could-a-5th-year-make-less-than-a-3rd-year-maybe-according-to-this-firm/) prompting a lot of discontent, but at the very top of the scale, people were happy. Still, when the firm stayed pat over the summer, there was an appropriate amount of grumbling.

But as the work week comes to an end before Christmas Eve, Venable has a new compensation scale for everyone! But is it a present or coal?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  


So the lockstop process is limited to first and second years now meaning third years have joined the ranks of those braving the ranges. What’s not clear here is whether or not the firm is offering any movement at the bottom of the salary range. Pushing the top up doesn’t necessarily mean much if the floor isn’t moving commensurably. It wouldn’t be a big deal if this hadn’t been the exact same complaint the firm faced in 2016. One would have thought they’d have learned from that experience.

And that floor makes a huge difference because, as one tipster points out, no one is really getting the maximum:

Venable announced new comp. Associates are pissed. Firm Chairman Stu Ingis made a big deal months ago that the firm would do right by associates and this is what we get. A $10k bump to the top of your class year range. Literally no one gets the maximum – no one. It’s a big joke. Not retroactive. No special bonus. Even regular bonus sucks. You can kill yourself and only get around $25k. PPP of $1MM+ and this the best they can do? They just don’t care about associates.

While the memo says salary bumps are effective as of January 1, associates aren’t going to see their salaries until February, meaning there must be a big retroactive bump coming for Valentine’s Day.

Congrats… I guess.

Well, well, well, it looks like we’ve got our first Davis Polk match. The market is already moving quickly in response to DPW’s move to increase salaries for midlevels and senior associates.

Buckle up, Biglaw, because we’re about to see some match mania.

Back in January, McDermott Will & Emery was the [second firm to match Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/mwe-match-2022/), and last night, just a few short hours after [Davis Polk finally made its announcement](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/davis-polk-raise-2022/), the firm stepped up to match the new market standard. Which other firms will be this quick to re-raise or match the compensation leader? We’ll have to wait and see, but we can’t imagine we’ll be waiting too long.

Here’s what the new salary scale looks like at McDermott:



The firm’s re-raise is retroactive to January 1. Congratulations!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from McDermott Will & Emery.)

# Summer Associates Events Law Firms Should Avoid
## Fun is fun. Except when it isn't.

Now that law school is out for the year, and the hot weather is upon us, it seems that summer associate season has officially opened. As many people within the legal profession already know, a summer associate is a rising third-year law student who is hired by a law firm to work at a shop for the summer.

During a summer associate gig, summers are usually paid very high salaries to perform projects and attend a number of social events so that people at the firm can decide if they wish to offer the summer associate full-time employment when they graduate from law school. Many law firms have amazing events for summer associates, and I fondly remember attending parties, scavenger hunts, and numerous other festivities as a summer associate. However, law firms should try to stay away from certain summer associate events to make summers and full-time attorneys more comfortable during summer associate season.

Pool Parties

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
When I was a summer associate over a decade ago, my firm threw a huge pool party at the house of one of the partners, open to all of the summer associates and any attorneys that wished to join. The pool party was a decent amount of fun, and it was interesting to see every unwind around a pool. However, the pool party created a lot of stress among the summer associates that may not have been constructive. Numerous summer associates stressed about what was appropriate to wear to the pool party and one of my colleagues was nervous that partners at the firm might judge him for a tattoo he had that could be seen when he was wearing a swimsuit but couldn’t be seen in professional attire.

I can completely understand the desire of firm management to let people unwind in a social setting, and a pool party can be a refreshing distraction on a hot summer day. However, there can be a lot of stress over pool attire, pool etiquette, and other matters involving pool parties. Some people may not wish to put on a bathing suit, others may have difficulty swimming. Accordingly, law firms should probably stay away from holding pool parties for summer associates.

Poker Nights

When I was a summer associate (and when I was a full-time associate) attorneys at the Biglaw firm at which I worked would regularly hold poker nights for attorneys and staff. The summer associates justifiably felt pressured joining such poker nights because they wanted to be part of the group and bond with other attorneys at the office. There was, I believe, a $50 buy-in or thereabouts for most poker nights, which might not seem like much, but for a law student who is trying to save money, this can be a large sum of money. In any event, it might not be fair to apply explicit or implicit pressure to summer associates to participate in such poker nights.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
When I was a summer associate and a full-time associate, I felt pretty compelled to participate in such poker nights. I was so bad at poker (kind of like [Bad Brad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le_ax6CKpZI&ab_channel=MantisLibra) in “Molly’s Game” I suppose) that I would invariably lose my money early and need to buy back in multiple times. It felt kind of weird that my losses were funding the pools for more senior lawyers who were more experienced at poker. I also know some attorneys who were morally against betting during poker nights, so this type of event should be avoided during summer programs.

Golf And Tennis Outings

I love golf and tennis (even though I am not particularly good at either sport). It is always fun to get outside and be around people working up the fairway on a golf course. However, golf and tennis outings might not be the best event to have during a summer program since not all attorneys are skilled at playing golf or tennis or any other athletic pursuit that might be part of a summer program. I have also heard that sports like golf and tennis might unfairly disadvantage people who are less interested in sports.

When I was a summer associate, there was a full-day golf and tennis outing at a fancy country club near the office. I enjoyed the outing, but I know for a fact that not everyone could actively participate in the activities because they had never golfed before. Worse still, they paired partners and associates together in competition, and some of the partners were really competitive, to the chagrin of some associates who did not have the skills to keep up. To avoid an uncomfortable situation and to ensure that all summer associates have equal opportunities to socialize with partners, golf and tennis outings might be avoided during summer associate programs.

All told, it is important for law firms to plan social events for summer associates so they can get a better sense of the summers to see if they want to hire them for full-time positions. However, law firms should stay away from certain events to keep everyone more comfortable around summer associate season.

Bonuses, bonuses, and more bonuses! Associates, we heard you like Biglaw bonuses, so we’ve got more Biglaw bonus news!

The latest firm to open its coffers for associates is Ropes & Gray, a firm that brought in $2,674,046,000 gross revenue in 2021, putting it in 8th place in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking. While some firms are leaving their super-senior associates off the bonus grid entirely, Ropes is rewarding them with supersized bonuses.

Here’s what the bonus scale looks like at this Biglaw heavy-hitter:

- Class of 2022: $15,000 (pro-rated)
- Class of 2021: $20,000
- Class of 2020: $30,000
- Class of 2019: $57,500
- Class of 2018: $75,000
- Class of 2017: $90,000
- Class of 2016: $105,000
- Class of 2015: $115,000
- Class of 2014+: $130,000
And that’s not all! Associates who have annualized creditable hours above the firms 1900-hour requirement will receive additional bonus money. This is excellent news for associates who really billed their butts off this year.

Congratulations on your bonuses, Ropes associates!

(Flip to the next page to read the memo from Ropes & Gray in full.)

# Biglaw Layoffs May Keep Coming, But Their Impact On Head Count Won't Be Huge

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Law firms don’t want to cut into their muscle. It was a feeding frenzy in 2021, and many law firms acknowledged they overhired, but I don’t think there’s a risk to reduce head count at law firms of 5-6%.

— [Kirsten Keegan Vasquez](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/kirsten-vasquez), Major, Lindsey & Africa partner and VP of law firm recruiting, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/05/05/can-the-legal-industry-keep-the-20000-jobs-gained-since-early-2020/) on the slim likelihood of Biglaw’s layoffs being able to deeply affect the Am Law 100′s cumulative head count growth since 2020. Layoffs may continue, but Biglaw firms will try to cut as few attorneys as possible, Vasquez said.

# Quinn Emanuel Would Like $18,500 Per Hour, Please

Plaintiff side contingency work isn’t for every firm. There’s a huge risk/reward gamble and fortune (read: contingency fees) favor the bold. Even though that’s an accepted maxim of the legal industry, some fee requests are large enough to turn the heads of even seasoned legal watchers. Such is the case of the latest fee request of Quinn Emanuel.

As, well, [a bunch](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/quinn-emanuels-185-million-fee-is-either-a-bargain-or-rip-off) [of outlets](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/quinn-emanuel-seeks-fee-amounting-to-18500-an-hour-will-judge-approve-it) [have reported](https://today.westlaw.com/Document/I749ef7f0d34911ea9c95d36f2e2d42ed/View/FullText.html), the firm is seeking $185 million in fees for their representation of insurers suing the federal government under the Affordable Care Act. As the firm has noted in its court filings, that is only 5 percent of $3.7 billion settlement: “If approved, a 5% fee would represent one of the lowest percentage rates ever awarded to class counsel, even in cases with multibillion-dollar recoveries, such as this.”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
But as the [ABA Journal notes](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/quinn-emanuel-seeks-fee-amounting-to-18500-an-hour-will-judge-approve-it), translating that to an hourly rate is $18,500 an hour, which is quite the bonus:

Translated into an hourly fee, $185 million represents a bonus of 18 to 19 times the law firm’s normal billable hourly rate. The firm said the amount is reasonable under a “lodestar cross-check” that involves calculating the product of lawyers’ hourly rate with the number of hours worked, then applying a risk multiplier to compensate for the risk of no or reduced recovery.

As Geoffrey Miller, professor at New York University School of Law, [told Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/quinn-emanuels-185-million-fee-is-either-a-bargain-or-rip-off), while the 5 percent seems reasonable, that multiplier number will still be taken into account:

Miller said Quinn Emanuel’s 5% request was “reasonable,” but noted that a multiplier of 18 was “extraordinarily large.”

That dynamic is somewhat common in cases with huge awards, Miller said, and makes it hard to handicap how a judge will view Quinn Emanuel’s fee request. One factor working in Quinn Emanuel’s favor is that the insurers chose to be part of the class and knew the fee could be as high as 5%, Miller said.

# Circle Up For This Bonus Announcement, It's Magical

As kids, magic was always one of those things that grabbed your attention. Many a good trick has involved sleight of hand and disappearance. Maybe a bird flies or a volunteer gets cut in half. But the stuff that really gets me? Duplication and copying. The trick is not where did it go, but where did it come from?! And Clifford Chance, an illustrious member of the Magic Circle, has made Cravath’s year-end bonus and Davis Polk’s new special bonus magically appear.



I wonder what other tricks they have up their sleeves? Umbrellas that dry on their own? I hear it rains a bit in London.

# Biglaw Firm Reminds Associates They Really Need To Be Billing More
## COVID funtime is over, you'd best get back to working.

2020 is a weird year. I certainly never imaged a chair of a Biglaw firm sending out a reminder to all U.S. employees that um, yes, you really do need to hit your billable hours. Usually that “billables before all else” mentality is hardwired into Biglaw, but, like I said, this is a weird year.

Anyway, McDermott Will & Emery Chair [Ira Coleman](https://www.mwe.com/people/coleman-ira/) sent out an email letting everyone know that the firm’s planned reopening of their offices, scheduled for post July 4th, was not going to happen. What with the American response to COVID-19 being a terrifying hodgepodge that has, in various jurisdictions, prioritized economy over health leading to a dangerous spike across the country. But then Coleman points out that yeah, things are tough right now but we really have to get back to billing:

However, now that we’ve moved beyond the initial period of disruption, we need to focus on picking up our stride. Schedules from home can be erratic as our family and work responsibilities are blended more than ever, but we must continue to dig deep to hit our hours, reach out to clients (even if just to check in), help out colleagues, engage in BD or marketing efforts, or participate in pro bono projects. These next few months will be critical in helping us bounce forward and accelerate through this crisis, so let’s make them count.

We know that many are taking some well-deserved days off over the nest few weeks — and that’s great. We strongly encourage everyone to make time to rest and recharge so we can surge ahead, This is what star athletes do, and it’s a lesson we can all heed to help our team reach peak performance. It’s not that we won’t stumble, but we will always pick ourselves up, rally together and emerge even stronger.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And Coleman deserves some credit — [other folks in Biglaw have made a similar point without the compassion](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/partner-shows-all-the-compassion-youd-expect-from-biglaw-read-none-at-all/). His email at least recognizes some of the reasons folks may not be billing with the same gusto as in the before-times. But the message remains… you’d best get back to billing. This is the new normal and your hours need to reflect that.

# Litigation Funding In Arbitrations And Class Actions
## Claimholders in arbitrations increasingly recognize that litigation finance is a valuable tool for enforcing their rights.

In terms of important trends in the legal industry, the rise of litigation finance and the rise of arbitration stand out as two of the most notable. So it should come as no surprise that these trends are intersecting, with a significant portion of litigation funding going to support arbitrations, both domestic and international.

[Lake Whillans Litigation Finance](http://bit.ly/2RwCSZG), a litigation funder that invests in litigations in the U.S. and Canada and arbitrations globally, reports that a significant portion of the opportunities it sees are domestic and international arbitrations. Claimholders in arbitrations increasingly recognize that litigation finance is a valuable tool for enforcing their rights.

At the [Litigation Funding Forum](https://litigationfundingforum.com/tickets/?utm_source=DealFlow+Events&utm_campaign=39013852a1-LITFUND_FWD_DFEVENTS_CAMPAIGN_2019_03_12&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_e08bf40efd-39013852a1-87946539&mc_cid=39013852a1&mc_eid=553f6a885d) earlier this month, I attended a thought-provoking “fireside chat” focused on litigation funding in arbitrations and class actions, featuring two speakers: [Lisa Richman](https://www.mwe.com/people/richman-lisa-m/), a partner at McDermott Will & Emery who focuses on international dispute resolution (especially international commercial arbitration), and [J. Richard Supple Jr.](https://www.hinshawlaw.com/professionals-J-Richard-Supple.html), a partner at Hinshaw & Culbertson who has been involved in the funding world for several years.

Richman speaks four languages — English, French, German, and Spanish — and these language skills drew her into the world of international arbitration early in her career, giving her a front-row seat to the rise of arbitration over the past two decades. In terms of her involvement with litigation finance, she both helps her clients obtain funding and does second-opinion work for funders interested in getting another take on the viability of a case.

What distinguishes litigation funding in the arbitration context from how it plays out in other fields? Richman identified two key concepts. The first is the “seat” of the arbitration, the legal place for the proceedings. When a contract contains an arbitration clause providing that any and all disputes shall be arbitrated, it will specify the set of rules that will govern the arbitration and the arbitral seat where any arbitration will take place. The identity of the arbitral seat affects not just the procedural aspects of an arbitration but also the body of law related to litigation funding — so when entering into a funding arrangement, the parties need to consider the designated seat and how it regulates litigation finance.

The second concept Richman mentioned: privacy/confidentiality. Arbitration takes place in private, meaning that unless everyone has agreed to a different arrangement, it doesn’t take place in open court. But arbitration is not necessarily confidential, unless the parties have so agreed. In the absence of a confidentiality agreement, the parties are at liberty to share information about the arbitration — including prospective funders.

In recent years, there has been a push for greater transparency or disclosure of funding arrangements, at least in terms of the fact of the funding and the identity of the funder, to avoid potential conflicts of interest involving the arbitrators. But this has generally not extended to the specific terms of details of funding arrangements (which are not necessary for purposes of avoiding conflicts).

Momentum for greater disclosure of funding has also been growing in the class-action space, as Rick Supple explained. The Northern District of California now has a rule [requiring disclosure of funding in class actions](https://www.dandodiary.com/2017/01/articles/litigation-financing-2/district-court-adopts-first-kind-litigation-funding-disclosure-requirement/), and similar rules are under consideration [in Congress](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2019/02/13/republican-senators-reintroduce-bill-pushing-for-disclosure-of-litigation-funding/) and by the [Advisory Committee for the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure](https://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/2018-11_civil_rules_agenda_book_0.pdf).

What does this mean for claimholders and funders in class actions? Supple said that both funders and parties should at least consider, at the outset of a possible arrangement, the possibility that some disclosure could eventually be required.

One concern cited by supporters of disclosure is that outsiders like funders not be allowed to interfere with the professional judgment of the lawyers to the claimant. Of course, as pointed out by Supple (who represents lawyers in many professional-ethics matters), lawyers already have this ethical obligation. But it’s possible that judges might start requiring disclosure of the identity of the funder and some affirmation by the funder and the party that the plaintiff and its counsel, not the funder, will control the course of the litigation.

This issue of disclosure intersects in interesting ways with the selection of class counsel in a class action. Summarizing the case law, Supple urged funders who are interested in the class-action space to think carefully about the qualifications of proposed class counsel. If the lawyers under consideration have a strong track record when it comes to class actions, the court is less likely to require disclosure of funding. On the other hand, if the proposed lawyers do not have extensive experience with class actions, the court is more likely to be interested in the existence and nature of any funding arrangements, to ensure that the interests of the class are adequately protected.

Having to disclose the fact of funding and the identity of the funder is not, by itself, a major problem for litigation funders. In fact, it can sometimes accelerate the settlement of a case, letting the defendant know that the plaintiff has resources and can’t just be ground down in a war of attrition. So while required disclosures might increase, at least in specific areas like class actions, this development is unlikely to stop the continued expansion of the litigation finance industry.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

[This is a] reflection of who is holding the power right now. Right now, the power is largely with the employers and this is the sort of market where it won’t hurt them, at least in the short-term, to institute policies like these.

These are the sorts of things associates and partners are paying attention to.

— [Michelle Fivel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-fivel-41b6293/), a partner at legal recruiting firm Hatch Henderson Fivel, in comments given to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/skadden-forces-lawyers-back-to-offices-four-days-per-week) on Skadden’s recent decision to [mandate four days of in-office work](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/you-didnt-see-your-kids-before-the-pandemic-you-shouldnt-expect-to-see-them-now-says-elite-law-firm-partner/) per week. The firm previously required attorneys to be in the office Tuesday through Thursday, but after Labor Day, attorneys will be required in the office from Monday through Thursday.

# Biglaw Partner's (Alleged) Butt Shaking Gets Him In Hot Water

Okay, Imma be up front about this one. Yes, the allegations involved in this story include some serious stuff. And homophobic “jokes” are categorically unfunny and, more importantly, unacceptable. But. Butt. The image of a Biglaw partner standing up and shaking their tuchus in the middle of a mediation just strikes me as hilarious.

So, let’s get into the meat of this story. [Dennis Duffy](https://www.bakerlaw.com/DennisPDuffy), a partner in the Houston office of BakerHostetler, represents Chevron in an employment discrimination case. The plaintiff, Alclair White, is represented by Alfonso Kennard Jr. of Kennard Law PC. Kennard filed a motion for sanctions and disqualification for Duffy’s allegedly “intolerable conduct” during a mediation.

As [reported by Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/1243302), during the August mediation session Duffy’s alleged behavior included “shaking his behind” in front of Kennard. Additionally, the filing alleges that Duffy mocked Kennard’s ponytail and intimated that because of the hairstyle Kennard would want to have sex with Duffy.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Because of this alleged display of unprofessional behavior, Kennard is asking the judge to remove Duffy from the case:

“As a result of Mr. Duffy’s abusive language, plaintiff’s counsel questions his professionalism and does not want any more instances in the future,” according to the motion.

Kennard “is not convinced that Mr. Duffy can restrain himself in future communications based on his vulgar language. Mr. Duffy’s actions go beyond the pale of anything that should be tolerated anywhere — let alone in a legal proceeding.”

For their part, BakerHostetler is denying the allegations made in the filing:

“While we are unable to comment on anything discussed in a confidential mediation, we strenuously deny the assertions made in Mr. Kennard’s filing,” BakerHostetler said in a statement.

Regardless of the accuracy of the allegations in the filing, my appreciation for irony demands I point out that [Duffy’s page](https://www.bakerlaw.com/DennisPDuffy) on the BakerHostetler website includes, in a prominent position, natch, this quote from Chambers USA, “Clients describe Dennis Duffy as ‘highly professional.'”

# Goodwin Refuses To Pay Special Fall Bonuses, Promises 'Competitive' Cash Come January 2021
## Associates are disappointed, but not surprised.

Now that [Cravath has spoken](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cravath-is-not-offering-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-pissed/) on fall bonuses, you can expect the rest of peer Biglaw firms that weren’t [early adopters](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-fall-special-bonus-tracker-which-biglaw-firms-are-handing-out-cash-for-associates-hard-work-during-the-pandemic/?rf=1) of the Davis Polk scale to fall in line — and do absolutely nothing.

Not a single firm has opened its coffers since Cravath put the kibosh on associate appreciation bonuses, and Goodwin Procter — a firm ranked No. 22 in the latest Am Law 100, and that conducted a series of [staff](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/even-a-billion-dollars-in-revenue-cant-stop-covid-19-layoffs/) and [attorney layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/goodwin-stealth-layoffs/) earlier this year — is stepping up to do the same.

This is “unexciting news,” as one associate quipped. Here’s the memo, sent by Robert Carroll, chair of the firm’s attorney review committee:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
As you may be aware, some of our peer firms have announced COVID-19 related special bonuses, while others have remained silent or announced that they will not pay a special bonus. At Goodwin, we remain committed to providing compensation that is competitive with the market.

We will recognize your significant efforts in January, when we pay annual merit bonuses to our associates, counsel and professional track attorneys. These bonuses will take into consideration the great work that you have done for our clients and the special bonuses that have been announced by other firms. The bonuses will also take into account the incredible amount of time many of you dedicated to the firm and our clients in fiscal year 2020 as well as the challenges that many of you have experienced during the past year.  

As in prior years, bonus compensation will be awarded in offices outside of the United States in accordance with the respective rules and markets applicable in each jurisdiction.

On behalf of the entire firm, I would like to thank you for the dedication, hard work and agility that you have demonstrated in support of our clients and one another since the onset of the pandemic. Please let me know if you have any questions.

At least the firm seems to be committed to making sure its attorneys get full market compensation — and possibly more, but perhaps that’s too optimistic of a read on this brief memo. Associates will just have to wait to see how much bonus money they’ll receive for their “significant efforts” in January.

As always, we depend on you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Biglaw Firm To Pick Up The Tab For Your Next Vacay
## Relax on the firm.

We know that Biglaw is in the [midst of a talent war](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/the-biglaw-lateral-market-is-fire-right-now/), with associates reaping the benefits. The response from Biglaw has been [pretty generous](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/) with the money, but they know that [it’s going to take more than cold, hard cash ](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/elite-biglaw-firms-are-offering-more-special-rewards-to-keep-their-stressed-out-associates-happy/)to keep the associates they need. Some of the creative perks Biglaw has bestowed on hardworking associates include: [Peloton](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/the-new-hotness-in-biglaw-perks-peloton/), a [selection of high-end gifts](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/grading-all-the-davis-polk-gift-bonuses/), [billable hours for unplugging](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/top-50-biglaw-firm-rolls-out-incredible-bonus-eligible-time-off-policy/) from work, [free food](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/kirkland-sweetens-associate-perks-with-free-food/), and up to [$15K for any purchase toward rest, recreation, and relaxation](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/fenwick-spring-bonus-2021/).

The latest perk Above the Law has gotten wind of combines associates’ desire for both money and work/life balance. Last week, Goodwin announced a new program, “Recharge on Goodwin,” which picks up the tab for associates’ vacations. Eligible associates — those who billed 1,950 hours in 2021 — can choose between a number of week-long trips, including an island escape, a family-friendly Disney trip, a winery tour, a spa excursion, and more. And if none of the curated vacations are appealing, folks can work with a travel agent to create their own perfect trip.

Kudos to the firm for this program. Not only does it thank associates for all their hard work, but it also demonstrates the value they put on taking time off from work. You can read the full announcement from the firm below.

# What Good Might Come Out Of The Coronavirus Crisis?
## Here are four ways that Biglaw might benefit from the current crisis.

David Lat, before and after hospital discharge.

It’s hard to imagine that anything good might come out of the coronavirus/COVID-19 crisis. I [almost died](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/coronavirus-and-me-david-lat-covid-19-journal/) from COVID-19, spending [six days on a ventilator](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/09/my-near-death-experience-ventilator/) in critical condition, so I certainly don’t have many good things to say about the disease.

And so far, for Biglaw, the news associated with coronavirus has been … bad. If you scroll through Above the Law’s [coronavirus coverage](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/coronavirus/), you’ll see story after story about firm after firm implementing reductions or delays in partnership draws, cuts or freezes for associate and staff compensation, and more drastic measures, like layoffs and furloughs.

But upon reflection, I came up with a few silver linings to the coronavirus cloud. Here they are:

1. A greater openness to working remotely.

This is perhaps the most obvious benefit of the current crisis. Forced by stay-at-home orders to work remotely, lawyers have done so — and have discovered that the world continues to turn.

Many younger lawyers, especially millennials, are quite familiar and comfortable with working remotely. But many older lawyers, the ones who have traditionally resisted remote working, are now discovering that it’s quite feasible — and really not that bad.

Exhibit A: [David Boies](https://www.bsfllp.com/lawyers/david-boies.html), chairman and founding partner of Boies Schiller Flexner.

“I’ve always been dubious about working remotely,” Boies told me when we spoke by phone yesterday. “I didn’t quite understand how you can have the interactions that are so critical for practice. But now I’m getting into experiences and patterns of working remotely where I’ve developed these same kinds of interactions.”

Another friend, also a partner at a top Biglaw firm, posted on Facebook a list of things that she hopes we retain even after we enter “our next normal.” Here’s one of her items: “A more flexible attitude towards work from home in workplaces like mine that have been slow to adopt it. God knows, I’m dying to get back to my office, and see my colleagues in person, and I still think a lot of personal interaction is good for the work and good for people, but now that we’ve demonstrated that we CAN work from anywhere, a once-a-week tolerance wouldn’t be so bad.”

2. More tech savvy among lawyers, especially older lawyers.

In a piece for the [Times of London](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/technology-is-key-to-stopping-coronavirus-wiping-out-law-firms-5kd307zlk), Richard Susskind, a longtime observer of the legal profession, made this prediction:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
If law firms and court systems cannot find a way to work remotely in the coming weeks, Covid-19 will rapidly run them into the ground. To do so they will need systems to manage secure messaging, video calling, online collaboration and virtual meetings. Tools and companies previously unknown to most lawyers and judges — such as the messaging services Signal, Zoom, Slack and Google Hangouts — will be embedded in everyday legal life within a fortnight.-

And it sounds like lawyers and law firms are learning how to work remotely, by embracing technologies that many of them resisted learning about for the longest time. In my conversation the other day with David Boies, he marveled at how many tech tools he has learned how to use in the past few weeks — out of necessity.

“I’m meeting with co-counsel by Zoom, I’m arguing to a court of appeals in a few weeks by videoconference, and I’m FaceTiming with my grandkids,” he said. “Like many senior lawyers, I resisted adopting new technologies — but now we’re being forced to, and it’s a good thing.”

3. An enhanced focus on value and efficiency.

The Great Recession shifted some power away from Biglaw and toward in-house counsel. The recession (or depression?) arising out of the coronavirus crisis will likely do the same, meaning that law firms will have to compete harder than ever to win the business of corporate counsel. As Basha Rubin and Mirra Levitt, co-founders of [Priori](https://www.priorilegal.com/), wrote in a smart and thoughtful piece for [Corporate Counsel](https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/2020/04/09/covid-19-will-force-legal-industry-transformation/):

As a result [of the economic crisis], many in-house legal departments will reduce their outside counsel spending and pause W-2 hiring. In turn, those changes will put pressure on law firms and other service providers to deliver higher quality services more efficiently and cost-effectively than before the pandemic crisis…. [T]he pressure to deliver excellent services at lower cost could incentivize collaboration — and potentially drive valuable long-lasting partnerships throughout the legal ecosystem.

This pressure could be painful (or even fatal) for firms that can’t cut it. But it will be a tonic to the firms that rise to the challenge, and beneficial for Biglaw as a whole.

4. A greater sense of perspective.

I emerged from my COVID-19 battle with a much better sense of what truly matters. When you’re fighting for your life, wondering if you’ll ever see your family again, you realize that most of what we get stressed about in day-to-day life is pretty petty. Our nation and our profession are undergoing a similar crisis — and crisis helps put things in perspective.

In normal times, litigators love to get worked up over document productions. They enjoy holding opposing counsel’s feet to the fire, demanding strict compliance with discovery deadlines.

But I just heard a story from a New York litigator that I don’t think I would have heard in normal times. This litigator is handling a document production that’s due in a few weeks. Opposing counsel, lawyers from out of state, reached out and said, in essence, “We’ve heard about what you’ve been going through in New York. Are you okay with the current deadline, or do you need more time? If you need more time, just let us know, and we’ll notify the court.”

Litigators playing well with each other? We are definitely not living in ordinary times. And maybe that’s not (entirely) a bad thing.

It’s time to compile our annual list of the [top law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/top-outside-counsel-rankings-2023/) in the country and, as always, we turn to those who know best — the clients.

We invite all in-house attorneys to share feedback about your outside counsel. Which law firms do you rely on and for what kind of work?

As always, our survey is both brief and anonymous. Please [share your thoughts here](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1TCL7vZwPpnclX8).

# Morning Docket: 08.07.17
## * Well, well, well... it seems that another law school has succumbed to the allure of the GRE. Which T14 law school has decided to accept the GRE for admissions purposes? We'll have more on the law school that hopes to reel in those sweet, sweet [STEM majors](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/stem-majors-who-excel-on-the-lsat-have-no-interest-in-law-school/) later today. [[Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/08/04/northwestern-is-latest-law-school-to-accept-gre-for-admissions/)] * Make Twitter great again? Lawyers from the White House and the Department of Defense had reportedly warned President Trump about the ramifications of the transgender military ban for days before he announced the policy via Twitter without warning because he was tired of being ""slow-walked."" [[POLITICO](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/04/trump-john-kelly-challenge-twitter-241343)] * Rep. Maxine Waters is [reclaiming her time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EvuBakBj3I) to call Alan Dershowitz a racist. The congresswoman is upset the Harvard Law professor claimed that a D.C. grand jury will be ""unfavorable"" to the Trump administration in the Russia case because of its liberal leanings and ""ethnic and racial composition."" [[Free Beacon](http://freebeacon.com/politics/waters-accuses-dershowitz-racist/)] * According to Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein, the Justice Department will federally prosecute anyone and everyone who so much as thinks about leaking classified information -- but not members of the press, because they're ""after leakers, not journalists."" Perhaps he ought to relay this information [to his boss](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/jeff-sessions-vows-to-make-journalists-famous-by-jailing-them-for-protecting-sources/). [[CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/06/politics/rod-rosenstein-leaks-journalists-congress/index.html)] * Kirkland & Ellis is looking for law students to join its army of summer associates in 2018. The magic number of summers is somewhere around 245, but they ""could go over."" Do you have what it takes to be one of the few many, the proud prestigious? Be all you can be at K&E. [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/kirklands-hunt-for-roughly-245-summer-associates-in-u-s/)] * Crap, it looks like the legal profession lost a ton of jobs in July. We're talking four figures worth of jobs -- 4,300 jobs, to be exact. All in, the profession has only seen an increase of 600 jobs since January, and is still down by about 50,000 jobs since pre-recession highs in May 2007. [[Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/home/id=1202794793280/Legal-Industry-Sees-Jobs-Numbers-Dip-in-July?mcode=1202617075486&curindex=0)] * The Seventh Circuit will rehear ""Making a Murderer"" star Brendan Dassey's case en banc, following a 2-1 decision that Dassey's confession to murder was coerced and that his conviction should be overturned. Perhaps the full court won't be as sympathetic to Dassey's situation... [[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/08/04/entire-7th-circuit-court-will-rehear-the-making-a-murderer-appeal/?utm_term=.36ebbce912e0)]

* Kirkland & Ellis is looking for law students to join its army of summer associates in 2018. The magic number of summers is somewhere around 245, but they “could go over.” Do you have what it takes to be one of the few many, the proud prestigious? Be all you can be at K&E.

Money, money, and more money! Associates, we heard you like money, so we’ve got more Biglaw compensation news!

The latest firm to open its coffers for associates is Ropes & Gray, a firm that brought in $2,718,173,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it in 10th place in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking. While some firms are leaving their super-senior associates off the compensation grid entirely, Ropes is rewarding them with Cravath-inspired supersized salaries and bonuses.

These are the salaries associates at the firm will see, as of January 1, 2024:

- Class of 2022 – $20,000

While other firms have included ninth-years and more senior associates their own lockstep salary designations on their compensation grids (i.e., Proskauer ($435K salary, $115K bonus); Sidley ($445K salary, $115K bonus)), Ropes is the very first to offer super-senior associates a higher bonus payout. At $130,000, Ropes is now a bonus leader for Biglaw’s most experienced associates.

The good news at Ropes doesn’t end there. Associates who have annualized creditable hours above the firm’s 1900-hour requirement will receive additional bonus money. This is excellent news for all of the firm’s hardworking associates who logged long hours this year.

Congratulations to everyone at Ropes & Gray!

# Top Biglaw Firm Plans Partial November Return, But Adds In Flexibility For Parents Of Children Too Young For Vaccination
## The firm continues to focus on the health and safety of its lawyers and staff.

The decision to bring lawyers and staff back to the office is weighing heavily on the hearts and minds of law firm leaders. After all, many firms have announced return dates only to have to postpone them and later reschedule them again. While some have settled on forgoing 2021 reopenings at all, others have simply refrained from announcing specific return dates. Others still have opted to begin the next phase of their returns in November, rather than in October as originally planned.

One of those firms is Debevoise & Plimpton, which brought in $1,224,942,000 gross revenue in 2020, placing it at No. 31 on the most recent Am Law 100 ranking. The firm announced in August that starting on October 11, it would require lawyers (and “some professional staff”) to work from the office one to two days each week, and starting on November 8, they will be required to work at least two-thirds of their time from the office. Those plans have now changed.

In a memo sent late last week, presiding partner Michael Blair informed all U.S. and European employees that on November 8, the firm will “strongly encourage” their return to their respective offices. Now, what does that mean at Debevoise? Here’s a relevant excerpt from the memo:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
- From now through November 7, our offices continue to be available as needed, on a completely voluntary basis.
- From November 8 through January 7, we strongly encourage everyone to come into the office 1-2 days per week, initially to reacquaint yourselves with the office and your commute, and then to re-establish connections and new working habits.
Personnel have about a month to ramp up to their one-to-two day office returns, and this relatively relaxed expectation will continue through the start of the new year. Like several other firms have announced, Debeboise is also doing all-remote weeks for the holidays (Thanksgiving week, and the last two weeks of 2021). Starting on January 10, lawyers and staff will be expected to work at least two-thirds of their time from the office.

For those worried about spending that much time in the office during the pandemic, the firm is offering additional flexibility for the following groups:

- Parents of children who are too young to be vaccinated;
- Individuals living with an elderly person or someone who is immunocompromised; and
- Those who have moved outside their office location and need some extra time to return.

“[T]he health and safety of our people is our foremost priority,” Blair noted. “All personnel must comply with local office vaccine policies – which now includes being fully vaccinated in order to enter our offices where that is permitted….” The firm will also continue to abide by public health policy for masking.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

(Flip the page to read the memo from Debevoise.)

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# Cleary Gottlieb Matches Cravath Scale... Or Maybe Beats It?
## Is this better than a raise?

Cleary Gottlieb (photo by David Lat)

UPDATE (6/8/16 12:26 p.m.): Some associates have weighed in on the opposite side, wishing Cleary didn’t employ this strategy. See below.

No doubt you expected to see Cleary Gottlieb show up in these pages sooner or later. They certainly weren’t one of those firms who’d try to buck the trend. Cravath set a new normal, Cleary’s there to match it.

But there is a twist in Cleary’s compensation regime, and it’s one that either shortchanges associates or beats the Cravath standard… depending on your point of view.

First things first, Cleary matched the scale all the way up the line for its New York and D.C. lawyers, as well as those in its International Lawyers Program (for foreign attorneys working a temporary stint in the U.S. offices).

And, yes, the summer associates are getting a commensurate bump as well (just like the [summers at Paul Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/ny-to-180k-the-raises-spread-to-summer-associates/)) [UPDATE: A previous version of this story linked at this point to a memo we were sent that was actually informing incoming first years of the increase, not the summers.]

But it’s that sentence about “TOPS” in the memo that’s worth noting:

The TOPS contribution is not new, but it may be unfamiliar to those outside the Cleary orbit. This is the firm’s contribution to the associate’s 401k account. Rather than giving all that money directly to associates, the firm, as a rule, takes a set percentage of what would otherwise be salary and puts it toward the associate’s retirement. Structured this way, this amount is thus exempt from the statutory cap for personal contributions.

So on the one hand, you could see this as the firm taking cold cash out of associates’ hands in a paternalistic endeavor. On the other hand, by doing this, associates can pump more pre-tax money into their retirement accounts than they’d be able to if they got the money up front. In a sense, Cleary is beating the market with this tax-free compensation… associates just have to wait a lot longer to play with it.

Most Cleary folks see it through the latter lens. We had an outpouring of tipsters on this one, and everyone was universally pleased, at least if the number of exclamation points is any indication.

Congratulations, Cleary team!

UPDATE (6/8/16 12:26 p.m.): I thought it was strange that so many associate tipsters were all coming down in favor of the TOPS policy even though it takes present value cash out of their pockets. And now we have some dissent rolling in:

Many CGSH associates do NOT agree with the line in your article today about tops. That policy only benefits people who are maxing out their 401ks already, and most associates are not doing so with loans and so forth, but participation is still mandatory. There are several other unusual (some would say questionable) features of this policy as well, but needless to say, most associates would be happier to get their full salary, and make their own decisions about 401k contributions.

It’s an interesting strategy and certainly divisive.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs.

# Biglaw Firm Pivots Direction And Loses Partners In The Process

Big changes are in the air at Irell & Manella.

Yesterday, the Biglaw firm announced to all attorneys that the firm was pursuing an “alternative business model.” According to the email sent by partner [Jonathan Kagan](https://www.irell.com/lawyers-jonathan-kagan), they are “focus[ing] on areas where we have a clearly demonstrated record of success and excellence when compared to other firms.”

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The email goes on to spell out exactly what that means:

“We therefore plan to focus our future growth and investments in our litigation practice areas, particularly IP and complex business litigation. Although we will continue to have lawyers in other practice areas at the Firm (particularly in certain transactional areas), we do not anticipate making significant investments in non-core practice areas in the near future.”

As you might imagine, not everyone — particularly those in “non-core” areas — is excited about the change. And Kagan’s email reflects this, as he points to several partners, [Mike Kaplan](https://profiles.superlawyers.com/california-southern/los-angeles/lawyer/michael-w-kaplan/66538cfb-17f3-4694-a85f-770f95f64721.html), [Greg Klein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/klein-gregory-2378766/), and Harry Mittleman, who have departed or are on their way out. And, as the new reality sets in, more exits are anticipated.

Kagan’s email goes on to assure the attorneys that the firm is in “fantastic financial health,” which is always nice to hear, but especially so after high-profile departures.

Best of luck to Irell with its new strategic vision. And here’s hoping all those attorneys who are no longer aligned with the core focus of the firm find a welcoming lateral market.

Dawn Knepper

If you thought a thriving Labor and Employment practice, an Am Law 100 ranking that’s [climbing](https://ogletree.com/press-releases/ogletree-deakins-jumps-three-spots-on-am-law-100-now-second-largest-employment-law-firm-in-country), and a certification from the [Women in Law Empowerment Forum](https://wilef.com/certification/) meant that a Biglaw firm was immune from a blockbuster gender discrimination suit, well, you’d be wrong. Last Friday, [Ogletree, Deakins, Nash, Smoak & Stewart](https://ogletree.com/) was hit with a $300 million purported class-action by nonequity shareholder Dawn Knepper, alleging gender discrimination and unequal pay.

The [complaint](https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/documents/403/8555/2018-01-12-Ogletree-Class-Complaint-FINAL.pdf) alleges Ogletree systemically undervalues the work that women partners (shareholders in the parlance of the firm) do on behalf of the firm:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Through formal policies and widespread practices, [Ogletree’s] male leadership interferes with, limits, or prevents female shareholders from receiving the appropriate credit for the business they bring to the firm and their hard work in running complex and demanding cases day-to-day.

The complaint goes on to argue this treatment has a direct — and negative — impact on the pay and promotion of women attorneys at the firm.

There are also some eye-popping numbers in the complaint, which alleges that on average, women shareholders make ~$110,000 less than their male counterparts. And the complaint notes that while women represent about 58 percent of associates at Ogletree, a mere 32 percent of shareholders are women.

Kneppler is represented by the firm of Sanford Heisler Sharp, which is carving out a [niche for themselves](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/david-sanford/) suing Biglaw firms over gender discrimination. As Law.com [reports](https://www.law.com/sites/therecorder/2018/01/12/ogletree-deakins-sued-in-300m-gender-discrimination-suit/), Jill Sanford, one of the attorneys on Kneppler’s case, believes the moment is ripe for lawsuits just like this:

We are at a cultural tipping point where women in the workplace will no longer tolerate unfair treatment, whether it comes in the form of sexual harassment or, as seems true at Ogletree, discriminatory pay and promotion practices that disadvantage women.

Ogletree has lawyered up, retaining Nancy Abell of Paul Hastings in its defense. In a statement about the lawsuit, the firm said it will “confidently defend” itself:

“Equal opportunity has been a core principle of Ogletree Deakins since the firm’s founding, and we do not tolerate discrimination of any kind—gender or otherwise. We take the allegations filed by one California shareholder very seriously,” it added. “However, the decision-making process that governs our compensation system is both fair and equitable.”

We will continue to follow the developments in this case.

# Sexism Continues To Thrive In Biglaw, With Women Facing Undue Bias
## Will things ever change? Not while women ‘face a much tougher path to advance and succeed.’

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Sexism is alive and well in Big Law. And outside of the firm and in the courtroom, too. We’ve all faced sexism, but I was shocked that it could be so blatant and insidious.

— [Laura Leopard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauraleopard), founder and CEO of [Leopard Solutions](https://www.leopardsolutions.com/), in conversation with [Vivia Chen of Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/1980s-style-sexism-still-a-drag-on-women-in-big-law), where the two discussed the results of the legal intelligence company’s latest survey on the [challenges women face in Biglaw](https://www.leopardsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/Women-in-Big-Law-2023.pdf). While about half (48%) of survey respondents said they saw themselves on the partner track, nearly all (90%) respondents felt “frustrated with the support they had received from their law firms.” Addressing these inconsistencies, Leopard said, “I think some of them are indeed denying what they see. Many people downplay behaviors and situations that are uncomfortable for them. They may not want to process or deal with it, so they move past it.”

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

Sally Yates (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)

I’ve spent the last 27 years of my life in public service, but I’ve never felt drawn to public office. What I really miss is being a practicing lawyer. I know other people sort of have political ambitions for me — but for me, I’m a lawyer. … I wanted to get back to some of the day-to-day practice of law.

— Former Acting Attorney General [Sally Yates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Yates), who was fired after just 10 days in that position for [refusing to enforce President Trump’s travel ban](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/sally-yates-explains-why-she-defied-trump-on-the-travel-ban/), commenting on her [return to private practice](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/05/08/sally-yates-launches-investigations-practice-as-king-spalding-partner/). Yates will be a partner at King & Spalding, the firm where she started her career, and while there, she’ll be the head of the firm’s new investigations practice, handling situations where “the allegations are egregious and the public and press are involved.”

Diversity and inclusion are top of mind for law firm marketing departments these days. For Biglaw firms, expressing a commitment to boosting diversity in the profession is expected. But when it comes to executing on that commitment, the results have been uneven.

How are firms doing on diversity?

In a recent [episode](https://laterallink.libsyn.com/episode-10-diversity-inclusion) of Movers, Shakers & Rainmakers, hosts Zach Sandberg and David Lat reviewed the landscape. Citing data from Leopard Solutions, David noted that in 2021, 17% of lawyers in top 200 firms were ethnically diverse, a percentage that was unchanged from 2020. However, at the partnership level the representation of minority lawyers grew from 10% to 11%. As David pointed out, that increase is significant in percentage terms, representing 10% year-over-year growth. But at the same time, it is still far from representative of the broader U.S. population.

Some firms are doing considerably better than most. The ALM Intelligence 2021 Diversity Scorecard lists White & Case as featuring 21.9% minority partners, making it the only AmLaw 50 partnership with greater than 20% ethnically diverse representation. On the other hand, some of the most prestigious and financially secure Biglaw firms are notable laggards: minority representation in the Wachtell and Sullivan & Cromwell partnerships stands at 8.9% and 9%, respectively.

Is there reason for optimism?

As we discussed on the podcast, it’s easy to be cynical about calls for increased diversity in the legal profession. Every year discussion of the problem grows more prominent, but the rate of actual change has been glacial. Nevertheless, we point to the [Mansfield Rule](https://www.diversitylab.com/mansfield-rule-4-0/) as one cause for optimism. Modeled after the National Football League’s Rooney Rule, which requires teams to interview diverse candidates as part of the head coach hiring process, the Mansfield Rule “measures whether law firms have affirmatively considered at least 30 percent women, lawyers of color, LGBTQ+ lawyers, and lawyers with disabilities for leadership and governance roles, equity partner promotions, formal client pitch opportunities, and senior lateral positions.” Firms that commit to that standard can become Mansfield Certified.

As David noted, an advantage of the Mansfield approach is that it ensures diverse candidates gain interview opportunities without establishing a quota for hiring decisions. That should make it palatable even to some firm leaders who may be skeptical of more aggressive campaigns to increase diversity. Indeed, the number of participating major law firms has grown to exceed 100.

Even so, it is notable how many top firms have not yet chosen to participate. Let’s take Gibson Dunn as a case study. The firm’s diversity performance is mediocre — not the worst in its peer group, but not exactly cause for celebration. Gibson’s partnership features 12.1% minority representation (as reported in the 2021 Diversity Scorecard). For comparison, fellow California-headquartered firm Wilson Sonsini is at 19.2%. Interestingly, Wilson Sonsini is Mansfield Certified, whereas Gibson is not.

Who should take responsibility for increasing diversity?

On another recent Movers, Shakers & Rainmakers [episode](https://laterallink.libsyn.com/episode-11-monique-burt-williams-ceo-cadence-counsel), guest Monique Burt Williams, CEO of [Cadence Counsel](https://cadencecounsel.com), addressed the growing number of law firms and companies hiring Chief Diversity Officers. Creating a position exclusively focused on diversity and inclusion can be an important positive step, but it carries risk that senior management will delegate the whole problem to the new hire. As Monique likes to say, “your Chief Diversity Officer should be your CEO.” In other words, unless law firm leaders are personally committed and engaged in efforts to make meaningful progress, we cannot expect a substantial increase in representation of diverse lawyers in Biglaw. The challenge is too important to be delegated.

# A Letter To Incoming Associates
## What your law firm won’t tell you (but you need to hear).

Dear Incoming Associate,

As a newly graduated 3L beginning your summer-long cram session for the bar, you’re probably not focused on what law firm life will look like on the other side. But with the practice of law changing quickly, there’s no bad time to start planning for the future. With that in mind, I’ve composed [another letter](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/a-letter-to-an-incoming-associate/) to you, my future colleague, filled with a few frank thoughts I hope you find useful.

You Shouldn’t Know What You Want To Do Yet

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
At best, you have one or two summer associate clerkships under your belt and maybe a practical clinic at your law school. That’s the sum of your actual legal experience. If you think you already know the kind of law you want to spend the next 40 years of your life practicing, you might find yourself surprised once you get into it.

The practice of law is broad, and right now you’re as malleable and open to new experience as you’ll ever be. Take advantage of that. Get entrepreneurial and advocate for yourself to try out a variety of practices. You can’t know what you like and dislike until you give it a shot.

I’d also recommend remembering that the kind of work you’re going to be offered as a first year will have the flavor of the real practice, but it’s not going to represent what you’ll be doing if you stick with it another five or 10 years. As a new associate, the work you’ll initially be doing is some combination of simple enough for a learning attorney and boring enough that your senior attorneys would prefer not to do it. You won’t be doing doc review as a 20-year partner.

To really understand what a field of practice is like, pay attention to the work your senior associates and partners perform. It’s more challenging and requires a deeper skillset, but it also tends to be more fun. If their day is what you want your day to look like in a few years, then pay your dues, learn the field, and that fun work will start to land on your desk. If not, seek out a new path quickly. Don’t let yourself get locked into a situation you don’t like. That’s a lose-lose for you and the firm that wants to build you up.

Don’t Treat This Like The Gig Economy

It’s not breaking news that the old model of law firm career progression is largely dead. An increasingly small number of attorneys start out as summer associates, get hired as first-years, and move up to partners all under the same roof anymore. Job mobility is much more the norm now, and many in your generation are probably planning on cruising through a Biglaw associateship for a few years before figuring out where they actually want to be.

If you’re at an Am Law 25 firm, where partnership promotion is rare, then, yes, you need to be realistic. But down the Am Law rankings a bit, into the second hundred or in midmarket firms, going from cradle to grave with the same firm is not only achievable, but actively desirable. Staying in one place allows you to build goodwill and identity among an entire organization. That’s great on the business front, internal cross-marketing, and it’s just plain fun being in an office where you have warm relations with your colleagues. Lateraling to another firm entails leaving that branding behind and starting fresh.

The grass isn’t always greener outside firm life, either. I’ve heard from any number of departed attorneys that they wish they hadn’t jumped ship when they did. In-house work can be just as demanding of your time and energy as firm life, and your financial upside might be drastically capped. In-house attorneys have also reported being treated by management as barely tolerated cost centers, as opposed to firm attorneys who actually drive profits.

You’re the only one who can read your situation, but at least consider dancing with the one that brought you, bucking the Millennial trend, and shooting for partnership from the get-go.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Be Deliberate In The New Flexible Working World

Last year, most every firm in the country went remote. Firms had to make drastic changes to function in a virtual space, and many of those changes were largely overdue. Flexibility is the present, and most firms have wisely decided it will remain part of the future.

But flexibility brings its own set of challenges. You’re the newbie in town, looking to build relationships and work sources from more senior attorneys. That can be tricky when you, or the people you’re hoping to create connections with are scattered around the country.

The secret sauce is being intentional with communication. Whether by Zoom or in person, set up standing meetings with mentors and colleagues to ensure you get the guidance you need and forge bonds. If you’re at home, pick up the phone to ask that question as you would if you were in the office. Don’t rely exclusively on email or instant messaging systems. It might seem intimidating at first, but give it a try. Even if some lawyers you contact are too busy, most will make time, and you can begin cultivating those vital relationships.

On a practical level, going back to the chance of making partner, having advocates in your corner is always a good thing. Making human connections starts on Day One, and it can be done in person or remotely. But it can’t be ignored.

This Is Just A Phase

Finally, if you take nothing else away from this letter, please understand that these next few years will go by quickly. Professionally, you are going to grow, change, make friends, develop a smidgen of expertise, and before you know it you’ll look back on yourself now with a sense of nostalgia.

You’re here because you’re smart, driven, and focused. You have all the tools to make these next few years amazing, both at work and in the personal life that you also need to be maintaining. You’re going to face challenges and setbacks. You’re going to botch an assignment or say something foolish in front of someone you want to impress. Everyone you’re working with has done the same.

But if you keep all of this in perspective and focus your efforts where they matter, you’ll be on the path to a rewarding, fulfilling career and friendships that will last a lifetime.

# Will The Super-Contagious COVID-19 Delta Variant Change Biglaw's Reopening Plans?

Unfortunately, there’s a lot of conflicting information between the World Health Organization and CDC on this issue [concerning extra precautions for the vaccinated]. I don’t think law firm leaders are really grappling with it yet, because they’re all hoping people are going to be vaccinated and this won’t be an issue.

— [Kristin Stark](https://fairfaxassociates.com/our-people/kristin-stark/), a law firm consultant with Fairfax Associates, commenting on [how Biglaw firms may (or may not) choose to deal with the COVID-19 Delta variant](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/07/09/law-firms-monitor-delta-variant-spread-as-leaders-plan-office-return-policies/) when it comes to their plans for the reopening of their offices, and whether vaccinated people should still have restrictions. Thanks to the Delta variant, “[p]eople might have to get more cautious” and it may “slow down some of the firm return to office plans or changes how they go about it,” said [Lisa Smith](https://fairfaxassociates.com/our-people/lisa-smith/), another Fairfax law firm consultant.

Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Salary Increases At Elite Litigation Firm Say Associates
## Just when you think Biglaw salary increases are finished...

Williams & Connolly isn’t the easiest firm to crack open. The top-notch litigation firm prides itself on its closed feel — laterals are a rarity, partners are mostly elevated from within, and the firm generally avoids promoting “marquee” lawyers in favor of a firm-wide brand of quality. This makes Williams & Connolly a bit of a classic throwback in the anarchic “eat what you kill” world of modern Biglaw, but it works for them and more importantly their clients.

But it also makes them a real pain to cover because gathering intel from inside the black box is more difficult than at other firms. During the salary craze of 2016, Williams & Connolly, whose unique pay scale historically put them slightly above market, found itself beset by rivals jacking up pay. At the time, tipsters pointed out that the new normal left Williams & Connolly behind: “W&C managed to go under radar through recruiting despite now paying less than market firm from second year on.”

We’re now hearing scattered reports from anonymous associates claiming that Williams & Connolly has addressed this issue and bumped up associate salaries. Unfortunately, we don’t have many specifics beyond that. So it’s up to you Williams & Connolly readers to give us the goods on this characteristically quiet salary hike.

# How To Work For A Difficult Partner
## Try shifting the focus from the partner feeling irritated at having to train you to helping you succeed so that the client can benefit.

Jeena Cho

One of my favorite parts of writing for ATL is the emails I receive from my readers. I usually respond offline, but I thought I’d share this question as well as my response in a post because this is an issue I hear about often — how to work with a difficult partner. The email reads:

The senior partner in our group is very intimidating… And I’ve just had a lot of work with him recently where even the slightest irritated comment gets me really worked up and unable to focus properly or even eat regularly during the day. So, of course, where I feel like I’ve just pissed him off over what could just be normal first-year foibles, I dread coming into the office knowing that I have more work/hassling forthcoming from him.

I’d definitely like to know how to manage my workload so that I’m not one of these associates that bills 2300-2400 hours and doesn’t have time to do anything else, and also how to manage living a balanced life. I’d like to spend more time with my partner, and I’m also an avid cyclist and part of a team up here, but I barely have time to enjoy that either!

I’d like to start by stating the obvious: The practice of law is difficult. It is a hard profession. As a young lawyer, you have two goals that must co-exist:

- How to be the best lawyer possible; and
- How to learn to practice in a way that is sustainable, fulfilling, and enjoyable.
You have many decades of work ahead of you and figuring out ways of managing yourself — finding ways to deal with the stresses of law practice in a healthy and positive way — is critical.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
I can really relate to this email — working for someone who instills the sense of terror that seeps into every aspect of your life. First, remember what I said above. The [practice of law is difficult](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/11-reasons-why-its-so-hard-being-a-lawyer-part-i/). It’s difficult because clients come to us with really complicated problems and we’re responsible for fixing them. There’s an endless amount of information to learn, and the craft of lawyering takes years, if not decades, to master. (That’s why it’s called a practice.) It’s also difficult because of the adversarial nature of our system. And the law firm structure where it’s always about maximizing the billable hour just adds to the misery.

In your particular situation, there are two layers to what you’re experiencing. First, you mention the inability to focus or eat. This sounds like you are suffering from chronic stress. The bad news is that chronic stress can feel all-consuming. Your mind just wants to fixate on the thing that you’re stressed about — in this case, the senior partner.

Research on stress is pretty clear. While we cannot control the stressors in our life — for example, the senior partner’s reaction to your work product — we can control the impact those stressors have on our mind and body. That’s the good news. With practice, we can change how we respond to stressful situations.

There are many different ways of modulating our emotional reaction to a stressful situation, including self-compassion, exercise, meditation, relaxation, breathing exercises, engaging in hobbies or other enjoyable activities, increasing positive social interaction, and gratitude practice. The key is to choose tools that work for you and practice using them on a regular basis.

One of the downsides of billing by the hour is that it disincentivizes mentoring and training young associates. If the senior partner spends an hour correcting or critiquing your work, that’s one hour he “wasted.” However, there is a larger picture that’s important to keep in mind. You and your senior partner have the same objective — to offer excellent service to the clients.

In your interaction with your senior partner, see if you can find ways of reminding him of this common objective. You can say something like, “I know this motion is really important to our client, and therefore important to you. I’d appreciate your suggestions on what I could’ve done better so I can deliver the best work product possible.”

Use words that emphasize the fact that you are a team, and you are in this together. This will hopefully shift the focus from the partner feeling irritated at having to train you to helping you succeed so that the client can benefit.

As for the second part of your question on how to not let work consume your life, that’s of course the 64-million-dollar question and one that many professionals, not just lawyers, struggle with. My short answer is this:

- Get clear about your priorities. Aside from work, what else is important to you? Having a loving relationship with your partner? Being a good friend? Being a good brother or sister? Hobbies like cycling?
- What do you have to let go of to make time for these priorities?
No matter how well you budget your time, there’s the basic truth that there are only 1,440 minutes per day, so start with those things that matter the most, then let the less important items fill the remaining space. I wrote a longer article on this topic — [Three Words That Should Be Banned: Work-Life Balance](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/three-words-that-should-be-banned-work-life-balance/).

Finally, practice being a good friend to yourself. Treat yourself with empathy, compassion, and kindness. What would you tell your best friend if she was struggling with these issues?

P.S. I am offering a CLE on skillfully navigating difficult conversations on March 30th. Details can be [found here](http://bit.ly/1U5IUNt).

# No Woman, No Cry

There’s no getting out of it: This is a column discussing a syndrome in which lawyers (I suspect mostly women lawyers) sometimes cry on the job in what are arguably inappropriate situations, and the often negative (and avoidable) fallout that results.

Maybe I shouldn’t post this one.  It’ll only get me into trouble.  But what the heck — I’m here to talk about what I see and hear happening in the world of law, and darn it, this falls under that heading.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
So here goes nothing:

My client had done what a lot of lawyers wind up doing at some point in their careers — tried to get herself fired.

That’s a phenomenon I see all the time in Biglaw — the unconscious attempt to get yourself fired thing.  You can’t rationally convince yourself to quit, but the irrational part of you knows it isn’t about to let you stay, either.  So, in therapist speak, you “act out on unexamined feelings.”  That manifests itself in stuff like complaining about your job a bit too loudly in places that are a bit too public.  Or coming in late.  Or not coming in.  Or just acting weird at the office without owning the fact that people are going to notice and some of them aren’t going to like it.

I urge lawyers, if they have reached that point of no return (the place where you really cannot come back and work at your firm for one more day without losing your shit) then please, go ahead and own it, and make the decision to leave in a conscious way.  It’s best to reframe all aspects of your life as conscious choices, including your career, and put your decision process into words someplace safe (like a psychotherapist’s office) so you can take back your autonomy and be the actor in your own life, instead of acting out on unconscious, unexplored emotions.

You’re allowed to quit.  There will be consequences, especially if you don’t have another job lined up, or are saddled with a heap of school debt.  But everything in life involves a cost/benefit calculus; this is just another one of those things.

The person who most needs to know what’s going on with you, so she can deal with it, is your boss.  That way, instead of wondering what the heck is going on with that associate acting like a lunatic, she can process the news that you want out and, maybe even work together with you to find a solution.

My client freely admitted she’d been broadcasting her discontent to a lot of people — other associates, secretaries, paralegals, word processors, librarians, doc reviewers, you name it.  In fact, if you were with her for more than a few moments, you probably heard how miserable she was, along with a stream of complaints and criticism about her firm.

Sure enough, a partner she worked with eventually took her aside and said, “I’ve been hearing you’re unhappy.  Why don’t we set up a time to talk?”  They agreed my client would come by her office the next morning.

And that’s when my client called me.

# Cravath Announces Major Change To Partnership Model
## It's been almost half a century.

It’s not exactly fair to say that the entire Biglaw landscape takes its cue from Cravath. Firms can and do employ a wide variety of management models. But it’s telling that when firms adopt innovative models, we still describe them in terms of deviating from “The Cravath System.” Cravath’s approach to running a law firm is so baked into this industry, that when firms do break from the model, we can’t help but see it as a failing on their part. “Oh, you pay black-box associate compensation… I guess you couldn’t hack it like Cravath.”

So when the firm makes a major announcement about its very structure, it’s a pretty big deal. In a memo sent out this morning, presiding partner Faiza Saeed explained that the firm would abandon the lockstep partner compensation model in place for almost half a century for a new modified system more akin to what it used in the distant past.

Today, I’m writing to let you know about a change our Partnership has decided to make. Cravath is moving to a modified lockstep compensation system at the partner level. This decision will advance our strategic objectives so that we can continue to thrive in a dynamic marketplace while maintaining the values and culture — including our ethos of shared success — that define our Firm.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Lockstep partner compensation is one practice where most of Biglaw had already parted ways with Cravath. And while Cravath’s announcement doesn’t seem to be introducing an anarchic “eat what you kill” model, it does signal that the realities of that market finally proved too much. Which is sad, because fostering a genuine “partnership” of lockstep attorneys had real advantages in avoiding petty generation credit fights and keeping the leadership of the firm focused on the institution over the individual.

Hopefully the new modified system doesn’t sacrifice those advantages for the short-term value of retaining easily tempted rainmakers.

The firm seems cognizant of not losing the “firm first” mindset. “Our modified lockstep will continue to strongly emphasize rewarding the performance of the Firm as a whole. The underpinning of the Cravath System is teamwork,” Saaed wrote. Still, it’s going to be interesting to watch the firm attempt to find that balance over the next few years.

But in any event, this is perhaps a final blow to the old collegial model of lockstep partnership compensation. It’s not exactly surprising — [some blockbuster partner laterals in recent years](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/major-lateral-moves-its-open-season-on-cleary-partners/) suggested the lockstep model was suffering from eager poachers.

# Former Biglaw Partner Convicted In Cryptocurrency Scam

Mark S. Scott, a former partner at Locke Lord, was convicted in federal court yesterday on conspiracy to commit bank fraud and conspiracy to launder money charges. The case against the lawyer stems from a cryptocurrency, OneCoin, that prosecutors say raised money in a pyramid scheme.

Scott left Biglaw to work at OneCoin, and prosecutors say he had a key role in the plot to launder $400 million from the cryptocurrency. During trial, Scott’s lawyers tried to portray him as being conned by OneCoin co-founder Ruja Ignatova. But jurors apparently rejected that argument, and after a three-week trial, returned a verdict in a day.

[Law.com ](https://www.law.com/2019/11/21/ex-locke-lord-partner-swiftly-convicted-in-400-million-crypto-case/)has details of the scheme:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Federal prosecutors said Scott was introduced to Ignatova in September 2015 and eventually helped her launder hundreds of millions of dollars from OneCoin, which raised about $4 billion through a pyramid scheme. While OneCoin purported to be a digital token whose transactions were recorded on a blockchain, unlike real cryptocurrencies, there was no decentralized, public blockchain to ensure the system’s integrity.

Prosecutors say Scott used his proceeds from OneCoin — estimated at $50 million — to buy a yacht, several homes, and luxury cars. U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman [said ](https://financefeeds.com/onecoin-co-conspirator-mark-scott-gets-convicted-400m-money-laundering-scheme/)Scott used his skills as a lawyer to perpetrate his crime:

“Mark S. Scott, an equity partner at a prominent international law firm, used his specialized knowledge as an experienced corporate lawyer to set up fake investment funds, which he used to launder hundreds of millions of dollars of fraud proceeds. He lined his pockets with over $50 million of the money stolen from victims of the OneCoin scheme. Scott, who boasted of earning ‘50 by 50’ now faces 50 years in prison for his crimes.”

One of Scott’s lawyers, Arlo Devlin-Brown, a Covington & Burling partner, said Scott is “disappointed in the jury’s verdict and plans to appeal.”

# Are You Really Sorry?
## Don’t encourage an apology if the client doesn’t really mean it.

Attention, dinosaurs! Way back when (and we can use the Mr. Peabody’s Wayback Machine from the Rocky and Bullwinkle show), singer Connie Francis had a very popular song, “[Who’s Sorry Now?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9QEAtcz3o8)” Remember?

I’ve pointed out many occasions when lawyers and judges have apologized for various forms of misconduct, in court, in their firms, before state bar disciplinary panels, before judicial performance commissions, and online using social media. I have wondered if the apologies were truly genuine or just a way to wriggle out (usually unsuccessfully) of their stupid and thoughtless remarks and actions. How do you know if an apology is truly genuine?

In their new book, “[Sorry, Sorry, Sorry, The Case for Good Apologies](https://www.amazon.com/Sorry-Case-Good-Apologies-ebook/dp/B0B3Y87H37/ref=sr_1_1?crid=BEPS4KQHTK74&keywords=sorry+sorry+sorry&qid=1673745030&s=digital-text&sprefix=%2Cdigital-text%2C144&sr=1-1),” authors Marjorie Ingall and Susan McCarthy list six factors for good apologies. The authors take great delight (as well they should) in [calling out and eviscerating many apologies](https://sorrywatch.com/) that should never have been written or spoken, especially on social media. My disdain for social media includes, but is not limited to, half-hearted, bone-headed limp expressions of regret. However, the authors think that social media can be good for the art of apology, which they view as an art.

The term “walking back” aka “never mind,” while usually used in the context of admitting error in what was said, can be also applied to apologies. If you didn’t mean to say it, why did you? And if you truly in your heart of hearts didn’t mean to apologize, then there’s no way that the apology would ever be good or sincere. False sentiments of contrition are useless and piss off the recipients. Lousy apologies are just insincere attempts to excuse an embarrassing situation, and there are many lousy, cringeworthy, tone-deaf apologies. They are all around us.

As a mediator, I have wrestled with whether an apology does any good or only makes a bad situation worse. Just Google “apologies in mediation,” and you will be overwhelmed with content. Lots of mediators have lots of opinions about apologies. Don’t encourage an apology if the client doesn’t really mean it. On the flip side, sometimes a heartfelt apology can close the gap between settlement or not, and if some dollars are put on the table as well, it can be hard to decline that apology. However, there’s no requirement that an apology be accepted. That’s for the recipient to decide.

So, the authors have listed six factors that they think need to be in any genuine apology, and I mean genuine, something unforced, something that is said without counsel kicking her unhappy client under the conference table. People understand insincerity.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Here are the six factors to a good apology, as the authors say, to “get it right.”

The first is to say that you are sorry. Three little words. Don’t say “regret”; say “sorry.”

The second is to say that you are sorry “for what you did.” Don’t be wishy-washy and say, “the incident,” “the occurrence,” or other similar words. Be specific; don’t be narcissistic. This is not about you. You are not the victim here.

Just as important is the third factor: show why you understand you did was wrong. Show you understand the effect your mistake has had on the other side.

Fourth: don’t make excuses for the behavior. Only explain if it’s necessary. Take responsibility for what happened. The apology should be able to stand on its own. We do the “yes, but” routine all the time and there is noting more annoying than trying to excuse bad behavior. Bad behavior is bad behavior. Full stop.

We’re almost done here. Five, say why it won’t happen again. Hopefully, having learned from the mistake, vigilance and prevention against future occurrences should be communicated.

Lastly, offer to make up for it. Whatever that might be. Of course, if the injured party wants a gazillion dollars for a hangnail suffered due to a bad manicure, that is beyond the pale of reparation. The offer should be within the scope of the suffered harm. Reality must play some part in all this.

The authors list “listen” as necessary to the apology process. Agreed. We need to do more listening and less talking. When you find yourself in a hole, stop digging. In other words, STFU.

In crafting a good apology, the authors want the person who will be offering the apology to answer these questions: is there any blame shifting going on? Is the offense being minimized? Is the apologetic tone defensive? Does the person really want to apologize? Can there be an apology without blaming the apology recipient? If you are not sorry, then don’t apologize.

Words such as “regrettable,” “alleged,” “if,” “but,” “obviously,” and “unfortunately,” don’t belong in apologies. Think long and hard about word choices first before saying anything..

These six factors for a good apology apply everywhere in every situation to all of us, to the vast panoply of people and entities who screw up: corporations, individuals, politicians, physicians, celebrities, and, yes, even lawyers. How many times do you think a genuine apology might have avoided litigation, made it easier to resolve a conflict, or put something to rights that went wrong? [Elton John nailed it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3nScN89Klo). “Sorry” does seem to be the hardest word.

# New York Times Fires David Boies Over The Whole 'Grave Betrayal' Thing
## Welp, he had a bad day.

David Boies had a really shitty Tuesday — even worse than the Tuesday the Republican party racked up. In fairness, it was deserved — that’s what you get when you admit to participating in the scheme of silence and retaliation that allowed an alleged serial sexual harasser and abuser like Harvey Weinstein to operate for years without any consequences. Oh, and he also got fired by the New York Times.

For those of you who missed the [Biglaw gossip yesterday](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/david-boies-takes-responsibility-for-enabling-harvey-weinstein/), here’s the quick version: Boies was involved in hiring some… aggressive investigators on behalf of Weinstein. That investigation was charged with creating files on “targets” — women who might accuse Weinstein of sexual assault and the journalists who might write about it. The [New Yorker piece](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/harvey-weinsteins-army-of-spies) that details the extent the Weinstein camp went to to avoid public exposure — and Boies’s role in it — is well worth the read.

For legal ethicists, one of the more interesting aspects of the whole debacle is that while Boies was part of the effort to actively kill the [New York Times piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html) detailing the allegations against Weinstein, he was also repping the Times in other matters. Yeah, the Times has not taken kindly to… any of this information, calling it a “[grave betrayal](https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/927886127142404098/photo/1).”

Late yesterday, the Times [announced](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2017/11/07/boies-work-for-weinstein-raises-ethicists-eyebrows/) it had “terminated its relationship” with Boies Schiller Flexner, calling the Weinstein investigation “reprehensible”:

We never contemplated that the law firm would contract with an intelligence firm to conduct a secret spying operation aimed at our reporting and our reporters. Such an operation is reprehensible, and the Boies firm must have known that its existence would have been material to our decision whether to continue using the firm. Whatever legalistic arguments and justifications can be made, we should have been treated better by a firm that we trusted.

Ouch.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As one might imagine, this is a PR nightmare for Boies. His name used to be associated with [Bush v. Gore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7fvpewDonQ), [marriage equality](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/politics/2014/07/david-boies-theodore-olson-marriage-equality), and [high salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/associate-bonus-watch-boies-schillers-bounty/), and now it will forever be linked with enabling sexual harassment. That’s quite the hit.

Boies isn’t staying quiet. His strategy appears to be giving more information to provide the full color and context of his work for Weinstein. Below is a [firm-wide email](https://www.law.com/sites/americanlawyer/2017/11/07/criticism-rises-over-david-boies-role-in-weinsteins-army-of-spies/) sent to BSF employees, which while long, provides Boies’s side of the events and engagements in question:

Many of you have asked for clarification of my, and the Firm’s, role related to Harvey Weinstein and recent stories concerning the hiring of private investigators. You are entitled to clarification and it is important to me to make clear what happened.

Mr. Weinstein was a client of mine; he is no longer a client of mine or of the Firm.

In the first half of this year, Mr. Weinstein learned that the New York Times was considering publishing a story alleging that many years ago Mr. Weinstein had raped an actress. Mr. Weinstein hotly disputed that allegation.

I told Mr. Weinstein at that time that neither I nor the Firm would represent him in this matter, and he hired several other lawyers to represent him.

I also told Mr. Weinstein that the Times story could not be stopped through threats or influence; the only way that the story could be stopped was by proving it was not true.

Mr. Weinstein, together with the lawyers representing him, selected private investigators to assist him and drafted a contract. He asked me to execute the contract on his behalf. I was told at the time that the purposes of hiring the private investigators were to ascertain exactly what the actress was accusing Mr. Weinstein of having done, and when, and to try to find facts that would prove the charge to be false and thereby stop the story.

I did not (nor did the firm) select the investigators (at least one of which had been used by Mr. Weinstein previously) or direct their work; that was done by Mr. Weinstein and his other counsel.

While I told Mr. Weinstein that I was not in a position to represent him on these issues, his request to contract with investigators seemed at the time, like a reasonable accommodation for a longtime client. I regret having done this. It was a mistake to contract with, and pay on behalf of a client, investigators who we did not select and did not control. It was not thought through, and that was my mistake. I take responsibility for that.

I also want to address the issue of whether there was a conflict of interest with the Firm’s representation of the New York Times. First, when we were engaged by the Times we made clear that we needed to be able to continue to represent clients adverse to the Times on matters unrelated to the work we were doing for the Times. Our Engagement Letter, countersigned by the Times, expressly states:

“We have explained and you have agreed that as a result of the types of clients the Firm advises and the types of engagements in which we are involved, we may be requested to act for other persons on matters which are not substantially related to the Engagement, where the interests of the other persons, and the Firm’s representation of them, may be against the client’s, including adversity in litigation.”

Second, despite the language in our Engagement Letter, I told Mr. Weinstein that we would not represent him in this matter.

Third, because I perceived the investigators’ work as trying to ascertain the exact charges against Mr. Weinstein and to develop facts that would prove the charges untrue, I thought at the time that was an appropriate endeavor.

Had I known at the time that this contract would have been used for the services that I now understand it was used for, I would never have signed it or been associated in any way with this effort. I have devoted much of my professional career to helping give voice to people who would otherwise not be heard and to protecting the rights of women and others subjection to oppression. I would never knowingly participate in an effort to intimidate or silence women or anyone else, including the conduct described in the New Yorker article. That is not who I am.

If any of you have further questions, please let me know and I will try to address them.

It remains to be seen how or if this will change the gossip swirling about Boies’s role. But it does show just how easily lawyers, trying to make accommodations for clients, can get embroiled in their mess.

# BREAKING: Cravath Finally Makes Its Compensation Move, Coming Over The Top Of Market Raises!
## Let's see how quickly the rest of Biglaw catches up!

[The 2022 Biglaw raises… have been slow going.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/why-havent-more-biglaw-firms-announced-raises/) Back in January, Milbank [announced raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/), but the matches were not nearly as fast and furious as associates would hope. But then Davis Polk made[ its move](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/davis-polk-raise-2022/), matching the salary numbers for junior associates, but coming over the top for midlevel and senior associates. And all of a sudden the salary announcements started rolling in.

But the question remained what would Cravath — part of the troika of Biglaw salary leaders (along with the aforementioned Milbank and Davis Polk) — do about associate compensation? Well, now we have our answer.

This afternoon, the firm announced the following compensation scale — and WOW — they surpass even the elevated Davis Polk scale for midlevel and senior associates.

Class of 2021: $215,000 ($215,000)

Class of 2020: $225,000 ($225,000)

Class of 2019: $250,000 ($250,000)

Class of 2018: $295,000 ($293,500) $1,500 more

Class of 2017: $345,000 ($335,000) $10,000 more

Class of 2016: $370,000 ($360,500) $9,500 more

Class of 2015: $400,000 ($381,000) $19,000 more

Class of 2014: $415,000 ($396,500) $18,500 more

Let’s see how quickly the rest of Biglaw catches up!

The increases are retroactive to January 1. You can read the [full memo on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cravath-raises/2/)

It looks like Fox Rothschild is out of the porn game. You might remember that the Biglaw firm got a [lot of attention](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/fox-rothschild/) for their representation of the [extremely litigious](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/biglaw-firms-staggering-work-on-behalf-of-a-porn-studio/) porn studio, Strike 3 Holdings — they’d filed hundreds of copyright infringement cases on behalf of that client.

The cases, largely filed against John Doe downloaders as part of what’s been described as a file-and-settle strategy, were blasted by judges across the country. U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth of the District of Columbia said Strike 3 [“treats this court not as a citadel of justice, but as an ATM.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/biglaw-firm-gets-benchslapped-over-controversial-representation-of-porn-company/?rf=1) In California, another judge ordered sanctions for missing deadlines in [numerous copyright cases ](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/fox-rothschilds-representation-of-porn-client-lands-them-in-hot-water-with-judge/)calling it [“willful disobedience”](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/biglaw-firm-sanctioned-over-willful-disobedience-of-court/) of the court.

But all those porn copyright cases at Fox Rothschild were under the direction of a single partner, [Lincoln Bandlow.](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/lincoln-bandlow/) Apparently when he left the firm early this year, he took all that attention-grabbing work with him. As [reported by](https://www.law360.com/articles/1179079) Law360, Fox Rothschild the amount of new copyright cases they’re filing is down, way down:

After filing 320 new copyright cases in the first quarter of 2019 — and an eye-popping 1,667 such lawsuits over the course of 2018 — attorneys from Fox Rothschild filed just a single copyright case in the second quarter, according to data compiled by Lex Machina.

Of course that means the firm is no longer the most litigious copyright firm. Though Fox Rothschild hasn’t publicly commented on Bandlow’s departure, my guess is they aren’t sad to leave such notorious cases in their rearview mirror.

# White & Case Names New Partner Class
## New partners offer a glimpse of where firms are going.

It’s promotion time and [White & Case welcomed 45 new partners to the firm](https://www.whitecase.com/news/press-release/white-case-elects-45-new-partners) effective in 2020. This breaks the firm’s previous record for largest class, set just last year. Another sign that White & Case is committed to its global expansion plan. Altogether, the new partners represent 13 practice areas in 21 offices.

In the United States, the firm promoted 16 attorneys, of which over half are women and five self-identify as diverse. Globally, 37 percent of the class is made up of women.

Partner promotions are one of the most underrated tea leaves to read when considering a firm’s, for lack of a better term, “health index.” What practice areas is a firm investing in? What offices are seen as growth opportunities? How well has the firm developed internal talent? From this list, it’s pretty clear that White & Case doesn’t see M&A slowing down any time soon.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Congratulations to all the new partners. You’ve finally earned the right to make unreasonable requests and make passive-aggressive jabs at junior associates that will haunt their quiet moments for years to come.

You shouldn’t do, well, any of that… but technically you’ve earned that right.

# A Biglaw Associate's Supreme Court Debut
## A fifth-year associate at Jenner & Block will argue before SCOTUS on Wednesday -- how cool is that?

Waiting for their date with SCOTUS.

Law firms take different approaches to their associates’ professional development. Some firms let associates argue merits cases before the Supreme Court of the United States, while other firms [won’t let their associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/proof-that-law-firms-dont-really-care-about-associate-development/) argue motions [before a magistrate judge](//abovethelaw.com/2016/03/judge-delivers-stinging-rebuke-to-partners-for-freezing-out-associates/).[[1]](#f1)

Back in 2009, I wrote about [Lindsay C. Harrison](https://jenner.com/people/LindsayHarrison), at the time a fifth-year associate at [Jenner & Block](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/jenner-block/), who got to [argue a merits case before SCOTUS](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/01/jenner-block-associate-argues-her-first-case-in-the-supreme-court/). It was actually Harrison’s first oral argument in any court — and she [won a resounding victory](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/04/update-jenner-block-associate-scores-scotus-win/) in the case, [Nken v. Holder](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/nken-v-holder/).

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Some seven years later, Harrison is now a partner at Jenner, where she’s “paying it forward.” She’s helping a fellow Harvard Law School grad, fifth-year associate [Amir H. Ali](https://jenner.com/people/AmirAli), prepare for his debut before the high court on Wednesday morning. Ali will be arguing in [Welch v. United States](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/welch-v-united-states-2/), a criminal case that, per [SCOTUSblog](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/welch-v-united-states-2/?wpmp_switcher=desktop), raises “whether Johnson v. United States announced a new substantive rule of constitutional law that applies retroactively to cases that are on collateral review.” (If that sounds confusing, simply read Professor [Rory Little’s](http://www.uchastings.edu/faculty/little/index.php) excellent [argument preview](http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/03/argument-preview-complex-retroactivity-questions-arising-from-justice-scalias-void-for-vagueness-decision-last-term/).)

In some ways, Lindsay Harrison and Amir Ali — graduates of a top law school, lawyers at a top law firm, and former federal law clerks — are typical Supreme Court advocates. But in other ways, such as their diversity and their youth, they are not. As Joan Biskupic and her Reuters colleagues documented last year in their superb [special report on the SCOTUS bar](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/scotus/), most Supreme Court arguments go to a small group of elite lawyers, who tend to be white, male, and old (which is why experience in the U.S. Solicitor General’s Office is so coveted; if you want to argue in front of the Supreme Court before you turn 40, hie thee to the S.G.’s office).

As Zoe Tillman wrote last fall in the [National Law Journal](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=1202739099099/Rookies-Take-Bat-Before-High-Court), “associates are far less likely to argue cases in the Supreme Court than partners.” So it was both newsworthy and impressive when three Biglaw associates — [Ethan Davis](http://www.kslaw.com/people/Ethan-Davis) of King & Spalding, [Michael Kimberly](https://www.mayerbrown.com/people/Michael-B-Kimberly/) of Mayer Brown, and [Fred Liu](http://www.hoganlovells.com/frederick-liu/) of Hogan Lovells — argued before SCOTUS within a few weeks of each other. Davis, Kimberly, and Liu all graduated from Yale Law School in 2008, so they argued before the Court as seventh-year associates (Kimberly’s [now a partner](https://www.mayerbrown.com/people/Michael-B-Kimberly/)); Amir Ali, a 2011 grad who became a fifth-year associate just a few months ago, is even more junior.

I spoke with Harrison and Ali by phone earlier today about their upcoming argument in Welch v. United States. Here’s a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation.

Amir H. Ali of Jenner & Block

DL: Congratulations on the upcoming argument, and good luck! So tell us, in a nutshell, how you came to have this case and this argument before the Supreme Court.

AHA: Since the Court’s decision in [Johnson v. United States](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/johnson-v-united-states-3/) last Term, a few of us here at Jenner had been tracking the issue of Johnson‘s retroactivity, and whether people sentenced under the “residual clause” struck down in Johnson would get relief even if their convictions were final before Johnson was decided. We had enjoyed some success in a number of individual pro bono cases but did not have a case to bring before the Court.

LCH: It was a tricky situation. The way to get this issue to the Court wasn’t clear. The real circuit split on this question involves “second or successive” federal habeas petitions, but you’re prohibited by statute from seeking certiorari in such cases. How can you get the Court to hear a case where cert can’t be granted? You can try to to present the issue through the Court’s original habeas jurisdiction or mandamus proceedings, but that’s tough.

And then we came across Gregory Welch’s petition for cert — a pro se petition he filed with the Supreme Court, which by coincidence of timing was an initial rather than second or successive petition. He filed for habeas relief, his habeas petition got denied, but then he sought reconsideration based on Johnson. So his case raises the retroactivity question squarely, but it’s still technically his first habeas petition.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
AHA: My colleague [Trent McCotter](https://jenner.com/people/RichardMcCotter) noticed Welch’s petition on the Court’s docket and sent it to me because we had been working on this issue. The government had waived its right to respond, but the Court requested a response.

DL: So the Supreme Court was ordering the Solicitor General’s office to file a response to a pro se prisoner’s petition for cert. Did that jump out at you as significant?

LCH: Well, it does happen from time to time — it’s noteworthy, to be sure, but not so unusual that it cries out for action.

AHA: It’s generally hard to read too much into the Court’s ordering a response, but in this case it jumped out at us because we had been tracking the Johnson retroactivity issue. After we saw the order for a government response, we looked at the petition and realized it was our issue.

DL: So how did you contact Mr. Welch to offer to represent him? Is he currently incarcerated?

AHA: We reached out to him in prison. We sent him a letter, followed up by phone and, after he asked us to represent him, I ultimately visited him in prison. We filed a reply to the government’s response to Mr. Welch’s cert petition in December.

DL: And then when did the Court grant cert?

LCH: January 8 — easy for me to remember, the day after my daughter was born.

DL: How did you feel when you heard that cert had been grated in your client’s case?

AHA: Ecstatic. But I was in a meeting with another client at the time when orders came down. I checked my phone and saw I had all these emails from partners, including Lindsay, telling me the case had been granted. I also had emails from members of the media asking for the briefs. But I put my phone down and finished up my meeting first.

LCH: Amir was in a meeting when he heard the news. I was still in the hospital, having given birth the day before. I was hooked up to an I.V., checking the Order List on my phone. It’s a bit of a cliché, Biglaw partner working from her hospital bed, but it was true in my case. I didn’t mind; I had nowhere else to go. We had a conference call later that day, which I also joined from my hospital bed.

DL: The petition was granted on January 8 and the case is being argued this Wednesday, March 30. Isn’t that a bit fast?

AHA: The case is on an extremely expedited briefing schedule, with around 30 days being cut off from the standard schedule. For prisoners who want to file a second or successive habeas petition based on Johnson, the one-year statute of limitations started running from the day Johnson was decided last year, so there’s some urgency. [Ed. note: Johnson was decided on June 26, 2015, so it didn’t get quite as much attention as the other case [handed down that day](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/why-the-same-sex-marriage-decision-will-likely-come-out-tomorrow/): Obergefell v. Hodges, which made marriage equality a reality nationwide.]

DL: You graduated from Harvard Law in 2011, so you’re a fifth-year associate. I’m guessing this is your first oral argument before the Supreme Court?

AHA: It’s my first argument before the Court, although my second time at counsel table. Last Term — exactly one year ago from my argument this Wednesday, actually — I was at counsel table when [Jenner partner] [Michael DeSanctis](https://jenner.com/people/MichaelDesanctis) argued in [Brumfield v. Cain](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/brumfield-v-cain/), a death penalty case I worked with him on.

DL: And how many other appellate arguments have you had?

AHA: This will be my second. I argued before the Fifth Circuit on remand in Brumfield.

DL: Your second appellate argument, and it’s before the United States Supreme Court. Have the past few weeks been hectic?

AHA: Extremely busy. Because of the expedited briefing schedule, we had to prepare our reply brief while also getting ready for argument. We filed our reply brief just last Wednesday.

LCH: We had our first moot before the reply was filed, in fact. The expedited nature of the case has been a fun, engaging aspect of it.


One of Amir Ali’s moot courts (with Lindsay Harrison’s newborn baby, sleeping… like a baby).

DL: How many moots have you had?

AHA: Four moots — three moots internally, with partners and associates here at Jenner, and one moot over at Georgetown Law’s Supreme Court Institute.

LCH: Another unusual aspect of this case is that the government is siding with us on the issue of Johnson‘s retroactivity. The Court appointed counsel to argue the other side — [Helgi Walker](http://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyers/hwalker) of Gibson Dunn.

DL: I’ve noticed such appointments in a few cases over the years. Who decides on those appointments?

LCH: By tradition or practice, it seems that the circuit justice for the circuit where the case came from makes the appointment. Justice Thomas is the circuit justice for the Eleventh Circuit, where this case originated, and Helgi Walker is an outstanding appellate attorney in D.C. who is a former clerk of his.

DL: So how will argument time be allotted?

AHA: One hour of argument — 15 minutes for us, 15 minutes for the government, and 30 minutes for the Court-appointed amicus.

DL: With your argument less than two days away, how are you feeling?

AHA: I’m feeling very prepared. Anyone arguing before the Supreme Court would be lying if they said they weren’t nervous, but that’s what keeps me going.

DL: And how do you expect the argument to go? Retroactivity is notoriously tricky.

AHA: I think it’s anybody’s guess what in particular the Justices will be interested in. As you note, retroactivity is a complicated area of law, a topic that law students are afraid to see on their Fed Courts exams. I’m expecting a lot of interesting hypotheticals and no shortage of complexity. The issue itself might be of more interest to lawyers than to the public, but how the Court rules has the potential to affect a lot of people’s lives. A number of people are waiting for this case to be decided, and a number of cases have been held in abeyance for it.

DL: Speaking of affecting people’s lives, Lindsay, what’s the latest with your client from the [Nken](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/01/jenner-block-associate-argues-her-first-case-in-the-supreme-court/) immigration case that you argued before the Court back in 2009?

LCH: Awesome news! I got a text from him last week. He just got sworn in as a U.S. citizen earlier this month. There was a lot of activity in the case on remand, including proceedings before the immigration judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals, so it’s nice to see him finally become a citizen.

DL: Now the Supreme Court has changed a bit in composition since Lindsay’s argument, most recently as a result of [Justice Scalia’s passing](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/justice-scalia-and-me-a-love-story/). How do you expect the loss of Justice Scalia to affect the outcome of your case?

AHA: That’s anyone’s guess. We’ve heard arguments on both sides.

LCH: On the one hand, Justice Scalia wrote Johnson, but on the other hand, he was not overwhelmingly in favor of giving retroactive relief. It would have been interesting to see how he felt about applying his own decision retroactively.

DL: So what do you guys have planned between now and Wednesday morning? Any more moots scheduled?

AHA: We’re all done with moots, just some final prep and polishing from now on. I’m going to try and relax until I get called up to speak.

LCH: And definitely get some good sleep. And salmon — I’ve been trying to convince Amir to follow in the Jenner tradition of eating a lot of salmon before a Supreme Court argument. It started with [Jenner partner turned Solicitor General] Don Verrilli, who said that salmon is “brain food.”

AHA: I’m eating salmon tonight and tomorrow, so it’s all set up.

DL: I’ll ask you what I asked Lindsay [years ago](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/01/jenner-block-associate-argues-her-first-case-in-the-supreme-court/): what are you wearing to Court?

AHA: My usual suit that I’ve had for ages. My mom bought me a necktie that she really wants me to wear, so I expect to do that.

DL: Will she be there in the courtroom? Who else will be joining you?

AHA: Yes, she and my dad and my wife will attend, along with a large Jenner contingent — the incredible team that has been working with me on the case. I have to say that it’s pretty cool to be at a firm that supports its associates in such extraordinary endeavors. Lindsay has been amazing, and so has [appellate practice chair] [Paul Smith](https://jenner.com/people/PaulSmith), who helped out a lot with strategy during the cert stage and participated in moots.

LCH: But he couldn’t come to the moot this morning, since he had his own argument before the Court today.

DL: Wow, so two SCOTUS arguments in one week — a busy Term for Jenner.

LCH: We should end this Term with six arguments and at least seven decisions. My partners Paul Smith and [Adam Unikowsky](https://jenner.com/people/AdamUnikowsky) won the lesbian adoption case, [V.L. v. E.L.](http://www.nclrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Alabama-Adoption-Decision.pdf), but that was a summary reversal — no oral argument.

AHA: It’s great to have the torch passed. I’m very grateful to Lindsay for all of her help, especially since she’s actually supposed to be out on maternity leave right now.

LCH: I’m happy to work on this while on leave — I love getting to work on cases before the Court, both as an advocate and as a supervisor of associates arguing before the Court.

DL: Congrats to you both on the upcoming argument, and best of luck on Wednesday!

FOOTNOTES

[ [1]](#reff1) Yes, there’s a difference between pro bono cases and cases for paying clients (although one would hope that pro bono cases get treated just as seriously). DLA Piper [didn’t let its associates argue in court](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/proof-that-law-firms-dont-really-care-about-associate-development/) in a paid case, while Jenner is letting an associate argue in court in a pro bono case (as it has [done in the past](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/01/jenner-block-associate-argues-her-first-case-in-the-supreme-court/)).

But DLA Piper can still be criticized, since there was really very little risk to letting associates argue before Magistrate Judge Paul Grewal in light of the fact that he [explicitly invited it](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/judge-delivers-stinging-rebuke-to-partners-for-freezing-out-associates/) (and, as my colleague Joe Patrice noted, telegraphed that he’d [grade on a curve](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/proof-that-law-firms-dont-really-care-about-associate-development/)). And Jenner can still be praised for letting its associates argue before the Supreme Court, even in “mere” pro bono cases, because (1) the firm puts its reputation on the line every time one of its lawyers appears before the high court, regardless of the type of case, and (2) at many other firms, partners with no or few SCOTUS arguments under their belts would’ve grabbed these arguments for themselves, pro bono or not.

# 'Having It All' Is Overrated

There’s a lot of talk these days about work-life balance — and for good reason. It’s no secret that lawyers often find themselves under a lot of pressure, putting in long hours and facing fierce competition. It only makes sense that many lawyers feel like they can never catch up. Constantly trying to juggle their work and their personal lives can be tough.

But here’s the thing: you don’t have to have it all (whatever that means) to be successful. In fact, you can actually be more successful if you focus on what’s important to you.

Here are a few tips on how to do just that:

Define Your Success

The first step is to define what success means to you. This may sound like a no-brainer, but it’s actually vitally important. Think about it: if you don’t know what you want, how can you ever get it? Take some time to sit down and really think about what you want out of life. What are your goals? What do you want to achieve? Once you have a good understanding of your desires, you can start working toward making them a reality.

Prioritize Your Time

The next step is to start prioritizing your time, though this is often easier said than done, especially if you’re used to always being busy and putting in long hours at the office. It’s essential, however, if you want to achieve a good work-life balance.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Start by identifying which tasks are most important to you, both personally and professionally. Focus on those tasks and let the rest go. It may seem like you’re not getting as much done, but you’re actually doing the things that matter most — that’s what counts.

Set Boundaries

Another important step is to set boundaries. This means learning to say no, both at work and in your personal life. As difficult as that may be for some, the truth is that you simply can’t do everything, and that’s OK.

If you’re feeling overloaded, start setting boundaries. Decline worrying about the things that aren’t important to you. You’ll be surprised how much better you feel once you learn to prioritize and say no.

Make Time For Yourself

Last but not least, make sure you make time for yourself. This is a vital part of finding a good work-life balance. You need to schedule time for yourself, just like you would set time aside for any other important meeting.

So put it in your calendar and stick to it. Make time for the things that are important to you, whether that’s spending time with friends and family or pursuing a hobby. If you make space in your schedule for yourself, you’ll feel refreshed and rejuvenated, which will help you succeed both at work and in life.

Final Words

In conclusion, you must focus on what’s important to you if you ever want to be successful as a lawyer. This may mean saying no more often and setting boundaries, but doing so will help you achieve your goals in the long run. So, make time for yourself, focus on your priorities, and remember that you don’t have to have it all to have what you want.

# Associate Bonus Watch: The First Major Firm Matches Cravath
## It's bonus time at this leading law firm!
By [Staci Zaretsky](https://abovethelaw.com/author/staci-zaretsky/)

Just a few hours after Cravath kicked off the 2018 bonus season with a [rather generous (and rather familiar) bonus scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/breaking-cravath-announces-annual-bonuses/), another leading law firm has matched.

For the past three years, Milbank has been the first firm to match Cravath’s year-end bonuses — but not this year. We suppose Milbank doesn’t need to be quick given the fact that associates have the firm to thank for the [new $190K salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/).

This time around, Paul Weiss is first firm to hop on the Cravath bonus bandwagon. Bonuses at the firm will be paid on December 21. This date is a week later than the Cravath payout date of December 14, which might be annoying from a holiday shopping perspective, but it’s not a huge difference. Plus, who’s really going to complain about up to six extra figures in their bank accounts right before Christmas?

# New Grads Bound For Biglaw: Do You Know What You're Getting Into?

You worked damn hard in law school. And what did you get for it? Well, likely a debt that you have to work off for God knows how many years. You suffered boorish instructors and perhaps more boorish classmates, and the scrambling to move up the grade ladder, hoping for that brass ring.

Well, you passed the fraternity hazing that is law school, and now you likely just spent two days of your life, and untold hundreds of dollars or more, taking an exam which, if you are lucky and are allowed to pass, will permit you to enter the hallowed trade guild that is the bar.

Law school is the gatekeeper that assures a constant flow of raw material to Biglaw — it brands and clones you to fit right in. No coincidence that law school (1) is so expensive and lasts three long years, and (2) doesn’t teach you how to be a lawyer. That way Biglaw can keep you chained to your desk — you get the big bucks which you need to pay off your law school loans, and you get to hear — often — that you are not a real lawyer — yet. It’s a nice little arrangement.

Assuming that you are, God willing, allowed into the Brotherhood — now what? Do you know what you bargained for?

(And Biglaw still is, for the most part, a Brotherhood. I [previously mentioned](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/can-women-lawyers-ever-find-equality-in-biglaw/) a 2016 study by Major, Lindsey & Africa, which found that women law partners average about 69% of the compensation of male partners.)

You must jump on the treadmill, which will only start moving faster until you are running seemingly for your life. Is it lifestyle? Client contact? Hands-on trial work?

I went “over the wall” and can say that Biglaw is, indeed, an impersonal factory that demands loyalty but is anything but loyal in return. (Hmmm, where have I heard that expression recently?).

Collegiality?

As I wrote here [before](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/can-women-lawyers-ever-find-equality-in-biglaw/):

“Collegiality” is probably the most overused, disingenuous word in the Biglaw recruiting lexicon, and I suspect that every Biglaw firm touts it as its number one quality – and many naïve (new) lawyers believe the pitch. Yet likely no one who has ever plied the lawyer’s trade in Biglaw can say – if they are honest – that their firm is truly “collegial.” Fat fees and greed are the prevailing ethos – how can you afford to be “collegial” when “shareholder value” is the summum bonum?

But Are There Advantages To Biglaw — Besides The Money?

Besides the money, there is the status.

And did I mention the money?

Besides the money, you will learn every possible way of carrying voluminous litigation files up and down courthouse stairs, and reviewing millions of documents — useful skills if you later want to become a paralegal. And maybe — just maybe — by your fifth or sixth year you will be permitted a front row seat at a real trial!

And if you’re really lucky, maybe after you become a partner, you will be allowed to second seat a trial! (You gotta be a partner first — sorry you 90 percent who will never make it.)

But seriously, you will learn to be thorough, to be complete, and to leave no stone unturned. You will train with a lot of smart people and learn how (up to a point) to be a complete lawyer — even if you can’t try a case. And, best of all, you will be well-situated to leave Biglaw and decide then what you really want to do.

Oh, did I mention the money?

There Are Other Options

But Biglaw is not the only endpoint for all of your training, although it will allow you to repay loans faster than other types of practice — assuming you are not ignominiously let go after giving your last full measure of devotion.

Many grads opt for public service or government service (not exactly the same, at least not these days).

The money is a fraction of Biglaw, but the hours usually let you have a life. The hands-on experience cannot be beat, as well as the job satisfaction. This is nothing to sneeze at, believe me. Depending upon the job, you may try dozens of cases in a few short years — first seat! — argue appeals to the highest courts, become a Deputy Commissioner, and in many ways truly learn how to do it all on your own.

Good experience in and of itself, but great if you then want to open your own shop.

Then there’s SmallLaw, which is like Biglaw — except it’s not. First there’s the money — nowhere near Biglaw. But the hours are usually better, and the experience can be somewhere between Biglaw and government or public service. That is, you are likely to be in court more on all sorts of matters and proceedings, dealing with clients more, and learning how private practice works — all of its nuts and bolts from soup to nuts (to mix a metaphor).

This is actually a good alternative to Biglaw — if you can afford it.

In-house work? Usually that requires some law practice experience first, but if you can swing it you may be in for a surprise– it has become more than ever like Biglaw in that the hours are no longer “civil service” hours, but the client contact and hands-on work have increased. Not a bad gig — unless your company merges and you become redundant.

Then there’s the increasingly popular “alternative” practice modes.

Trying not to sound shamelessly self-promoting (I am a lawyer, after all!), after 40 years of every type of practice I found the ideal platform — what we call the “2.0 Firm,” or “cloud” firm. All of us are partners, and virtually all are Biglaw escapees looking for a better way to practice — and live. We’ve eliminated costly overhead so that we — the working attorneys! — keep most of what we earn from our work. We can therefore charge our clients less, and — best of all — we have no billing requirements! No 2,000+ hours for which we have to account, and no one we have to account to for our time! Like being a solo within the cocoon of 200 actually collegial lawyers who are proficient in every type of law.

But this is not yet for you, Law Grad. You need to be a real lawyer first. So wait a few, learn your trade, and then — give me call!

# Here's More Bonus News, You Salivating Dogs
## Another big firm hands out bonuses.

It’s December and you’re reading Above the Law, and it’s probably not to hear about [birthday parties](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/lawyer-spends-4-million-on-sons-birthday-party/) or [blockchain](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/what-is-blockchain/). No, it’s Christmas time, so there’ll be [scary ghost stories](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/brett-talley-being-withdrawn-good-night-sweet-prince-and-flights-of-ghosts-sing-thee-to-thy-rest/) and tales of the glory of [disgraced judges](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/what-will-it-take-to-get-alex-kozinski-off-the-ninth-circuit/) from long, long ago.

But you’re here for bonuses.

While we sit and wait on Sullivan & Cromwell’s bonuses (they’re a black box… reports are trickling in and we’ll have something once there’s a critical mass), another big firm just announced their bonuses.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Or… another two firms depending on whether or not you’re emotionally ready to accept that [Arnold & Porter and Kaye Scholer are one firm now](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/two-new-york-and-d-c-powerhouses-arnold-porter-and-kaye-scholer-agree-to-merge/). In any event, they are one firm and they have bonuses.

Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer just announced bonuses. This is in line with last year – match the market at 2000 hours (which can include up to 200 hours of pro bono or other qualifying non-billable), with special bonuses for 2400+.

Another market match with benefits. We’re on the record as [approving of market bonuses with an extra something special for higher billers](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/associates-dont-deserve-bonuses-argues-woman-who-isnt-an-associate/) as opposed to trying to stiff people who have fewer than 2400 hours and calling that a “gift,” so Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer earns our seal of approval.
