# Biglaw Firm Does Right By Junior Associates, Mid-Levels and Senior Associates Not So Much
## Not everyone is happy about these raises.

Not everyone is happy about these raises. Though, since Reed Smith [laid off attorneys earlier this year](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/nationwide-layoff-watch-biglaw-firm-cuts-headcount-attorneys-among-the-victims/), I guess the firm thinks associates should just be excited that they still have jobs. But, perhaps more accurately, it probably means they’ll [lateral somewhere more generous](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/elite-firms-need-to-increase-compensation-recruiters-smell-blood-in-the-water/).

This afternoon, the associates in Reed Smith’s New York office got an email, which indicates that the firm is bumping up salaries for first- and second-year associates, but not for any other classes. The mid-level and senior associates are left in the ill-defined land of maybe getting merit raises:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The problem with that, according to several tipsters, is the “merit” scale is used to compress the salaries of the more experienced attorneys, even those that are exceeding billing targets. Those folks were already below the old $160,000 market scale:

Some pressure on RS would be nice!
Finally bumped up starting salary to 160 in a handful of offices last year but with severe compression among mid/senior associate salaries. Now senior associates more than $110-120k below new market. Hard to justify for amlaw 20-25 firm with $1.1M PPP and $1.1 billion in revenue marketing itself as an international powerhouse. Associates very frustrated.

Reed Smith… is already below market. Call them out on it–maybe they will give us associates a break. We need a morale boost! They haven’t addressed it yet internally… crickets.

This certainly isn’t going to to help morale among the older associates. I’m sure they’ll super enjoy helping a second year through a complex offering they’ve never done before secure in the knowledge they are making all of $5,000 more.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
UPDATE 5:42pm: It seems the San Francisco and Silicon Valley Reed Smith offices got the same email as New York.



UPDATE 6/24/16 9:46AM: Reed Smith associates in DC, Tysons, and Houston all received the same email as NY, SF and Silicon Valley. Associates in Philadelphia, Princeton and Wilmington received a slightly different one. The 1st year starting salary was $145,000 there, now it is being bumped to $160,000, and second years will now make $170,000, while mid-level and senior associates are likely getting boned.



Our tipsters remain furious and certain that the majority of associates will wind up with salaries below market:

Second time in two years these offices have backhanded their senior and mid level associates in exchange for their years of hard work and given the people doing their cite checks an unearned windfall.

The raises also do not go into effect until January 1, a full six months after those truly following the Cravath scale get their money.

# What Makes A Good Book Of Business?
## Understanding profitability makes stronger firms and happier partners.

Ask any partner at any law firm to describe their book of business, and dollars to donuts they’ll give the same answer: a number. The number the lawyer reports will represent the amount of revenue that lawyer believes he or she is responsible for bringing into the firm. That magic “book size” is the industry standard, our shorthand for someone’s business generation success.

When headhunters reach out to lawyers, the first question they ask is, “What’s your portable book?” Generate enough revenue and you’ll make equity partner. Rake in enough revenue and you’ll be courted all over town. These are the numbers our careers rise and fall on. Revenue is the defining statistic of the private legal world.

Despite the legal industry’s obsession with revenue, the truth is revenue tells you very little about the strength of a book of business.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Not all practices are created equal, and not all books are created equal. Some practices command high rates, some low. Some practices get paid on every cent they bill, some have to expect substantial write-offs as a matter of course. Some practices collect on their invoices, others pray.

Most importantly, the amount of money a firm has to spend to get their revenue in the door varies wildly, and isn’t always simple to measure. This rabbit hole goes deep. There are countless books, CLEs, and consultants focused on the topic. But if you’re looking for the quick and dirty version, you take the gross revenue recovered as a direct result of an attorney’s business generation efforts and you subtract the labor costs, overhead, and other costs expended to produce that revenue. It sounds simple, but it’s surprisingly complicated to capture when you get into issues like calculating timekeeper cost rates, controlling for underutilized timekeepers, and fairly allocating overhead.

Another Tragedy of The Commons

I wrote [a few weeks back](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/the-tragedy-of-the-law-firm-commons/?rf=1) on how law firms need to get smarter about tracking and allocating internal overhead. When firms turn a blind eye to exorbitant and anomalous uses of firm resources, partners are incentivized to rack up big expenses that benefit individuals far out of proportion to the costs the partnership bears. By ensuring partners have some financial accountability for their decisions, a firm promotes efficiency and profitability for everyone.

Smart cost tracking isn’t just crucial to keeping a firm’s costs down — it’s a necessary component of understanding the true value of a partner’s book of business.

Say you’re running a firm, and you were forced to pick one of two candidates for lateral partnership. Candidate One services a major, publicly traded client, one they’ve had a relationship with for 20 years. This client alone throws off enough work to keep that candidate, a paralegal, and three associates busy full-time. Candidate One’s book of business is a solid $1.5M a year.

Candidate Two runs a practice servicing one-off clients. They keep themselves and a paralegal busy. They’re also going to need $100,000 in marketing support to keep their book of business going, and that book of business is valued at $1M a year.

To most law firms, Candidate One is the clear winner. Their book of business is larger, they have a reliable “big firm” model client, and they’ll keep firm associates busy. They also don’t need a major capital investment to keep their book functional, unlike Candidate Two.

But let’s complicate the example with some figures. Those two associates that Candidate One needs don’t come free, nor do paralegals. If the associates cost the firm $300,000 a year in salary and overhead allocation, and the paralegal an additional $150,000, Candidate One’s book of business is actually only turning a $450K profit off their work, out of which we’ll need to pay Candidate One’s own salary and overhead. In comparison, Candidate Two is only spending $150K on a paralegal and $100K on marketing, leaving their more modest book to generate $750K in profit. Candidate Two wins the profitability fight, despite their smaller and less “impressive” book.

Firms that understand this profitability gap can go out and cherry pick high-value, underpaid partners from around town. Firms that don’t will be stuck overpaying for partners who might turn them a profit, but won’t leave much left over for the firm as a whole.

Getting Smarter

Change is hard, and I don’t expect any law firm to have an easy time shifting its constituents’ focus from a revenue model to a pure profitability model. Nor should they. The truth is that large books of business can have benefits beyond raw profit, including reputation and the fact that big books can cover a significant amount of fixed overhead expenses. So profit is part of the answer, but not the only answer.

Where I have seen firms try to make that change, I’ve often heard the counterargument that profitability models are divisive and dangerous for the partnership. They pit partners against one another in a battle of profit, dividing lawyers into alphas, betas, and don’t-need-yas. They threaten the firm’s “culture,” a trap I’ve [written about before. ](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/the-culture-card-in-law-firms/)Most of these claims are unfounded and are thrown around as a way to put the brakes on change, which lawyers notoriously loathe.

Every time I’ve seen a firm make the transition to a model that factors in profitability, it’s been for the better. My own firm made the shift several years ago, and it’s been one of the best decisions we’ve made. It’s contributed to double-digit growth in major metrics in the face of an economy where most middle-market firms are struggling to tread water. Better yet, we’ve had so many partners coming up with great, creative ideas about improving the firm’s profits, reducing its expenses, and making it a better place for everyone here. Our culture has become one that fosters innovation. Our attorneys have taken to heart the business-world mindset that’s so often lacking in Biglaw, and we’re so much stronger for it.

Nothing strengthens a sense of culture like success. Who wouldn’t want to be part of a smarter, more efficient, and wealthier business? Take the plunge, do the work, and close the book on outmoded ways of valuing our profession.

John P. Rowley III (via Stephen Tschida aka @ABC7Stephen)

Who says law school students and recent graduates have no skills? One GW Law student just saved a Biglaw partner — in the most literal sense.

No, we’re not talking about finding a killer citation, or catching an overturned case in a brief about to be filed. We’re dealing with a far more serious situation, as described by [WJLA](http://wjla.com/news/local/man-recovering-after-vicious-attack-by-teens-at-gallery-place-metro-station-in-dc) in Washington, D.C.:

A man is recovering from a shattered hand and cuts and bruises Monday after a group of teens jumped him at the Gallery Place Metro station on May 12.

John Rowley says when he stepped off a Metro train and was walking through the station the teens attacked him.

John P. Rowley III is a lawyer — and not just any lawyer, but a former federal prosecutor and current [partner at Baker McKenzie](http://www.bakermckenzie.com/en/people/r/rowley-iii-john-p/).

And the bystander who came to his aid comes from the legal profession too:

[Rowley] says as they were pummeling him a young man stepped in to try to pull them off. Rowley says had the good Samaritan not taken action, it’s likely the teens would have thrown him onto the tracks.

He believes he mangled his hand when the teens tossed him at a passing train.

Rowley says he hopes to find the George Washington University law student whom he believes may have saved his life.

Above the Law has a significant law school readership. Might you be the GW law student in question, or a friend of this student? If so, [reach out to John Rowley](http://www.bakermckenzie.com/en/people/r/rowley-iii-john-p/), so he can express his gratitude to you.

If you don’t already have a summer associate position, perhaps that’s about to change….

P.S. This isn’t the first time a law student has come to the aid of someone in a train station. See this 2012 story, [Law Student of the Day: A Good Samaritan Hero](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/10/law-student-of-the-day-a-good-samaritan-hero/).

# 3 Ways In-House Counsel Can Promote Mental Health At Firms
## We, as in-house counsel, should recognize that we have an important role to play as the client in cultivating a healthy culture in our profession.

Hopefully, it is not too soon to talk about a silver lining from COVID-19 — which is the fact that there is a collective heightened awareness of mental health in our country, even among lawyers. While it is easy to point the finger at Biglaw and law firms generally, that approach isn’t very fair. Rather, we, as in-house counsel, should recognize that we have an important role to play as the client in cultivating a healthy culture in our profession.

Here are some easy ways to do your part as in-house counsel:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
1. Have a conversation. Client law firms won’t know that mental health awareness is important to you and your company if you haven’t brought it up. And while it could be awkward, depending upon your relationship with the firm, it doesn’t have to be dramatic. It could easily start with you sharing how the topic is important to you and why, followed by a direct ask: “What are you [firm][partner] doing in support of mental health for your lawyers and staff?” And if you are outside counsel, you may want to consider having an answer in case you get asked.

2. Support Location Flexibility. Recently, I read a thread on LinkedIn where there was a discussion about whether lawyers should be  required to return to the office. You may already know my stance based on my last post about hybrid work, but let me be clear on where I stand as the client: I really don’t care where you work from — as long as you are responsive and accessible if needed. If you are more efficient at home or happier, then why wouldn’t I want more efficient and happier counsel? And for what it’s worth, the in-house counsel on the thread had the same sentiment.

3. Set Reasonable Deadlines. I completely understand that sometimes there are emergencies, and asking for work to be done as soon as possible (overnight) or over the weekend might be warranted. But those times should be rare. As a former associate in Biglaw who hardly had control over her schedule, I am sensitive to making requests that may result in skipped workouts, cancelled dinners and missed bedtime stories. Even when I email a question to outside counsel, I try to be clear about when a response is needed. Of course, to do this well, it is important not to overpromise your business client. Also, for what it’s worth, because I often work during what I call “mommy hour” (i.e., when my kids are asleep – 9 p.m. to 11 p.m.), I include in my emails that I don’t expect an immediate response. I am also working on scheduling my emails to be sent during others’ working hours to reduce “pinging” others.

While these are all small things, they are all easy and within our control to execute, and also easy to encourage others to do the same.

# 11 Questions To Ask During Your Legal Interview
## Acing an interview is more than simply looking fresh and being confident about your skills and qualifications. It is about showing interest in the firm.

No matter how you look at it, getting called in for a job interview is no small feat. After all, you’ve literally beat out hundreds (maybe even thousands) of qualified candidates. You’ve demonstrated that you have what it takes to make it to the next (and hopefully) hiring stage. However, if you really want to ace your interview and impress your interviewers, you’ll need more than incredible qualifications, a firm handshake, the perfect outfit, and a healthy dose of confidence. You’ll also need to know about the law firm, what sets you apart from the competition, how to answer questions confidently, and ask them as well. After all, getting an offer includes all of the above and asking relevant questions that demonstrate your intelligence and desire to work at the firm. Now, before you feel panicky, overwhelmed, and stressed, we’re here to tell you that it is not hard to ask poignant questions and impress your interviewer. In fact, if you take our advice and ask these 11 questions, you’ll avoid the age-old silence and awkwardness that comes when most interviewers ask, “Do you have any questions for us?”

What type of cases and deals are distributed to new associates?

This question displays initiative and demonstrates that you are interested in the firm’s workflow. It demonstrates that you are passionate about the legal field, various areas of law, the complexity of cases, and the level of authority you might be given as an associate. It will also help you decipher the type of cases or transactions that you will be required to handle on a daily basis. Listen carefully to the interviewer’s answers to determine if the work sounds exciting, challenging, or mundane.

What kind of tasks do new associates typically handle?

This is a spin-off question to the previous one and is important because when you’re just starting out, you may have high hopes of arguing and being involved in high-profile cases. However, as a new associate, this may or may not be a realistic expectation, especially if you’ve recently graduated and have little or no practical experience. In fact, many large firms hire new associates so that they can receive on-the-job-training because they understand that they haven’t yet developed the lawyering skills necessary to be a successful attorney. Therefore, many larger firms pair new associates with more experienced ones, and the new associates mostly conduct legal research or writing, and assist in trial preparation and other mundane tasks.

In contrast, when you work with a medium or larger firm, you may have to wear many hats. For instance, you may conduct legal research, write briefs, engage in eDiscovery, and argue cases. By asking detailed questions about what might be expected of you at the particular firm you’re interviewing with, you’ll have a clearer understanding of what will be expected of you. And if you are offered and accept the position, you’ll go in with your eyes wide open and will know firsthand whether this firm is in alignment with your overall goals as to the tasks that you’re comfortable working on.

What makes this firm stand apart from others?

Although you should conduct independent research on the firm to determine the overall work culture, you still want to gather as much information as possible on the culture, benefits, and perks of working here. That is, you want to see how this firm is unique in comparison to others. For instance, does this firm have a reputation for providing its associates with a sound work-life balance? Do they offer an onsite gym or access to an offsite one, private health care, or even pet insurance? By understanding what sets the firm apart, you can decide if it is the best firm for you.

How do you consider the firm will grow in the next five years? What are the biggest hurdles currently facing this firm?

These questions demonstrate your genuine concern about the company’s future. Knowing about the organization’s future plans for projected growth and any hurdles will help you discern their overall stability. It will also help you decipher any problems. Of course, all firms have challenges, both big and small, but if you plan on working for the firm long term, you’ll want to ensure that it is a stable one before you take the position.

Could you explain the firm’s hierarchical structure?

It is important to understand the hierarchical structure of the firm or chain of command. This way, you’ll have a better understanding of the superior and subordinate levels of the firm. For instance, how many partners work at the firm? How many associates? What are the firm’s main practice areas? How are cases distributed amongst associates and partners? By understanding the managerial structure of the firm, you’ll have a better idea of how you might fit in as a newbie, as well as who has the power and how the firm is organized from a leadership standpoint. This knowledge will help you understand how the firm functions and to whom you will have to answer.

Will I frequently work with the same partners or be assigned to cases with different partners?

This question will help you ascertain how casework is distributed, with whom you’ll work, the type of assistance you might receive, and the type of tasks that you might be given. By understanding whether you’ll work with a particular partner or several, you’ll better be able to gauge how your communication style fits.

What type of associate is likely to succeed here?

Although you may get a generalized response from your interviewer, this is a great question to ask. You see, this question provides insider information about the traits, skills, or qualities that the firm values. It helps you determine whether you have those specific traits and what will be expected of you. For instance, if this firm values someone with a strong work ethic who can put in lots of overtime and you’re available to do this, you’ll be more likely to succeed. On the other hand, if you have a family and need to limit your work hours, then working in a firm that doesn’t require such overtime might be best.

How often will my performance be evaluated?

Constructive criticism can help you improve and make you a better attorney. Understanding how criticism is administered and how often you’ll be evaluated and by whom will help you prepare for performance reviews. It will also help you understand the law firm’s overall expectations so you can exceed those expectations.

What has been your experience working here? 

Although everyone’s experience is different, it definitely can’t hurt to learn about other people’s experiences while they’re employed at the firm. By asking about the interviewer’s experience, you’ll get an in-depth look at the overall work culture. You’ll be able to determine if it is a creative, task-oriented, cooperative, power-driven, or competitive work environment. You can determine whether your personality and work style will be a good match for the firm.

How did you become interested in your practice area?

Another great question is to ask the interviewer how they became interested in their practice area. This question demonstrates that you are an inquisitive candidate who is interested in the interviewer and other colleagues. By asking questions to get to know others better, you demonstrate that you are a team player and are someone who has exceptional communication skills. The interviewer will feel respected that you want to know more about them. Additionally, this question will help establish rapport and will help you get a feel for the type of associates who work at the firm as well as their likes, dislikes, and interests.

What kinds of nonprofit assignments (if any) does the firm ask associates to handle?

As you know, many bar associations require that lawyers engage in pro bono work or “free legal services for the good of the people.” If you’re someone who wants to meet this requirement or are interested in giving back to the community, you are probably searching for opportunities to engage in pro bono work. One great way to do this is to use your lawyering skills to help others in need. Therefore, finding a law firm that encourages (or, at the very least, supports) your pro bono efforts should be a priority for you. Therefore, if this is important to you, don’t be shy. Ask the interviewer if the firm looks favorably upon pro bono projects. Ask if they encourage associates to do more than 50+ hours of pro bono cases a year. This is important because if they don’t have a pro bono requirement or do not seem to care about this work, and it’s important to you, you may want to seek a firm that is more concerned with serving the community.

In conclusion, acing an interview is more than simply looking fresh and being confident about your skills and qualifications. It is about showing interest in the firm. By asking the right questions, you get insider information about the firm and cleverly demonstrate that you are well suited for the position. You showcase your enthusiasm and personality and do some essential investigative work to determine if the firm is right for you. After all, it’s just as important (maybe even more important) that you feel comfortable working for the firm as they feel comfortable hiring you to work for them.

# This Is How Am Law 100 Law Firms Are Using Generative AI
## Some Biglaw firms want to stay far away from generative AI, but others are using it to their advantage.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

I know a lot of firms came out and said we don’t use ChatGPT. It’s like banning a smartphone. Instead of ignoring it and pretending it doesn’t exist, we have guidelines for how to use carefully.

What lawyers are finding is it can automate commodity low-rate work because there wasn’t a budget to do that kind of work. We’re spending the same amount of time on the matter but we can automate some work. We can dig deeper into issues. And then the lawyer is able to spend more time on the higher-value work for the client. We’re seeing it more as a quality play for us. Lawyers can provide more value for the same amount of time.

— [David Cunningham](https://www.reedsmith.com/en/professionals/c/cunningham-david), chief innovation officer at Reed Smith, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2024/01/29/we-asked-every-am-law-100-firm-how-theyre-using-gen-ai-heres-what-we-learned/) concerning the firm’s use of generative artificial intelligence. Am Law reached out to members of the Am Law 100 to examine how those firms were using generative AI. Of the 41 firms that offered responses, the most common uses of generative AI are for summarizing documents/generating transcripts (15), legal research (11), drafting marketing materials/attorney bios (8), drafting legal material (7), and e-discovery (5).

# Biglaw Associate Salaries And Cost Of Living: An Imperfect Correlation
## With Biglaw offices reopening and office attendance soon to be expected at most firms (at least for part of the week), many associates are contemplating their post-pandemic Biglaw futures and considering their options.

With Biglaw offices reopening and office attendance soon to be expected at most firms (at least for part of the week), many associates are contemplating their post-pandemic Biglaw futures and [considering their options](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/remote-biglaw-positions-separating-fact-from-myth/). It still remains to be seen whether the exodus from large, high-cost cities during the pandemic will end up being a momentary blip or a permanent shift. But even assuming the migration to lower-cost locales partially reverses, the relative advantages of living in different parts of the United States remain front-of-mind for many associates.

A move from a high-cost city to a lower-cost one is a particularly good deal if you can continue to earn the same compensation. But it may be a tougher call if it comes with a salary cut. That’s a trade-off that employees of some major tech companies are currently weighing. [Facebook](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/05/how-silicon-valley-facebook-salary-cuts-are-shaping-remote-worker-pay.html) and [Google](https://www.cnet.com/news/google-rolls-out-tool-to-show-its-employees-compensation-changes-for-transferring-offices/) have both taken a relatively flexible approach to the post-pandemic workplace, allowing employees to request office transfers or permanent remote arrangements. But there’s a catch: pay localization. Facebook and Google have thus far declined to explain publicly how they will recalculate the salaries of employees who move. But judging from the approach of companies like [Stripe](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Stripe-employees-move-outside-sf-bonus-paycut-16255820.php), base salary cuts of around 10% are likely on the table.

Tech workers may not like it, but the reality is that paying lower salaries in lower-cost cities has historically been the norm for many industries. That’s also true of the legal industry, to a point. But Biglaw is an anomaly. Top firms largely ignore cost of living and instead pay associates the “New York” rate in several “major” markets, including the Bay Area, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Boston, and DC. On a cost of living basis, paying New York salaries in San Francisco is justified. In Houston? Not so much.

It’s good to be a Houston Biglaw associate

A November 2019 [NALP analysis](https://www.nalp.org/class_of_2018_buying_power_index) of median private practice first-year associate salaries relative to cost of living found stark differences in associate buying power. NALP calculated that Houston first-year associates enjoyed 2.4 times the buying power of their New York counterparts. Chicago associates were at 1.9 times the New York baseline. Meanwhile, first-year associates in cities like Miami, Portland, and San Diego were found to have less buying power than their New York peers.

The NALP survey looked at private practice salaries overall, rather than Biglaw salaries exclusively. If the analysis had been limited to Biglaw offices, the results would surely have been somewhat different. But the broader point is unassailable: associate salaries are poorly correlated with cost of living.

Billing rates are a key driver

If cost of living isn’t driving associate salaries, what is? The answer is billing rates. Houston and Chicago may not be high-cost cities, but they have plenty of clients willing to pay firms top-dollar rates. Viewed from that lens, paying top salaries in these markets seems fair: associates are being compensated for the value they create. Over time, as clients become more accustomed to the notion of top legal talent being based in regional cities, we may see more lawyers being paid New York rates in cities across the country. Biglaw firms in markets like Kansas City and St. Louis, for example, have raised their first year associate salaries up to 30% this year, significantly narrowing the salary gap.  That’s not to say that median associate salaries in secondary cities will rival the New York level. But for lawyers with top-flight credentials, geographic arbitrage may become increasingly possible and alluring.  

As we [discussed last week](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/remote-biglaw-positions-separating-fact-from-myth/), however, we aren’t quite there yet. The post-pandemic market is still sorting itself out, and for most Biglaw associates, the work-from-anywhere dream is not yet a reality. Still, that doesn’t mean you don’t have options. If you are a New York or Bay Area associate tired of putting up with relatively low buying power, you may wish to consider a lateral move to Texas. Needless to say, plenty of professionals have had the same idea recently, so [housing](https://www.recenter.tamu.edu/articles/technical-report/Texas-Housing-Insight) isn’t as cheap as it used to be. But at least you’ll pay no state income tax!

F-U, lawyers! F-U!

Lawyers historically tilt Democratic, but these numbers are truly dramatic, and I’m at a loss to fully explain them.

— [Kenneth Gross](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/kenneth-gross), head of the political law practice in the Washington, D.C., office of Skadden Arps, commenting on the latest information from the [OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/) website of the [Center for Responsive Politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Responsive_Politics) on [political campaign contributions from the legal industry](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202758972250/Legal-Community-Shuns-Trump-in-Campaign-Contributions?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL). As of Tuesday, [Hillary Clinton](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/) raised $18.33 million from members of the legal profession, while [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) raised only $52,398. Clinton has raised 350 times more money from lawyers than Trump.

# People To Follow For Legal Career Development Advice In 2024
## If you're looking for motivational speeches or vague platitudes, you've come to the wrong place.

A few weeks ago, I [asked](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/in-search-of-people-who-provide-useful-career-advice-and-are-generally-helpful-to-lost-attorneys/) for recommendations for people to follow who provide career development advice for attorneys. After receiving many recommendations, I have narrowed them down to the list shown below.

The people on the list generally provide concrete, practical advice instead of motivational speeches or vague platitudes. Their advice will not work every time, nor for everyone. Since an individual’s circumstances are unique, their advice can be tuned to meet their needs and remembered for future use.

Many of them are also known to mentor newer attorneys.

But most importantly, I found them to have genuine voices and to not be AI generated. They are not bound by a deadline yet write on a regular basis without sounding forced or spammy.

Without further ado, here is the list:

As 2024 approaches, we will have to deal with an increased amount of inflammatory, hyperbolic, and divisive rhetoric due to key events that occurred in the past and key events that will take place in the future. Because of this, it is of grave importance that we mute or block out the noise and instead follow and acknowledge the people that help everyone become more productive.

[It’s a] Faustian bargain. Once demand from clients comes down, some of the less productive associates may find they’re too expensive and they will need to start looking around.

— [Bruce MacEwen](https://adamsmithesq.com/team/bruce-macewen/), president of law firm consultancy [Adam Smith, Esq.](https://adamsmithesq.com/), commenting on the [troubling future that some associates may see](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/associate-salary-war-heats-up-again-big-firms-match-davis-polk-pay-2022-02-23/) as a result of the latest round of Biglaw raises. Davis Polk’s new [salary scale ranges from $215,000 to $396,500](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/davis-polk-raise-2022/), and if the legal industry begins to suffer, highly compensated associates without work may be some of the first to find themselves without jobs.

# Staff Attorneys Are Treated As Second-Class Lawyers At Some Firms
## Staff attorneys are lawyers just like traditional associates of a law firm and administrators should treat them more like how they treat other attorneys at a shop.

When most people think of law firm associates, they think of the traditional, partnership-track junior attorneys to which all of us are accustomed. These attorneys are incorporated into the fabric of a firm, and if they perform well enough, they may someday be promoted to counsel or even partner. However, many firms have staff attorney positions or nonpartnership track associates who are not treated the same as traditional associates. Law firms often hire such attorneys in order to save money, have staff perform work on a temporary basis, or for other reasons. Nevertheless, staff attorneys are often treated like second-class lawyers at many firms, and shops should try not to create different tiers of lawyers at their firms.

One of the biggest ways that staff attorneys are treated worse than traditional associates is in their rate of pay. Staff attorneys typically make far less money than traditional associates, and in certain circumstances, they can make half or less the amount that traditional associates earn at a firm. Employers sometimes argue that staff attorneys are not expected to work as hard as traditional associates or devote time to business development and other efforts, and this reasoning helps firms justify why they pay staff attorneys less money. Of course, some staff attorneys who work through temp agencies and similar arrangements can ensure that they do not work a substantial number of hours. In such circumstances, it might make sense to pay such lawyers less.

However, many staff attorneys are paid a salary, and their hours are not tightly regulated. As a result, it is not uncommon to see staff attorneys work just as hard or even harder than traditional associates. This demonstrates that firms simply create staff attorney positions to save money and not for the allegedly benign purpose of creating an opportunity for attorneys to work less and accordingly be paid less. Moreover, many law firms permit traditional associates to adopt a reduced workload and be paid a proportionate share of their associate salary. As such, if firms really wanted to create lighter workloads for some lawyers, they would simply adopt this approach for all lawyers employed at a shop.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Another way staff attorneys are treated differently than traditional associates is the resources offered to them by a firm. Many associates are permitted to attend conferences, learn from training seminars, and pursue other activities to grow professionally. This may require a significant expense on a firm’s part, but firms can justify this by pointing to the professional development obtained by the attorney who will hopefully stay at a firm and apply new skills to their work.

In my experience, staff attorneys are rarely offered the chance to attend professional development events. This is very unfortunate because staff attorneys sometimes stay at firms for long periods of time and they can apply any new skills they learn to their work. Moreover, staff attorneys may be more likely to go out of pocket to pay for CLE expenses and other costs since firms are not paying for the types of programs that typically cover this requirement.

Perhaps the most heartbreaking thing about staff attorneys is that they are frequently not considered full members of the lawyer community at a firm. Staff attorneys often do not attend associates’ retreats and other functions held for lawyers at a firm. Moreover, staff attorneys usually do not sit on partner-associate committees, which may mean that they have less of a voice when it comes to working at a firm. In addition, staff attorneys are often not invited to many social events at a firm. Indeed, I have worked at firms where staff attorneys were not even invited to certain holiday functions hosted by a shop.

All of these differences may generate an aura that staff attorneys are second-class lawyers at a firm, which is really unfair. All of the staff attorneys I ever worked with were extremely competent and dedicated to their jobs. Most had become staff attorneys not because they were interested in a lower salary or potentially less work, but because there were no other jobs available. Lawyers of all kinds are part of the same profession and have many shared experiences. It is not right for some lawyers to be treated as second-class attorneys at certain firms.

Ideally, law firms would not have separate tracks for lawyers, but in some situations, hiring temporary lawyers or attorneys that have less responsibilities is unavoidable because of short-term projects and the type of work to be completed. However, law firms should be much more aware about how they treat staff attorneys. Such lawyers should be afforded more professional development opportunities, especially since many staff attorneys stay at firms for extended periods of time and could apply any new skills they learn to their work. Moreover, staff attorneys should be incorporated into the social and professional fabric of a law firm. Staff attorneys are lawyers just like traditional associates of a law firm and administrators should treat them more like how they treat other attorneys at a shop.

# The Best Biglaw Firms In The World According To Corporate Clients (2021)
## Biglaw attorneys should care about these rankings, since firm survival depends on branding.

Thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, 2020 was quite the troublesome year for Biglaw firms. With salary cuts, layoffs, and furloughs galore, some firms stumbled while others sauntered into their next deal, and some firms suffered while others soared into success. Through their highs and lows, these firms attempted to maintain their brands — the image they want clients to see when making hiring decisions and their overall reputations in the marketplace.

But which Biglaw firm has the best brand in the world? Today, Acritas (part of Thomson Reuters) published its 2021 Global Elite Law Firm Brand Index, so you’re about to find out.

Acritas ranks Biglaw firms based on feedback from their most important clients, general counsel at companies across the globe with revenue of at least $1 billion. Here’s how the survey was conducted:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The Acritas Global Elite Law Firm Brand Index is determined through four open-ended questions from the full Sharplegal survey to find out from senior legal buyers:

– The first law firms to come to mind (Awareness)
– The firms they feel most favorable towards (Favorability)
– The firms most considered for multi-jurisdictional deals across three or more countries (Consideration)
– The firms most considered for multi-jurisdictional litigation across three or more countries (Consideration).

Because 2020 was such a complicated year, corporate clients tended to stand by Biglaw firms they’ve known and worked with for years. But that doesn’t mean that there isn’t room for improvement.

[Elizabeth Duffy, senior director, Global Client Services at Thomson Reuters,] noted that the survey results emphasize firms must continue to adapt to survive and grow. In particular, firms should embrace flexibility for remote working, more inclusive working practices and an improved work-life balance to strengthen their brand as well as to demonstrate how they value and respect their lawyers.

‘Firms have always known their lawyers represent the firm’s brand, but this last year has put a spotlight on how everyone within a firm is a brand ambassador,’ added Duffy. ‘When lawyers feel support from their leadership and are proud to work at the firm, clients recognize that, and it often leads to stronger relationships, both within the firm and with clients.’

So, which firm is tops when it comes to its global brand? That would be Baker McKenzie, which has kept its lock in the #1 spot for the eleventh year in a row. Here’s the full Top 10 (with three ties):

Would you look at that! Jones Day, the only U.S.-based firm in the Top 10, lost face on a global scale, presumably due to its association with Donald Trump. This can only spell trouble for the firm when the U.S. rankings are published.

Click [here](https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/insights/reports/acritas-global-elite-law-firm-brand-index-2021) to access the complete ranking of the Top 20.

Once again, this ranking speaks volumes as to which Biglaw firms are on top when it comes to client loyalty, but there are just a few U.S.-based firms among the Acritas Global Elite (with Jones Day almost sinking out of the Top 10 entirely). What does this say about our lawyers? Our Biglaw firms might be doing something right, but surely there’s a way to do things differently to propel additional firms to success.

Look who decided to come join the raise party. It’s none other than Debevoise & Plimpton, a firm that brought in $1,224,942,000 gross revenue in 2020, placing it at No. 31 on the most recent Am Law 100 ranking. Debevoise knows how important compensation is for attracting and retaining quality talent, so of course the firm was going to raise salaries.

Here’s that the new salary scale looks like at Debevoise, thanks to Davis Polk:

- 2021: $202,500
- 2020: $205,000
- 2019: $215,000
- 2018: $240,000
- 2017: $275,000
- 2016: $305,000
- 2015: $330,000
- 2014: $350,000
- 2013: $365,000
- 2012+: $375,000

# Biglaw Firm Announces New Salary And Bonuses At The Same Time -- All To Be Paid In 2022
## A long wait lies ahead of associates for these raises.

Even though July 1 has come and gone, Biglaw firms are still announcing compensation moves. This weekend, yet another firm made fireworks when it notified associates that salaries would be exploding, as well as bonuses. Exciting news all around, but there’s a little caveat on the salary news: nothing will be happening until 2022.

Vedder Price, a firm that grossed $255,000,000 in 2020, landing it at No. 127 on the most recent Am Law 200, announced a new bonus program for associates on Saturday. Those with at least 1,800 annualized chargeable hours as of December 31, 2021 (including up to 100 pro bono hours) as well as a performance rating of 3 or better will receive base performance bonuses on the following scale:

- Class of 2020: $5,000
- Class of 2019: $7,500
- Class of 2018: $10,000
- Class of 2017: $15,000
- Class of 2016: $20,000
- Class of 2015: $25,000
- Class of 2014+: $30,000

High billers at the firm will receive an “additional hours” bonus that increases on a pro-rated basis for increments of chargeable hours over the 2,000 mark. For the classes of 2020 through 2018, those bonuses will be $15K, $25K, and $60K, capped as an aggregate of their base bonus plus additional hours bonus. For the class of 2017 and beyond, there will be no cap.

Those with 1700-1799 annualized chargeable hours and a performance rating 3 or better will receive 50% of the bonus for their class years. It looks like those who come in below 1700 hours won’t receive this bonus at all. A “collections” bonus will also be available. These bonuses are payable on April 15, 2022.

As far as the firm’s new base salary scale is concerned, it starts out at $205K, so it seems like everything will be on par with the market, but it turns out that compensation gets a little constricted for midlevel to senior associates, but on a range. Associates must have at least 1,850 annualized chargeable hours to be eligible for a raise. Here’s what Vedder Price associates will be working with, effective January 1, 2022:

- Class of 2020: $205,000
- Class of 2019: $210,000-$215,000
- Class of 2018: $220,000-$240,000
- Class of 2017: $235,000-$260,000
- Class of 2016: $260,000-$280,000
- Class of 2015: $280,000-$300,000
- Class of 2014: $295,000-$315,000
- Class of 2013+: $305,000-$325,000

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The range here is “based on relevant market factors such as practice area and geographic area,” and when compared to the prevailing Davis Polk scale, salaries start to get crunched after the class of 2018. The more senior the associate, the more the scale deviates away from a dollar-to-dollar match. (Take, for example, Vedder’s highest eighth-year salary of $325,000. That’s $40,000 less than what’s being offered on the DPW scale.)

Associates at the firm may wish their new salaries and bonuses were coming sooner, but any raise and any bonus is nice, despite what may seem like an exceptionally long waiting period to get it.

With the GDPR looming, Facebook on the defensive, and data breaches seemingly a daily occurrence, privacy law is a matter of massive interest and urgency in 2018. Therefore, we decided to put together a new feature, [The ATL Top Law Firm Privacy Practice Index ](https://abovethelaw.com/top-privacy-practices/)(sponsored by our friends at Thomson Reuters). Privacy concerns are increasingly seen as an existential threat to a broad range of industries. Biglaw has responded with a swift and widespread ramping up of data privacy and cybersecurity capabilities. This Index is an attempt to capture the most active and relevant major law firms in this complex and rapidly evolving practice area.

We used three (equally weighted) factors to identify the firms in our Index:

- A survey of in-house counsel
- The firms’ resource commitment to the practice
- Thought leadership
Check out the full Index [here](https://abovethelaw.com/top-privacy-practices/).

Joshua Shirley, Managing Director at Kinney Recruiting

As far as the legal field goes, [Joshua Shirley](https://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/recruiters/joshua-shirley/) has a relatively non-traditional background. Being brought up on a hobby farm in a blue-collar family, Josh spent most of his childhood outside in the St. Louis sunshine. From bailing hay and landscaping to law school and litigation, Josh is a first-generation lawyer who turned the hard work of farm living and critical thinking of litigation into legal recruitment success. Today, he is a Managing Director at [Kinney Recruiting](http://bit.ly/2JrNyE4) where he matches attorneys to opportunities in Chicago, Denver, and other major markets throughout the nation. His secret to legal recruiting success, however, started on his family’s farm.

The thing that sets Josh apart from other legal recruiters is his personable style, patience and will to persevere – something he saw the benefit of when his dad introduced rotational grazing for their cattle. “We divided our land into paddocks, planted the very best grass in each one and rotated the cattle every few weeks. That allowed the other paddocks to rest and recover and keep our steers’ bellies full. Watching my dad have the patience and care for our cattle while looking out for the longevity of our land taught me a lot about having a long view in life and really caring for what you have. You never know when someone will show back up on your doorstep or when a random encounter will lead to your next career move. A lot of my success is because people I’ve helped in the past, either by helping them lateral or just by giving them advice, show back up looking for something new. Whether it’s land or a lateral move, the goal is to get whatever you have to the best place possible.”

Growing up, Josh was always outside. When he wasn’t bailing hay, landscaping, or mowing lawns, he was playing sports, skiing, and fishing. While he loved spending time outdoors and developed a great interest in biology, Josh didn’t necessarily want to pursue it as a career. When it came to choosing his degree, he chose English Language and Literature and minored in Environmental Science. That helped him land an internship at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in his junior year. Josh was the perfect fit for the unique and highly sought-after position, where he helped researchers and biologists in the Conservation Department while simultaneously spending time running boats up and down the Mississippi River. It also ended up putting him on a path he didn’t see coming. “After I had graduated from Southern Illinois University in Edwardsville, I got to a point where I was either going to go back and get a Master’s in Biology or try something completely different. I spent a summer shadowing the General Counsel of the Army Corps of Engineers and those four or five weeks changed my life. Shadowing her piqued my interest in law and l think she picked up on it. She encouraged me to apply to law school and before I knew it, I was in.” Josh was accepted and attended Vermont Law and Graduate School – the country’s best and most well-known environmental law school. After he had completed his first year, he transferred back home to be closer to family and got his J.D. from Southern Illinois University School of Law. “I didn’t know it at the time, but law combined a lot of my favorite things. The legal playing field is constantly shifting and you have to find creative ways to stay upright and steady at all times.”

Before entering the world of legal recruitment, Josh worked as an attorney, advising private energy companies in litigation and transactions. Josh particularly enjoyed his litigation practice and the opportunity to argue at trial and in dispositive motions on behalf of his clients. “Court is exhilarating. It’s so fast and your argument is put out there and exposed. You’ve got opposing counsel taking shots at it, the judge is asking questions and your argument is getting chiseled away until it’s at its final form where you either know your points of law or don’t.” Oddly enough, six months before he decided he wanted to pursue something new, a legal recruiter reached out to him regarding another litigation role. “I don’t want to say I had a bad interaction, but it was certainly eye-opening. Being in the industry now, I understand more about it, but at the time I got the feeling that I was just another resume – a tiny blip on that person’s radar. I ended up getting ghosted! I didn’t go into recruiting thinking all recruiters are like that. In fact, that experience made me think “Huh, I really like helping people. What if I tried recruiting?”

Josh was suddenly caught between starting his own practice, which is what he had initially planned, and entering legal recruiting. “Even though I was a junior attorney, I had substantial litigation and court experience and was fortunate enough to have a considerable client base. The thing is… I had a really good feeling about recruiting. I decided I was just going to take a long shot. I got a LinkedIn message one day from a recruiting firm asking if I had any interest in legal recruiting and it was a now-or-never moment. I took a couple calls and the next thing you know, I was moving to Chicago to join a recruiting firm and the rest is history.” In 2017, Josh joined a large company with nearly 100 fiercely competitive agents where he quickly became a top-performing legal recruiter. “Towards the end of my last firm job, the stress level was incredibly high and I had thought that legal recruiting would be a low pressure job — something I really needed at the time. I was wrong and I’m glad I didn’t know that because let me tell you: this industry is just as crazy. Starting recruiting felt like being dropped into a snake pit at first. I’m a very competitive person which is why I loved being in court, enjoy playing sports and why my brother and I can’t play ping-pong, but entering that kind of recruiting environment was very challenging. Being competitive helped because I saw other people succeeding so I willed myself into being good at it. After some early placements, I found I had a knack.”

Josh’s secret weapon was something he had picked up from his father. “My dad could talk to a fence post and have a good conversation. Growing up, I’d go with my dad to Walmart and he’d randomly start talking to somebody and I’d worry we might be here for two days talking about some hardware tool. I’d say ‘Dad, do you know this person?’ and he’d always respond with ‘Never met ’em,’ when I had important video games to get back to! I guess I got that from my dad.” Part of what makes Josh such a talented recruiter is his unparalleled ability to connect with just about anybody. “I like meeting new people and really getting to know them. I made some lateral moves early on in my career that turned into long-lasting connections and I made great friends out of some of those candidates. Four years on and we still go catch a baseball game or grab a drink.”

In 2020, Josh started looking for something bigger. “I don’t know if Robert even knows this but when I started looking for a new recruiting firm, I didn’t even apply to or look at any other recruiting firms. Kinney was the only one. I flew in to meet Robert and when I met the team, I immediately knew that they are a good bunch. Robert, Danny, and Jack were so positive and friendly and when they shared some deals they had worked on, I was all in. The stuff Robert works on is what most recruiters aspire to get to at some point in their career. I remember thinking, ‘Whatever these guys are doing and whatever they have to teach me, I really need to join and learn.’ I had done some significant deals prior to Kinney but this was the type of recruiting practice that I wanted to be a part of – a group of good and upstanding recruiters, working on some of the best and biggest placements in the nation, so I joined Kinney in May 2020. It was just one of those things – when you know, you know.”

Josh’s combination of patience, which he picked up on the farm, and the grit he developed in litigation is part of what puts Kinney Recruiting in a league of its own. “The brunt of being an honorable and good recruiter is approaching this job with the mindset that you’re here to help people. That’s what we’re about. It’s about being honest and sharing what you know with whoever is open to hearing it. Having an intelligent drive to get to the decision makers and the people leading these groups is so important. Anyone can regurgitate a job description but finding out what sort of deals they’re working on, what industries they’re working in, what kind of background knowledge would be helpful to the practice is invaluable. Those are the details that help you fit the right person at the right firm and help get people closer to their end goal. Our practice in Chicago has cultivated so many good relationships with partners where I get to talk directly to them. The goal is not to just be pushing uphill but pushing uphill in the most effective manner. The other thing is having a lot of grit. At first, candidates are often not incredibly receptive to advice but if you’re patient and can prove that your advice works, you’ve got a connection for life.”

Just shy of six years in the industry, Josh is only going up. “There’s a lot to learn in recruiting and there’s a lot about the legal industry that you’re only able to learn in this field. My advice to candidates is to appreciate, internalize and take advice that’s worked for other candidates. I really wish they would have taught us some of this stuff at law school but until they do, we’re here to help you and I’m always up for a call (and baseball game)!”

# Associates At Biglaw Firm Now Really Bringing In The Dough

He-hee.

Nothing says lovin’ like salary increases in the oven. It is this tortured series of references that bring us to the news that Pillsbury has matched the prevailing salary scale.

After flirting with a merger earlier this year, Pillsbury is closing out the year with some good news for its attorneys.

The firm follows a slightly different classification system than most:

Class	Bonus
First-years	$225K
Second-years	$235K
Third-years	$260K
Fourth-years	$310K
Fifth-years	$365K
Senior Associate 1	$390K
Senior Associate 2	$420K
Counsel	$435K
As for bonuses, the firm commits to maintaining its established market bonus and super bonus formula. So that’s a match based on the corresponding class year and, if the past remains the guide, an additional $50,000 on top of these numbers for top performers.

Memo on the next page.

Please help us help you when it comes to salary news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Salary) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Salary”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

With the Fourth almost upon us, it’s time to figure out your grilling wardrobe. Whether you call it a barbecue or a cook out or a potential fire hazard, when it comes to celebrating the holiday, you’ll need to be set up with the right gear.

Assuming you aren’t in the office.

This [“I’m Grilling A Witness!” apron](http://amzn.to/28TmQHP) (affiliate link) is a fun addition to any party, plus it gives your guests that queasy feeling that you might just be a mob lawyer with a Titus Adronicus kick.

If you’d rather have a [Better Call Saul apron](http://amzn.to/28TQlqI) (affiliate link), that can be arranged.

And don’t forget to get yourself the best grill you can. Whether [you live in Dallas](http://amzn.to/28TR1wz) or [New York](http://amzn.to/28PP2Wq) (affiliate links)

# Your New Mission Is To Get This Message To As Many Clients As Possible

…to get folks to take a survey.

How do clients see the law firm ecosystem? Which firms do they trust and for what work? If you’re trying to build a practice, shouldn’t you know what lawyers clients trust in that space so you can shape your practice to compete?

And if you’re already on top, don’t you want as many people to know that as possible?

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
For the last few years, Above the Law has put together a [Top Outside Counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/top-outside-counsel-2021/) report featuring input from corporate counsel and in-house attorneys at around 440 companies, ranging from small and medium-sized private companies to large public corporations. For the 2022 edition, let’s really blow this out and get responses from the biggest cross-section of clients ever. The more information we get, the more illuminating this report will be.

Lawyers get a lot of survey requests and there are almost certainly in-house attorneys out there that just breezed over our request. So it’s time for outside counsel to do their part and make sure clients are participating in the survey.

It helps firms. It helps legal departments. There’s no reason we can’t get massive participation here.

Get them [to the survey here](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3gemHFXLZ9J3Gpo).

# Speaking For The Sake Of Having Spoken
## Try something different: next time, speak when you actually have something to say.

Long ago, when I was in college, a not-very-distinguished member of our school’s basketball team lived across the hall from me. He was put into a game for garbage time — we were ahead or behind by 20, and it really didn’t matter what happened on the court. He took a 28-footer.

“What the heck were you doing taking that shot?”

“My name’s gonna show up on the scorecard, one way or the other. One for one and three points. Or oh for one and zero points. Whatever. If I played, my name’s gonna show up when they write about it.”

Shooting for the sake of having taken a shot.

I think we occasionally see speaking for the sake of having spoken.

On the quarterly analysts’ call that I now listen to, analysts sometimes ask phenomenally silly questions: “Can you give us a little more context on the earnings per share?”

What the heck kind of question is that? A six-year-old could do better.

Unless you’re asking the question solely to have asked the question.

Your name showed up on the transcript! You therefore must have attended the call! And paid attention! And the CEO selected you to ask a question! (Well, not really. You just put yourself in the queue with the operator. But you feel special, anyway.)

It must serve some purpose — either with your employer, or your clients, or your psyche — to have spoken. So you speak for the purpose of having spoken.

How about theater reviews? I saw one recently for “Beautiful: The Carole King Musical” (which actually was a pretty good show). The reviewer wrote that the musical made “the earth move under my feet.” Now, I admit, that’s a pretty clever way of describing the Carole King show. But maybe the reviewer had an ulterior motive: Maybe, if you write that the show made “the earth move under [your] feet,” your words are more likely to appear on a banner outside the theater — accompanied by the name of your newspaper! So you help the show attract a bigger audience, have your words appear on a banner, and publicize the name of your newspaper — thus providing real value to your editor. It’s irrelevant whether the show truly made “the earth move under [your] feet;” you had another reason for speaking.

You certainly see speaking-for-the-sake-of-having-spoken at corporate meetings of all types. If you have a meeting with the very important person, then many people think they should speak. What they say doesn’t really matter. Speaking helps with audience participation; the sound of multiple voices makes the meeting less tedious; the fact that you spoke proves that you were present and paying attention. It doesn’t matter if what you say is insightful or intelligent; you’re speaking for the sake of having spoken.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
I think I saw this less frequently at law firms.

I concede that I saw plenty of sucking up to the managing partner. At the annual office dinner, for example, everyone hung around until the managing partner took off. Once he left, the crowd thinned out pretty quickly.

But I don’t think I saw people waving their hands in the air at the partners’ meeting solely for the purpose of having spoken.

Maybe that’s a function of size: Although I worked at a large law firm, the law firm was not as extraordinarily large as my corporation. Maybe you feel more anonymous as an entity grows in size, so you feel more compelled to prove that you matter.

Or maybe it’s a question of politics. At a law firm, it’s likely that the “points committee” — or, by whatever name, the committee that sets salaries and runs the joint — will discuss you personally at least once per year. That conversation might be brief, but most firms commit to discussing individually what each partner’s draw should be. (Some, but not all, firms even have annual performance interviews with each partner.)

At a corporation, the situation’s different. Corporations can be too large to discuss every employee — or even every important employee — individually. Remuneration is thus left between you and your supervisor, and maybe you feel that you have to do something else — like speak at meetings — to stand out.

Or perhaps I’m mistaken. Maybe people speak for the purpose of having spoken at law firms as often as they do at corporations, and I’m just getting more sensitive with each passing year to people seemingly asking questions solely for the purpose of having asked them.

[Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/morning-docket/)
# Morning Docket: 03.26.18
## * As it turns out, Joe diGenova -- the lawyer who's convinced that the Justice Department is trying to frame Trump with its Russia investigation -- won't be joining the president's personal legal team after all due to conflicts of interest. DiGenova's wife, Victoria Toensing, has been conflicted out as well. Oopsie! [[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/us/politics/trump-digenova-toensing.html)] * President Trump tweeted this weekend that ""[m]any lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia case,"" and that his difficulty in finding lawyers to join his defense team is ""Fake News."" Meanwhile, at least four defense attorneys at separate Biglaw firms have been approached, and most have turned down the offer. [[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/25/politics/trump-tweet-lawyers/index.html)] * In her 60 Minutes interview, Stormy Daniels says she was once physically threatened to keep quiet about her affair with Donald Trump and was later pressured into signing a false statement denying the affair because she believed that Michael Cohen, Trump’s personal attorney, would “make [her] life hell.” Cohen has denied threatening Daniels. [[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-eve-of-60-minutes-interview-stormy-daniels-says-working-in-porn-helped-prepare-her-for-public-scrutiny/2018/03/24/b1555594-2ea6-11e8-8ad6-fbc50284fce8_story.html)] * In the summer of 2014, Bracewell & Giuliani warned Cambridge Analytica that foreign citizens shouldn't have ""substantive management"" roles running U.S. election campaigns, and yet, that's exactly what the company did in its work with the Trump campaign, and now Robert Mueller is on the case. [[Washington Examiner](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/rudy-giulianis-law-firm-warned-cambridge-analytica-against-having-foreign-nationals-manage-us-election-campaigns); [TIME](http://time.com/5211609/robert-mueller-donald-trump-cambridge-analytica-connection/)] * Some law firms in the U.K. have started including information on partners' salaries in their mandatory gender pay gap reporting. The first firms to do so were Norton Rose Fulbright, with a 27 percent pay gap for all employees (including partners), and Reed Smith, with an 8 percent pay gap among only partners. [[Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/626a3e44-2eb6-11e8-a34a-7e7563b0b0f4)] * Law student Jordan Crewe has already filed suit against the soon-to-be-closed Savannah Law School, accusing the school of committing fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract, and breach of fiduciary duty. She's requesting punitive damages from the school, and wants a jury trial too. [[WSAV](http://wsav.com/2018/03/23/lawsuit-filed-by-student-after-announcement-that-savannah-law-school-is-closing/)]

Welcome to the special bonus party, HoLove! It may have taken a few weeks, but the firm, which is currently rated [Good on the Leopard Law Firm Index](https://www.leopardsolutions.com/index.php/leopard-law-firm-index-list/), has stepped up and matched the prevailing market rate for special bonuses.

Hogan Lovells announced appreciation bonuses today for their U.S. associates. To be eligible for the bonuses, associates need to bill 1850 hours annualized, which includes up to 150 pro bono hours and up to 50 hours for diversity and inclusion initiatives. And if folks miss the threshold for the spring payment, they’ll have an opportunity to make it up by the fall.

According to tipsters at the firm, associates are pretty happy with the announcement, especially considering the billable requirement is smaller than the typical year-end threshold:

Associates are extremely pleased with the announcement, especially given that the threshold for the bonus was reduced from our typical 2000 hours requirement for year-end bonuses, and including pro bono and D&I activities reaffirmed for associates management’s commitment to these activities.

Assuming folks meet those requirements, special bonuses will be awarded on the following schedule:

## Maybe you dread making ""cold calls"" -- but it's far easier than you think to turn ""cold"" conversations into warm ones, according to columnist David Perla.

If you’re reading this, there’s a fair chance that you dislike the idea of business development. Most lawyers do. In the lawyer’s mind, business development means sales, and sales means cold-calling cheap leads for Rio Rancho Estates, with Alec Baldwin [chewing you out at the blackboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4PE2hSqVnk). In short, it’s not a pretty picture.

If that’s your mindset, I’m speaking to you in this column. And I’m here to tell you this: first of all, yes, it’s true. Anyone who wishes to be effective in selling their services—even highly sophisticated lawyers—must have the ability to “cold call” prospective buyers in some sense. But second and more importantly, it’s far easier than you may think to turn “cold” conversations into warm ones.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

Let me explain, by way of my own experience. Before I came to Bloomberg Law, I co-founded a legal outsourcing company called Pangea3. About a decade ago, vacationing with my family in Florida, I found myself at a holiday meal with the head of litigation at a global bank. He was the ideal prospect for our emerging company, and naturally I was eager for an opportunity to speak with him. I asked if I could call him at a later date. When I made that call and explained who I was, his first statement to me was plain and simple: “I’m never going to send my document review to India, but I’ll happily help you navigate our organization for other opportunities.”

He was not unkind about it, but from a sales perspective, his message was as cold as it gets. In other words – he’d be a coach, but never a buyer. Nearly two years later, just a few months after Lehman Brothers collapsed, he called me and said, “I know I told you that I’d never do doc review in India. Well, I’m under orders to cut our legal spend by 25 percent, and the only way to do that is to lower the cost of doc review. So never has arrived. Can you come meet with me and my team?”

I mention it here because with his help, the global bank that he worked for eventually became Pangea3’s largest client.

In that one anecdote—a cold conversation that turned into a warm and mutually beneficial relationship—lie many of the lessons about sales that I have learned in my career. Without exception, these lessons are relevant to lawyers, many of whom have great potential to develop business if they could get past their unfounded aversion to it. Many simply haven’t been instructed how to go about it from anyone other than Alec Baldwin. This is what I would tell them:

Turn cold into warm in less than a minute: For most lawyers, the trouble isn’t identifying who their best prospects are. You don’t need to steal the Glengarry leads when you can search for general counsel in your target industry on LinkedIn. The trouble is opening up conversations with the targets you’ve already identified. When I approached the client prospect in Florida, I had it relatively easy. I had met his wife earlier in the evening, and so I asked her to make the introduction. She did, making the conversation far warmer than it would have been if I had approached out of the blue. Mutual acquaintances—from those you’ve just met to anyone in your network—can be helpful in creating warm introductions, and in most cases are eager to assist.

Of course, many times there is no mutual acquaintance. It can seem an arduous task to approach without an introduction, but the only thing it takes to turn a cold call into a warm one is a single commonality. Recently, we wanted to speak with a large Midwestern firm, but our team was unable to connect with the right people. Searching the firm’s website, I noticed that a member of the Executive Committee had gone to Penn Law, which I attended. I used this single commonality in an introductory email, and ten minutes later the committee member wrote me back. We spoke by phone the next day, and he began opening doors for Bloomberg Law at the firm.

Be genuine: Law school connections aren’t the only ones that warm up conversations. Common sports interests. Vacation spots. Children’s activities. Foods and restaurants. Even religion. Any commonality can work, and the more personal the better (obviously using judgment as to what is appropriate in the context of a specific conversation). Only one thing is out of bounds: topics in which you don’t have a genuine interest. For that reason, I rarely bond with people professionally over my undergraduate experience, which I feel less connected to, as opposed to law school, which has been the foundation of many of my professional relationships.

Follow up: Following up as promised is important for the health of any relationship, and it’s no different in business development. After the litigation head told me that he would never use my services, I accepted his response but asked if I could follow up with him every six months. That was April 2007. By December 2008, the financial world had collapsed and my prospect faced a mandate to cut his expenses by 25 percent. Because I had been following up with him as advertised—neither calling too frequently nor fading away—he invited me in to pitch his business.

Look for opportunities to build relationships: Developing business is less about sales tactics than simply being interested in other people. When they sense that you are, you have the trust in place to grow your relationship. I once knew an executive who truly cared about his bank’s public service effort to maintain neighborhood schools. Every year, the bank would invite its law firm partners to join it for a service day. Many associates, but few partners, came to these events. But some of my most valuable time with that executive—from both a personal and business perspective—came when I spent two hours with him painting a school building, talking about our children and our family life.

I wasn’t thinking about making a sale. I was outside, contributing to the community, enjoying someone’s company, and talking about our favorite things in the world – our kids. It was almost enough to give business development a good name.

Eugene Scalia

Last week, Alex Acosta[ stepped down](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/alex-acosta-resigns-to-probably-go-make-millions-because-there-are-no-more-consequences/) from his role as Labor Secretary following a firestorm of controversy over the sweetheart deal he gave convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. While the deal was public knowledge when Acosta was confirmed to the cabinet position, following Epstein’s July 6th arrest on child sex trafficking charges, new details of were hashed out and Acosta [didn’t seem capable](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/alex-acosta-just-delivered-a-dumpster-fire-of-a-press-conference/) of making the case he should keep his job.

With Acosta out, many Republicans believed Patrick Pizzella, Acosta’s deputy, would get the nod, that is, if Donald Trump even got around to making a new nomination. But last night, the president announced over Twitter, natch, a Biglaw partner with a familiar last name would be his nomination for the new Labor Secretary.

I am pleased to announce that it is my intention to nominate Gene Scalia as the new Secretary of Labor. Gene has led a life of great success in the legal and labor field and is highly respected not only as a lawyer, but as a lawyer with great experience….

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) [July 19, 2019](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1152010854176452608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

….working with labor and everyone else. He will be a great member of an Administration that has done more in the first 2 ½ years than perhaps any Administration in history!

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) [July 19, 2019](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1152010855552180224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

That’s right, the late Justice Antonin Scalia’s son is getting the nomination.

And, as Politico, the outlet that first called the nomination,[ notes](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/18/trump-scalia-nomination-labor-chief-1422418), having the name “Scalia” bandied about over the course of the nomination is a political boon, one that serves to remind Trump’s base just who got to fill Justice Scalia’s seat on the Court:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
A Scalia nomination could become a base-pleaser for Trump, who as a presidential candidate built a relationship with right-leaning evangelical voters after promising to select a reliably conservative judge to replace the late justice on the court.

Trump grew close to the Scalia family during the confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch, who replaced the late conservative justice on the high court. Scalia’s wife, Maureen, attended a Rose Garden ceremony last July where Trump announced Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the court.

Scalia received his J.D. from the University of Chicago and is currently a [partner at Gibson Dunn](https://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyer/scalia-eugene/), but does have notable government experience on his résumé. He served as the Solicitor of the U.S. Department of Labor and as a Special Assistant to the Attorney General. Scalia has a pretty successful track record in challenging government regulations in court, including a Maryland rule that would have required Wal-Mart to pay more for employee healthcare and an Obama-era fiduciary rule for retirement account advisors.

[Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/morning-docket/)
# Morning Docket: 08.17.18
## * In response to President Trump's ""relentless assault"" against the press, more than 300 newspapers published editorials denouncing his attacks and defending the freedom of the press. In response, Trump said he wants ""true"" freedom of the press, but without the ""FAKE NEWS."" Come on, even the Supreme Court wants the press to remain free. [[National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/2018/08/16/supreme-court-isnt-on-trumps-side-as-he-bashes-media/)] * Gallery Books and Simon & Schuster, the publishers of Omarosa Manigault Newman’s White House memoir, are hitting back hard against President Trump's attempts to silence her and stop its publication. this letter from Davis Wright Tremaine partner [Elizabeth McNamara](https://www.dwt.com/people/elizabethamcnamara/) is freakin' fantastic.

A lawyer tried to get away with a little misogynistic insulting in open court. It did not end well for him. Meanwhile, a Biglaw partner laments low hours and associates skipping out on the office. This should be a warning to associates as the economy cools because whether or not this is fair, this is the sort of thinking that guides layoff decisions. And the bar exam is here and so are all the indignities. Like asking applicants to spend over $100 on lunch.

# How Much Do Partners Make At Williams & Connolly?
## Another Trump nominee lets us look in on firm finances.

It’s not like presidential administrations don’t always draw heavily from the ranks of Biglaw. You can’t fill a swamp without a healthy dose of attorneys. But the Trump administration’s gift to legal industry observers is the utter dysfunction of its transition. At the 200-day mark, he’d only nominated [277 of the more than 1200 jobs](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/07/politics/trump-200-days-nominations/index.html) requiring Senate confirmation that he’s got to fill.

A competent organization would have overwhelmed us with so many nominations in such a short span that digging into any specific financial disclosure form would be impossible. But with nominations coming at such a painfully slow clip, every nominee can get a full media vetting.

So far we’ve learned that [Christopher Wray](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/king-spalding-pays-christopher-wray-9-2-million-a-year/) made more money than the average King & Spalding partner and that [Jones Day’s Eric Dreiband](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/disclosure-forms-reveal-biglaw-partners-salary-despicable-clients/) was doubling up the firm average. Since we’re getting these windows into partnership shares, let’s keep going with a look at [Williams & Connolly](https://www.wc.com), a firm with financials of particular interest this week since it was going to [merge with Quinn Emanuel](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/major-biglaw-merger-news-quinn-emanuel-and-williams-connolly-are-in-talks/)… and [then wasn’t](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/anatomy-of-a-rumor-the-quinn-emanuel-williams-connolly-merger-talks/).

Mahoney](https://www.wc.com/Profiles/C-J-Mahoney), a former Kozinski and Kennedy clerk, is up for “deputy U.S. trade representative overseeing investment, services, labor, environment, Africa, China and the Western Hemisphere,” meaning he’ll be the point person for making sure China keeps making Donald J. Trump brand suits and Ivanka brand baubles at competitive prices.

Mahoney claims [on his form](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/how-much-do-partners-make-at-williams-connolly/2/) that he’s pulled down $833,238 this year. He doesn’t flag that as an “estimated” partnership share — as, for example, Wray did on his form — suggesting this isn’t his expected annual compensation, but his take so far this year. If so, that puts him right in the middle at Williams & Connolly, where profits per partner [hover around $1.6 million](http://www.americanlawyer.com/law-firm-profiles-result?firmname=Williams+%26+Connolly), a position befitting a relatively young partner.

Congratulations to C.J. Mahoney on his nomination. Hopefully there [will still be a China](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/09/politics/north-korea-donald-trump/index.html) by the time you’re confirmed.

# Biglaw Firms Take Their Legal Fee Battle To The Courthouse
## There's millions in fees on the line.

Two Biglaw firms are going head to head over contingency fees and it shows just how complicated it can be when partners change firms mid-representation.

As [reported](https://www.law.com/2019/03/18/manatt-sues-brown-rudnick-over-ex-partners-contingency-win/) by Law.com, the controversy stems from work Benjamin Chew did on behalf of Rudolph Geist and his limited liability corporation, RJGLaw. Chew began the representation, which was done on a contingency basis where Geist owed Manatt 30 percent of any recovery, while he was a partner at Manatt. When Chew lateraled to Brown Rudnick in April 2018, Geist was among the clients that made the move to the new firm. The case settled in November 2018 for $10 million, and Manatt was left out in the cold.

Now Manatt has sued Brown Rudnick and Geist/RJGLaw for the work they did on on behalf of Geist against
Hispanic Information and Telecommunications Network Inc. According to the complaint, Manatt did key work on the case, and “all the work that caused the settlement was performed by Manatt, prior to Manatt’s dismissal,” and therefore they’re entitled to their share of the settlement:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
“Mr. Geist, a lawyer, knows that legal services are not provided for free, and he was involved in the negotiations of the method of payment to Manatt at the outset of the HITN Litigation,” Peter Axelrad, Manatt’s counsel at Council, Baradel, Kosmerl & Nolan, wrote in the complaint.  “Manatt is entitled to the benefit conferred upon Mr. Geist and RJG.”

The complaint alleges breach of contract against Geist and tortious interference and unjust enrichment against Brown Rudnick.

Do you want to build a viral video? Let’s start with one Boston lawyer who has an Elsa costume at the ready. Throw in a nor’easter and a vehicle stuck in the snow. Voila! Internet gold.

Meet Boston lawyer [Jason Triplett](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/jason-triplett/). Triplett, a BC Law graduate and former associate at Proskauer Rose, [is currently](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-triplett-32b91242/) the manager of attorney recruiting, training, and development at Kirkland & Ellis in Boston. He’s the star of the viral video that shows him coming to rescue of a Boston police wagon that was stuck in the snow outside a local gastropub, The Gallows. I guess the cold never bothered him anyway.

The video — an absolute must-watch — was captured by fellow restaurant guest [Christopher Haynes](https://www.facebook.com/ChrisBHaynes?hc_ref=ARQwgw1Scjobo7xreRgvM6Y-2Z2xgcnHV_vV395Nqa6MtOx6JvSjukaX_Yd3gXMO1Nk). It’s been watched over two million times already:

As the Boston Globe [reports](http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/03/14/queen-elsa-came-boston-and-pushed-police-wagon-out-snow/v02YU4tNnYcMPnAc125kSM/story.html), the Boston PD was happy for the assist:

“The officers involved were especially grateful for the help and would like to thank the Elsa-impersonator for the assist,” said Boston police Officer James Kenneally, a spokesman for the department.

People Magazine [caught up](http://people.com/human-interest/man-dressed-elsa-frozen-saves-police-wagon-snowbank/) with Triplett, and he has big plans for his brush with fame:

Playing down his heroic feat, Triplett says his fame will be fleeting as snow on a hot day.

“Everyone will be over it by noon,” Triplett tells PEOPLE. “But if this is my 15 minutes, I would like to leverage it to meet Adam Rippon.”

For the first time in forever, a vehicle stuck in the snow will actually make you smile.

Am Law 200 firms will soon have access to an innovative new AI-powered recruiting tool called Haistack – Law Firm. [Michael Heise](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-heise-b55b4b6/) has led development of the product, in partnership with Lateral Link. Ahead of the official launch on September 18, Lateral Link sat down with Mike to talk about the path that led him to develop Haistack – Law Firm.

LL: Let’s start with a quick description of Haistack – Law Firm. Why should firms be interested?

MH: Haistack – Law Firm uses machine learning to identify the best candidates for a specific attorney role. We aggregate publicly available attorney, firm, and law firm job data from across the internet, and we enrich it with proprietary Lateral Link data. From this data, we illustrate connections between a candidate and a firm and estimate the strength of the fit. These connections also suggest the most effective avenues for reaching out to a candidate who has not yet applied. In addition, we show firms which members of their current attorney pool have profiles that are in high demand in the broader lateral market. This enables firms to take affirmative steps to retain the most scarce talent.

LL: You worked for years in software development before you entered the legal field. How did you first get into software? 

MH: I graduated from the University of Maryland in 1997 with a Business Information Systems degree. I was in the Marine Corps Reserves, so I had a connection to the government. I combined those interests by joining a government contractor out of college, writing software. Over the next 15 years, I worked for both government and private sector clients, everything from the State Department to the NASDAQ. That variety was great because I was able to take lessons from one sector and cross-pollinate them into the next. In 2009 I earned my MBA from Maryland with a focus in Entrepreneurship. And then in 2013 I took a full-time software development program manager role with the DC Police Department, where I spent nearly three years.

LL: What do you like best about working in software?

MH: I love making cumbersome processes more efficient. With software you can take a task that previously took days to complete and reduce that time to seconds. I also enjoy solving the puzzles that you confront when writing software. There’s no shortage of hard problems to tackle.

LL: What brought you into the world of law firms?

MH: I was thinking about getting back into the private sector, and in 2016 my wife was a law student, so that made me curious about law firms. I applied for a role at an Am Law 30 firm and spent nearly three years there as an Application Development Manager, followed by three years as a Senior Manager of Software Development at an Am Law 20 firm. Meanwhile, my wife now practices at an Am Law 50 firm, so in a way law has become a family business for us.

LL: What did your time at Am Law firms teach you about their software needs?

MH: First, security and data privacy are critical. Law firms have a reputation for being slow to adopt technology, but it makes sense after you’ve come to appreciate the liability risk of the information they hold. My other big takeaway came from working on system implementations that were 12- or 18-month projects costing millions of dollars. They involved intricate work to export data, massage it, and then import the data into the new system. Those projects reinforced for me the value of turnkey solutions that streamline the user experience. I decided that if I was going to develop software for law firm customers in the future, I would put a premium on making it as turnkey as possible.

LL: And that’s exactly what you’ve done with Haistack – Law Firm, right?

MH: Yes! Users can log in with LinkedIn, Google or Microsoft credentials tied to their firm email. You don’t even have to remember a password. Haistack will recognize which firm you belong to and will automatically display data customized to that firm.

LL: Why were you the perfect person to develop this product?

MH: Certainly I’ve had significant exposure to major law firms, learning not only about their software preferences and constraints but also gaining an understanding of the broader culture. My prior familiarity with the industry is only part of the story. I’ve learned a huge amount about the recruiting process through my collaboration with Lateral Link in developing Haistack – Law Firm. And I’ve had the distinct advantage of being able to draw on 15 years of Lateral Link data. For example, where we know that a firm has considered and rejected a candidate in the past, Haistack is not going to suggest that candidate to the same firm again. So the core strength isn’t just my background, it’s really the complementary assets that have come together to form the Haistack partnership.

In a rapidly evolving legal landscape, the alignment of technology with the intricacies of the legal sector remains pivotal. Michael Heise’s unique journey—from software development in various industries to the heart of law firms—has equipped him to pioneer solutions like Haistack – Law Firm. With its impending launch, Am Law 200 firms are on the cusp of an AI-driven revolution in recruitment. Drawing upon a rich blend of Heise’s software expertise, firsthand insights from top-tier law firms, and the robust data of Lateral Link, Haistack promises to redefine how firms identify, recruit, and retain the brightest legal talents. As law becomes increasingly tech-driven, innovators like Heise are ushering in a new era of efficiency, precision, and excellence.

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

Of the 50 Biglaw firms included in Above the Law’s [Law Firm Transparency Directory,](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firm-transparency/) powered by Leopard Solutions, which five firms are tied with the lowest promotion rate?

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Offers Optional Deferral To Incoming Associates
## And it seems like only some would-be associates will receive a stipend.

Layoffs continue to plague Biglaw, with some firms still attempting to slim down despite a [slight uptick in demand](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/law-firms-saw-rising-demand-q2-report-says-2023-08-07/) year-over-year. Some firms have even decided to defer the start dates of their incoming associate classes to lighten their load when it comes to attorney head count. Today, we have news on a firm that’s offering its incoming associates an optional deferral.

Back in May, Dechert — a firm that brought in $1,288,692,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 36 in the most recent Am Law 100 — announced a [global reduction in force](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/am-law-top-50-firm-begins-reduction-in-force-will-cut-5-of-global-workforce/). At the time, the firm let go about 5% of its total workforce, including attorneys and business professionals.

According to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/dechert-is-giving-summer-associates-option-to-delay-2024-start), Dechert has now announced an optional deferral program, offering some of its soon-to-be first-years the ability to push their start date from 2024 to 2025. If those who accept the deferral choose to work with a nonprofit entity through the firm, they’ll be awarded a $75,000 stipend. [Bloomberg](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/dechert-is-giving-summer-associates-option-to-delay-2024-start) has additional details:

The associates who accept a deferment would start at the firm in fall 2025, a Dechert spokesperson confirmed Friday. Those that choose to work for a pro bono or nonprofit organization through Dechert will receive a $75,000 stipend and benefits, the spokesperson said.

“While there is a spot for all should they chose to start in the fall of 2024, we created the opportunity for up to 20 Summer Associates to defer for a year and come back in the fall of 2025,” a firm spokesperson said in an email to Bloomberg Law. “They are welcome to explore, study, travel or experience another opportunity.”

Keep in mind that only those incoming associates who choose to work for a nonprofit through the firm will receive a stipend (of less than half of their projected first-year salaries) as well as benefits. Those who opt to take the deferral to pursue other opportunities won’t receive those perks. That being the case, will Dechert’s incoming first-years choose to take the money and run into the welcoming arms of a nonprofit, or join the firm on time in 2024? Only time will tell.

Best of luck to all affected incoming associates at Dechert — they have quite the decision to make.

Robert E. Lighthizer

Looks like Donald Trump can’t get enough of Biglaw partners. They populate his [DOJ transition team](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/the-biglaw-attorneys-on-trumps-doj-transition-team/), and they are his [White House counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/biglaw-partner-to-be-trump-administrations-white-house-counsel/) (Don McGahn) and [ambassador to Israel](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-israel-ambassador-david-friedman-232717) (David M. Friedman). Given the Donald’s [penchant for appointing rich people to his administration](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/30/donald-trump-is-assembling-the-richest-administration-in-modern-american-history/?utm_term=.30890c42fd4d), Biglaw is the place to find them.

Yesterday it was announced that a longtime Skadden partner, [Robert Lighthizer](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/robert-e-lighthizer), will be appointed as U.S. Trade Representative. Though he’s spent the better part of three decades in Biglaw, he does have experience as a deputy United States Trade Representative, as his firm bio notes:

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Mr. Lighthizer was a deputy United States trade representative (USTR) with the rank of ambassador during the Reagan administration. The USTR is the cabinet level agency that develops and coordinates trade policy on behalf of the United States government and negotiates on trade matters for the president. Ambassador Lighthizer had responsibility within the USTR for industry, agriculture, investment and trade policy matters.

During his tenure, Mr. Lighthizer was involved in all the important trade issues. He regularly attended and chaired subcabinet policy meetings and often attended cabinet meetings when the USTR was unavailable. In addition, Mr. Lighthizer negotiated some two dozen bilateral international agreements on subjects ranging from steel to grain. He frequently participated in General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (now the World Trade Organization) and Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development meetings.

Trump’s selection of Lighthizer is generally seen as an extension of the President-elect’s hardline trade stance. As the National Law Journal [notes](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/home/id=1202775943293), Lighthizer has a history of being outspoken on trade issues:

Lighthizer has supported what he dubs protectionist trade policy over the years. During the 2008 presidential election, he criticized Republican candidate John McCain, [writing in The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/06/opinion/06lighthizer.html) that McCain’s trade-friendly agenda amounted to a rebuke of conservative thinkers ranging from Alexander Hamilton to Reagan. Lighthizer also [criticized the](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/22/opinion/22lighthizer.html) U.S. trade deficit with China and China’s approach to currency inflation in 2010.

Lighthizer seems pretty jazzed for the role of protector of protectionism, saying in a statement, “I am fully committed to President-elect Trump’s mission to level the playing field for American workers and forge better trade policies which will benefit all Americans.”

Associates, did you click on this article hoping for some firm to beat the Cravath bonus scale? Well, temper your greed — and think about your colleagues on the staff side.

Ever since Biglaw bonus season started, we’ve received a slew of emails from law firm support staff wondering what their fate may be as the Benjamins continue to rain down upon associates. After all, it takes an army for law firms this large to run, and the behind-the-scenes battalions of paralegals, secretaries, administrative assistants, and all other support staff members deserve their due, too.

After an extremely successful year, one of the most prestigious firms in the country came to the conclusion that its support staff — a class defined broadly to include all personnel from human resources, business development, paralegals, secretaries, etc. — deserved a little bit more, and decided to issue special bonuses to them of one week’s pay, on top of any discretionary year-end bonuses they were already due to receive.

Please note that special bonuses for Weil’s staff members will be paid on December 23, 2016, while year-end bonuses for associates will be paid on [January 31, 2017](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/weil-matches-market-bonuses-but-when-will-they-get-paid/).

That’s our take on Weil Gotshal’s special bonuses for staff. If you’re a staff member at the firm, what do you think? Feel free to let us know how you feel [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Staff%20Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

What is your firm doing in terms of staff bonuses this holiday season? Is it paying out two-figure, three-figure, or four-figure bonuses? Please [let us know](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Staff%20Bonus).

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks for your help.

Don’t forget, if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please enter your email address in the box below. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Cheers to a happy bonus season, everyone!

The “mojo hand,” bearing cash.

It looks like star IP litigator [Matt Powers](http://tensegritylawgroup.com/profiles/powers.html) is giving his associates the [“mojo hand.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/04/benchslap-of-the-day-leading-ip-litigator-gets-taste-of-pimp-hand/) His IP litigation powerhouse, [Tensegrity Law Group](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/tensegrity-law-group-llp/), just announced that it’s adopting the familiar [$180K pay scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/). Like the Cravath version of the scale, it tops out at $315K for eighth-year associates.

Here’s what one source said:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Associates seem happy with the move, but it was also generally expected — the firm has always kept up with New York market base and has used end-of-year and special successful event bonuses as the tools for giving above-market recognition.

There was some discussion among associates (and likely among the partnership as well) about whether TLG would match the [above-market] [Desmarais](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/elite-ip-litigation-boutique-shatters-the-market-leaves-cravath-raises-in-the-dust/) or [Susman Godfrey](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/prestigious-litigation-boutique-announces-nationwide-salary-raises-to-190k/) scales [UPDATE (6/25/2016, 4:10 p.m.): Susman’s scale is consistent with, not above, the Cravath scale; see the [update](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/prestigious-litigation-boutique-announces-nationwide-salary-raises-to-190k/)], but the general view here is that would likely have only shifted $20k from end-of-year bonuses into base salary. Associates seem convinced that our total comp will remain competitive with (if not above) associates there.

That sounds like a safe bet. We’ve previously reported on Tensegrity’s [generous, above-market bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-small-firm-huge-bonuses/).

The firm doesn’t have a summer program, so there’s no issue of summers getting raises or not. And the hot topic of [counsel salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/whats-up-with-counsel-salaries/) also doesn’t apply to Tensegrity, which apparently [doesn’t have any counsel](http://tensegritylawgroup.com/ourteam.html).

The full memo appears [on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/a-leading-ip-litigation-boutique-matches-with-big-bonuses-still-to-come/2/). Congratulations to the Tensegrity team; the news isn’t surprising, but it’s nice to receive anyway.

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://www.laterallink.com) team of expert contributors. [Matt Ritter](http://www.laterallink.com/about/team/181) is Director of Legal Recruiting focusing on law firm and in-house placements in California and New York. He went to Penn Law (’05), worked at Mayer Brown and Kirkland as a corporate associate, then toured as a comedian, wrote and produced a few hit TV shows…and is now trying to help lawyers find their dream jobs! You could say he’s not your typical recruiter. He can be reached at [mritter@laterallink.com](mailto:mritter@laterallink.com) or [917-576-0049](tel:(917)%20576-0049).

It’s the end of the year, and you’re still at the firm you said you were going to leave. You’re not quite sure why you’re still there, but you know you have your reasons. Maybe it’s time for a little self reflection. We at Lateral Link believe there are plenty of good reasons to stay at a firm, but there are also a LOT of bad ones. Here’s a quick video from a legal recruiter and comedian, Matt Ritter, with 10 really bad reasons to stay at your firm. If any one of these is you, please call us or email us at Lateral Link so we can help you with your Stockholm Syndrome. Happy New Year!

# Associates NOT Happy With Seyfarth Shaw
## The firm that told associates it wanted to hold off on raises inspired a lot of discontent.

Almost two weeks ago, long after the new “Cravath Approved!” payscale of $180K for first-years established itself as the prevailing market reality, [Seyfarth Shaw sent its associates a memo](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/one-firm-decides-to-pump-the-brakes-on-this-whole-raise-thing/) to let them know the firm had no intention of matching the new scale in the near-term.

Laced with appeals to caution and the downright silly statement that “like you, we are wondering what this all means,” the memo instantly topped our chart for the most ludicrous response to The Summer of Cravath yet.

We’ve been holding onto most of the Seyfarth backlash we’ve received in the hopes that Seyfarth Shaw would reverse course and mend these strained relationships. But alas, that hasn’t happened, so here’s an inside look at these not-so-happy times for Seyfarth’s work force.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Seyfarth has totally demoralized its associates in a manner that was contemptuous, patronizing, and dishonest, not to mention entire unnecessary. Talk about a pointless, gaping, self-inflicted wound — why not just shut up and keep quiet while you “evaluate” rather than go on the record in truly tasteless fashion? If management wants to lie or obfuscate, they should at least try to do a good job of it.

Indeed, the only thing more ridiculous than McGuireWoods clumsily [trying to keep out of the public eye](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/these-partners-desperately-dont-want-us-to-know-they-arent-raising-salaries/) was Seyfarth Shaw’s decision to publicly own “we don’t care what raises the rest of you give.”

Today’s email to associates drips with presumptuousness — other firms have not thought the raises through properly but Seyfarth’s crackerjack team of genius management is committed to preserving sanity and reason in ways nobody else has the common sense to do?

This is an excellent point. Seyfarth’s memo, coupled with Seyfarth’s Chair Emeritus Stephen Poor [questioning the wisdom of any firm raising salaries](https://bol.bna.com/the-cravath-pay-raise-challenges-and-opportunities-for-law-firms-perspective/), charts out a pretty bold “we’re smarter than the top firms” stance. One might wonder why they aren’t Cravath if they’re so good at this…

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The memo opens by advising associates that management recognizes that certain NY law firms” have raised “first year” compensation. Actually, firms nationwide and globally have raised salaries for ALL class years. It then goes on to state “Like you, we are wondering what this means.”

Like us? No, you, Management Committee, are nothing like us. We know what it means. It means you will have to raise salaries and cut into your profits to some extent (a survivable extent). That’s what it means. It means the cost of doing business has increased and you want to drag your heels kicking and screaming or at least make the associates fear for their job security as a price for receiving any sort of compensation bump.

Yes, that’s pretty much what it means.

When firms have come up below the Cravath scale, I’ve been quick to point out that it’s all about maintaining expectations. Some folks choose smaller firms knowing that they will stay below Biglaw leader salary, but will enjoy a commensurate boost in quality of life — working overall fewer hours — or in career-building responsibility — getting the reins on matters faster than behemoth firms tend to hand them over. But firms have to stay on pace with those expectations. Seyfarth was below market already, but Cravath and its followers have exacerbated that gap. Seyfarth needs to match accordingly to maintain the relationship with associates.

The mood at Seyfarth is… they aren’t doing that.

If your firm matches — or you have some strong thoughts on how they haven’t — please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Biglaw Firm That Said Lawyers Should Be In Office 'By Default' Casually Takes It Back
## Who said employees should be at the office 'by default'? Certainly not this firm....

Now that more and more Biglaw firms have announced their office reopening plans, with policies that include more and more autonomy and remote work options for attorneys, it’s fair to say that firms that previously notified associates that the office would return to being their “default” ball and chain have a few regrets. At least this seems to be what’s happening at Paul Hastings.

Back in May, the firm [notified lawyers and staff](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/paul-hastings-reopening/) that as of September 7, they “should be working from the office.” The firm then went one step further, stating that “by default, we should work from the office when we are able.” Needless to say, this did not go over well, prompting much talk about immediate lateral moves.

Late last month, Paul Hastings sent out a second memo, in an attempt to clarify their return-to-office plans. The “by default” terminology was notably absent from the firm’s second memo, replaced by statements about the firm’s prior accomodations for remote work, and its intention to remain a flexible workplace in the post-pandemic world. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/07/14/paul-hastings-after-internal-pushback-clarifies-office-return-stance-in-second-memo/) has additional details:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
While the firm didn’t outright walk back from its earlier stance, the more recent memo stated that the firm “has been an innovator and market leader in flexible working arrangements for over a decade, and we plan to remain a leader.”

In the most telling portion of the memo, the firm stated that it was issuing another statement to “allay any potential concerns or misperceptions about our September 7 return to work plan” and that firm leaders “want to reinforce that remote work and increasing levels of flexibility in our work arrangements will remain hallmarks of how we operate.”

Paul Hastings is the first firm we’re aware of that has made an about face when it comes to their office reopening plans as far as remote work is concerned.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

Firms will increasingly be asking about harassment claims in their lateral partner forms. It’s a tricky thing, but it’s something you want to contain and deal with in a private way.

— Natasha Innocenti, recruiter and partner at Mlegal Group Inc., on how Biglaw firms are dealing with the risk of a sexual harassment scandal in their lateral hires. She also notes that how a firm handles these issues matter to lateral candidates as well, “I do have candidates ask me all the time—men and women—is this firm good for women? That is a difference maker.”

In an era of ever-increasing cybersecurity risks, we want to know how firms of all sizes are faring.

Are the biggest firms considered the best at data security? Are clients increasingly focused on these issues? What do lawyers see as the most essential tools to combat a breach?

Please take this (always) anonymous survey and help us benchmark how law firms and their clients may be changing their approach to data security. 

We’ll be giving away three $250 gift cards to randomly selected respondents as a thank you for sharing your expertise.

# Biglaw Firm Is Cooking Up Some Big Bonuses For Associates

It’s that time of the year when Biglaw bonus announcements are dropping like hot cakes. It seems like every firm is eager to show their associates some appreciation — and hopefully get them to stay put during a particularly active lateral market.

So, what’s baking over at Pillsbury Winthrop? Why, it’s a bonus announcement! Just like you wanted! With $723,452,000 in gross revenue in 2020 making it 62nd on the Am Law 100, the firm has the cash to spread around. And Pillsbury is doing just that, matching the market bonuses — in both the annual and special flavors that are making the rounds in Biglaw.

The scale, in case you’ve forgotten, is as follows:

# Reed Smith Announces 'Flexible' Reopening, With No Mandatory Office Days For Lawyers
## Lawyers will have to maintain a 'regular' presence, but nothing is set in stone. Wow!

Biglaw firms continue to make progress when it comes to plans for the reopening of their offices and a return to work for attorneys and staff members. Thus far, the majority of firms have aimed for soft openings during the first week of July, and a full return sometime after Labor Day. Yesterday, another firm announced a similar plan, with an interesting twist: lawyers will not be required to work a certain number of days in the office.

Reed Smith — a firm that posted a 5.1% revenue increase in 2020, bringing its total gross to about $1.31 billion — has not only announced a return-to-work plan for all of its U.S. offices, but has created a flexible work policy for lawyers and staff on a global basis. The firm will roll out a three-phase reopening that will have everyone ready for office life on September 7, subject to local COVID restrictions.

In May, all U.S. offices will be ready to host more people working there. In June, the firm will host “Welcome Back Wednesdays,” where all employees will be encouraged to sign up to work one office Wednesday. On those days, employees will receive boxed lunches courtesy of Reed Smith and small social gatherings will be set up for everyone to reconnect safely. On July 6, the firm will have a soft opening, where employees will be able to come into the office by reservation only, with full staffing available. On September 7, all U.S. offices will be fully reopened.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
During these phases, the summer associate program will begin remotely in May, with voluntary in-office activities scheduled in June and July. Lawyers will not have to work a set number of days in the office, even when the firm has fully reopened, but will be expected to maintain somewhat of a “routine physical presence” in the office (e.g., for client and team meetings, office events, training sessions, and practice group meetings). No mandatory office days for lawyers? This is big news, everyone. Much like the Ropes & Gray plan that ended the five-day, in-office workweek, this is something that’s revolutionary for Biglaw.

Staff will be assigned into three separate categories: office based (essential staff expected to resume a full-time office presence), hybrid (office presence will be required on a “routine basis”), and fully flexible (full-time remote work). This is yet another innovative policy from Reed Smith.

Here’s what Sandy Thomas, Reed Smith’s Global Managing Partner, thinks about the firm’s flexible reopening plans:

The move to flexible work represents a step forward in transforming our business based on the new understanding we have gained from our remote work experience during the pandemic. We have learned that we can serve our clients at the highest level in a work environment that includes flexibility, and that this arrangement offers significant benefits to our people as well.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Casey Ryan, Reed Smith’s Global Head of Legal Personnel, had this to say:

Our working environment and the ways we support clients have changed significantly from the pre-pandemic world. We have adopted this flexible work policy with this new reality in mind and to capitalize on the best parts of what we have learned from remote working.

Congratulations to Reed Smith on creating a fully flexible return-to-office policy. We wonder if more firms will adopt something similar.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

As soon as you find out about reopening plans at your firm, please email us (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

As the days and weeks since the tragic deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor march forward, it’s natural to start to wonder what, if anything, has changed. [Biglaw made a big promises](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/) in the wake of protests supporting Black Lives Matter, but [will that actually make a difference](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/when-biglaws-statements-on-racial-justice-ring-hollow/)?

Of course, what the most powerful law firms should do to support racial justice is a question with a lot of different answers. [Giving money is a big](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/how-biglaw-should-be-responding-to-the-black-lives-matter-protests/), and somewhat obvious, answer, as is doing some really [vital pro bono work](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/sidley-partner-on-why-pro-bono-is-so-important-in-the-wake-of-the-george-floyd-protests/). But more is needed. Like [rethinking what programs firms support](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-firm-cuts-ties-with-local-prosecutors-office-citing-racial-justice-concerns/), and even rethinking the traditional holiday calendar. Lots of firms got in on [declaring Juneteenth a holiday](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/skadden-declares-juneteeth-a-firmwide-holiday/), and now there’s another day earmarked for equal justice.

Fenwick recently announced a Voting Rights Initiative which includes declaring Election Day a paid public service holiday, designed to allow employees the time to vote and volunteer. In a statement about the new program, firm chair Richard Dickson said the move was linked to the firm’s commitment to equal justice:

“Our voting initiative ties directly to Fenwick’s Action for Change and our promise to work toward equal justice through civic engagement,” said Fenwick Chair Richard Dickson. “Voting is the most powerful lever in a democracy, and the most effective way to bring about change at the local, county, state and national levels. I hope that other law firms and more companies will join in making similar investments to promote the civic engagement needed for a properly functioning democracy.”

As with most Biglaw trends, we’ll be tracking exactly which firms are giving time off for employees to do their civic duty. If your firm is giving time off for Election Day or otherwise supporting voting rights, let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Election%20Day) or text us (646-820-8477).

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)
Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

— Bill Gates (@BillGates) [May 3, 2021](https://twitter.com/BillGates/status/1389316412259270657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

His wife, Melinda Gates — actually, make that Melinda French Gates (she just added her maiden name to her Twitter bio) — posted the [exact same statement](https://twitter.com/melindagates/status/1389316399428866049) at the exact same time. Given the size of the Gates fortune, estimated by Forbes at [$130.5 billion](https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#78b5dc533d78), inquiring minds want to know: do the Gateses have a prenuptial agreement, aka a prenup?

At first glance, it might appear that the answer is no. If you look at the [petition for divorce](https://dam.tmz.com/document/96/o/2021/05/03/9614c3c36f7c48d6aab9ec0c7e7f8932.pdf) that Melinda French Gates filed against Bill Gates on May 3 (via [TMZ](https://www.tmz.com/2021/05/03/bill-melinda-gates-divorce-27-years-marriage-foundation/)), you’ll see question 11 and the parties’ response to it:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Question 11 refers to “a prenuptial agreement” and a “separation contract” as two different things. And they appear to be governed by two different statutory provisions, [RCW 26.09.070](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=26.09.070) (separation agreements) and [RCW 26.16.120](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.16.120) (“agreements as to status,” a category that includes prenups).

But the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/03/business/bill-melinda-gates-divorce.html) reported that the Gateses “are believed to have a prenuptial agreement.” So this made me wonder: could there be more going on here?

After tweeting out some [preliminary thoughts on this](https://twitter.com/DavidLat/status/1389421872064962560), I heard from [Thomas Kretchmar](https://www.cmfb.com/staff/thomas-m-kretchmar/), a partner at Chemtob Moss Forman & Beyda, LLP in New York. Here’s what Tom, who specializes in matrimonial and family law, shared with me (standard caveats: he doesn’t practice in Washington state, none of this is legal advice, etc.):

Perhaps the situation is what it appears to be at face value: no prenup. But it seems to me that it’s equally plausible that what’s really going on is that there was a prenup, but the separation agreement expressly supersedes the terms of the prenup in its entirety, as an updated and more comprehensive settlement of the parties’ financial matters. Separation agreements commonly do that, or variations on that: they either supersede a prenup in its entirety, or they incorporate by reference an existing prenup either in whole or in part. It seems plausible to me that if the Gates separation agreement superseded the prenup in its entirety such that, in effect, the prenup no longer exists, then the attorneys who prepared the petition may have felt it unnecessary or even inappropriate to mention a prenup in that section of the petition.

If the document has been superseded out of existence, perhaps Washington state practice provides that you don’t make reference to it in that section. This is just a theory; I could be mistaken and perhaps there’s just no prenup at all. But for anyone who thinks that that doesn’t make sense, and that there must have been a prenup, then the theory above certainly reconciles some of the disconnect created by what the petition appears to indicate.

It may also be worth noting that a separation agreement is really, for all pertinent intents and purposes, a final settlement agreement. Matrimonial attorneys use the term “separation agreement,” but when you think of it as a final settlement agreement (which is really what it is), that helps understand why a separation agreement could and would supersede and/or incorporate a prior agreement such as a prenup or a postnup.

Thanks to Tom Kretchmar for these excellent insights. You can follow him on Twitter at [@tkretchmar](https://twitter.com/tkretchmar), and you can read additional analysis from him in this [interview with Town & Country magazine](https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/money-and-power/a36332725/bill-melinda-gates-divorce-prenup-separation-contract/).

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
So TMZ’s confident declaration that “there is NO PRENUP,” which numerous other media outlets have relied upon in reporting the same, might not be correct. As Bill Clinton famously quipped, “It depends upon what the meaning of the word ‘is’ is.” Maybe there “is” no prenup, but there was a prenup, and it just got superseded — fancy legal-speak for “supplanted” or “replaced” — by a separation agreement.

Would Bill and Melinda French Gates have wanted or needed a prenup when they got married back in 1994? According to [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/news/bill-gates-and-melinda-gates-divorce-everything-to-know-about-the-foundation-and-billions-at-stake/), citing [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/2006/06/16/cz_rr_ck_billgatesslide.html?sh=18c2c4133811), “By the time they were married in 1994, Gates was already the richest person in the US, with more than $9 billion in assets.” As Rafal Konopka similarly noted on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rafalkonopka/status/1389454884769079299), “At the time of his marriage, Bill Gates was already [one of the richest men in the United States]. He forced his wedding [vendors] [to sign NDAs](https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19950604&slug=2124492). This is not the kind of man who would risk losing control of his company to the whims of a local court.”

If we really want to know if the Gateses ever had a prenup, we’d need to ask one of the many lawyers involved in this divorce (although they’re probably not talking, having been well paid for their discretion). Melinda French Gates is represented by no less than three different law firms:

- [Sherri M. Anderson](https://www.smalaw.biz/) of Bellevue, Washington, an experienced matrimonial lawyer in Washington state;
- [Robert Stephan Cohen](https://www.cohenclairlans.com/robert-stephan-cohen) of Cohen Clair Lans in New York — one of the nation’s preeminent divorce lawyers, with many [celebrity clients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Stephan_Cohen) — and his partner, [Shannon Rogers Simpson](https://www.cohenclairlans.com/lawyers-2/#simpson); and
- [Bruce Birenboim](https://www.paulweiss.com/professionals/partners-and-counsel/bruce-birenboim) and [Loretta A. Ippolito](https://www.paulweiss.com/professionals/partners-and-counsel/loretta-a-ippolito), a litigation partner and a trusts and estates (“Personal Representation”) partner, respectively, at Paul, Weiss.
Meanwhile, Bill Gates is represented by a trio of firms as well:

- [Ted D. Billbe](https://www.tedbillbelaw.com/), like Sherri Anderson, a seasoned divorce lawyer based in Bellevue, Washington;
- [Wendy Goffe](https://www.stoel.com/people/wendy-s-goffe), a trusts and estates partner in the Seattle office of Stoel Rives; and
- [Ronald Olson](https://www.mto.com/lawyers/Ronald-L-Olson), [Robert Denham](https://www.mto.com/lawyers/Robert-E-Denham), and [Eric Tuttle](https://www.mto.com/lawyers/Eric-P-Tuttle), partners at the high-powered, super-elite law firm of Munger, Tolles & Olson.
This might seem like an awful lot of legal firepower for what appears to be an amicable divorce. But $130.5 billion is an awful lot of money.

If there is/was a prenup, then I’m guessing that Melinda French Gates will not end up with the [$36 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/us/mackenzie-bezos-charity.html) that Mackenzie Bezos received upon divorcing Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos (although I wouldn’t worry too much about French Gates; she has already received [$2.4 billion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/melinda-gates-was-meeting-with-divorce-lawyers-since-2019-to-end-marriage-with-bill-gates-11620579924) in publicly traded securities since the divorce). And I’m guessing that she’ll be okay with that.

If Bill and Melinda Gates wanted to maximize their fortunes, they wouldn’t have already given away so much of their money to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has an endowment of $50 billion. And they wouldn’t have created and signed the [Giving Pledge](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/11/giving/11PLEDGE.html), promising to give away at least half of their fortune.

Regardless of who’s getting what, and even if it’s for the best, it’s always sad to see a longstanding marriage dissolve. The Gateses were married for 27 years and have three children together, ages 18 to 25. May Bill and Melinda Gates find happiness in their separate lives going forward, and thanks to them for the great charitable work that they have done and continue to do.

# To Practice Law Well, There's No Substitute For Hard Work
## Working hard also means working smart.

During the first week of law school you are indoctrinated with the concept that you can only understand the law if you read and understand the written decisions of judges. This is because, under the common law, the principle of stare decisis is the bedrock of all knowledge. In law school this means many hours reading cases and preparing digests of specific rulings — known as holdings — and the reasoning behind them, as well as how to differentiate dicta, which is that part of the decision that is not relevant to the holding. One of the teachings in law school is that there is no substitute for hard work and the members of the Law Review, which is the most prestigious student group with the highest grades, consisted generally of those students who studied the most.

When I started my own firm, I initially focused on new issues and representing companies raising money. But the stock market went into a rapid and long decline. Some of my clients turned to me and asked me to defend them in regulatory enforcement actions and to handle litigation. As a one-person firm competing against large Wall Street law firms, I realized that hard work was critical to the survival and success of my nascent practice. Fortunately, Westlaw was a new legal research product which enabled us to compete. We were now able to do a much more comprehensive search. We also found that in reading the cases we developed new threads and ideas for further research.

But research is only the beginning of your hard work. In litigation, you need to spend the time and energy to develop an initial strategy. Two of the tools we use at [my current firm](https://balestrierefariello.com/) are 1) develop a case plan at the outset, which is continuously revised and expanded during the lifetime of the matter, and 2) a weekly plan for what needs to be done the following week by the responsible partner, the associates, and the analysts.

Another tool I use is what I call my instant memo file. When I have an idea, I dictate it out, as well as what needs to be done to develop that idea, and I immediately put it into the file for that matter. The case team also meets periodically to discuss long-range strategy and further ideas that need to be pursued to figure out how to win the case or successfully defend our client in a government regulatory matter. Preparing for this type of meeting can involve substantial work because you need to organize your thoughts and ideas based on the legal and factual research that has been have done.

Reviewing and analyzing documents to be produced by your client for privileged materials and reviewing those produced by opposing counsel and other parties for “hot documents,” can be extremely time-consuming, but it is critically important.

Working hard also means working smart. Artificial intelligence has become an important research tool in cases where a substantial amount of documents is produced. It enables us to more effectively and efficiently conduct documentary review and to set up a program to enable us to easily locate key documents. Although this involves a significant expenditure of money, if the client is able to pay the costs of the third-party vendor, in the long run you get a much more comprehensive and reliable document search at a lower overall cost. An integral part of AI legal research is not only to initially develop a plan, but then to use samples to modify the research plan and search terms to make the review more effective.

Hard work, organization, and planning are critical in producing documents to be filed with the court or administrative agency. I always find preparing an outline and drafting the papers to be an ongoing and cumulative process. You cannot simply draft perfect papers in one shot. After you do a rough outline, in almost all cases there is more research to be done and the need to review the documents you have available to you. Once you have prepared a draft, you need to send it out to your client, expert witness, and possibly others for their review and comments. Once these comments are received and analyzed, you need to revise your drafts. Each time a draft comes back I try to take a fresh look and often make substantial revisions. It is hard work but it must be done to end up with the best product possible.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
At my firm we have a unique procedure for filings. The attorneys have to be done with their writing and revisions 24 to 48 working hours before the papers need to be filed to enable the analysts to complete the filing process, which is time consuming and detail focused. This includes, among other things, a line edit of the text to make sure that everything is clear, properly spelled, and grammatically checked. It also involves a fact check, including checking that the exhibits or referenced documents are accurately described in the text. It also involves checking that the legal citations comply with the Blue Book and applicable state style guide.

The end product of a well thought out, well-argued, and winning product is the result of hard work by a number of people at your law firm.

# The Top 10 Most Family-Friendly Law Firms (2017)
## Your law firm owes it to you to let you be a parent. Which firm does it best?

Today’s Biglaw firm is different than that of yesteryear. Law firms are now more progressive, and to that end, parenthood no longer seems to be an inconvenience for attorneys. Despite the many gender discrimination suits that have been filed in recent months, gender equity indicators at large law firms seem to be on the rise. Some firms may give lip service to work/life balance, but other firms truly deliver on their family-friendly policies. Right now, in 2017, it is possible to be an attorney with a family when working at a large law firm thanks to generous parental leave plans and part-time and flex-time working arrangements.

But which firms are the best when it comes to these policies?

Today, the Yale Law Women released its annual list of the Top 10 Family-Friendly Firms. We cover this list every year (see our posts from [2016](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/the-top-10-most-family-friendly-law-firms-2016/), [2015](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/04/the-top-10-most-family-friendly-law-firms-2015/), [2014](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/04/the-top-ten-family-friendly-law-firms-2014/),[2013](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/04/the-top-ten-family-friendly-law-firms-2013/), [2012](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/04/the-2012-top-ten-family-friendly-firms-according-to-yale-law/), [2011](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/04/top-ten-family-friendly-firms-according-to-yale-law-women/), [2010](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/05/family-friendly-law-firms/), [2009](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/08/yale-law-women-anoint-top-ten-family-friendly-firms/), and [2008](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/09/non-sequiturs-09-08-08/)). How has this list changed year over year? Which firms made the cut in 2017? Which firms had the best options available to both women and men? Let’s take a look at the latest rankings.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Here’s the list of the most family-friendly firms according to Yale Law Women:

- Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer
- Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton
- Jenner & Block
- King & Spalding
- Morrison & Foerster
- Munger, Tolles & Olson
- O’Melveny & Myers
- Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe
- Proskauer Rose
- Simpson Thacher & Bartlett
In 2017, the following firms were dropped from the list after having made an appearance last year: Foley Hoag; Foley & Lardner; Goodwin Procter; K&L Gates; Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky & Popeo; Vinson & Elkins; and WilmerHale. That’s more than half of last year’s honorees, for those of you who are keeping count. Why was there such a shake-up? Cecilia Cheng, chair of the YLW 2017 Family Friendly Firms Initiative, told us what happened:

The main difference between this year’s report and last year’s report is that we returned to surveying firms directly instead of pulling NALP data, mostly due to timing of when NALP data is updated. That said, the Top Ten list generally shifts every year, because many of our survey questions ask about what firms have done in the previous year to promote family friendliness. For example, we ask the firms how many attorneys worked part-time in 2016, how many took caregiver leave, how many women were promoted to leadership, etc. Accordingly, the list is highly dependent on what is happening with firm culture within that slice of time. We feel that our mix of questions allows us to capture both firms that are consistently leaders in family friendliness, as well as any firms that have been making major strides in the past year.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The three returning firms are Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer (Arnold & Porter is an institution on this list, and has been recognized every year since YLW first issued its rankings in 2006; it’s nice to see that the firm remains even after its merger with Kaye Scholer), MoFo (honored for the fourth year in a row), and O’Melveny (honored for the second year in a row). These three firms are joined by Cleary Gottlieb (this is the firm’s first appearance on the list since 2009), Jenner & Block (this is the firm’s first appearance on the list since 2009), King & Spalding (this is the firm’s first ever appearance on the list), Munger Tolles (the firm returns to the list after dropping off in 2016 and previously being honored in 2014 and 2015), Proskauer Rose (this is the firm’s first appearance on the list since 2007), Orrick (the firm returns to the list after dropping off in 2016, and previously being honored from 2012 to 2015) and Simpson Thacher (this is the firm’s first appearance on the list since 2006).

Here’s a round-up of useful information about some of the YLW study’s findings:

• Part-Time & Flex-Time Policies – Of participating firms, 5% of associates worked on part-time schedules. Alumni ranked availability and use of part-time policies as the most important category in assessing family friendliness.

• Family Leave – The industry norm offers 18 weeks for primary caregiver leave, and most law firms now offer gender-neutral leave policies. Alumni reported that a firm’s written policy does not necessarily reveal its cultural norms around taking leave, noting the importance of encouraging men to take leave as well.

• Gender Equity – Among participating firms, 45% of associates were women and 23% of partners were women. Alumni indicated that the presence of women in leadership roles creates a powerful signal to young women associates that women at the firm have a path to partnership.

The YLW also awarded Category Honors in those three categories:

The Yale Law Women have been conducting this study for 12 years, and while vast improvements have been made in terms of parental accommodations offerings, there is still a lot of work to be done. We said this in the past, but it bears repeating in a world where Biglaw parents are having a tough time being parents to their children: “The legal profession has come a long way in terms of attempting to afford equal opportunities for success for both men and women, but it’s still got a long way to go. Why are lawyers still hurrying up and waiting for change? We shouldn’t be applauding a system that, in most cases, penalizes parents.” For all of the hours that you put in, your law firm owes it to you to let you be a parent. We thank those firms that have done right by their associates.

Congratulations to all of the Biglaw firms that made the latest edition of the Yale Law Women Family-Friendly Firm rankings. How did your firm do this time around?

If your firm is still in business, you’ve successfully made the shift to operating online. So have the courts where you practice, as eFiling undergoes a massive expansion throughout the U.S.

With more client and court data now housed in digital systems, it’s no longer necessary for a person to fill out forms one-by-one.
So how can courts and law firms improve upon redundant, obsolete processes?

Join us on October 6th at 1 p.m. ET/ 10 a.m. PT for this live webinar, where we’ll provide actionable takeaways on how your firm can be an early adopter in the integration revolution, creating automatic workflows that can vastly improve your filing efficiency in state courts.

The panel will be hosted by the legal tech expert and journalist Bob Ambrogi.

You’ll learn:

- What the future of court filing looks like in a digital-first legal industry.
- How integration ecosystems that revolutionized the B2B software market
are making their way into litigation management.
- How pre-built integrations can eliminate mundane and time-consuming
litigation tasks with no setup required.

# What Biglaw M&A Practice Is Already Killing It In 2018?
## The rest of the market seems to be doing well too.

Winter has overstayed its welcome this year, so you may not have clocked it, but we are already well into April. With a full fourth of 2018 already in the can, it’s time to see just how well firms did in Q1.[ Bloomberg’s law firm league table for global mergers & acquisitions deal volume](https://biglawbusiness.com/skadden-tops-ma-rankings-for-q1-2018/) tracks just which firms are getting the lion’s share of the work, and the firm at the very top of the list is extending the[ lead it picked up in 2017](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/the-biglaw-firms-with-the-biggest-ma-market-share/).

Skadden Arps has had the biggest 2018 so far, with 46 deals representing $169 billion in deal volume. Next comes Paul Weiss with 37 deals representing $117 billion, followed by Wachtell with 14 deals representing $97 billion. We should note, these numbers only include the work done for the corporations buying a target or selling to a buyer — no credit is given for a firm that just advised a bank or investment firm in those transactions.

Stephen Arcano, head of Skadden’s M&A group, had predicted a strong start to 2018 for the firm way back in January. In a statement to Bloomberg, he seemed excited his forecasting panned out:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
“The M&A market has been robust so far this year, though there is risk that deal activity could be negatively impacted going forward by rising interest rates or disruption in the capital markets, as well as evolving regulatory and trade policies,” he said via email.

Yes, this passes as excited in the M&A world.

The rest of the market seems to be doing well too. Overall global M&A deal volume is up over the number for Q1 2017 by ~25 percent, for a grand total of $936.8 billion.

# Real Property: How Today's Lawyers Are Working Remote
## Go behind the videoconference with Dean Mead's Kristilee Chihos, a real estate attorney based in Orlando.

Ed. note: This is the second in a series. Read the [first installment here](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/real-property-how-the-legal-industry-is-working-remote/). 

Since the spring of 2020, lawyers have steadily built up the resources and routines that allow them to thrive at work while working from home.

Now, many expect remote work to continue as part of whatever industry standard may emerge.

Our series includes the distractions, hobbies, and other activities that make up the remote workplace, to benchmark your own setup while gathering a few tips from your peers.

In this edition, we visit the home offices of Dean Mead real estate lawyer Kristilee Chihos, based in Orlando. Want to share how you’ve adapted? [Click here to participate](https://breakingmedia.wufoo.com/forms/xiuybj21a48c2w/).

Describe your office decor in one sentence.

I would call my office style “Professional Fantasy” because it contains a healthy balance of books, Harry Potter collectibles, Star Wars memorabilia, academic awards, [Avatar: The Last Airbender Funko Pops](https://amzn.to/2V8Ihgg), and an [RBG action figure](https://amzn.to/3kIkle6).

What office equipment do you use to complete your day-to-day work?

Two large Apple Thunderbolt displays (which were nearly free as part of a moving sale), [a MacBook Pro](https://rstyle.me/+z3mlnWq1MPVfIU5RgWiCcA), an [Apple Magic Keyboard](https://rstyle.me/+1YPXXcxc4B5V2mBi29sYPg) and [Mouse](https://rstyle.me/+QpSbjcqBOoDPMzIyIUpmIA), a wireless headphone set that I always forget to charge, [a warmer for my cup of tea](https://amzn.to/3kLCY10), and a 3-in-1 printer/scanner/copier.

What key pieces of office furniture do you use?

A very uncomfortable chair from IKEA and a custom wooden desk built by my husband as his first woodworking project. My office furniture occasionally includes my kitchen table if I need to spread out a bit more.



What work adjacent equipment helps?

I really enjoy doing a light workout during lunchtime and breaks. About two years ago I started taking an aerial arts class (like Cirque du Soleil for beginners) and I recently set up an aerial silks and lyra rig in my backyard. I use it to do a few pull-ups when I take my dogs outside. Those small doses of physical activity help keep me energized and focused for the remainder of the workday.

Any videoconference fashion must-haves?

I’ve actually never participated in a work-related videoconference from my home. I’m a transactional real estate attorney, therefore I don’t have video court appearances or depositions. Most of my client meetings and office meetings are done the old-fashioned way via phone calls.

What are your biggest meeting-bomb risks?

My husband and I share a home office. He’s a manager of digital analytics for a hospitality company, so he’s either giving presentations on data and statistics or typing code on his mechanical keyboard.

When we know we have an upcoming meeting at the same time, he’ll graciously move to the kitchen or outside. However, most of my client calls are spontaneous, so I’m typically looking up contract terms on my computer while he’s 3 feet away giving a presentation about vacation destinations.

We’re actually pretty great coworkers, but I think we’ll eventually need separate office spaces if we continue working from home long-term. I also have two dogs who mostly sleep all day except for their strategically planned barking fits when I’m on the phone with a client or my managing partner.

What is your go-to publication or website for taking a breather?

I keep up with news by reading [theSkimm](https://www.theskimm.com/), [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/), and my local newspaper, the [Orlando Sentinel](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/).

What are your favorite physical books in your background (or nearby)?

I have two bookshelves in my home office. One is for fiction and the other is for non-fiction. The non-fiction books look nice in the background, but my much-abused [Harry Potter books](https://amzn.to/2W0CHwC) will always be my favorite books for sentimental reasons.

# Addiction, Ethics, And Bravery
## Kudos to those who are confronting various mental health issues. It’s not easy being in the spotlight and discussing such personal matters.

Well, yahoo (and I don’t mean THAT Yahoo). Finally, there’s conversation about the “addiction,” that the federal bench seems to have for Yale and Harvard graduates. These peeps are not the only fish in the sea for judicial appointments, and it’s well past time to look beyond these two elite law schools for federal judicial candidates who can do the jobs just as well if not better than those from the two schools. In many cases, regional and local candidates are way closer to the communities that they hail from and are better able to understand them. How about some [academic diversity on the federal bench](https://www.courthousenews.com/move-over-ivies-judges-want-academic-diversity-on-federal-bench/)? Sounds like a plan to me.

Diversity, equity, and inclusion require that judicial appointments are more than just rubber stamps from those elite schools that seem to have the lock on appointments to the federal bench. Not everyone has the academic credentials, the recommendations, the scholarships, or the deep pockets to go to these schools. And I wonder how many graduates of those schools, along with other elite schools, who go on to Biglaw careers, find themselves miserable and ditch those careers for something else. I can think of more than just a few, but I’m not saying.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Not everyone can afford to go to an elite law school. Not everyone can juggle the three years with a job to pay the bills. Not everyone can balance the needs of law school studying with family responsibilities. But those who attend nonelite law schools are just as qualified as those who have that pedigree from Harvard or Yale. I’ve always thought that pedigree is for dogs. Isn’t there a dog food by that name?

Bravo to United States District Judge Michael McShane of the District of Oregon who testified before the House Judiciary Committee and used the term “addicted” to refer to the preference toward Harvard and Yale lawyers for bench appointments. So, how to withdraw from that “addiction?” Begin at the beginning: “making law school admissions less homogeneous, helping students from regional law schools get clerkships and making the [judicial] nomination process accessible to nontraditional candidates.” However, we all know how hard it is to overcome addiction. Withdrawal takes time, but it’s vital if the federal bench is to look at all like the population it is supposed to serve. Speaking publicly about the addiction is a good place to start. Now, where to go for rehab?

Just more evidence that an attorney responds on social media to an unhappy client at his peril. The scenario is all too familiar: unhappy client complains online about his attorney. Attorney responds (let the pissing contest begin) and reveals details about the client, including information in public records. The Oregon Supreme Court said that it’s not just privileged information that an attorney cannot disclose, but also information that would be embarrassing and detrimental to the client, even though such information is public record. No matter that such complaint may be embarrassing and detrimental to the lawyer. Rather than impose a suspension, the Oregon Supreme Court [publicly reprimanded](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/lawyer-gets-reprimand-for-responding-to-negative-online-review-with-embarrassing-client-information?utm_source=maestro&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=weekly_email) him.

To me, engaging in a war of words online is a waste of time. I don’t think a lawyer ever wins. Trying to defend himself or herself on social media runs up against the [Streisand effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect), which just further imprints the issue and makes it last longer. It’s like that mosquito bite. Leave it alone and it will go away, but if you scratch it, the itch lasts longer and so does the bite. It’s mosquito season, need I say more?

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
There is always something going on in Tinsel Town litigation. Most recently, the Second District Court of Appeal (note, the name of the court is not pluralized) here in Los Angeles disqualified a private retired judge from continuing to preside over custody issues between Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt involving their six children. Essentially the appellate court [benchslapped the private judge](https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/25/entertainment/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-custody-dispute-judge-disqualified/index.html) for not disqualifying himself due to a conflict of interest for work done on other matters involving Pitt’s lawyers. (Full disclosure: he and I are both on the same panel of neutrals here in Los Angeles, although I don’t think we have ever met.)

The appellate court chastised the retired judge for not disclosing the fact of his work on other cases involving Pitt’s counsel. I don’t know anything about the circumstances except what’s in the opinion. It’s worth reading to remind all of us, whether sitting judges, retired judges, attorneys, or neutrals, that it’s always better to overdisclose than not. You don’t get into trouble by doing that. The court said that the duty to disclose is [an affirmative one](https://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/documents/B308958.PDF), to be volunteered without prompting and not disclosed only in response to a question. The test, said the Court of Appeal, is the assessment of “how a reasonable person would view … [the private judge’s] ability to be impartial.”

Disclosure was the temporary judge’s responsibility, and that duty cannot be offloaded onto the provider or its staff, which is what he tried to do. Just as a lawyer cannot blame support staff for his error, the court said that the temporary judge must accept the responsibility for the ethical lapse.

And finally, kudos to Simone Biles, Naomi Osaka, and all the others who are confronting various mental health issues. It’s not easy being in the spotlight and discussing such personal matters. The more discussion, the less stigma. If Olympic athletes are courageous enough to step up, then why can’t lawyers? The profession would do well to model their bravery.

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Ups Their Billable Hours Requirement, Sparking Ire Among Associates
## 'Every associate is livid.'

Biglaw firms are anticipating an economic slump. We know that because of the layoffs at [Shearman](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/shearman-sterling-associate-layoffs/) and [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/cooley-layoffs-2022/) and [Goodwin](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/am-law-20-firm-begins-layoffs/) and [Gunderson](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/biglaw-firm-makes-2-rounds-stealth-layoffs-billable-work-disappears-gunderson/) and [Kirkland](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/stealth-layoffs-arrive-at-worlds-richest-biglaw-firm/). And, short of that step, firms are[ tightening of the purse strings](https://legaltalknetwork.com/podcasts/thinking-like-a-lawyer/2023/01/biglaw-closes-out-the-year-with-some-shenanigans/), making it more difficult for associates to earn their full market bonus.

Now comes word that another Biglaw firm is changing course on associate bonuses. Perkins Coie, a firm that made $1,155,565,000 in gross revenue in 2021, making it 42nd on the Am Law 100, told associates the billable hours requirement to get their full bonus is going up. It’s being bumped up from 1950 hours to 2000, but the kicker is it’s for the current year. At Perkins, the financial year begins in October. So associates were nearly 5 months into the year when new criteria got dumped on them.

A tipster shared the following image from the firm’s announcement:



So you can see the firm is asking for an additional 50 client billable hours per associate. If the associate is unable to hit that target (seeing as they found out about it ~5 months into the year), then they’ll only get half of their bonus.

As you might imagine, tipsters from inside the firm are reporting anger at the situation, with one saying, “Every associate is livid.” Another described the firm’s messaging of the change as putting the blame on associates who want market compensation:

The entire conversation was very uncomfortable. Firm leadership blamed associates for the change. They said that this was because they raised our salaries. They were asked if they would raise our billables again and the firm would not give a straight answer. They claimed they were doing this to match our competitors.

Another insider said folks at the firm see this as a prelude to even more severe cost-saving measures:

At PC, junior associates have their annual reviews in the spring. Many associates believe that placing the blame on us (blaming the us for the salary increasing without mentioning inflation, saying that the extra hours are “barely” more than an extra hour per week, essentially saying there’s no reason associates shouldn’t hit their hours because there’s “so many resources” to hit the hours without recognizes that some groups are slow, saying they will be pulling our hours every month and having conversations with people who aren’t hitting monthly targets) is just preparing to put the blame on us when they do layoffs this spring after reviews.

And associates are saying this change will permanently alter the firm’s culture: “Associates were very upset that our laid back culture is changing.”

# Attrition, Anti-Pedigree, Advice, And Appetite
## A toxic corporate culture needs no description. It’s like obscenity: you know it when you see it.

There’s been much talk about burnout during the Great Resignation. Peeps are walking out, thinking that there’s more to life than billable hours, unceasing demands, and just a lack of empathy/compassion, however you choose to describe it. While working remotely has had its upsides for many peeps, downsides have emerged. They include the lack of in-person communication aka the “Schmooze” or “Kibitz” factor, the inability to walk down the hall and ask questions about an assignment, the inability of supervisors to understand just how much work has been given to associates with little or no guidance. But the young associates are reluctant to ask for help, worrying that they will look stupid or uneducated or lazy or whatever. Burnout is real and we need to pay attention to it.

MIT has analyzed the [top 5 predictors](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/toxic-culture-is-driving-the-great-resignation/) for attrition these days and found that a toxic corporate culture is more than 10 times likely to lead to attrition. No surprise there. A toxic corporate culture needs no description. It’s like obscenity: you know it when you see it. That toxic culture may be apparent or insidious, but it’s there, regardless.

Other predictors of attrition that the MIT survey found were job insecurity and reorganization (I can speak to that), high levels of innovation, management’s failure to recognize and acknowledge employee performance, and last, but not least, a poor response to COVID-19.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Compensation issues? Way, way, down the list of reasons for turnover. Why are high levels of innovation the third-biggest reason? The report said that keeping up with innovation means longer work hours, a faster pace, and more stress. Although the work may be fascinating, it takes its toll in a number of ways, including work-life balance.

As you know, I equate the term “pedigree” with a dog food brand. So, it was refreshing to read that you don’t have to be a star, i.e., pedigreed, AKC variety lawyer, to do interesting work and get paid concomitantly. We need more of that mindset and less of the “well, if you aren’t from a top-tiered school or have experience in Biglaw, we don’t want you.”

The profession is rightly being called out for snobbery in the talent wars. What a surprise! There can be all kinds of reasons why peeps don’t attend pedigreed law schools. How about finances, for one? How about [not putting yourself in hock for the rest of your life](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/is-snobbery-causing-a-talent-shortage-in-biglaw/?utm_medium=email&_hsmi=206906142&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_Csik_IKoAK3X6t0jacVB60PmxOcHbeOGq4XxAzp3XV2TcdV41-_W_eFw43gNaGuDfGW7EzLuPJ-4EIx1U2-ymcYSI3A&utm_content=206906142&utm_source=hs_email)? One lawyer couple I know has more than $500K in debt from both undergraduate and law schools. That amount, even in SoCal, can be a hefty down payment on a house if not the entire purchase price, depending upon location.

How about family responsibilities as a reason for a “nonpedigreed” law school degree? And other reasons which rightfully preclude the spending of outrageous sums to get a legal education that’s just as good and makes for just as good a lawyer? Who may make a better lawyer? Someone who graduated from the bottom half of a pedigreed law school, or someone who was ranked No. 1 elsewhere? What about those who want to practice in their communities and want to attend a law school where they can start building relationships so necessary to a successful practice? And please don’t tell me that LSAT scores will have anything to do with being a smart, successful lawyer.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
In an interview with the California Lawyers Association’s digital magazine, an attorney who was admitted to the California Bar in 1952 (not a typo) is [still at it](https://publication.calawyers.org/spring-2022/member-profile-j-wilmar-jensen/?inf_contact_key=24a6fce3a93670a044074a0604a2dc82842e902fbefb79ab9abae13bfcb46658&utm_campaign=publication&utm_medium=link-jensen&utm_source=email-b). J. Wilmar Jensen has some good advice for the newbies: “The worst thing that can happen to a young lawyer is to make a lot of money off the first case. That’s bad news because you’re always looking for that from then on. Those lawyers don’t like the grind. They like the glory, but not the blood, sweat, and tears that go into it. Be prepared to work. If you don’t have a work ethic, you’re not going to make it in law practice. You’ve got to grind it out.” He is spot on.

Jensen has a “people law” practice in California’s San Joaquin Valley, one of the most productive agricultural regions in the country. (Yes, there’s more to California than Tinseltown and Silicon Valley.)

For all of us, at whatever stage, how hungry are you? I don’t mean in the tummy-growling sense, but in the career sense. How hungry are you for money? Prestige? Fascinating work? Part of what we have seen during the Great Resignation is that people are not hungry for the same things anymore. Yes, money is important to be able to pay your bills, interesting work is good so that you don’t stick a pen up your nose out of boredom. What about prestige? Important to maybe some, but fewer than we think. How many clients ask you where you went to law school? Your LSAT scores?

The past two years have taught us many things. Hunger is more than merely satisfying physical appetite. During the past two years, we have hungered for connection, for health, and other physical and emotional needs that are not satisfied by Uber Eats, Grub Hub, Door Dash, and the like. (No comments, please, about quarantine weight gain.) After two years, we can start, at least a little, to satisfy those other hungers.

# Remain Silent And Stay A Fool
## Remaining silent is terrible advice. Always ask questions, because others may be too shy to do so.

There are a lot of quotes that sound nice but are idiotic real-world advice. “Follow Your Heart” and “Don’t Take ‘No’ for an Answer” have gotten me nothing but restraining orders. “If you can dream it, you can achieve it” is a little ridiculous when you dream of being Han Solo, Don Corleone, or a 7-foot NBA all-star. “If you can’t handle me at my worst, you don’t deserve me at my best” usually leaves me wondering when exactly I’m going to be seeing this person’s “best.” “I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.” For some reason I don’t seem to get the same reaction as Liam. And of course, the subject of this column: “Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt.”

Sometimes attributed to Mark Twain, but it’s Abraham Lincoln. Well, Abe, you may be on Mt. Rushmore, and you may be good at [racing](http://washington.nationals.mlb.com/was/fan_forum/presidents_standings.jsp), but I guess we all have our off days. Remaining silent is terrible advice. Had I been reviewing your work the day you said that, I would have marked it up so it read: “Speak out and be thought a fool, or remain silent and stay a fool.”

In Biglaw, there’s pressure to stay silent. If I was in a senior partner’s corner office along with another partner or a senior associate and we were on a conference call and someone asked if anyone had any questions, my piping up with a bunch of questions (or any questions at all) would have subjected me to some serious side-eye. Then there were the partners who would get upset when they were asked questions by underlings, since they liked to feign their time was so valuable they couldn’t spare 30 seconds to answer a question. And sure, their billing rate may have been twice mine, but why was it the most senior partners — with the highest rates — tended to be the most generous with their time?

In Biglaw, the consequences of asking a stupid question can be unpleasant. Maybe you don’t get invited to the partner’s office anymore to sit in on conference calls. Maybe the junior partner/senior associate gets tired of being asked questions he doesn’t know the answer to and starts using someone else for his deals. Maybe your hours suffer if you’re not a head-down worker bee.

In SmallLaw, nothing is holding you back. There’s no intimidation in the room. Nobody to really get upset. And it’s liberating. I’ve found that about two-thirds of the time when I ask the stupid question it turns out not to have been a stupid question at all, and was on at least a few other people’s minds. On the conference call that sparked the idea for this column, my stupid question generated a 10-minute discussion among the other parties that helped clarify the situation, so it probably wasn’t a stupid question.

I won’t lie: it feels good when the question you ask was on everyone else’s mind. It gives you confidence the next question you ask won’t be considered stupid either, and if it does, hey BFD, because your other questions have been good. Like I wrote in the [Facebook column](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/the-lawyers-guide-to-facebook-etiquette/?rf=1), there’s no glory in being a lurker. Speak up! Really, the only stupid question is the one someone just said the answer to five minutes ago. That will frustrate people. Otherwise, I’d much rather have someone tell me they don’t understand something, as opposed to sitting there mute like they do.

I’ve written before about the [accelerated learning curve in SmallLaw](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/the-weekly-llm/). Part of it is because there is no relying on a bunch of other people (e.g., another practice group) to handle something. I have to know what’s going on, otherwise it’s not going to get done. So if I’m just not getting something, I’m going to speak up, and we’re going to keep discussing it until I get it.

Abe did have some good quotes. For example, “Man who catch fly with chopstick accomplish anything.” I don’t have time to google it because the folks at ATL are bugging me for today’s column, but that was Abe, right? [Good stuff.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1gAHil89Z4)

# Biglaw Made A Boatload Of Money Last Year
## 2018 was a very good year for law firms... but is trouble on the horizon?

For the longest time, the story of Biglaw has wavered between muted confidence and abject despair. While most firms claimed they saw modest success on the horizon for themselves, they also envisioned looming woes for everyone else in the sector. Discounting for self-assurance and then watching quarter after quarter of sagging demand for legal services, the whole thing didn’t paint an inspiring picture.

But 2018 managed to prove everyone wrong! According to Citi Private Bank’s most recent report, well, the first line of [this article](https://www.law.com/2019/02/10/inside-law-firms-best-results-in-a-decade/) says it all: “The law firm industry last year posted its best results in more than 10 years.”

That’s right. After a morose decade and hand-wringing over a mid-year salary bump, revenue still outpaced expenses and firms posted the best net income and profits per equity partner growth since 2007. These are pre-recession numbers.

While the rich continued to get richer, the gap wasn’t as pronounced as in recent years:

Am Law 50 firms and niche/boutique firms outperformed the rest of the industry on average, and the Am Law Second 50 were not far behind. And while dispersion remained, the good news is that we saw a larger proportion of firms enjoy demand growth. Even among the Am Law Second Hundred firms, whose performance as a group lagged the other segments, an increased proportion of firms saw demand improvement. With strong inventory growth at year-end, the industry is well-positioned for a strong start to 2019.

Perhaps no one is happier than White & Case, who [smashed through the $2 billion revenue barrier](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/02/11/white-case-breaks-2-billion-in-revenue-as-profit-growth-continues/) last year. The White & Case story, while maybe more extreme than the rest of the industry, reflects the broad trends of 2018 — strategic lateral expansion, key contributions from new offices, and taking advantage of a hot M&A market. But as impressive as the $2 billion objective sounds, the firm’s looking to bust through another more formidable obstacle soon: besting $1 million in revenue per lawyer.

Basically, everything’s up across the board. Expenses grew, but revenue outpaced it. Billing rates increased, but increased demand made up for it. The only thing that’s really “down” is volatility which is great news too.

But are these 2018 numbers across the industry sustainable? The aggressive upper-income tax cuts kicked off a furious round of activity at the top, but those have more or less run their course as 2019 dawns. Is demand really back or was it just temporarily buoyed by a short-term stimulus package for the corporate set? The legal industry isn’t always on the forefront of shifting economic winds, but the next few quarters could be telling. If demand creeps back sharply, we could be looking back at 2018 as the year we all got just a little too cocky.

# Should I Stay Or Should I Go?
## You’ve obviously achieved a lot in your career already. You’ve honed your legal skills and become a trusted advisor to your clients. You’ve generated business for your firm, mentored associates, and contributed to the broader legal community. But are you happy?

So you fought the law[[2]](#f2)… and won! Congrats, you’re now a firm partner. You’ve obviously achieved a lot in your career already. You’ve honed your legal skills and become a trusted advisor to your clients. You’ve generated business for your firm, mentored associates, and contributed to the broader legal community. Rudie can’t fail![[3]](#f3) You deserve that brand new Cadillac.[[4]](#f4)

But are you happy? Or do you feel a little lost in a supermarket?[[5]](#f5)

Maybe that’s a complicated question. You’re a busy person, living a life of death or glory,[[6]](#f6) with a constant stream of noise competing for your attention. You might not often find the time to reflect deeply on your career opportunities[[7]](#f7) and trajectory, or on your goals for the next phase.

Partner compensation structure. If you entered your firm as an associate, the partner compensation structure probably wasn’t front of mind when you decided to join. But as a partner, this is a big deal! The choice between full eat-what-you-kill versus a more balanced approach to sharing the wealth has implications for both your bank account and your relationships with colleagues. Ask yourself whether your firm has chosen the point on the spectrum that you would prefer.

Your personal compensation. Does your [pay fully reflect the value](https://laterallink.com/biglaw-partners-are-you-capturing-a-fair-share-of-your-revenue/) you’re creating? As a general rule, you should be taking home 40% of revenue from hours you billed personally. Your fair share of the hours billed by members of your team is going to depend on the firm’s profitability and leverage. If you have questions about whether you’re being paid fairly, we should talk.

Equity. Do you have equity? If not, [do you want it](https://laterallink.com/is-it-better-to-be-an-equity-partner-or-non-equity-partner/)? Does your firm offer a viable pathway to the equity tier?

Capital contributions. What capital contributions does your firm require? Are the terms more or less burdensome than those of other firms?

Support for your practice area. Does your firm value your practice area? Is your practice a priority in the firm’s marketing efforts? Are you benefitting from cross-selling by the firm’s other practices?

Opportunity to own client relationships. Does your firm provide a strong platform for you to develop your own business? To the extent some of your work comes from the firm’s institutional clients, are more senior partners making room for you to own key relationships?

Broader firm strategy. Does your firm have a well-defined strategy? Do you believe in it? Are you confident that your firm will be stronger in five years than it is today?

If you know you want to keep practicing, but you aren’t entirely sure that your firm is the best place to do it … whether you are looking for bankrobber[[8]](#f8) compensation or need a pressure drop,[[9]](#f9) we should talk. I don’t have to tell you that the market for lateral partners is extremely hot right now. I’m sure you have friends and colleagues who have moved recently.

And with good reason! On average, a partner who makes a lateral move receives a [compensation boost](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/insights/research/10-year-partner-compensation-survey) of 20-30%. The potential gains are especially eye-popping for female partners: when a female partner switches firms, she receives a median pay increase of 40%. Makes sense that so many partners are exploring their options, right?

Keep in mind that window shopping is not a final decision. You don’t need to be bored with the USA[[10]](#f10) to find out if London’s calling.[[11]](#f11) Actually, the ideal time to start looking is before you’re ready to move. Confidence is a better look than desperation.

But the bottom line is, in this market, you are doing a disservice to yourself if you don’t at least explore your options. You need to know your rights[[12]](#f12) and know your worth. And the only way to find out how another firm might treat you is to ask.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Associate Bonus Watch: Dechert Does A Match
## Trust the process, Dechert associates.

Dechert announced a match of the Cravath bonus scale, for all U.S. associates. Dechert has an hours cut off at 1,950 billable hours (which includes qualified pro-bono work). But if you hit the hours, here’s your scale, same as nearly everybody else:

Class of 2016 — $15,000
Class of 2015 — $25,000
Class of 2014 — $50,000
Class of 2013 — $65,000
Class of 2012 — $80,000
Class of 2011 — $90,000
Class of 2010 (or more senior) — $100,000

Thing is, Dechert is a Philly firm. I know, I know, I’ll pause now so Dechert people can scream that they have people in their New York office now. “Dechert is a full-service, intergalactic law firm with expertise in tri-parte incorporation rules of the Zoltar Nebula” — is an email I’m sure somebody there is writing to me now.

But, come on, when you think of Dechert you think of Philly and the firm’s all-U.S. bonuses is a good place to highlight how screwed New York associates are compared to their peers of yesteryear. It might be shocking to younger readers but, back in the day, the New York bonus scale was more generous than anywhere else, because New York is more expensive than anywhere else. A decade ago, it would have been weird for people in Philly to be making the same bonus as people in New York.

Now, it’s all but standard: every associate, in every office, gets the same bonus scale. From a purchasing power standpoint, New York associates are losing out.

On the other hand… have you seen Hamilton yet? It’s really very good.

What about the bonuses everywhere else? Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please email it to us (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text (646-820-8477), or tweet (@ATLblog). We always keep our sources anonymous — and that includes our sources for bonus stories. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks for your help.

Biglaw bonus season is just about over, and if you’re an associate looking to make a move, you may be receiving some unsolicited emails from local recruiters who hope to add you to their roster. If you’re uninterested in leaving your firm, it’s pretty easy to just ignore and delete those bulk-BCC emails and move on with your billable life. But when you receive one of these emails and you can plainly see that it’s addressed to you and hundreds of other attorneys, you know that someone has made a major error in email etiquette.

Something like this happened last week, and much to the amusement of everyone involved (except the recruiter), one of the lawyers who received this not-quite BCC, entitled “Top Tier Firms Seeking Top Tier Attorneys,” snarked it up for all to see.

Here’s the email that a recruiter sent to about 200 lawyers in the Minneapolis area:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
I’m an attorney recruiter with extensive experience recruiting for top-tier national law firms, and I’m reaching out to see if you might be considering the market at this time. Based on what I know about your background and experience, you may be of interest to a number of my clients in the Minneapolis area.

Having practiced law for more than 20 years, as an associate attorney, partner, and managing partner, I’ve acquired unique insights and knowledge into the lateral hiring process, which serves as a vital resource to my candidates. I’ve developed invaluable contacts over the years, not only with recruiting managers, but also with department chairs and managing partners, affording me direct access to the people with ultimate decision-making authority.

I’d love to schedule a time to speak this week (even if you’re not considering a move right now) and learn more about you! Please let me know your availability.

I hope to hear back from you soon.

Best regards,

[Recruiter]

This recruiter did hear back from someone soon, but not in the way that was expected:

I’m an associate attorney with extensive experience using the bcc function, and I’m reaching out to see if you might be considering learning how to use the bcc function at this time. Based on what I know about your background and experience, you may be interested in learning how to use the bcc function while prospecting in the Minneapolis area.

Having practiced law for more than 2 years as an associate attorney, I’ve acquired unique insights and knowledge into the bcc process, which serves as a vital resource to my colleagues and clients. I’ve developed invaluable contacts over the years, though they are unaware of one another’s identities due to my ultimate bcc knowledge.

I’d love to schedule a time to speak this week (even if you’re not considering using the bcc function right now) and learn more about you! Please let me know your availability.

I hope to hear back from you soon.

Best regards,

[Associate]

“My apologies, it was an inadvertent mistake,” said the recruiter after his email fail was called out in front of hundreds of would-be clients. Perhaps this recruiter will more careful the next time he tries to solicit business from “top tier attorneys.”

While we are well-positioned to execute the combination on April 1, we believe the decision to postpone is in the best interest of our attorneys, staff, and clients. Postponing the merger will allow our attorneys to remain focused on excellent client care and will allow all our people to prioritize the health and safety of their families and themselves at this difficult time.

—  an except from an [announcement](https://www.troutman.com/insights/troutman-pepper.html) posted on the Troutman Sanders website, announcing that its planned merger with Pepper Hamilton is being postponed until July 1, 2020. When the merger is complete this summer, the combined firm of Troutman Pepper will have 1,100 lawyers across 23 offices.

# Money Matters: These Am Law 100 Firms Haven't Announced Raises Yet
## These firms seem to have the cash, and associates want to know why it isn't being spent on them.

Biglaw’s 2022 salary wars have been ongoing since January, and the market (i.e., all of the firms that have matched Cravath’s generous $215K to $415K scale) has spoken — very loudly, in fact. Dozens of firms up, down, and even outside of the Am Law 100 have already matched the new salary scale, but here we are, more than a month after Cravath announced its new compensation grid, with dozens of firms still remaining completely silent. Why? There aren’t any decisions left to be made… except, of course, whether or not your firm is planning to offer lower-tier salaries to associates during an incredibly hot lateral market.

Which firms in the Am Law 100 haven’t uttered a word — that we know of — to their associates about raises (of any kind) yet? Here’s a list of the firms that have yet to match (along with their most recent gross revenue, as of 2020). Do with it what you will, and please feel free to correct us if we’re wrong.

16. Greenberg Traurig: $1,730,230,000
18. Sullivan & Cromwell: $1,555,441,000 (the firm [matched](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/sullcrom-raise-2022/) on March 17, 2022)
26. Reed Smith: $1,310,596,000
39. Squire Patton: $1,042,000,000
40. K&L Gates: $1,019,674,000
41. Wachtell: $1,010,664,000 (associates at this firm don’t typically share information on their compensation; likely nothing to see here)
47. Faegre Drinker: $937,037,000
48. Foley & Lardner: $922,354,000
49. Troutman Pepper: $918,010,000
52. Bryan Cave: $860,083,000
55. McGuireWoods: $831,051,000
57. Baker & Hostetler: $789,429,000
58. Fragomen: $787,305,000
63. Seyfarth: $717,032,000
65. Venable: $681,864,000
66. Lewis Brisbois: $676,823,000
68. Polsinelli: $618,322,000
69. Littler: $613,640,000
70. Fox Rothschild: $584,000,000
71. Nelson Mullins: $577,075,000
73. Ogletree: $537,559,000
74. Cozen O’Connor: $530,875,000
75. Duane Morris: $526,230,000
76. Jackson Lewis: $518,243,000
77. Crowell & Moring: $514,391,000
78. Barnes & Thornburg: $506,189,000
80. Kilpatrick Townsend: $497,936,000
81. Nixon Peabody: $488,753,000
82. Blank Rome: $483,370,000
83. Locke Lord: $482,096,000
84. Womble Bond: $476,192,000
86. Akerman: $451,682,000
89. Davis Wright: $445,253,000
92. Gordon Rees: $442,256,000
94. Ballard Spahr: $426,926,000
95. Husch Blackwell: $417,056,000
96. Dorsey: $414,096,000
100. Baker Donelson: $372,959,000

# Sexual Harassment Allegations Mount Against Former FTC Commissioner & Law Professor
## The first story was bad, these stories are way worse.

Of the public allegation that now-former FTC Commissioner and ASS Law professor Joshua Wright leveraged his role as the law school’s hiring chair to dangle a job prospect as a means of meeting potential dates, [we wrote that](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/we-shouldnt-have-to-say-this-but-job-interviews-are-not-your-personal-dating-app/) “in the annals of inappropriate behavior this is not the worst. And maybe this guy was just clueless about the ramifications of what he was doing.”

Like Schrödinger’s Cat in prose, those sentences existed in a simultaneous duality. It could describe the “benefit of the doubt” or foreshadow that this specific allegation, while serious in its own right, could prove the tip of an iceberg and that maybe this guy was not just clueless.

The probability wave might’ve just collapsed.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Law360 spoke with two senior Biglaw attorneys, Kirkland & Ellis partner Elyse Dorsey and Freshfields counsel Angela Landry who [detailed sexual harassment from Wright dating back to their 1L years](https://www.law360.com/articles/1710427) and carrying into their professional lives:

The women said those early advances led to years of misconduct, during which Dorsey and Landry felt they had no option but to continue engaging sexually with Wright or else risk serious damage to their careers. Both said they believe there are “many” more women who have been similarly approached by Wright, based on conversations with former schoolmates and colleagues, as well as a conversation between Landry and Wright himself.

Dorsey and Landry were in the same 1L class, but neither knew about the other’s story until recently when a mutual friend recommended that they reconnect based on their similar accounts.

Despite a string of flirtatious comments, Dorsey said, she generally thought Wright was “harmless” at the time and felt reassured by the fact that he was married and had small children. When he asked her to join him on a trip to meet clients in California, she said, she agreed to attend.

They stayed at a nice hotel, and when they arrived she discovered there was only one room with one bed, Dorsey said. There weren’t any client meetings during the trip, she said, and instead they went wine tasting.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
When I said that in the annals of inappropriate behavior, using a job interview to set up for asking someone out is not the worst, that’s because “booking a single bed for you and your student for meetings with non-existent clients” would be the definition of “worse.” As would “pressuring your research assistant to have sex with you in your office,” which Dorsey also alleges. For what it’s worth, Landry also describes sex in the office while she was a student.

According to Landry, she confronted Wright in 2020 about his alleged sexual misconduct after he sent her an email apologizing for his behavior. They met in person and he told her he’d sought sexual relationships with countless women in professional settings, she said.

“He told me he couldn’t even count the number of people he sent inappropriate messages to,” she said.

If true, then so much for being clueless.

Wright’s attorney, Lindsay R. McKasson of [Binnall Law Group](https://www.binnall.com/) — yes, that’s MAGA doofus Jesse Binnall’s firm — provided Law360 with a statement, stating, “These false allegations are being made public after unsuccessfully demanding millions of dollars behind closed doors. We look forward to total vindication in court.”

“Total vindication in court” sounds like a defamation suit in the offing. If Wright goes that route, he’d better hope there really aren’t an incalculable “number of people he sent inappropriate messages to.”

# Take Your Best Shot: Remote Practices, Bad Boy Lawyers, And Unvaccinated Warnings
## Which do you think is a worse violation of ethics rules: stealing money from clients or advising the vice president to disregard the rule of law?

For those of us in California who hate sitting in traffic (does anyone enjoy that?), Gov. Gavin Newsom has signed SB 241, which permits remote courtroom appearances until July 1, 2023. No one says that there’s been anything good that has come out of the pandemic, certainly not when more than 700,000 Americans are dead, but the pandemic has forced us to confront how to provide legal services in different ways. Courtrooms have been remote since the beginning of the pandemic more than a year and a half ago, but now, [at least here in California](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB241), remote appearances have the force of law and not just emergency judicial declarations.

This is not only a boon for lawyers who don’t want to appear in public spaces — especially courtrooms, while the pandemic continues — but it’s an economic benefit for clients. No more paying for exorbitant parking at courthouses, especially in downtown LA where the cost is equivalent to ransoming your first-born child, no more heel cooling for several hours while awaiting an appearance that takes no more than five minutes, no more explaining to the client why you billed three hours for a five-minute appearance (travel and traffic to and from the courthouse, schlepping from a remote parking lot, which is all that is left these days), and so on. It’s never been a pretty picture for clients receiving those bills, but that may be a thing of the past, at least in California for a while. No more opportunities for a little creative billing, aka padding, as a [couple of Biglaw associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/biglaw-associates-caught-overbilling-lose-jobs-ability-to-practice-law/) recently learned. Suspensions for both. Not the best optics, especially if/when either or both seek future employment as lawyers.

We all know that the billable hours requirement increases almost every year. But where is the point when associates (and even partners) say “enough is enough”? When I started practice all those dinosaur years ago, “work-life balance” was not even in the vocabulary, although billable hours were much more reasonable. And the Biglaw business model is [getting some competition](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/the-real-threat-to-biglaws-business-model/) from the non-Biglaw firms that can poach top laterals with the phase that makes them swoon: “work-life balance.”

Positives can and do abound in remote work, which is why it’s going to be so hard to go back, if ever, to the office environment. You don’t need me to count the ways why remote work, or at least some subset of it, is [here to stay](https://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/some-attorneys-liked-parts-of-their-pandemic-lifestyles-so-much-theyve-made-some-changes-permanent-changes?utm_medium=email&utm_source=salesforce_443869&sc_sid=04744929&utm_campaign=weekly_email&promo=&utm_content=&additional4=&additional5=&sfmc_j=443869&sfmc_s=83087486&sfmc_l=1527&sfmc_jb=27020&sfmc_mid=100027443&sfmc_u=12931132).

And think of all the money that has gone down the drain when firms adopted the “[open office architecture](https://www.fastcompany.com/90626329/these-architects-popularized-the-open-office-now-they-say-the-open-office-is-dead)” model. That is so pre-2020.

Salaries for associates in dinosaur days (my era) were [not eye-popping](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/michelman-robinson-raise/), to say the least. However, we didn’t carry the amount of student loan debt that is extant today, and the cost of living was certainly less, albeit we did have very high inflation, the gas crisis, and the prime rate kept climbing. I could no more imagine today’s salaries than I could have predicted the six winning numbers for Powerball.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
So, what do you think is the likelihood that the newly named State Bar of California Chief Trial Counsel, [George Cardona](https://www.calbar.ca.gov/About-Us/News/News-Releases/state-bar-of-california-names-george-s-cardona-as-new-chief-trial-counsel-for-the-attorney-discipline-system), will do anything about the request from multiple attorneys and retired judges [to investigate John Eastman](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-10-04/trump-2020-election-john-eastman-california-bar)? You remember him, don’t you? The former Chapman University (here in SoCal) law school professor who advised Vice President Mike Pence to ignore the rule of law and invalidate the results of the 2020 presidential election? Cardona, newly appointed and subject to state Senate confirmation, has a lot to do.

Which do you think is a worse violation of the ethics rules and the state bar’s stated mandate of public protection? Which is more egregious? Stealing money from clients as Tom Girardi is alleged to have done? Or advising the vice president to disregard the rule of law as John Eastman did? Flip a coin. It will be interesting to see if the state bar does anything about disciplining Eastman. Girardi has already resigned from the bar. I doubt if Eastman would do anything similar even if disciplinary charges were to be filed against him. Is there discipline for erroneous bonehead advice other than a malpractice claim, even if it rises to the [level of what Eastman advised](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/trumpland-lawyers-face-bar-complaints-after-engaging-in-some-light-coup-ing/)?

Eastman wins the prize for needing refresher courses in both ethics and civics, and some con law wouldn’t hurt. He is the poster child for my belief that pedigree isn’t everything even though his law degree is from University of Chicago, and yes, he also has a Ph.D. in Government(!), the latter from Claremont Graduate School.

This was [not Eastman’s first flight of fancy](https://timesofsandiego.com/politics/2020/08/14/oc-professor-defends-saying-kamala-harris-ineligible-for-vp-echoing-birther-lie/). Remember that Eastman is the same law professor who doubted that Kamala Harris could properly be vice president, the “birther” argument redux.

Last, but certainly not least, as one of the many millions who is immuno-compromised for various boring reasons and has received a COVID-19 booster shot, the refusals of first responders (fire, police, EMTs), health care professionals, teachers, [and now an associate judge](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/judge-refuses-to-get-vaxxed-gets-barred-from-courthouse-chambers/) of the Court of Appeals in New York State, to be vaccinated are beyond irritating.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Should we now have a variation of the Miranda warnings to make sure everyone who encounters an unvaccinated understands the risks for COVID-19? How would that work? Would the unvaccinated person have to advise that he/she is unvaccinated, that there is the right to refuse treatment or services from the unvaccinated, and that if treatment is permitted, that permission could be used as a defense in a lawsuit against the unvaccinated? (“But your honor, the plaintiff agreed to treatment.”) Would the unvaccinated also need to include in the warning that he/she is relying on a religious or medical exemption to explain the reason(s) for not being vaccinated?

What should we call such warnings? I have some suggestions. If you have any, please share.

# Life After Skadden Can Be Pretty Sweet
## Yes, you can break the golden handcuffs.

If you’re like a lot of Biglaw attorneys, you’re pretty miserable at your job but have no idea what comes next. Stories from “reformed litigators” who have actually managed to break the golden handcuffs of law firm life and somehow managed to get themselves a brand new career can be inspirational.

In the latest episode of The Jabot podcast, I talk with Amy Impellizzeri. After spending a decade as a litigator at Skadden, she’s embarked on a successful career as a writer, penning four novels and a non-fiction book, [Lawyer Interrupted](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/alt-legal-conscious-uncoupling-with-your-law-firm/), about how to leave your law firm. Amy’s latest novel, [Why We Lie](https://amzn.to/2Ot0ltU) (affiliate link) is the perfect book club selection. It’s a fast-paced page turner set amid the high-stakes world of D.C. politics filled with characters dealing with the repercussions of domestic violence and sexual assault.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wears when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

We start the week off with a bit of closure — after reviewing the case presented, a jury has decided on the Davis Polk discrimination suit. From [Law360](https://www.law360.com/trials/articles/1791067/breaking-davis-polk-not-liable-in-black-atty-s-retaliation-case):

A Manhattan federal jury on Monday quickly absolved Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP and two lawyers of liability in a Black former associate’s suit alleging he was fired in retaliation for airing concerns about racial bias and diversity.

The jury of five women and five men needed just over two hours of deliberations to reach their verdict against plaintiff Kaloma Cardwell after a trial before U.S. District Judge Gregory H. Woods that opened Jan. 8.

Judge Woods thanked the jury for its “careful and devoted service.”

It is still weird that DPW attorneys were providing Golden Globe-level performances depending on who was in the room? Yes, but that does not distract from the fact that it is generally not a good idea to turn away M&A work in the 11th hour when everyone else needs you.

2019 was a good year for Squire Patton Boggs. The firm [brought in $1,035,000,000 in gross revenue](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/04/21/the-2020-am-law-100-ranked-by-gross-revenue/#) last year, but that won’t stop the COVID-19 austerity measures sweeping Biglaw.

Today the firm announced a 20 percent salary cut for all associates, though the existing bonus program will not be impacted by the cuts. Staff will see a range of cuts, between 10 and 20 percent, depending on salary. Additionally, underutilized or staff unable to perform their job remotely will be furloughed. Partner distributions will also be adjusted, and the firm says the partnership will shoulder the largest financial burden.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The summer program is also being impacted. The 2020 US Summer Associate Program is cut and those that were scheduled to work at the firm will receive a stipend and an offer for future employment (2Ls will get full time job offers, 1Ls will be offered to join the 2021 summer program). And the soon-to-be-graduates of the class of 2020, set to start at the U.S. offices of the firm in September, will have their start day pushed back until January 2021. (The firm expects U.K. trainees to start in August as scheduled.)

The firm had the following statement on the cuts:

“The global pandemic has created distress for companies around the world and will continue to for some time.  As responsible stewards of the firm and consistent with measures taken by other law firms, it is necessary to take prudent steps to assure the firm’s success and prevent job loss over the long term.”

# The Litigation Finance Survey Report: Check Out Our Findings

[](http://bit.ly/2SIFIdQ)For more than a decade now, we have witnessed the seemingly inexorable growth of the commercial litigation finance market as means to finance claims, hedge risk, and fund operating expenses. For both corporations and law firms, the trend has been the same: ever-broadening acceptance of litigation finance as not just a viable option, but an attractive one. Late in 2018, together with our friends at [Lake Whillans, ](http://bit.ly/2RwCSZG)we fielded a survey aimed at capturing the perspective of practicing litigators and in-house counsel regarding this increasingly relevant and established means of accessing capital. Nearly 400 respondents ultimately shared their insights, and our findings reveal a detailed and sometimes surprising portrait of the ongoing dynamics of the practice:

- Attorneys in which industries have the most experience with litigation finance? The least?
- How do the perspectives of in-house counsel and law firm attorneys differ?
- Which motivations for seeking litigation finance are the most powerful?
- What are the major challenges to the continuing growth of the field?

# Biglaw Firm Boosts Salaries For The THIRD Time This Year, But...
## Better luck next time for that $205K starting salary.

How badly does your firm want to compete in the white-hot lateral market? For some firms, the answer can be evidenced in its compensation. Did your firm raise salaries once this year? Great, a lot of firms did that. But did your firm raises salaries twice this year? Eh, probably not, only a few did. Did your firm raise salaries three times this year? Only two firms that we know of can say that they did, and one of them did it earlier this week.

As noted above, this firm has bumped associate salaries three times thus far in 2021… but it still hasn’t quite reached the $205K starting salary that associates have long been dreaming of. Which firm could it be?

Stoel Rives — a firm that brought in $259,328,000 gross revenue in 2020, ranking it at No. 124 in the most recent Am Law 200 — has committed to putting more cash in associates’ pockets three times this year. The firm’s first announcement was made in July, when all associates received a [$10,000 salary bump](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/stoel-rives-raises-21/). Then, in August, the firm announced that effective October 1, starting salaries would rise once again, with commensurate raises for more senior associates (along with a yearly requirement for 1850 billable hours). Here’s what the firm’s salaries looked like in October across all of its office:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
- Anchorage: $125,000
- Boise: $125,000
- Minneapolis: $155,000
- Portland: $155,000
- Sacramento: $155,000
- Salt Lake City: $155,000
- San Diego: $180,000
- San Francisco: $180,000
- Seattle: $180,000
- Washington D.C.: $180,000
Earlier this week, Stoel Rives surprised associates with a third salary announcement. This time, the firm will be increasing associate starting pay by $10,000 or more, with adjustments for more senior associates as well, starting in 2022. According to managing partner Melissa Jones, these compensation changes (a “market correction”) are part of the the firm’s plans to “remain competitive in a tight market for talent.”

Congratulations to everyone at the firm. Maybe in 2022, the firm will meet the market with its next round of raises.

# Donald Trump Chooses Biglaw Firm To Fight New York Times Over Publication Of Tax Documents

Donald Trump

On Saturday night, the New York Times published [three pages from Donald Trump’s 1995 tax returns](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html), specifically, the first page of a New York State resident income tax return, the first page of a New Jersey nonresident tax return, and the first page of a Connecticut nonresident tax return. Jack Mitnick, the lawyer and certified public accountant who handled Trump’s tax matters until 1996 (and for more than 30 years prior), said the documents were “legit.” Taken as a whole, those records show that Trump declared a loss of about $916 million in 1995, a tax deduction that would have allowed him to avoid paying any federal income taxes for nearly two decades.

Trump himself refused to comment on the tax records obtained and published by the Times, but his campaign [released a statement](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/01/us/politics/donald-trump-letter.html), which reads in relevant part:

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The only news here is that the more than 20 year-old alleged tax document was illegally obtained, a further demonstration that the New York Times, like establishment media in general, is an extension of the Clinton Campaign, the Democratic Party and their global special interests.

Mr. Trump is a highly-skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required. That being said, Mr. Trump has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes, sales and excise taxes, real estate taxes, city taxes, state taxes, employee taxes and federal taxes, along with very substantial charitable contributions.

The Times later received a letter via email from [Marc E. Kasowitz](http://www.kasowitz.com/marc-e-kasowitz/), name partner at Kasowitz Benson Torres & Friedman, which stated that the publication of Trump’s tax records was illegal because Trump had not authorized their disclosure, threatening “prompt initiation of appropriate legal action.”

How did the [superior legal minds](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/08/lawsuit-of-the-day-ex-kasowitz-associate-with-superior-legal-mind-sues-the-firm-for-77-million/) at Kasowitz Benson get caught up in this mess?

It seems that attorneys from the firm have represented Trump in all manner of matters since at least 2001. Such matters have included, but are certainly not limited to, the restructuring of $1.3 billion in bondholder debt connected to his Atlantic City casinos; a defamation case filed against the author of [TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald](http://amzn.to/2cXRIGB) (affiliate link), for stating that the businessman was worth between $150 million and $250 million, not billions (a suit that [Trump later lost](http://www.njlawjournal.com/id=1202513815084/Trump-v-OBrien?slreturn=20160903115041)); and the fight to keep filings from his 1990 divorce from ex-wife Ivana Trump sealed. Here’s more from the [Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/top-stories/id=1202769047259/Trump-Taps-Kasowitz-Amid-Times-Tax-Drama?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=2):

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Kasowitz Benson has been a longtime legal adviser to Trump, advising him on numerous engagements…. …

“[Kasowitz Benson] are not good lawyers, they’re phenomenal lawyers,” [Trump told The American Lawyer in a 2004 feature story](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=900005411966?id=900005411966) about the firm, specifically singling out [[David] Friedman](http://www.kasowitz.com/david-m-friedman/) for praise. “They’re highly talented with great insight into the future.”

Perhaps it’s thanks to the lawyers at Kasowitz Benson that Trump thinks he “knows the tax code far better than anyone who has ever run for President,” and why he believes that “he is the only one that knows how to fix it.”

# Managing Partners Should Micromanage Less
## Managing partners should foster a more decentralized environment to improve efficiency.

Sometimes, attention to every little thing can be a limitation.

As discussed in a previous article, [managing partners at law firms have a difficult job](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/02/qualities-of-good-managing-partners/). Not only do many of these attorneys need to bill time to clients, but they also need to fulfill a number of administrative functions at a firm. Even though managing partners have so much to do, some of them can micromanage the smallest things about an office. This is usually very inefficient, and managing partners should avoid micromanaging and should delegate tasks to other people at a firm.

I worked at several law firms of all sizes before I started my own practice almost three years ago. The function of the managing partner at each of these firms was similar, although some of the firms at which I worked had numerous offices so the office managing partner had a similar role to the firm managing partners at smaller firms. I was always impressed with how many hours managing partners needed to dedicate to their jobs to ensure that things were running smoothly.

However, some of the managing partners I worked with micromanaged parts of the office in inefficient ways. For instance, I once worked at a law firm at which the managing partner needed to approve all of the retainer agreements that were sent to clients. On a certain level, this makes sense, since the managing partner needs to ensure that the terms offered to prospective clients are good for a firm and keep attorneys from binding the firm to unreasonable engagements even if the arrangement might benefit one lawyer.

One time, I had a potential client that was interested in retaining me to handle a matter. The managing partner told me that he needed to approve the retainer agreement, and I was able to send him a draft retainer agreement within a few hours. The partner then sat on the retainer agreement for days, saying that he was too busy to look at it earlier. This was extremely frustrating since the retainer agreement was only two pages long and offered terms I knew were reasonable for the firm. By the time we got our approved retainer agreement to the potential client, the potential client had hired different counsel. The wait caused by the micromanagement of the managing partner could have kept our firm from originating a solid client.

Sometimes, the micromanagement of managing partners is even more unreasonable. Some managing partners I worked with needed to be consulted when people suggested changing the free food offered by a shop, and the office administrator did not feel empowered to do this on her own. I once worked at another firm at which the managing partner had the final say over where attorneys and staff sat in an office. The firm had gone through a period of layoffs, and the empty spaces scattered around the office was a reminded of the layoffs that had happened in the past.

The office rented several floors in a building, but after the layoffs, perhaps everyone could have been consolidated into one floor and change. Consolidating everyone would make the office seem livelier and eliminate reminders about past layoffs. However, the office administrator said that she needed to get the managing partner’s approval before anyone could move offices. For whatever reason, the managing partner never got around to approving the moves, and the status quo at the office stood. This negatively impacted morale at the office, and this could have been fixed if there was less micromanagement on behalf of the managing partner.

Law firms typically have a number of administrators, in addition to managing partners, that can help with the administrative tasks of running a law firm. Indeed, law firms typically have office managers, facilities managers, and others who are tasked with maintaining the physical space in which a law firm operated. Moreover, human resource professionals, marketing teams, and other employees at firms can handle many of the nonlegal tasks associated with running a law firm. Some law firms even have C-suite officials like CFOs so that designated management officials can handle administrative tasks that could keep managing partners from serving clients and billing hours.

Managing partners should rely on administrative officials at a firm to make decisions so that attorneys and staff do not need to get the approval of a management partner for relatively trivial matters. In addition, managing partners should foster a more decentralized environment so that attorneys feel more like they can operate on their own initiative rather than waiting for the “brass” to decide a matter since this can delay the decision-making process. In this way, managing partners can eliminate inefficiencies in an office and ensure that managing partners, attorney, and staff and more focused on serving clients rather than worrying about nonlegal administrative issues.

# Stats Of The Week: Meh Midyear Report For Biglaw
## The business of Biglaw is tepid at midyear.

As [noted earlier](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/law-firm-growth-continues-slowly/?rf=1) this week, the [Citi Private Law Firm Group](https://www.privatebank.citibank.com/home/tailored-advice/specialist-services/law-firm-group.html) has released its [report](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202765058171?slreturn=20160719093631) on the state of the legal industry at the halfway point of 2016. The news was resoundingly lukewarm: Q1’s surprisingly robust demand growth has faded, although the general picture compares favorably to 2015. Some of the key metrics cited:

- Demand increased a mere 0.3 percent for the the first half of 2016.
- Revenue grew 4.1 percent (up from the 3.3 percent growth seen in the first half of 2015).
- Growth in net income and PEP has exceeded first-half 2015 levels, attributable to expense management and rate increases.
- Expense growth of 3.1 percent, driven by 3.3 percent growth in overhead and 3 percent in compensation expenses.
Regarding that last point, the report’s authors blandly — and ominously — note that “the increase in associate salaries which many firms implemented in July will put upward pressure on second-half expenses.”

# There's No Such Thing As A Competitive Legal Market -- But There Are Ways To Make It Better
## Bodhala seeks to empower in-house counsel through data.

Whenever we get a new report on the legal industry’s business landscape, we note an increasing divide between the elite handful of Biglaw behemoths — either by size or reputation or both — and the rest of the Am Law 200. Chalk it up to the enduring “CYA” factor that whispers to in-house lawyers that “no one gets fired for hiring Cravath.” But at the same time, we’ve also seen some of the smaller firms — the elite boutiques and the scrappy regional players — encroaching more and more on the mid-sized and even Biglaw firms that don’t quite make the elite cut. With smaller firms able to leverage technology to deliver results for clients at a lower price point, some savvy GCs are taking advantage where they can. But the lack of a cohesive strategy for hiring outside counsel leads to a bit of a hodgepodge approach that has left a lot of the Am Law 200 sitting in a hollowing middle.

But in truth, the legal market has never been perfectly competitive. It’s entry-level economics that the Platonic ideal of a market involves “perfect information” which is generally laughable and never more so than in the legal sector. For decades, clients developed personal relationships with Biglaw firms and never bothered to shop out work. When they do, a broad swath of firms are never even invited to compete. How can clients guarantee they’re making the right call for their company when most of the hiring logic is mostly derived from anecdote and habit?

This lack of perfect competition is a tagline Bodhala uses on its website. The legal procurement company is providing transparency for in-house attorneys seeking to engage the right outside counsel for the right price point. It’s a task befitting the corporate name, which is sanskrit for “the illumination of talent.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Bodhala’s legal analytics offer in-house counsel a wealth of information about the entire Am Law 200, high-quality boutiques, as well as a number of local firms that clients can easily customize to find exactly what they want. The platform also leverages machine learning technology to make predictive calls about opportunities to lower costs with other firms. Beyond talent procurement, the product offers spend optimization features that grant clients an opportunity to really market test quotes for legal services. Finally, something approaching perfect information.

As Bodhala co-CEO Raj Goyle describes it, Bodhala’s mission is to “solve several kinds of pain for clients.” And when it comes to client pain, outside spend is a notorious one. What Bodhala brings, in Goyle’s opinion, is a big data play and a robust algorithm to allow clients to get deep on solving procurement pain. As he puts it, most legal departments are “still in the age of the slide rule while managing a $400B industry.”

While most corporate legal departments feel secure that their gut calls have, largely, worked out, it turns out that there’s a lot lurking in the data that corporate legal departments aren’t seeing, resulting in heavy opportunity costs. Goyle offers the example of a Biglaw partner listed on the website as a fund formation lawyer. But analyzing available data reveals that an overwhelming majority of the lawyer’s work is really private equity. Has this categorical inaccuracy led the company missing a bargain of a private equity lawyer? Have they staked the company on an affordable fund formation lawyer who lacks the necessary expertise? These are among the questions Bodhala can resolve.

Goyle’s personal story isn’t the “risk-averse” path of the typical lawyer. But the tale of how he got to the legal tech world from his days at Harvard Law with a stopover in the Kansas legislature animates the spirit of Bodhala.

Goyle likes to say his risk-taking is a product of being dropped as a child, but his mother doesn’t find it funny… since she’s an obstetrician. In reality, the entrepreneurial spirit came naturally to Goyle, the son of immigrants who both got medical degrees and ran their own practices in Wichita. And it’s not a stretch to say that having successful professionals as parents afforded him a little wiggle room to gamble.

Goyle, who was “hit with political bug early,” actually sees a consistent through line from his time in Democratic politics, serving as a member of the Kansas legislature, to legal technology.

The idea of solving problems has always animated me… Leveraging the same passion toward solving this huge piece of the economy run exceptionally poorly.

That’s a pretty good answer. Personally, I’d have said that as a Democrat in the Kansas legislature, I spent a good deal of time trying to bring a large number of people to a better future that they resisted for often ill-conceived reasons and that’s a lot like changing the culture in the legal profession, but Goyle’s answer is probably better.

# What Do Magic Circle Partners Think Of The A&O Shearman Merger? Not Much...
## The deal seems to be getting met with a collective shoulder shrug in the U.K.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

The truth is that it doesn’t make much difference in the U.K.

It probably will not set any precedent because it is difficult to merge firms because of different cultures, especially between the U.S. and U.K. It will take about 10 years to determine [if it’s a success or failure]. It’s really important to see if they get synergies, it’s really important to see who stays because often people leave after mergers.

— The U.K. head of a U.S. firm, in anonymous comments given to [Law.com International](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/10/16/what-industry-leaders-think-of-the-ao-shearman-result-405-130283/) concerning the [recently approved merger](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/ao-shearman-merger-approved-poised-to-become-third-largest-firm-in-the-world/) between Allen & Overy and Shearman & Sterling that would unite the firms to become A&O Shearman come sometime in May 2024. The partner said that the combination would “inevitably” bolster A&O’s portrayal in the U.S., but won’t be of much assistance in the U.K.

# Beware The Biglaw Lunch Interview: There Be Dragons
## There are a ton of pitfalls before you actually receive an offer from a Biglaw firm.

You guys. There are a ton of pitfalls before you actually receive an offer from a Biglaw firm. One of the biggest potential downfalls is not realizing that the oh-so-kind offer for a lunch is actually an interview in the flimsiest of disguises.

Last week, we asked for the worst of your interview stories, and boy, have our readers delivered. Today, we are focusing on associates who’ve had the misfortune of interviewing with miserable candidates. The common thread here is that the candidates have forgotten that while a fancy lunch may be nice, it is still, first and foremost, an interview:

One candidate actually licked his plate in a fancy Italian restaurant during a lunch interview. He bent down and full on licked the plate. He also double dipped his bread in the olive oil. My colleague and I were grossed out and recommended an automatic ding.

Ewwwww. That’s just nasty.

You also need to mind your Ps and Qs while dining with potential co-workers. Remember they aren’t your friends, you’re just hoping one day you’ll get to do menial tasks for them. Don’t treat them the same way you’d treat your bestie… cause that could be sexual harassment.

[A] girl violated our sexual harassment policy. Both the other lunch interviewer and I were female. We asked whether she saw anything good on Netflix and she talked for about 20 minutes about a porn industry documentary, at some points quite graphically. She didn’t pick up how I was silent and very uncomfortable the entire time. When we reported the incident, one of our firm’s partners had to call me up afterwards and apologize that I had to go through that, and how our firm doesn’t tolerate violations of our sexual harassment policy. The firm said the girl’s behavior was unacceptable and automatically rejected her.  Red flags also came up from a co-worker of mine, who reported that the candidate had admitted to cheating during a firm interview (pretending she got disconnected and then looking up an answer on her phone).

These candidates looked great on paper, but when it came to actual human interaction they both got a big, giant fail.

This reminds me of a former associate friend who said, fundamentally, they made the decision of whether to recommend a candidate on the “pizza test.” If they could imagine sharing a late night meal (i.e., a pizza) with the candidate in the midst of a deadline, then they got a pass. It wasn’t designed to be a high bar (or one designed to identify potential buddies or romantic partners), but it was about imagining working in difficult situations with the candidate. Should be easy to ace, but a shocking amount would fail with downright bizarre behavior.

So, what’s your tale of woe? Or maybe you were on the interviewer side of someone’s epic meltdown? If you have a funny, mortifying, or otherwise interesting interview story, we’d love it if you shared it with us. Please send it our way [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Interview%20Stories) or by text (646-820-8477). We’ll read all the submissions and share our favorites in these pages. Thanks, and good luck to both the candidates and the interviewers in the current recruiting cycle.

Participants in the program will earn $190K for one year, and may be offered a permanent job.

He's been with the firm for his entire career as an attorney since the 1990s, and he'll continue to maintain his private equity and funds practice during his time serving as the firm's leader, or rather, its ""listener in chief.""

# Am Law 100 Firm Walks Back Its Coronavirus Crisis Salary Cuts
## More good news for associates and staff.

We’re now more than halfway through 2020, and the legal profession has spent just about as long being bogged down by the coronavirus crisis. Thrown into financial upheaval, many Biglaw firms put austerity measures in place to prepare for what would become the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Several months have passed, and some firms are now reversing course on their cuts.

About four months ago, Katten Muchin — a firm that placed 63rd on the latest Am Law 100 ranking — put all of its employees’ [salaries on the chopping block](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-slashes-salaries-furloughs-lawyers-and-staff/?rf=1) while furloughing others. In late June, the firm [made some of those furloughs permanent](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/am-law-100-firms-furloughs-have-turned-into-layoffs/). At the time, there was no end in sight for the spring salary cuts. If you recall, those cuts were up to 20 percent for both business professionals and attorneys making over $100,000. Equity partners who suspended their monthly draws in April and May received a payout in June, but at a 25 percent reduction from previous levels.

Now, employees at Katten are finally receiving some good news on the salary front.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The firm will be doing a partial about face on its salary cuts, reducing them by 50 percent. Now, all attorneys and business professionals who make more than $100,000 will only see their salaries reduced by 10 percent. We’re sure those impacted at the firm must be thrilled (and wondering when their salaries will be fully restored).

Let’s hope more firms are able to roll back COVID-19 austerity measures — and soon.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

Kellyanne Conway is the hardest working woman in the political spin room. Sure, that sometimes means she spews utter [ridiculousness](http://theslot.jezebel.com/trump-campaign-manager-kellyanne-conway-ive-been-alone-1787613699), but what would you do if you were given responsibility for a lumbering, orange troll who wants to be president?

The George Washington Law School-educated, ““[fully-recovered” attorney](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/kellyanne-conway)” and her [Biglaw husband](http://www.wlrk.com/GTConway/), Wachtell Lipton partner [George Conway](http://www.wlrk.com/GTConway/), are the subject of a Saturday Night Live video short, and well, the late-night mainstay has a pretty good idea how crazy Conway’s life must be. Even Kellyanne agrees the sketch has the ring of truth to it.

Chelsy Davy (Photo by Samir Hussein/WireImage)

The law thing was a challenge… But it got to the point that I wanted something that was mine and I also wanted to go home.

—Chelsy Davy, [reflecting](http://www.legalcheek.com/2016/06/chelsy-davy-speaks-for-the-first-time-about-quitting-allen-overy/) on her reasons for leaving Allen & Overy in 2014 and wanting to go back to South Africa. She has since gone on to start her own jewelry line featuring precious stones from Africa. The on-again, off-again paramour of Prince Harry of Wales also noted that getting her economics degree at the University of Cape Town was a lot more challenging than getting her law degree at the University of Leeds.

# The Plan To Reopen Biglaw (And The Rest Of The Legal Profession)
## The state bar wants lawyers to get back to the office quickly.

How the world reopens post COVID-19 is something on everyone’s mind. Most people are struggling to weigh the lack of adequate testing and the lack of vaccine immediately available with the overwhelming sense that lock down just can’t go on for forever. And figuring out exactly how the legal profession will open back up is something currently being worked on.

The New York State Bar Association has taken the stance that law firms should open up even before other non-essential businesses and has created a “Restarting the Economy Working Group” to make recommendations to policymakers on “the safest and most efficient way for law firms to reopen.”

Hank Greenberg, the president of the state bar and a partner at Greenberg Traurig, [told Law.com](https://www.law.com/2020/04/29/how-can-law-firms-safely-reopen-new-york-bar-group-to-make-recommendations/) that getting lawyers back in their offices is a top priority:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“It’s not Hank Greenberg just beating the drum for lawyers,” he said in a Wednesday interview. “The rule of law is dependent on lawyers. We are the footsoldiers of the Constitution. We are utterly vital and essential to society.”

Of course, like lots of white-collar workers, lawyers are, by and large, able to work from home. But Greenberg believes that there is something important about getting the door back open:

“It is absolutely true that we can do a lot of our work remotely … and I think we will continue to do a lot of our work remotely,” he continued. But “from an economic perspective, having the legal profession be able to function, survive the crisis, and flourish is critical. If lawyers can’t work, if lawyers can’t make a living, if lawyers are not in a position to help clients, that is a direct threat to the vibrancy of the rule of law.”

David Schraver, of counsel at Nixon Peabody and a member of the working group, said safety would be paramount as they deal with the different office spaces of different size firms across the state:

“One of the issues is that there are so many different types of law offices across the state,” he said. “There are large firms in multistory buildings that have conference rooms of all different sizes and shapes, and there are solo and small-firm practices across the state that have much different kinds of offices.”

He also noted it is too early to know what recommendations the working group would make.

# Almost A Century In The Making: Herrick, Feinstein Selects Its First Female Executive Chair

Long considered a boys’ club, there have been an increasing number of women who are joining the legal community. There are clear strides — [female law students students outnumber their male cohort](https://www.enjuris.com/students/law-school-women-enrollment-2020/) and there are signs of cracks in the glass ceiling. Knowing that there are people like you in the places you want to be is a powerful force. Aspiring lawyers just gained a new point of reference to show that they can call the shots too. From the American Lawyer:

Executive committee members at Herrick, Feinstein have tapped Belinda Schwartz, chair of the firm’s real estate department, to lead the firm as executive chair.

Schwartz is succeeding Irwin Kishner, who served as executive chair since 2010. Schwartz becomes the first woman to lead the Am Law Second Hundred firm in its 95-year history.

“It’s a good time for others, whether they are women or other people who don’t necessarily see a path up the chain, to really believe that it can be done,” Schwartz said in an interview. “It’s a lot of hard work, a lot of luck, but it can be done. I hope it’s helpful to women and others to realize that they can succeed at the top.”

Here are some of her goals for the firm:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
As executive chair, Schwartz said her priorities are to ensure lawyers at the firm provide “exceptional” services to clients while continuing to grow profits and maintaining a positive firm culture.

With the accolade sheet she has, these read as easy goals to meet. She’s spent the last 25 years advising clients on major financial decisions and has had her hands in some of New York’s largest development projects. Congratulations!

There’s a lot of awful in the world right now. But if you need some relief from scrolling the [Kyiv Independent’s feed](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent) for the latest in the war effort, perhaps this will help. Another Biglaw firm has decided to share the proceeds of their good year with hardworking associates in the form of raises.

Gibson Dunn — with its 1400+ attorneys and $2,160,542,000 in gross revenue in 2020 — has announced their own set of raises. And, as expected, it’s a match of the prevailing scale.

That salary grid is as follows:

Year	Amount
2021	$ 215,000
2020	$ 225,000
2019	$ 250,000
2018	$ 293,500
2017	$ 335,000
2016	$ 360,500
2015	$ 381,000
2014	$ 396,500
You can read the full memo [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/gibson-raises-22/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Okay, okay:  My headline had a little clickbait built in.  (So what else is new here at Above the Law?)

Summer associate jobs do tell you a little bit, but not about the practice of law.  Why not?

I’ve been working at this firm for 15 years.  I’ll continue to work at this firm until I retire.  I’ve got several big cases on my desk.  Those cases have been active for years, and they’ve got years to go before trial.

I just got a memo from our summer associate team.  They’re looking for projects to give to summer associates.

I really don’t want to do this.  If I give a project to a summer associate, then the work product is unlikely to be useful; the person doing the work is the least experienced person in the joint.

Actually, it’s even worse than that.  If I give a project to a permanent associate, then, when I receive back crappy work product, I can just revise the crappy work product into something serviceable and send it to the client.  I might send the final product back to the associate, telling the associate to compare the final product to the associate’s draft and think about the difference.  We call that “training” at this law firm.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But a summer associate is different.  After I receive the crappy work product, I must revise it in a way that permits you to track the revisions.  Then, after making the revisions, I must think about what I did (that’s 15 minutes of wasted time), figure out how to convey those thoughts to a young lawyer without causing the young lawyer to break into tears (that’s another 15 minutes of wasted time), and then sit with the young lawyer providing constructive feedback (which is probably 45 minutes of wasted time).  That’s an hour and a quarter of unbilled time taken out of my life, when I could have been home with the kids.  I need this like a hole in the head.

But we do have to generate projects for summer associates, and I feel a  little bit of institutional loyalty, so I’ll contribute one project that can be done by a summer associate, just to pull my weight.

What does the memo from the summer associate team say?

“Summer associates are at this firm for only a few weeks.  It’s critical that no one lawyer occupy the time of a summer associate for most of a summer.  Summer associates should work with multiple firm lawyers, so that the summer associate’s work is evaluated by many people.  And we should give summer associates a sense of the working styles of many different people.  We therefore ask that any project assigned to summer associates be capable of being completed [in two weeks](//0) or less.”

Two weeks or less?

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
What are they thinking?

I’ve got the [Blaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Side_of_Paradise) case that has been pending for three years and will continue to pend for three more.  What piece of that case can be completed, start to finish, [in two weeks](//1)?

None.

I guess I’ll pull out a small piece of one legal question and ask the summer associate to look at that one disembodied legal issue for two weeks.  That’s nothing like the practice of law, but at least it meets the standard that the committee imposed on me.

I’m such a fool.  I swear I’ll never again work with a summer associate.  Let other partners waste their time with this.

What does the summer associate think?

“Let me pick a project from among those available.  Oh — here’s a research project from a partner who’s a pretty important guy at the firm.  I’ll choose this one, so I can help him out, and I’ll have a person with some clout evaluate my work.”

The summer associate then reads the disembodied legal question, talks to the partner about it for 10 minutes, and undertakes legal research and writing for two weeks.

The summer associate wonders why life at law firms is so dull:  “All the junior folks do is disembodied legal research.”

No.  But that’s all summer associates do, because those are the rules that the firm imposes (for a pretty good reason, actually).

It’s rare for the summer associate to learn about the entirety of a case, or the joy of practicing law, because that requires the partner to sit with the summer person for a reasonably extended time, explaining the nature of the client, the case, the development of the case, and what the future holds.

Ferociously busy partners ain’t gonna waste time doing that.

So being a summer associate tells you something, because you breathe law firm air and meet law firm inhabitants.

But being a summer associate doesn’t tell you very much about life as a lawyer, because there are too many constraints — formal and informal — guaranteeing that interactions with summer associates are artificial.

More than two years after the World Health Organization officially declared a coronavirus pandemic, upheaval in the legal profession continues.

Whether it’s ever-increasing associate salaries, law firms adapting to an (at least partially) remotened world, or legal issues surrounding pandemic-related complexities, lawyers need to stay up to speed on a changing professional landscape.

# Advice From The Lottery Lawyer On What To Do If You Win The Lottery
## The Powerball jackpot is currently at $550 million. You're going to need a lawyer if you win.

I would say having to put your name out there, especially if it’s a large jackpot with the nation paying attention, is a very scary thing. You’re going to get bombarded by financial advisers and friends and family coming out of the woodwork. Remaining anonymous is also difficult, because you have all this newfound wealth, and if you are going to spend what you can, it’s sort of obvious to people. The biggest mistake people make is doing it on their own. All the horror stories you hear is when people do it on their own.

— [Jason Kurland](https://thelotterylawyer.com/about-jason-kurland/) of Rivkin Radler, explaining why [lottery winners need a lawyer](https://www.law.com/2019/03/19/how-a-254m-powerball-ticket-changed-this-mans-life-292-42192/) and why they should try to remain anonymous if that option is available. Kurland first became known as [The Lottery Lawyer](https://thelotterylawyer.com/press-coverage/) after advising the 2011 Connecticut Powerball winner of $254.2 million, and has represented lottery winners of a collective $2.5 billion.
