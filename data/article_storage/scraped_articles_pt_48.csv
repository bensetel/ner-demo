If you’re a Biglaw associate in the fall of 2023, two things are probably true: (i) you’re still hearing rumors of stealth layoffs (yikes!) and hoping you’re not going to be out of a job soon, and (ii) you’re eagerly awaiting news of your bonus, which may be right around the corner.

To kick off our coverage, we’re asking you to take this (always) confidential, (always) brief survey to share your thoughts on the upcoming bonus season. And if you’d like to stay on top of any changes this bonus season, enter your email below to sign up for our free bonus alerts.

And as a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file.

Don’t forget, if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please enter your email address in the box below. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish — including, of course, the first such announcement.

People are leaving because the demands are increasingly brutal. There’s an unbelievable amount of work, especially on the deal side. The few deal lawyers I interact with, they’ve never seen so much flow.

I know someone who got an offer at another firm, told the partner they were working with, and got offered some crazy retention bonus. They stayed on.

I haven’t seen Kirkland change anything. Big Law careers are generally short anyway. It’s that mindset of, ‘It’s OK if you leave because we can just hire more people.’

— a current associate at Kirkland & Ellis, offering their thoughts on the firm’s oftentimes [grueling work expectations](https://www.businessinsider.com/kirkland-ellis-law-firm-lawyer-churn-associates-labor-turnover-legal-2021-11), which have driven a high amount of associate turnover. According to Firm Prospects, the firm lost 323 associates between September 2020 and September 2021, but gained 613 associates at the same time.

# This Biglaw Firm Will No Longer Publish Its Profits Per Equity Partner

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Our goal is create long term value – for our clients, our people and the society in which we operate. [Profits per equity partner] is not a metric which is helpful in this context nor is it useful for a business like ours with a diversified offering of legal and non-legal services.

— [Matt Hotson](https://www.mishcon.com/people/matt-hotson), chief financial officer of Mishcon de Reya, in a [statement](https://www.mishcon.com/news/mishcon-de-reya-revenue-grows-by-10-and-profit-at-93m-in-2022-and-23) made after announcing the firm’s impressive double-digit increase in overall profits and gross revenue. The international firm will [no longer be publishing](https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/practice/mishcon-drops-unhelpful-pep-metric/5116745.article) its profit per equity partner. As noted on the firm’s [website](https://www.mishcon.com/news/mishcon-de-reya-revenue-grows-by-10-and-profit-at-93m-in-2022-and-23), its leaders believe that “PEP has become too narrow, short term and misleading as a metric,” while noting that they think “[o]verall profit and increase in profits are much better indicators of real, rather than short term, business performance.”

# This Biglaw Firm Has The Urge To Merge, But Can't Find A Willing Partner
## Why won't anyone merge with this Am Law 200 firm?

With worries about a potential recession plaguing partners’ minds, law firm merger mania is now in full force, with Biglaw firms combining with competitors and gobbling up boutiques as well. While many firms have had luck in finding merger partners, others are finding nothing but trouble in a would-be paradise.

Take Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, for example. The New York-based firm has lost quite a few partners in recent years, and it made headlines last month after ringing in the new year by [conducting a round of layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/stroock-layoffs/). While Stroock has been in merger talks with quite a few Biglaw firms, it hasn’t been able to find a successful match yet. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/02/03/stroocks-merger-talks-face-pension-and-accounting-system-hurdles/) has the scoop:

[T]he law firm is facing some challenges to a combination, including its pension program for retired partners and its accrual accounting system, according to sources familiar with the matter.

In particular, Stroock has been in discussions with McGuireWoods, Steptoe & Johnson and, most recently, Squire Patton Boggs, according to a source. Representatives for these firms did not return messages seeking comment on merger talks.

In a statement, the law firm declined to comment on specifics of any merger talks but acknowledged that “operations systems” and pension obligations may be points to address in “sizeable law firm mergers.”

While most firms use cash basis accounting, Stroock’s accrual system means that the firm considers revenue from work in progress and accounts receivable before clients have actually paid. While most firms follow a standard calendar fiscal year, ending their year in December, Stroock’s fiscal year ends in September. Stroock also has a pension obligation to its retirees that’s tied to its revenue, which at one point was about $40 million annually. According to Am Law, the firm has contacted its retirees to ask them to consider a reduction in benefits while merger talks are progressing.

“We are always working to strengthen our business in line with our long-term strategy to grow independently and fairly evaluate new opportunities as they arise. We do not comment on rumors or speculation,” Stroock told Am Law in a statement. “It is common knowledge that sizable law firm mergers are typically complex, and while operational systems, compensation systems and pension obligations of the parties involved rarely dovetail perfectly, many still find a way to close.”

Will Stroock’s accounting and pension issues be enough to kill a merger deal?

“Most firms are not excited about adopting an accrual base system,” [Brad Hildebrandt, a veteran consultant of law firm mergers] said. “It creates new income and tax issues for them, and those are two significant issues. Are they solvable? Yes, but it takes a good understanding of whatever direction the firm [being acquired] is heading. If it is a positive one, there can be a compromise.” …

What was a deal killer, said Hildebrandt, was a “lack of flexibility.” The question is how flexible Stroock and its merger partners are going to be.

# Above The Law’s 14th Annual Holiday Card Contest
## We look forward to your submissions. Thank you, and happy holidays!

It’s the most wonderful time of the year (all things considered). With Biglaw bonuses about to begin, the holiday season will soon be off to a great start. Now that we’re officially living in a “post”-COVID world, law firm holiday parties are likely to be held in real life, but all of the celebrations and hefty paychecks pale in comparison to what’s about to get underway: Above the Law’s fourteenth annual holiday card contest. We’ve already received several emails asking about when this year’s contest would start. The answer: It starts today.

We are a legal website, so of course there are some rules to follow:

1. Because we are committed to the environment here at [Breaking Media](http://breakingmedia.com/), we will consider ONLY E-CARDS. Please don’t send us paper holiday cards via snail mail this year — the Above the Law editorial team hasn’t been in our physical office much since March 2020.

2. To submit an e-card, please email either a link to the card or the card itself (as an attachment) — but note that WE PREFER LINKS, if available — to [tips@abovethelaw.com](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Holiday%20Card%20Contest), subject line: “Holiday Card Contest.” The subject line is very important because it’s how we will comb through our inbox to collect the entries when picking finalists. If you don’t use the correct subject line, expect a lump of coal in your stocking.

3. Please limit submissions to holiday / Christmas cards that you view as WORTHY CONTENDERS. We’re looking for cards that are unusually clever, funny, or cool; we’re not interested in cards that are safe or boring (e.g., a beautiful winter landscape, a “Happy Holidays 2022,” and the law firm name). We’re seeking cards with some attitude, with that extra je ne sais quoi. If you send us a banal card, don’t be surprised if we make fun of it.

4. In your email, please include a BRIEF EXPLANATION of why this card is compelling — an explanation that we MIGHT QUOTE FROM if your nominee makes the finals (if you want to be anonymous, let us know). If you can’t offer an explanation, please rethink whether the card is a worthy contender (see rule #3, supra).

5. The deadline for submissions is three weeks from today: THURSDAY, DECEMBER 8, at 11:59 p.m. (New York time). No exceptions. If you’re reading this post after the deadline, then you don’t read Above the Law frequently enough.

# Magic Circle Gives Special Bonuses, But How Much Is Anyone's Guess
## At least they're getting something for their hard work this year.

Bonus seasons continues to make its way through Biglaw. And, generally speaking, that’s good news for the associates on the ground busy billing their butts off during a pandemic. And though the[ prevailing market rate has been set](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/biglaw-bonus-chart-2020/), we’re still waiting to see exactly who will match.

Well, the wait is over for associates at Linklaters. The firm announced they’ll be paying market year-end bonuses. That’s good news, but as Biglaw followers know, in 2020, that’s not the end of the discussion. Special bonuses are also a thing this year, generally ranging from $7,500 to $40,000 depending on class year as an extra special thank you for working through a challenging year. And Linklaters says there’ll be special bonuses starting at 1,700 billable hours, but there’s no clear chart delineating exactly how much you need to bill to get full market special bonuses.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
And reaction from tipsters has called out this lack of transparency:

After taking two weeks longer than any of their “magic circle” peers, they didn’t even match. They added a scaled hours requirement that no one can make sense of.  From talking to people it sounds like you needed to hit 1,900 to even get a quarter of the special bonus, so who knows what anyone billing 1,700 – 1,900 got. And 2,000 gets you half if you’re lucky.
Instead of thanking people for working during a pandemic, it’s a late Christmas slap in the face. No one is happy and it shows just how littleLinklaters thinks of its US practice

Of course any bonuses are better than no bonuses, but it isn’t surprising associates wish there were a bit more clarity.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Disgraced Former Biglaw Chair Asks For No Jail Time In College Admissions Scandal
## The government is seeking eight months of jail time.

Gordan Caplan

Gordon Caplan has fallen quite far from being the co-chair of an Am Law 50 firm. The [former Willkie Farr](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/willkie-farr-ditches-gordon-caplan-nabbed-in-varsity-blues-scandal/) partner [got caught in the “Varsity Blues”](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/willkie-farr-chair-caught-in-college-admissions-scandal/) college admissions scandal, eventually [pleading guilty](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/suspended-co-chair-of-biglaw-firm-charged-in-college-admissions-scandal-will-plead-guilty/) to paying $75,000 to “college coaches” turned government cooperating witnesses in a scheme to have a professional alter his daughter’s answers on the ACT in order to get her a higher score.

Now payment is due on that guilty verdict, and both the government and the defense have submitted sentencing memos to the court arguing what they each think the appropriate punishment should be. As you might imagine, their recommended sentences are wildly different. As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/09/26/ex-willkie-co-chair-gordon-caplan-asks-judge-to-spare-him-prison/) Law.com, Caplan’s defense team is arguing he should avoid jail time, saying he’s already suffered consequences as a result of his actions:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But Caplan argued his admission of guilt doesn’t tell the full story. He said he was caught up “in a toxic mix of tense family issues at home, aggressive recruiting and college ‘advisory’ pitches” that “warped” his judgment and “allowed himself to fall prey to his own ego.” Public humiliation and the other consequences Caplan said he and his family suffered were enough, he argued.

“He screwed up. He committed a crime. He has owned it. He was a highly skilled lawyer who should have known better,” Caplan’s defense team at Ropes & Gray and Smith Villazor wrote. “Yet, the Gordon Caplan who was on the phone with Rick Singer was a father looking at an easier path forward; his role as a corporate lawyer was peripheral to this conduct.”

The government disagrees with that assessment, they say Caplan should be sentenced to eight months in jail with a $40,000 fine and a year of supervised release:

“Like many con-men, Caplan committed his crime from behind a façade of feigned integrity,” the government wrote. “Caplan boasted on his law firm’s website and in interviews with news organizations about his pro bono work for immigrant children even as he secretly conspired to bribe an ACT administrator and pay a corrupt test-taker to cheat on his own child’s college entrance exams.

“Jail is the only appropriate sentence for a leader of the bar who displays such callous disregard for honesty and the rule of law,” prosecutors added.

Jail sentences for others who have pleaded guilty in the college admissions scandal have varied from 14 days on the low end (Felicity Huffman) to four months (Stephen Semprevivo and Devin Sloane). Caplan will be sentenced on October 3rd.

This story is filled with rumors, so take it with a grain of salt, but [New York Magazine is reporting](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/07/murdochs-have-decided-to-remove-roger-ailes.html) that Roger Ailes’s reign as the head of Fox News is coming to an end. The Biglaw behemoth, Paul, Weiss, has been tasked with investigating the allegations behind Gretchen Carlson’s sexual harassment lawsuit. And according to sources, Rupert Murdoch and sons Lachlan and James, who are the co-chairmen and CEO, respectively, of 21st Century Fox, having been briefed on the results of the investigation so far, are in agreement that Ailes should go. The only question is when:

After reviewing the initial findings of the probe, James Murdoch is said to be arguing that Ailes should be presented with a choice this week to resign or face being fired. Lachlan is more aligned with their father, who thinks that no action should be taken until after the GOP convention this week. Another source confirms that all three are in agreement that Ailes needs to go.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
The scope of the investigation has broadened from just looking into Carlson’s allegations, according to New York Mag sources, to probing Ailes’s overall management style:

The lawyers are seeking to interview former female employees of Fox News in addition to current staff. They are also looking into the appropriateness of Ailes’s pressuring employees to speak out on his behalf, against his accusers. For instance, they are focusing on an [op-ed](http://www.businessinsider.com/neil-cavuto-roger-ailes-fox-news-2016-7) written by Fox Business anchor Neil Cavuto in which Cavuto called the allegations against Ailes “sick.” As Cavuto is a manager at Fox News (his title is senior VP and managing editor), his comments could be seen as part of a corporate attempt to silence women who would speak out.

Ailes supporters allegedly describe the mood in the office as “bleak.”

Paul, Weiss may have accomplished what MSNBC has only dreamt about.

There is limited good news at K&L Gates. Associates that bill a bunch of hours — well over the firm’s typical bonus hour requirement — will get special bonuses in line with the market rates sweeping the industry. But, woo boy, the firm’s extensive memo outlining the bonus is a real read.

Take a look at this gem, where the firm tells associates they need to care about more than just what other firms are paying:

We believe the Associate experience at K&L Gates is and should be an outstanding and rewarding career path for reasons going well beyond hours worked and what other firms are undertaking and expecting in the markets.

But really, knowing your worth and what other firms are willing to pay for your skills *is* important. The lateral market is hot right now, and if a firm isn’t paying you what you deserve, you can leave. Perhaps it’s unsurprising that a firm putting conditions on market pay is trying to undermine the importance of market pay.

The firm’s email goes on to say they want credit for not firing people:

We are a firm in which talented, hard-working and contributing Associates can build a rewarding career in a positive and engaging environment; we are not a firm in which such Associates look over their  shoulder for pink slips when they don’t hit certain billable hour targets in a limited given period.

So yeah, even though the firm is technically matching market bonuses, it is only for associates that bill a whopping 2080 hours — significantly more than the 1950 required for year-end bonuses.



Tipsters expressed frustration with the firm’s stance:

To many of us feel that associates have been asked to share in the losses but not the profits, to work harder simply to recoup money we earned in 2020 but haven’t been repaid, and that the email from leadership (especially the first paragraph) is somewhat tone-deaf.

Oh yeah, we should also mention that though the firm cut salaries for a period during 2020, they have not done make whole payments (unlike a large chunk of Biglaw).

# Associate Bonus Watch: Happy, Texas

We haven’t heard from many Texas-centric firms yet in this 2016 bonus season. Sure, we got bonus news from [Akin Gump](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/associate-bonus-watch-achin-for-more-cash-this-firm-beat-market-for-some/), but one could argue that the firm has transcended its Texas roots to become a national or even global firm. We also heard from [Susman Godfrey](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/associate-bonus-and-new-partner-watch-susman-godfrey/), but it’s a bit sui generis, and its (very generous) bonuses aren’t likely to affect the Texas market.

So the latest news is notable because it very well could affect what other Texas shops do. [Haynes and Boone](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/haynes-and-boone/) bonuses came out last night.

HayBoo bonuses are individualized and therefore harder to report on (call this the [Kirkland & Ellis challenge](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/update-bunches-of-kirkland-and-ellis-above-market-bonus-news/)), but most people we’ve heard from seem happy:

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
- “My bonus was generous and higher than expected given the mid-year salary increase. Others I’ve spoken with are also very pleased. A lot of us here are feeling the HayBoo spirit heading into the holidays.”
- “People seem really happy. No one knows the scale, though, because they’re individualized and confidential. But I do know that even those who took paternity and maternity leave got something (at least those that I know of did), how much I’m unsure of.”
- “I’m a [senior associate] on the ‘high’ scale…. The excess over the ‘low’ scale is supposed to be our bonus, but I did receive a slight one. I’m very happy with it.”
Here’s one tipster’s more detailed dive:

I’ve talked to several attorneys, all with strong hours (2200+), whol received full market-level bonuses in Texas. Haynes and Boone deserves praise because there was a [fear that we might have gotten] screwed this year due to the raises.

I’m not sure how individuals with low hours fared, but I’d imagine that their bonuses will be significantly lower than market level and, if under 2000 billable hours, they likely didn’t get a bonus at all.

As for myself, couldn’t be happier. I hope the firm continues to reward its associates who put in significant contributions.

The reference to folks with lower hours is the caveat to this good news (just as it was [last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-a-new-compensation-leader-in-texas/)). As noted, most of our HayBoo sources are happy, but we did note some dissent. For example:

People got memos yesterday. If there was a second attachment, then you got a bonus. People who had low hours are upset obviously — and are doubly afraid they won’t move up in class re: base salary next year.

If you have information to share on that front, you know [where to reach us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Haynes%20and%20Boone). We might update this post depending on what we receive.

UPDATE (4:35 p.m.): Here’s a good summary of sentiment, plus info on associates with lower hours:

HB sends out individual bonus memos, so it’s hard to make any blanket statements, but the prevailing sentiment in the Dallas office is that bonuses exceeded expectations, with high billers (2100-2200?) receiving market or near-market bonuses (similar to last year). Most of the associates know that we enjoy a pretty good work-life balance compared to most big law firms, but nice bonuses make it just that much better to be here.

I also saw in your post that there was speculation that under 2000 hours would likely not receive a bonus. I can say that that I have several colleagues who came in under 2000 hours and received a bonus, though below market for their class.

We look forward to covering bonus news from other Texas players, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. No need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks for your help.

As any Vanderbilt Law student who has ventured into my office, or in recent years logged onto a Zoom with me, can attest, I often share stories from my own time in law school, clerking, in Biglaw, or in the nonprofit world when dispensing career advice. To paraphrase the great [Toby Zeigler](http://westwing.bewarne.com/second/23gunmen.html), I utilize personal stories if only because it’s the easiest thing to remember. A favorite of these excerpts from my own life deals with an issue that has dominated [Above the Law](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-raise-tracker-2022/) in recent months, Biglaw salary increases.

In Spring 2007, as a 2L at NYU Law, I took Criminal Procedure with the [late](https://usali.org/institute-news/in-memoriam-s-andrew-schaffer), great S. Andrew Schaffer. Even though it was 15 years ago, a period of elapsed time that pains me to write, I can clearly remember sitting two-thirds of the way in the back of the class, partially hidden from Schaffer’s view behind what I recall as nearly the entirety of the [New York University Law Review](https://www.nyulawreview.org/) Executive Board.  While everyone in the class was doing their best to focus on the intricacies of the Exclusionary Rule or the point at which a stop becomes an arrest, there was something else vying for our attention.  In January 2007, Simpson Thatcher had been the first to [raise first-year associate salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/01/breaking-simpson-thacher-raises-associate-base-salaries/) to $160,000 from $145,000. As is the case with any Biglaw salary increase, the race was then soon on to see which firms would match this salary jump and when. From my perch in Schaffer’s class, I can still remember looking out at a sea of laptops, and literally every single one, including my own, had a browser open to Above the Law. My classmates were repeatedly refreshing the site to see when the firm they were either going to work for after graduation or for the upcoming summer would raise salaries.

While the technology has changed — fewer students have flip phones, even though they are making a [bizarre](https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-flip3-5g/) re-emergence — a decade and a half later, Above the Law is still the go-to-source for the latest news in law firm salaries, a topic that has once again captured the attention of law students and lawyers alike in 2022.  Between firms raising salaries, only to be met by other firms re-raising, and still other firms going over the top, it is as if an extremely aggressive game of no-limit Texas Hold ‘Em has broken out.

In fact, the only thing hotter than law firm salaries over the past month has been Kansas’s Remy Martin.



As a general matter, I think this significant increase in law firm salaries is welcome news. As my twice-daily emails from The American Lawyer have, in recent weeks, been filled with story after story highlighting the record profits at firms [up](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/03/28/at-paul-hastings-revenue-and-pep-jumped-20-in-banner-year/) and [down](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/03/31/weil-rides-balance-to-double-digit-revenue-net-income-growth-in-2021/) the Am Law 100, no one can argue with a straight face that these raises are a financial strain for Biglaw. And whether it is my political ideology coming to the fore or that I missed my true calling as a labor lawyer, I always like to see workers extract more value from management. This is the case even if the workers are already well compensated, see, e.g., the recent baseball lockout in which I was 100% in favor of the millionaire players ceding as little ground as possible to the billionaire owners. In the words of the great 21st-century philosopher, [Jalen Rose](https://twitter.com/JalenRose), “there’s rich, and then there’s wealthy.” The players are rich while the owners are wealthy.

Even though I view these salary increases as welcome news, that does not mean they are free of any downsides. Whether you are already in Biglaw, counting your newfound stacks, or a law student eagerly waiting to see when your future firm will call the salary raise, here are some potential pitfalls that could arise.

First, as with any other business, or really any other endeavor, large law firms are not going to give away something, in this case, more money to their attorneys, for nothing. The glittering offices that you see throughout Biglaw were not built because the firms willingly parted with  their money, even if they are losing substantial sums as those offices sit vacant due to COVID-19. In exchange for greater pay, law firms are going to expect their associates to produce more. This means more billable hours. Whether explicitly stated to attorneys or made clear through some indirect means, the expectation of billing more to generate more revenue for the firm is very real. The notoriously long hours that Biglaw associates put in just got a bit longer.

What about those attorneys who cannot increase their workload? That leads us to the second point, expect law firms handing out more money in salaries to have a shorter leash with underperforming associates. Anyone who has spent even a relatively short amount of time in the legal recruiting space knows that Biglaw firms do not like to fire attorneys. It can be a messy process and news of the termination(s) can often end up in the digital pages of this august publication. In an industry where it can be difficult to distinguish between varying law firms, a reputation for letting go of attorneys can be a real turnoff for law students, which then makes it difficult for firms to replenish their associate ranks with new law school graduates. While law firms might not like having to fire attorneys, these salary raises could very well make it a requirement. It is one thing for an employer to carry dead weight, in the form of underperforming/underbilling attorneys, when they are making $50,000, but when the salaries reach nearly a quarter of a million dollars a year, the dead weight can feel more like an albatross. In years past, underperforming attorneys in Biglaw would have a chance to address and rectify their slow billing pace or outright mistakes. Today, that might be a luxury that is no longer deemed affordable.

Lastly, it is not just current lawyers who might feel negative repercussions from the current raise frenzy. Biglaw summer associates might not make the entirety of the $215,000 yearly salary over the course of the summer — though when that first paycheck hits your bank account, it can feel like you might get pretty close — but these recent raises mean their salaries will increase as well. For as little value as a first-year associate brings to the firm — that’s not an indictment on a particular first-year associate, but rather a recognition that junior associates do not typically generate profits for the firm until a couple of years into their practice — summer associates bring even less. But if law firms are hesitant to fire associates, they are far more hesitant to not extend a post-graduation offer to a summer associate. That 100% summer offer rate is a cherished figure in Biglaw recruiting offices around the country. So how can firms save a bit as summer salaries become more expensive? By shrinking the size of the summer class.  While such a reduction is not likely to impact the current board of the NYU Law Review, it can have a very real impact on more marginal Biglaw candidates. This was seen during the dropoff in Biglaw summer opportunities for the current 3L class across the country due to COVID-19. What might have seemed like a one-year blip, could turn into a very real and persistent pattern.

On a macro level, I will always cheer when Biglaw salaries go up. But to once again paraphrase, this time from possibly the greatest [uncredited hook](https://genius.com/12660694) in the history of hip-hop, it’s like the more money that Biglaw attorneys accrue from the recent spate of raises, the more problems they could see.

# COVID Appreciation Bonuses For The Hardest Workers
## Cash is still the best way to say thanks!

With associate special bonuses tearing through Biglaw, it’s easy to think the firm’s entire focus is on them. But as an increasing number of Biglaw firms are showing — it takes more than just associates to make legal magic happen, and saying thank you to *everyone* is on the to-do list.

[Clifford Chance and Herbert Smith Freehills previously announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/two-elite-biglaw-firms-handing-out-new-covid-bonuses-to-hardworking-staff/?rf=1) staff COVID bonuses, but now more firms are getting in on the action. These are the bonus wars we really like to see.

As [reported by](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/linklaters-and-addleshaw-goddard-latest-award-all-staff-covid-bonuses) Roll on Friday, Linklaters is giving staff a 5 percent bonus, which is the same bonus standard Clifford Chance and Herbert Smith used. Another firm, Addleshaw Goddard, is taking a slightly different approach. They’re paying out £1,500 (or equivalent outside of the UK) to all staff. Both firms have said these COVID appreciation bonuses are in addition to any usual performance/salary reviews or year-end bonuses.

Kudos! Let’s hope even more firms decide to share the largesse with staffers!

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

A little more than one year ago, Cravath, Swaine & Moore [raised associate salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/?rf=1) to the $180K scale, launching the [Great Associate Pay Raise of 2016](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2016-salary-increase/). With the added insight that comes from the passage of time, what can we say about the big pay hike’s consequences for Biglaw?

In a very interesting, extensive [article](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202793477356/Hit-or-Miss-The-Associate-Salary-Hike-One-Year-Later?mcode=1202617075486&curindex=0&curpage=ALL) over at the American Lawyer, Katelyn Polantz explores that question. I recommend that you read her article in its entirety. To whet your appetite, here are some selected statistics from her piece.

The move to the $180K scale was the first Biglaw pay raise since Simpson Thacher’s adoption of the $160K scale in January 2007. Taking inflation into account, how much was $160K in 2007 worth in 2017 dollars?

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
A $160,000 paycheck in 2008 was worth $184,000 in 2017 dollars, according to the Consumer Price Index’s inflation data.

How many firms followed Cravath’s move, in whole or in part?

By the end of June, 101 firms had announced a match to the $180,000 starting salary, according to a real-time tally of announcements by the blog Above the Law. Some firms did not increase their pay for older associates quite as high as the Cravath rates, though. Other firms only raised in certain cities, or made increases that did not reach the $180,000 level for first-years. Meanwhile, a few firms moved above $180,000. In the months that followed, another two dozen or so large firms announced increased associate salaries.

What effect could the pay raise have had on summer associate hiring for 2017?

[T]he American Lawyer’s 2017 summer associates survey shows summer hiring down 2 percent year over year. The projected average class size for incoming associates dropped to 38.6 new lawyers from 40.4 the previous year.

How much did this pay raise cost various firms?

At Dechert, the firm’s 563 associates cost an extra $5 million or $6 million last year, because of the Cravath-scale increase, Dechert chief executive officer Henry Nassau told American Lawyer earlier this year. (The firm did not respond to a request for comment for this article.) The firm’s profit margin dropped from 46 percent to 44 percent, according to Am Law 200 data.

At Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, the firm swallowed a $10 million added expense because of the associate salary increase, Wilmer’s co-managing partner Robert Novick says. Wilmer’s profit margin was unchanged at 44 percent, Am Law 200 data shows.

Did some of the pay raise get passed along to clients in the form of rate increases?

Of 50 firms that provided ALM billing rate information this year and that pay $180,000 for first-year associates, 35 firms said they increased billing rates by more than 3 percent in 2016. Four out of five firms in the same group say they plan to increase billing rates by more than 3 percent this year.

But remember, as Polantz notes, that “incremental price increases are part of doing business.” During the decade or so that associate salaries remained flat, Biglaw firms were consistently raising rates by a few percentage points each year.

From the prior starting salary of $160,000, the move to $180,000 represented a 12.5 percent increase. But no Biglaw firm we know of could (or did) raise its billing rates by 12.5 percent in a single year. Instead, firms raised rates by low-single-digit percentages — which they pretty much do on an annual basis. So even if clients indirectly paid for some of this pay raise, they certainly did pay for all of it.

Should we feel bad for Biglaw partners having to shoulder the cost of this pay hike?

“There are so many things we consult on from an economic standpoint. This isn’t one of them,” Tom Clay, a law firm consultant with Altman Weil, said this spring. “This will not be an economic event.” Firms aren’t “wasting away,” he added. Partners “still have their homes [at] the ocean and [in] the mountains.”

Indeed. Let’s close with this statistic, from the 2017 Am Law 100 rankings:

Average profits per partner in 2016: $1.66 million, up by 3 percent (compared to 4 percent last year).

Austerity measures continue to be rolled out at law firms across America, and this afternoon, we have news from one of the very first firms to be affected by the coronavirus crisis. In mid-March, Davis Wright Tremaine closed several of its offices after an [employee who displayed COVID-19 symptoms passed away](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firm-closes-offices-after-employee-dies-enacts-work-from-home-policy/). Although that employee ultimately tested negative for the virus posthumously, the firm asked all attorneys and staff to work remotely across all offices for the foreseeable future. Now, DWT is doing what it can to make sure the firm remains open after all is said and done.

Davis Wright currently finds itself in 92nd place in the Am Law 100 rankings, with $414,144,000 in gross revenue in 2019, and the firm is trying to keep its finances on the up and up by offering up a veritable smorgasbord of cost-cutting efforts, from reduced partner distributions to salary cuts for associates and staff to furloughs and reduced schedules for staff. Here’s what’s going on:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
- Partner Distributions: Quarterly equity partner distributions will be reduced, with the expectation that equity partner compensation for the year will be at least 25% below budget.
- Salary Reductions: Effective with the pay period beginning May 2 through December 31, 2020
15% for contract partners
12% for associates, counsel and of counsel
15% for C-level executives
6-10% for staff based on salary level, with no reduction below $60,000
- Furloughs: Effective May 2, we will temporarily furlough approximately 8% of our staff to adjust for workflows that have been disrupted or diminished due to reduced demand. Those furloughed will be eligible for the expanded federal unemployment benefits. The firm will also continue to provide them with medical, dental, and vision benefits, as well as access to our new Employee Disaster Relief Program, described below. We anticipate they will return to work as soon as we can resume more normal operations. We’re not planning to furlough any attorneys at this time. We’ll continue to share resources across practice groups to take advantage of available bandwidth and support the areas that remain very busy.
- Reduced Schedules: In addition, a small number of staff members will move to reduced schedules to account for decreased workflow. Most of them (based on their state) will also be eligible for unemployment benefits and receive continued benefits. We anticipate that they’ll return to their standard schedules when workflow returns to normal for their functions.
On the bright side, DWT has established an Employee Disaster Relief Program, funded by partners, to provide monetary relief to staff members who suffer financial hardship as a result of the pandemic. The program is designed to provide assistance with various household expenses. In addition, the firm has created a vacation donation bank for staff to donate unused time for others who don’t have the leave needed to help with medical emergencies or the time needed to care for family.

Here’s a statement from Jeff Gray, Managing Partner of Davis Wright Tremaine:

We came into this crisis after a record year in 2019 and a strong first quarter, even as we adjusted to office closures and a changing business environment. We have continued to build our firm for the future, including bringing in several new laterals in the first quarter to service clients in our key industries. Though demand remains high in some practice areas, it’s decreasing in several others, and we’re seeing a significant slowdown in collections. We’ve delayed actions that affect jobs and paychecks for as long as we could. But, like many of our peers, we now must take additional steps to protect the firm, while continuing to provide the highest level of client service and ensure we emerge in the strongest possible position.

Our approach addresses business necessity in a manner consistent with our core values. We’re sharing the sacrifice across the firm and protecting jobs as best we can. We’re asking more of those who make more, with the hope that we will not need to take additional action. We must make sacrifices together, but we will also share in our success. If we end the year better than we currently expect, which we are working very hard to do, we will share that financial success across all levels of the firm.

# Why Are Women Leaving The Legal Profession In Droves?
## In addition to leaving law firms during their child-rearing years, women are now leaving in their 40s and 50s.

You’ve already had your children, you’ve come back from maternity leave, and at that point, you have all this experience and expertise, why would you leave then?

We’re not suggesting everybody needs to work till 65 or 70 in law. But if women are leaving because they’re just tired of having fought for all these years and still not being treated how they perceive to be fairly and equally with men, that’s a problem we need to address.

— American Bar Association president [Hilarie Bass](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/professionals/b/bass-hilarie), who also serves as co-president of Greenberg Traurig, commenting on the fact that according to recent studies, women have been [leaving their law firms in their 40s and 50s](http://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2017/11/08/aba-summit-examines-why-seasoned-women-are-leaving-the-law/), leaving the profession without some of its most experienced attorneys. Per the ABA, women over 50 now make up only 27 percent of lawyers at firms. The [ABA’s Achieving Long-Term Careers for Women in Law initiative](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/leadership/office_of_the_president/advisorycouncil.html) seeks to find an answer to the question of why these women are leaving, and hopes to provide specific recommendations to end the problem.

# The Second Chair Compromise
## An expert way to get your CEO to sign off on hiring a Biglaw firm as outside counsel.

As an in-house counsel, it is natural for me to give my Biglaw colleagues a hard time.

From your overpriced suits to the overpadded client invoices, you just sometimes make it easy on yourselves. But at the end of the day, even though it may pain me to admit it, I understand and appreciate your value.

I am understaffed, under-resourced, under stress, and just about any other “under-” you can think of, and I will often welcome the extra set of hands from the outside with open arms. But my CEO often does not share my same enthusiasm.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Even though he is well aware we are a small and strapped in-house team, he is often convinced we can take on any opposing counsel out there without the outside help. For one, he does not see the need to pay for more attorneys when he already has a team of them on his payroll — a fair, but misguided point. And second, he frankly trusts my team and I more than a group of strangers to handle matters of import to our organization. This point is a little harder to argue.

As in-house counsel, my team and I have built a natural rapport with our CEO and members of his team. We have earned their trust over many years of work and a record of success. When something major is on the line, it is natural for him to want familiar faces in the room.

But as the under-resourced in-house team that we are, I often find myself pushing for outside counsel assistance to ensure our organization is adequately represented. Which leads to me to a little technique I have devised I like to call the Second Chair Compromise.

The Second Chair Compromise is as simple as its name suggests. In lieu of asking the CEO to sign-off on handing the entire case to outside counsel, I instead convince the CEO that my team will remain primary on the case, but that we could use some outside experts to help with paperwork or to answer specific legal questions my team may not have the time to research.

I further assure him that if the present case ever makes its way to trial, it will be one of his attorneys making the arguments in court while our outside help merely sits at the table ready to offer assistance, if needed.

Hence, the name Second Chair Compromise.

This compromise is admittedly a bit more work on my team and I. Sometimes handing off a case, out of sight and out of mind, is a relief.

Ever wake up in a panic after sleeping through an alarm only to be met with that feeling of relief when you realize it’s Saturday? Yeah, handing off a case is kind of like that.

Haven’t thought about the Peterson case in awhile? Who cares, outside counsel is monitoring it and has your back.

The compromise at least requires that you show up and stay engaged. But given the time constraints and pressures of handling a case solo, it still can provide a tremendous amount of relief while ensuring your case has the resources it needs to prevail.

Plus it has the added benefit of keeping you in the good graces of your CEO who appreciates you staying on top of the case.

So to my Biglaw colleagues ever in search of new business, keep an open mind to the Second Chair Compromise. In fact, maybe even start to market it as your own idea, albeit with a slight reduction in your standard billable hour.

Yes, while you may have wanted to own the case outright, do you think your managing partner will really care who makes the closing argument so long as your newfound source of checks keep coming in?

# Partner Allegedly Steals Millions From Biglaw Firms To Lead Luxurious Lifestyle
## If these allegations are true, perhaps partners aren't being paid enough?

Partners are often the people associates love to hate. Bad Biglaw hours? Blame the partners. Bad Biglaw culture? Blame the partners. Bad Biglaw bonuses? Blame the partners. All of this hatred, undue or otherwise, is why people absolutely revel in the schadenfreude of a Biglaw partner in trouble with the law.

Take a look at this [juicy lede](http://www.northjersey.com/news/feds-attorney-from-englewood-cliffs-husband-stole-millions-from-two-nyc-law-firms-1.1174367) and tell us you didn’t feel a small amount of joy knowing this Biglaw partner is getting a lump of coal in her stocking from the feds:

A prominent antitrust attorney and her husband, who is accused of being the head of a New Jersey drug trafficking ring in a separate federal case, were arrested early Monday at their Englewood Cliffs home for allegedly stealing millions of dollars from two New York City law firms where she had been a partner, federal authorities said.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Believe it or not, the attorney in question in this crime drama was not a castmember of the Real Housewives of New Jersey. Who is this alleged femme fatale?

Meet [Keila D. Ravelo](http://www.avvo.com/attorneys/10019-ny-keila-ravelo-913902.html). She’s a graduate of Columbia University Law School who went on work at Clifford Chance before becoming a partner at Hunton & Williams, and later a partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher. She then married and lived happily ever after… thanks to her alleged multimillion-dollar crime spree.

The government accuses Ravelo and her husband, Melvin Feliz, of creating dummy companies and then funneling millions of dollars from both of her former firms — more than $5.75 million, to be exact — to those companies for “legal consulting fees” on work that was never done. According to the [Bergen Record](http://www.northjersey.com/news/feds-attorney-from-englewood-cliffs-husband-stole-millions-from-two-nyc-law-firms-1.1174367), Ravelo reportedly used that money to fund a lavish lifestyle for herself and her husband.

Speaking of Ravelo’s husband, it seems that he’s got a host of his own legal problems. Earlier this year, he accumulated various drug charges after being named as the alleged leader of a drug trafficking ring where he reportedly sought to transport almost 50 pounds of cocaine from California to New Jersey. Hmm, the couple that allegedly commits crime together does time together?

As for Ravelo’s alleged misdeeds, in the latest Am Law 100 rankings, Willkie Farr’s average profits per partner [$2.235 million](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1397565990976#). Apparently that’s just not enough these days to sate partners who are starving for luxurious items, like paintings worth $125,000 and Miami condos with $325,000 of equity (both used as part of Ravelo’s security to post bond; she also handed over a $200K retirement fund).

Attention Biglaw: you know your partners clearly aren’t being given high enough draws if they’re allegedly forced to lead lives of crime.

At least she had nice taste, according to this [2013 Bergen.com](http://www.bergen.com/fashion/featured/personal-style-the-modern-and-classic-style-of-keila-ravelo-1.765482) fashion fluff piece:

“The Birkin is a classic,” she says. “Here and there I like to add a little edge or pop of color with an unexpected accessory.”

Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, Manolo Blahnik and Christian Louboutin also top her favorite accessory brands.

In October 2014, Ravelo was named as a [“Woman Worth Watching”](http://www.womenworthwatching.com/keila-ravelo/) by the Diversity Journal for her work with Willkie Farr. In the magazine write-up, she noted:

You learn very quickly that there isn’t necessarily just one path for success, and that it’s up to you to figure out what will make you happy and fulfilled.

It’s too bad that what allegedly made Ravelo “happy and fulfilled” was embezzling money from her firm. She now faces up to 20 years in prison on wire fraud charges.

Per the [New Jersey Law Journal](http://www.njlawjournal.com/id=1202713188764/Former-BigLaw-Partner-Charged-in-NJ-with-Bilking-NY-Firms?slreturn=20141123103530), Hunton & Williams and Willkie are “cooperating fully” with law enforcement, while Ravelo’s attorney, Aidan O’Connor of Pashman Stein in Hackensack, New Jersey, says the complaint against his client is “weak.”

How “weak” could the government’s complaint against Keila Ravelo be? We’ll allow our readers to be the judge. It’s available in full on the next page.

# Why Was Sidley Working With A Con Artist?
## Sidley's client is in jail, and they're being sued for what he did.

We touched on this in [Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/morning-docket-02-15-17/), but it bears some further exploration. Because top-flight Biglaw firms usually aren’t named in fraud complaints for allegedly aiding and abetting a now-imprisoned con artist.

And yet here we are.

[The complaint](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/why-was-sidley-working-with-a-con-artist/2/), filed in October, names Sidley Austin and partner [Edward McNicholas](http://www.sidley.com/people/mcnicholas_edward), alleging that they assisted one Joseph Garcia in securing millions in investments from a woman named Carrie Birkel. Birkel is looking to recover $1.5 million from the lawyers. Birkel claims that she had millions to invest after she got her $10 million divorce settlement — a divorce precipitated by Garcia providing her, unsolicited, with compromising photos of her husband, before introducing her to McNicholas, who vetted divorce lawyers for her on a $25,000 retainer.

As the complaint states:

Birkel’s claims arise out of a truly bizarre set of circumstances that would seem more appropriate for an episode of “Law and Order” than in reality.

Indeed.

Garcia, who is serving a 37-month sentence for similar activity, is [a curious character by all accounts](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202779178880/Sidley-Fights-Fraud-Suit-Over-Alleged-Ties-to-Imprisoned-Con-Man/):

Garcia and his wife used multiple aliases to go along with numerous Social Security numbers. While peddling phony investments, Garcia would only reference his time as a Navy SEAL; the details were confidential. And he instructed his family to always have “go bags” packed should they need to flee one of the many lavish homes they rented across the country.

Not exactly the sort of guy you usually find working with a major law firm. Usually the con men working with a firm of this caliber at least have words like “Goldman” or “Fargo” on their business cards. That said, firms can find themselves in one-off representations of almost anyone. And yet Roy Strom of Am Law Daily notes that Garcia’s relationship with Sidley might be bigger than that:

Sidley declined to comment about the firm’s alleged work for Garcia. But court documents and testimony by Garcia’s former accountant indicate the relationship between the con man and the Chicago-based Am Law 100 firm were not limited to Birkel’s case.

How does a firm get so mixed up with somebody like this that they work with him on an ongoing basis? Well…

According to testimony by his former accountant in his criminal case, Garcia had “24-7” access to Sidley’s offices after the accountant said Garcia spent “several weeks” counseling the firm’s clients on data security issues.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
This claim may not explain how the relationship got initiated, but this does offer a clue into how the relationship flourished. Taking the view most charitable to the firm — and the firm contends that allegations of wrongdoing on their part are “utterly without merit” — it would seem that the firm got taken in by a slick-talking cybersecurity consultant and never saw any need to question him on the work sent their way. It’s a sobering reminder that the world of cybersecurity is populated with white hats and black hats and sometimes the bad guys can dupe you.

At least that’s one theory based on the documents and testimony out there (mostly from Garcia’s criminal case). If this case moves forward we’ll hear what Sidley has to say — though they’ve asked to move the case to arbitration, so a veil could easily descend over this.

Stephen M. Shapiro

The legal world was in shock when, in 2018, the founder of Mayer Brown’s Supreme Court and appellate practice Stephen Shapiro[ was murdered](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/biglaw-practice-leader-shot-and-killed-in-domestic-dispute/). The slaying was quickly dubbed a domestic dispute. Shapiro’s brother-in-law, John Gately III, [was arrested](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/charges-filed-in-murder-of-celebrated-supreme-court-litigator/) shortly after for the murder and for the attempted murder of Joan Shapiro, Stephen Shapiro’s wife and Gately’s sister.

Earlier this month Gately pleaded guilty to first degree murder. Cook County Circuit Court Judge Anjana M.J. Hansen sentenced Gately to 23 years in prison, with credit for the four years he’s already spent in jail, followed by three years of supervised release.

Law360 [has a description](https://www.law360.com/articles/1524859) of events that led up to Shapiro’s murder:

Prosecutors say that just before the murder, Gately learned that his sister was planning to stop giving him financial assistance. She had missed several calls from Gately that day, and he went to the Shapiros’ Northfield, Illinois, home shortly after the couple had finished dinner that evening, and asked for Joan when Shapiro answered the door, they said.

When Gately was told she wasn’t available, he shot Shapiro, 72. After that, Gately went into the living room, pointed his gun at Joan Shapiro and said, “I’m going to kill you,” prosecutors said.

Joan Shapiro was able to escape and call authorities when Gately’s gun didn’t go off. She provided Gately’s name and address to police and he was taken into custody after a standoff with the assistance of a SWAT team.

In a statement, Stephen Shapiro was remembered by Mayer Brown as “an extremely talented lawyer and a highly-regarded colleague and friend.”

Abby Gordon

Ed. note: This is Part III of a three-part series on the timeline for a lateral associate move and the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://www.laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors. [Abby Gordon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abbygordon/) is a Senior Director in the New York office where she focuses on placements of partners, counsel, and associate candidates for law firms and in-house. Her focus is primarily on the New York, Boston, and European markets. Abby holds a J.D., cum laude, from Georgetown University Law Center and a B.A. in Government and Romance Languages, magna cum laude, from Dartmouth College. Prior to recruiting, Abby spent seven years as a corporate associate with Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, focusing on capital markets transactions for Latin American clients in New York, and for the last five years for European clients in Paris, France. She regularly participates in professional and career panels and has published numerous articles offering career advice and tracking trends in the legal market (links to which are on her LinkedIn profile). She is a member of the New York, Massachusetts, and Maine state bars. Abby is fluent in French and Spanish, and enjoys dabbling in Portuguese and Italian.

Be sure to also read [Part I (Interviews)](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/timeline-for-a-lateral-associate-move-and-the-offer-acceptance-process-interviews-part-i/) and [Part II (Offer, Acceptance, Background Checks & Conflicts)](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/timeline-for-a-lateral-associate-move-and-the-offer-acceptance-process-part-ii/) of this series.

For a smooth lateral associate move with minimal misunderstandings on the part of the candidate, the current employer and the future employer, I encourage associates to familiarize themselves with the process before jumping in. In the last two weeks’ installments, I discussed the [timing of interviews](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/timeline-for-a-lateral-associate-move-and-the-offer-acceptance-process-interviews-part-i/) and the [offer and acceptance](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/timeline-for-a-lateral-associate-move-and-the-offer-acceptance-process-part-ii/). In this final installment, I discuss giving notice, handling reference checks, and picking your start date. Remember, the dates below in italics are only an example of one possible timeline.

Giving Notice

Week 9: You give notice to your current employer.

Do not give notice until you have the green light from the new firm! Wait for the new firm to confirm that the background checks and conflicts checks are complete and there is no problem before you let your current employer know that you are leaving.

How do you give notice? The most common approach is to schedule an in-person meeting with the partner or partners (but one at a time) with whom you work most closely. Let them know you have decided to move on to your next professional opportunity and be sure to emphasize how much you appreciate the opportunity you have had to work with them. Never burn bridges. It’s hard to know how the partner will react, but many partners are surprisingly supportive. Remember that given the pyramid-shaped business model of law firms, partners do expect most associates to leave eventually.

You may have a good reason for waiting a few days to give notice, but barring this great reason, do not procrastinate! Partners may be out of the office or you may get staffed on a new matter. Bite the bullet and do it as soon as it’s appropriate!

Be prepared! While many partners are supportive, you must be prepared for the possibility that the partner tries to talk you into staying. Your current firm may even offer you a salary hike or that inter-office transfer you had been asking for. If you have any doubt that you may be vulnerable to persuasion, discuss this scenario with your recruiter before giving notice. Practice responses to different enticements to stay. You did your homework. There is a reason you chose to move on. Rarely will the reason to stay be that compelling (or the promise reliable). On rare occasions, a partner may be hostile. Again, be prepared. Stay calm and professional. You can cry, scream, yell and curse once you’re home.

As soon as you’ve spoken with the key partners, follow up with HR. It is best to send them a written letter of resignation and ask about any other internal procedures you will need to follow. For example, be aware that firms have strict document retention policies. Do not try to download your firm’s database before leaving! You may be entitled to copies of certain documents, but follow the set procedures. Firms also have policies (often based in state ethics rules) dictating what you may and may not say to clients about your departure.

Be sure to let your recruiter know as soon as you’ve given notice. The recruiter will inform your new firm right away so they can proceed with next steps.

I have said this several times, but I will say it again: always remain professional and as cooperative as possible. Work with the partners to devise a plan to wrap up or pass off your ongoing matters and to notify clients. Focus on the positive if you’re asked to do an exit interview. Don’t burn bridges.

Reference Checks

Week 9: New employer checks references.

You may choose to provide references earlier in the process, in which case the firm may call them at any point in the interview process. But if you are providing current employer references, the new firm will wait and call them after you’ve confirmed that you have already given notice.

What does this reference check entail? Every firm has a different process, but by and large the reference check is becoming less and less of just a mere formality. If you have any doubt your references will speak highly of you, discuss the situation with your recruiter to determine how to proceed. And be sure to read my colleague Kristina Marlow’s article on [Why You Need To Think About Your References Before You Need Them](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/why-you-need-to-think-about-your-references-before-you-need-them/?rf=1).

Setting Your Start Date

Week 12: Start date.

You’re in the home stretch now! The final piece is to agree with the new firm on your start date. Keep in mind—once again—that this is not the summer associate hiring process. If a firm has an opening, it’s because they have an immediate need that they are looking to fill… yesterday.

A good way to make an enemy of your new employer is by springing on them at this late stage that you actually don’t want to start for another six months. Firms will expect you to give your current employer two weeks’ notice, possibly a bit more if you are in the middle of a big deal or trial. They want you to arrive fresh and enthusiastic, hence a week or two of vacation between jobs is a great idea. You may need a bit more time if you’re making a geographic move as well. And firms can be very understanding when you’re coordinating a move with a working spouse or a whole family. If you’re accepting an offer in November or December, the firm will likely expect you to wait until you receive your year-end bonus before giving notice. (Do not give notice before your bonus hits your bank account!)

If you have a very compelling reason for delaying your start date more than a month or so after you accept the offer, be sure to discuss your situation with your recruiter before asking too much of the new firm and starting off on the wrong foot.

***

A final thought on the lateral process: Always keep in the forefront of your mind at every stage of the process that you will be working with the new team every day for the foreseeable future. You should inform yourself of the process, the norms and the expectations of the new employer before jumping in. You should act professional and respectful, and be responsive and maintain open lines of communication with the firm, directly or through a recruiter, at every stage of the process. Even if you kill it in the interviews, your ability to succeed at the new firm will be greatly impaired if you do not handle the offer and acceptance process professionally and enthusiastically.

If you are considering exploring the lateral market, it’s very helpful to seek the guidance of a legal recruiter who can share our expertise regarding the process and who knows how to best advocate on your behalf while navigating the road to a lateral move. If you’re still considering whether it’s the right time for a move, take a look at my recent article [Top 12 Reasons Why Associates Switch Law Firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/top-12-reasons-why-associates-switch-law-firms/%20Top%2012%20Reasons%20Why%20Associates%20Switch%20Law%20Firms). A legal recruiter can help you to weigh the pros and cons in light of your specific situation.

# That's Certainly *One* Way To Work At Cravath
## Things sure have changed.

At one time, the only way to be an attorney at Cravath was getting recruited out of law school. The firm famously eschewed lateral hires, preferring to focus on home-grown talent. They didn’t want attorneys tainted by other Biglaw firms, only those trained in the Cravath system.

But the pandemic took a toll on all sorts of things, and the Cravath way was one of them. In 2021, they looked to [hire a recruitment manager](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/did-the-pandemic-break-the-cravath-system/) that would focus on lateral hires, signaling an opening for folks looking to make a lateral move to the firm.

Recently an eagle-eyed tipster spied some recruiter pitches looking for someone interested in a temporary position — at a firm that doesn’t typically hire laterals — that could become a permanent position.

Hmmm, wonder what firm they could mean? A tipster confirms it is indeed Cravath. Temp to perm at one of the most elite Biglaw firms in the world? That is definitely different than the Cravath way. It’s unclear if folks hired into this role will be full associates — or if they’ll be billed at the same rate as associates — but the chance to get your “foot in the door” sure makes it seem like it’s being pitched that way. An update to the listed opportunity indicates they’ll now accept folks applying for the role as a permanent position. But it is a sign of just how much has changed in the last few years that this possibility is even on the table.

A [new lawsuit filed in Kansas state court](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ltwl8PcsQafrUZNBDS4E8gP3PGPUH8Mh/view) by propane supply company Ferrellgas Partners, an ex-client of Biglaw firm DLA Piper, alleges the firm engaged in “strident double-dealing” that was only revealed when the wrong invoice was mistakenly sent to Ferrellgas.

In July of 2018, the company hired DLA Piper for debt restructuring advice. According to the suit, the work on that matter naturally tapered off by November of that year, but the representation was not formally terminated. However, in November of 2019 Ferrellgas received a $14,000 invoice, signed by Thomas Califano — the same restructuring partner they’d previously worked with — for research about Ferrellgas. During that same time, the company was fielding hostile takeover threats.

The lawsuit says that after inquiries from Ferrellgas, DLA returned their client file and that the firm says an internal investigation revealed the client information was not used in connection with work for any other client. But the lawsuit draws the conclusion that the invoice revealed DLA was working for adverse interests:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“DLA’s breach of its fiduciary duties is obvious. DLA put itself on both sides of Ferrellgas’ restructuring efforts, having both (a) received highly confidential information from Farrellgas and advised it on its restructuring strategy, and (b) accepted the representation of an undisclosed entity with an adverse interest in Ferrellgas’ restructuring.”

As[ reported by](https://www.law.com/2020/06/17/suit-against-dla-piper-says-firms-mistaken-email-revealed-double-dealing/) Law.com, Ferrellgas is seeking a preliminary injunction to “prevent any ongoing and future misuse of Ferrellgas’ confidential information as well as permanent injunctive relief for DLA’s alleged breach of contract and fiduciary duty.” And seeks to hold DLA “responsible for the violation of fiduciary and contractual obligations to its client Ferrellgas and its improper conduct in advising one or more clients in matters directly adverse to Ferrellgas.”

DLA Piper has not yet commented on the lawsuit.

# Biglaw Bonus News Continues To Impress As Another Firm Announces Associate Bonuses
## The question remains, how does your firm stack up?

Woohoo! The news about end-of-the-year Biglaw bonuses continues to be good news for associates at elite firms. Though we are still waiting on bonus announcements from the majority of Biglaw firms, but with 13 firms ([and counting](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/associate-compensation-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-bonuses-fall-2018/)) matching the bonus scale [set by Cravath last week](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/breaking-cravath-announces-annual-bonuses/), it feels like we’ve reached a tipping point.

Firms that consider themselves at the top end of the Biglaw proving ground will — at a minimum — match the Cravath scale. Firms that don’t (or that put excessive conditions on unlocking market bonuses) will reveal themselves to be “less than” the top firms. The question remains, how does your firm stack up?

The folks at Cadwalader announced bonuses on November 21st that demonstrate they’re at the top of the heap. Even before they left to celebrate Thanksgiving with their families and loved ones, the powers-that-be were making sure associates knew they were appreciated with the following bonus schedule:

Class of 2018: $15,000 (prorated)
Class of 2017: $15,000
Class of 2016: $25,000
Class of 2015: $50,000
Class of 2014: $65,000
Class of 2013: $80,000
Class of 2012: $90,000
Class of 2011 and senior: $100,000

# Pandora Papers Unleash A Lot Of Biglaw Evils On The World

It’s unfair to define the Pandora Papers as a singular scandal as much as it’s a “coming attractions” reel for the next couple hundred scandals out there involving the wealthy and powerful engaged in shady international operations at the expense of the rest of us. The “papers” amount to around 12 million documents and are currently being scoured by [over 600 journalists in 117 countries](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-58780561).

And you thought your document review was unruly.

They’ve turned up dealings involving royal families, presidents, prime ministers, and various rich people moving money across borders into secret accounts. Whether they’re doing it as a means of tax evasion, avoidance, money laundering, or worse depends on the particular actor.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
But the Pandora Papers also have the side effect of revealing which Biglaw firms are neck deep in assisting these clients in moving this money… for whatever reasons. After all, you can’t set up a bunch of dummy corporations and funnel resources into novel, difficult to pierce, “trust-like” instruments without lawyers and The New Republic took a look at [which law firms have turned up in the data dump](https://newrepublic.com/article/164029/pandora-papers-us-law-corruption).

One firm came up big:

As the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, or ICIJ, [detailed](https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/baker-mckenzie-global-law-firm-offshore-tax-dodging/), few firms stand out for their offshoring help more than Baker McKenzie—one of America’s largest firms, billing itself as “the original global law firm.” As the Pandora Papers document, Baker McKenzie helped clients link up with offshore services providers time and again, and advised “corporate giants” elsewhere on offshoring tactics. Along the way, Baker McKenzie specifically crafted policies stripping away transparency in [notorious offshore havens](https://carnegieendowment.org/2020/07/07/dubai-s-role-in-facilitating-corruption-and-global-illicit-financial-flows-pub-82180) like the United Arab Emirates. And in the U.S., Baker McKenzie “sought to exempt more foreign customers from due diligence rules meant to prevent money laundering.”

The ICIJ put it bluntly, “Baker McKenzie is an architect and pillar of a shadow economy, often called ‘offshore,’ that benefits the wealthy at the expense of nations’ treasuries and ordinary citizens’ wallets.”

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
How do law firms think they can get into this sort of work? Especially in an environment where working as a functional lobbyist is [fraught with risk](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/09/greg-craig-wasnt-guilty-the-american-lobbying-industry-on-the-other-hand/). It all depends on what you call yourself. From the TNR report:

Some lawyers now combine legal services with [P.R. representation](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/prominent-global-law-firm-agrees-register-agent-foreign-principal)—thus taking skillful advantage of [foreign lobbying exemptions](https://newrepublic.com/article/155387/law-take-rudy-giuliani) that remain wide open. (One of the first hires the Jordanian king-cum-kleptocrat made after his offshore holdings were revealed was American firm DLA Piper, which will now help him with “[media matters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/dla-piper-will-guide-jordans-king-abdullah-media-matters-2021-10-01/).”)

While DLA Piper is named in the text, Skadden is the subject of one of those links. Because while Baker McKenzie may position itself as a leader in this space, there are enough nooks and crannies for other firms — willing to take accept the bare minimum of “know your customer” requirements imposed on lawyers in the United States — to get themselves implicated in these documents. DLA Piper might be forgiven for not knowing what each of its approximately 200 million partners were doing at any given moment — but now that this is out there, law firms had best be setting up some healthier guardrails.

And if they don’t, it’s possible that Washington will set some up for them. With efforts afoot to sign lawyers and public relations consultants up to [adhere to basic anti-money laundering regulations](https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/576646-enablers-act-will-do-more-to-stop-money-laundering-than-lawmakers-realize), the coming months could bring new protocols and many more firms highlighted in reports and testimony for whetting their appetites on the offshoring smorgasbord of the last several years.

# 4 Things Outside Counsel Can Do Instead Of Taking Me To Dinner

Let me start off by saying – I get it.

I understand the need for the hustle. While it has been at least seven years since I moved in-house, I have not forgotten the need to develop business and how hard it can be.

At the same time, now that I’m on this side of it, I can understand more intimately why a coffee, drink, lunch, or dinner, although complimentary and generous, may not be the most appealing use of my time. I can only speak to myself, but there are a few reasons for this.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
First, as an introvert, I have most likely spent most of my day depleting my energy by engaging and talking with others. The last thing I want to do is talk some more. My poor extroverted husband can attest to this when I can barely grunt in response to his chipper conversation when he gets home.

Second, as a work-outside-the-home mom of three (ages 7, 5, and 1), I want to get home to my babies and connect with them. I am very aware that my time with them, while they still like me, is finite.

Lastly, the siren’s call of productivity is hard to resist. Even though I don’t have to bill, I still have clients waiting on me for things — and an hour and a half away from the workday just means that I have to work after the kids are in bed or make it up somewhere else.

Please don’t misunderstand me. I appreciate the asks, and I know that having my company as a client may be very helpful, and you want to build a relationship. But here are some other ideas that you may want to consider instead of the usual dinner.

Pro Bono/Community Service/Philanthropy

Again, I can’t speak for everyone, but for me, I love the idea of getting to know my outside counsel through working together on a pro bono case or side by side doing some community service or serving on a philanthropic board. I see it as a “win-win.” We get to spend time together but also do good together. It gives us something to talk about just in case my introverted self can’t carry the conversation. Plus, to the extent our employers care, it is good branding for them. Lastly, it lessens the mom guilt a bit. I get to share with my kiddos why I was away for a bit, and it becomes a teachable moment about the importance of community service.

Include My Family

While not all in-house counsel are parents, they still have family or people they consider family. And who do you think are most influential in their lives? Yup, the family. So why not include the family in business development events?

For me, it is a way for us to connect without me accruing the mom guilt. And yes, while it is harder to have meaningful conversation with the chaos of my kids around, you should know and trust that my kids remember your name and how you invited us to the fun movie where they got all the candy they wanted. My husband will remember that you remember him, and how you bought him a drink, and the fun conversation you both had cause he’s the extrovert.

See Me

This may seem like an odd category, but what I mean by this is to personalize the invite to what you know about me. While I don’t love going to dinner, I will think twice if it’s to the exclusive omakase place whose reservations fill up within minutes. I definitely won’t decline if I can bring my spouse. Or maybe you know that I love fiction so you invite me to a book signing with an up-and-coming author. Perhaps you know that I’m super passionate about a particular cause or that I co-founded a nonprofit, and you want to sponsor one of our events. These are the things that make you stand out, and because they are in activities which I love and that give me life, the introvert in me will stand down.

Help Me Shine

Last, but certainly not least, it is hard to forget someone who helps you shine — whether it is talking me up to my leadership or nominating me for an award (that you genuinely think I’m qualified for) or thinking of me for a panel or other speaking opportunity (presuming I’m into speaking). Flattery doesn’t get very far because my imposter syndrome won’t let me feel it. But if you take the time to help me get external validation? Or grow my brand? Let me put it this way: it is hard to forget someone who is invested in you.

In closing, relationship-building is about building trust, which takes time. I don’t think there are shortcuts to that time, but your goal is to get through the door, to get a bit of access. And for that, consider how your prospective client or client would rather spend their time — and go there.

# Justice Kagan Does Not Like Neil Gorsuch

Ugh, this guy. (Photo by Brendan Smialowski/Getty Images)

Neil Gorsuch hasn’t been on the Supreme Court that long, but we already know he’s a bit of a jerk. He gets pedantic [during oral arguments](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/ruth-bader-ginsburg-claps-back-at-neil-gorsuch/?rf=1), he’s been [boorish and childish](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/neil-gorsuch-isnt-the-justice-we-need-but-hes-the-justice-we-deserve/), and isn’t making [any friends](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/how-badly-is-neil-gorsuch-annoying-the-other-supreme-court-justices) on the Court. And it seems it’s getting worse.

There’s a storm cloud blowing over the Court. As Nina Totenberg revealed on the podcast [First Mondays,](http://www.firstmondays.fm/episodes/2017/10/16/ot2017-3-nowheresville) there’s a feud a-brewing between Elena Kagan and Neil Gorsuch:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
My surmise, from what I’m hearing, is that Justice [Elena] Kagan really has taken [Gorsuch] on in conference. And that it’s a pretty tough battle and it’s going to get tougher. And she is about as tough as they come, and I am not sure he’s as tough—or dare I say it, maybe not as smart. I always thought he was very smart, but he has a tin ear somehow, and he doesn’t seem to bring anything new to the conversation.

The increasingly public nature of the Supreme Court quarrels is also fascinating. As Mark Joseph Stern at Slate [notes](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2017/10/why_rumors_of_a_gorsuch_kagan_supreme_court_clash_are_such_a_bombshell.html):

[I]t’s astonishing that any reporter would hear details from conference, let alone score some genuinely juicy scuttlebutt. Conference is famously sacrosanct: It’s where the justices gather to cast their votes in the cases of the week, with each explaining his or her reasoning in order of seniority. Nobody else is allowed to attend. If rumors leak about a justice’s behavior in conference—and they basically never do—it is almost certainly a justice who leaked them. And when justices leak—which again, happens very rarely—they do so on purpose. The fact that we know about the “battle” in conference between Gorsuch and Kagan suggests that someone on the court wants us to know.

Neil Gorsuch is alienating his colleagues so much that someone is eschewing tradition and decorum to publicly humiliate him. This goes well beyond ideological differences. Remember, Antonin Scalia was as right wing as anyone who’s been on the Court, and he was a [close friend](http://www.npr.org/2016/02/15/466848775/scalia-ginsburg-opera-commemorates-sparring-supreme-court-friendship) of his ideological opposite, Ruth Bader Ginsburg. It’s Gorsuch, himself, who brings out the ire.

Even if they don’t like it, Kagan and Gorsuch have to work together for the rest of their lives. And I’m sure they’ll find some way to “make it work.” But in the meantime, court watchers and legal nerds will appreciate the glimpse behind the scenes these fights give us.

# Fired Associate Takes Plea Deal In Biglaw Extortion Charge
## There's no word yet on when he'll be sentenced.

Michael Potere

Remember Michael Potere, the former Dentons associate who was fired and allegedly decided to [exact his revenge](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/biglaw-associate-arrested-over-plot-to-extort-partners/) against the firm by threatening to leak sensitive information taken from the email account of the managing director of the firm’s Los Angeles office — i.e., information that ranged from emails between partners to the firm’s quarterly financial reports to associate reviews — to Above the Law, unless he was paid $210,000 and given an expensive piece of artwork?

This summer, Potere was arrested and indicted on charges of extortion and attempted extortion affecting interstate commerce, as well as transmitting threatening communications with intent to extort. At the time, the ex-Biglaw associate was represented by a public defender and faced up to 22 years in prison.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
As it turns out, Potere has taken a plea deal on a lesser charge to avoid spending more than two decades behind bars. The [New York Law Journal](http://www.law.com/sites/therecorder/2017/10/23/102317potere_plea/) has the details:

Under a plea deal, federal prosecutors agreed to dismiss an underlying indictment that included a [more severe charge of extortion](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1951) against Potere, which could have resulted in a sentence of up to 20 years in prison if he were convicted.

With his plea, Potere admitted to accessing confidential Dentons documents related to the firm’s finances, billing and hiring efforts, including quarterly financial reports, a list of clients and how much they owed in legal fees, confidential employment reviews of other associates and a “detailed analysis” describing lateral recruitment efforts and offers made to potential hires, according to court records.

Prior to his arrest, Potere reportedly told two partners that he felt like “people his age were getting screwed and that he might have a chance to screw back.” That didn’t work out so well, now did it? Potere tried to stand up for his generation, and now he’s getting super screwed. Oops! Never try to screw Biglaw back — the firm always wins.

Every high schooler has a group text chain and then a chain where they complain about the people they don’t like on the group chain. Brett Kavanaugh is unaware of the second chain. Because when you have to do public tours to convince people that you have friends, [you don’t have friends](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/brett-kavanaugh-notre-dame-u-s-news-law-school-rankings/). Meanwhile, a law professor [didn’t take too kindly to a student request](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/professor-offers-fk-you-to-student-request/). And while cursing at students isn’t acceptable, the frustration probably was justified. Finally, there are a lot of thorny ethical challenges in this world, but some conflicts are pretty clear. Like, [$62 million clear](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/husch-blackwell-charles-renner-biglaw-62-milion-arbitration-award/).

# Stuck In The Middle With You
## In essence, a non-equity partner is a non-partner partner, and the existence of a non-owning partner in said partnership renders it a non-partnership.

There’s a new place in Biglaw — not always a comfortable place — called the middle.  One of its defining characteristics is euphemism, particularly around job titles.  Consider yourself lucky if you’re merely saddled with a legal anachronism like “Of Counsel” or “Senior Counsel” or the more workaday “Senior Attorney” (i.e., a lawyer who’s been here a while, which is apparently the best we can say for him), as opposed to that vague moniker creeping into the legal world, borrowed from finance or consulting firms, “Principal.”

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The ultimate horror (though somehow preferable as middle titles go) is that now-commonplace epitome of Biglaw oxymoronicness: “non-equity partner.”  Every thinking person’s initial objection to this laboratory-experiment-gone-horribly-wrong of a credential, or title, or status, or whatever it is, is that in purely legal terms, it’s nonsense.  How can a partner, meaning a member of a partnership, i.e., a fundamental part of an entity defined by shared ownership, not own anything? I’ve run this past tax attorneys (the smartest of all lawyers) and they agreed to a man (and woman):  This is more than a quibble — the concept is absurd.

In essence, a non-equity partner is a non-partner partner.  If a partner owns nothing in a partnership, it’s not merely that the partnership is non-equitable, it’s that the existence of a non-owning partner in said partnership renders it a non-partnership.  The other guys, who own stuff, have a partnership.  You, as a non-equity partner, might as well be called “that guy we let work here until we decide differently” (thus, perhaps, was born yet another neologism, the term “de-equitize”).  The phrase “salary partner” only makes things worse, by sweeping less of the evident cognitive dissonance under the rug.  Might as well emblazon yourself “Proletarian Viscount” or “Marquis of the Living Wage.”

In fairness, the whole problem began when someone needed to come up with a word for lawyers who somehow never left their firms, but on the other hand weren’t really getting anywhere, either.  There had to be something better to call them than “fourteenth-year associate,” which is one of those titles more apt to leave a lawyer gazing into a mirror, his face wet with tears, then crowing with pride at a firm cocktail event.

More importantly, “fourteenth-year associate” sounds bad in front of clients, and let’s face it, the entire issue of concocting these titles for folks in the middle is about appearances, i.e., what outsiders think.  No one cares what you think, and everyone knows where you dwell (amid the dark and dreadful middle realm).  Law is like fashion (to paraphrase Heidi Klum):  You’re either in, or you’re out (and no, the middle isn’t in, so all the more reason for clever euphemisms).

# Lawyers Should Focus Less On 'CYA' And More On Serving Clients
## It is far better for attorneys to help clients fix situations than insulate themselves from liability.

I am willing to bet that many of the people reading the title of this article have no idea what the abbreviation “CYA” means. The first time I ever heard the term was when I was an ROTC cadet, and I was told that it meant to “cover your ass.” In essence, if someone thought that they had to follow misguided orders, or pursue a flawed strategy, they would make sure to have witnesses, or perhaps something in writing, to provide evidence that they were not responsible for the consequences. This attitude is not exclusive to any field, and I am sure that many of us have heard of the term “defensive medicine” to describe a similar practice in the medical field where doctors cover their butts to insulate themselves from malpractice claims.

The legal industry is also ripe with this kind of attitude. Lawyers, like all other professionals, are nervous about being accused of malpractice, so attorneys often cover themselves to avoid malpractice liability. However, attorneys also simply try to cover their butts so that they don’t look bad in front of their bosses. Nevertheless, sometimes a cover your ass attitude can get in the way of serving clients, and attorneys should make clients the priority over insulating themselves from blowback.

Lawyers are often forced into covering their butts because clients wish to pursue a strategy which can result in negative outcomes. For instance, I once worked at a firm that was tasked with serving local subpoenas for an out-of-state proceeding. The out-of-state law firm insisted on making the subpoenas returnable sooner than the mandated time period required by local rules. I conveyed this to the out-of-state paralegal that was assigned to the case, and she told me that we should just go forward with signing and serving the defective subpoenas anyways.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
I spoke with my boss about this situation and suggested that we discuss the matter with the out-of-state lawyers who were working on this case. I suggested that perhaps the paralegal did not know the importance of timeframes with the subpoenas, but maybe we could convince the lawyers to use the correct timeframe with the subpoenas. The partner ended up telling me that it was not our problem that the paralegal had dictated that we serve defective subpoenas. He simply told me to write a memo to the file memorializing the conversation I had about the defective subpoenas so we could cover ourselves if the situation blew up in our faces.

Naturally, the short-served subpoenas became problematic, but we were able to tell the client about our conversation concerning the defective subpoenas, and we didn’t receive any blowback. In fact, our firm actually got more work sending out another round of subpoenas. However, it would have been more efficient to simply fix the problem in the first place rather than focus on covering our butts. This would have resulted in a much better outcome for our client even though it required us to go that extra mile.

Sometimes, attorneys focus on CYA because of internal firm politics, and this does not serve the best interests of the client. I once had a case as a “baby lawyer” that required someone from our firm to head to Long Island for a deposition. The senior associate told me that he wanted me to take the deposition because he did not want to get on the Long Island Railroad and schlep a few hours to the deposition and back. Since this was in the early part of my career, I was pretty excited to go on the deposition, even though I was somewhat inexperienced, and the senior associate knew more about the case.

However, the partner ended up finding out that the senior associate had pawned the deposition off on me, and he probably understood that the senior associate was just being lazy when assigning me the deposition. The senior associate then proceeded to write an extremely long email to cover his ass, and the message discussed in detail all of the tasks that the senior associate had to do in the office and why he could not cover the deposition. It must have taken the senior associate a substantial amount of time to review his outstanding tasks and draft that email. However, the senior associate should have just taken the deposition himself and not wasted so much time justifying his actions so that he could cover himself in front of the partner.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Of course, there are situations when it makes sense to cover your ass, and lawyers more than other professionals know best how they can avoid liability if a situation blows up. It is often a good idea to memorialize some oral conversations in an email, and speak by phone in other contexts. Furthermore, providing advice to clients about how they can cover their asses is a huge part of providing quality legal representation.

However, attorneys should try not to cover themselves if it will have a negative impact on the client. It is far better for attorneys to help clients fix situations than insulate themselves from liability.

# The Global 200: The Richest Law Firms In The World (2023)
## Which firms are at the very top of the list this year?

Law.com International recently published its latest edition of the Global 200, a ranking of the world’s 200 largest law firms by total revenue. How did these firms do in the year that was? As we learned from the most recent Am Law 100 rankings, what goes up must come down, and 2022 wasn’t as much of a banner year for Biglaw firms as the one prior, with revenue up by just 1.2% while while head count grew by an average of 6.1%.

What are we looking at in terms of the big picture?

For some guidance, we merely need to turn to the headline story on Law.com International concerning the rankings: [“The Year the Global 200 Law Firms Returned to Earth With a Bump.”](https://www.law.com/2023/09/19/the-year-the-global-200-law-firms-returned-to-earth-with-a-bump-405-128868/) Yikes. In fact, one Biglaw leader said of the year-over-year change, “I don’t think there’s ever been a period that has been so hot, and then cooled down so quickly.”

But it’s not all depressing news when it comes to the wealthiest firms in the world. Once again, almost all of the firms at the tippy top of the ranking have the majority of their lawyers in the U.S. These are the top 10 firms of the 2023 Global 200 (ranked by 2022 revenue):

- Kirkland & Ellis: $6,514,300,000
- Latham & Watkins: $5,321,007,000
- DLA Piper: $3,685,205,000
- Baker McKenzie: $3,300,189,000
- Dentons: $3,100,000,000
- Skadden Arps: $3,020,869,000
- Sidley Austin: $2,922,634,000
- White & Case: $2,828,000,000
- Morgan Lewis: $2,745,251,000
- Gibson Dunn: $2,736,637,000

Congratulations to all the firms that made it through 2022 — a year of slow growth to be sure, but growth nonetheless for the biggest of the world’s Biglaw firms.

# Biglaw Partners Are Getting Forced Out Of Their Firms
## Thanks, COVID. :(

COVID-19, and the accompanying economic upheaval, has radically changed the legal landscape. We’ve known for a while that [furloughs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/holland-knight-cuts/), [stealth associate layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/goodwin-stealth-layoffs/?rf=1), and [salary cuts ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/associates-at-this-biglaw-firm-are-taking-a-20-percent-pay-cut/?rf=1)were part of this new normal, but now comes [word from Law.com](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2020/08/21/big-law-firms-are-forcing-out-unproductive-partners-as-recession-stalls-profits/) that partners are increasingly finding themselves pushed out the door during these uncertain times.

It seems this is a new Biglaw trend — firms are “counseling out” both equity and nonequity partners that are not as productive as they’d like. And it’s largely coming in corporate practice groups, which have been particularly hard hit by COVID-19. But it didn’t start solely because of COVID; an Altman Weil survey found a hefty percentage of firms thought their partners were not busy enough, and the pandemic has exacerbated the problem:

Altman Weil legal consultant Eric Seeger points to his firm’s Law Firms in Transition survey, which found that, among the 182 firm leaders surveyed, 31% of respondents said their equity partners are not sufficiently busy. For nonequity partners, that figure rises to 51%.

And that survey came polled firms in February and March, pre-pandemic. Since then, billable hours at many firms have fallen by 10% to 20%, Seeger said.

The firms are seeing these partners out the door (or sometimes, in the case of equity partners, pushing them down to the nonequity ranks) and using that savings to retain big rainmakers, who are in danger of being poached by other firms.

“All firms are going to do everything they can to protect their most significant contributors from the threat of poaching by other firms. And that is often going to mean getting more money to those people so that they’re paid fairly, meaning market competitively,” said legal consultant Kent Zimmermann of the Zeughauser Group.

This effort to “right size” has taken on new life since, according to legal industry experts, more firms have moved to allow partner removal based on executive or management committee vote, as opposed to a traditional all-partner votes. And you can expect even more partners leaving their firms under less than strictly voluntary circumstances:

“Those conversations are happening. I know it,” said Peter Zeughauser, a law firm management consultant at the Zeughauser Group. ”We’ve talked to some of our clients about it. It’s going to pick up steam.”

Though these changes to the industry seem pretty radical, it’s really only the typically high profits in Biglaw that have previously insulated the industry from these tough cuts:

“Big Law has an unusually high profit margin, and it allows for a lot of sloppiness on this stuff,” Zeughauser said. “There has been a need for this for some time, but firms have done so well that they haven’t had to.”

So, um, thanks COVID?

“As they say, there’s nothing like a good disaster to get things in order,” said one Am Law 100 leader. “A lot of firms don’t have the rigor to do it. But it has been a long time coming.”

But it still has to suck for those fired forced into a career pivot during a freaking pandemic.

# From Biglaw Partner To In-House To Author

In this episode of The Jabot, I speak with Mansi Shah, author of [“The Taste of Ginger”](https://www.amazon.com/Taste-Ginger-Novel-Mansi-Shah/dp/1542031907/) and Senior Vice President of Legal at Warner Bros., about how she balances her writing and legal careers, and what the process of writing is like for her. Mansi discusses the biggest challenges she faces when writing a novel, and why she decided to root her book in the immigrant experience. She also talks about how she decided what to draw on to create the main character of her book.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

For anyone who has Googled me, there’s a lot to find. I quit my law firm job 20 months ago, soon after I provided [congressional testimony](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU03/20220317/114503/HHRG-117-JU03-20220317-SD005.pdf) in support of the [Judiciary Accountability Act](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/judges-who-interpret-title-vii-should-themselves-be-subject-to-it/), legislation that would extend Title VII protections to the federal judiciary, in order to launch a transparency and accountability [nonprofit](https://www.legalaccountabilityproject.org/). I imagine my existence would have been tenuous at the small D.C. family law firm where I was working, had I continued publicly advocating for judicial accountability and changes to the clerkship system. My outspokenness likely would have been constrained. Perhaps clients would have Googled me and wondered how I could represent them, considering my [challenging relationship](https://administrativelawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/11/Shatzman_Final_crop.pdf) with the local courts. Not to mention, creating larger cultural change in the clerkship system, judiciary, and legal profession requires a nonprofit and its leader working full-time to create urgently needed changes.

I [launched a nonprofit](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/how-to-protect-law-clerks-from-harassment/) 18 months ago to correct injustices I experienced as a law student and law clerk. There was an enormous void in the public dialogue around judicial clerkships: they were messaged — incorrectly — as an [unadulterated good](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/we-should-tell-the-truth-about-judicial-clerkships/). Too many law clerks suffer in silence. Information about judges who mistreated their clerks [is not shared](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/the-clerkship-whisper-network/) with clerkship applicants, perpetuating a cycle of abuse in the federal and state courts.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Some were initially skeptical. Would I gain any traction? Was the intent simply to criticize judges? Fortunately, my nonprofit and I proved the naysayers wrong. The incredible [response](https://www.innsofcourt.org/AIC/AIC_For_Members/AIC_Bencher/AIC_Bencher_Tech_Column/2023_NovDec_Tech_Melkonian.aspx) from across the legal profession — and far beyond — is evidence there’s a real hunger for candid dialogue around judicial accountability, clerkships, and the courts. We’ve also been fortunate to receive support from many federal and state judges, who convey their support publicly, as well as to law schools, in support of LAP’s main initiative, our [Centralized Clerkships Database,](https://www.legalaccountabilityproject.org/clerkships-database) which democratizes information about judges as managers and clerkship experiences.

Every internship, job, and clerkship hiring cycle — including the hiring cycle happening right now — I see lots of bad takes about the hiring process. One of the most galling? “Your reputation is everything.” This statement, and companion statements like, “Don’t rock the boat,” “Don’t make waves,” and “Keep your head down, and do your work,” perpetuate the legal profession’s overly cautious, change-resistant status quo.

The problems I shine a spotlight on in the judicial clerkship system — enormous power disparities between principal and subordinate that perpetuate problematic behaviors; [failure to train](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/not-every-good-jurist-is-a-good-manager/) and supervise subordinates; secrecy; fear; unnecessary hierarchies and [deification](https://nyujlpp.org/quorum/shatzman-judiciary-accountability-act/) of the principal; and a persistent lack of transparency, diversity, equity, and [accountability](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/options-for-law-clerks-to-address-wrongful-conduct/) — are not unique to clerkships, although they’re particularly pronounced and problematic, considering the nature of the work environment. These problems trickle up through the profession, as today’s law clerks become tomorrow’s prosecutors and public defenders; Biglaw associates and partners, law school faculty members, clerkship advisors, deans, and judges themselves.

There’s a profession-wide unwillingness to step forward and publicly acknowledge the system only works for a handful invested in perpetuating the status quo. There’s a profession-wide unwillingness to embrace change and to question why we’ve conferred so much power on an unaccountable few. The system [does not work](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/do-your-research-stick-it-out-and-other-things-law-schools-should-stop-telling-students-about-clerkships/) for most law students — or law clerks. Embracing anything “risky” or disruptive is considered a threat to one’s “reputation.” New attorneys are taught to worry that a potential employer will Google them and discover they have advocated for change or urged the legal profession to do better, and will toss them aside. Recent student advocacy — [and law firms’ responses](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/winston-davis-polk-may-be-the-first-of-many-firms-to-revoke-job-offers-over-controversial-statements-on-israel/) — following the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Israel has not lessened these fears.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
As law students apply for summer internships and post-graduate positions and continue to hear the refrain — from attorneys and law school career services — that their “reputation” is everything, they should interrogate the subtext: don’t rock the boat. Conform to societal expectations of what a summer associate, law clerk, or junior attorney looks like, even if that means hiding your true personality or identity. Law clerks tell me they feel pressure to conceal their sexual orientation, change the way they dress, hide tattoos and piercings, conceal an accent, or self-censor. It’s also a subtle threat: do not question the status quo, or you will be punished professionally.

I spend a lot of time working with law students on campuses across the country, urging them to demand better from their law school career services offices, who currently gatekeep clerkship resources and maintain a chokehold on clerkship messaging and programming. Students spearhead student advocacy on a variety of issues. Where does that justice-minded spirit go after they graduate?

Some will pursue clerkships, where they’re told to prioritize the principal over themselves because judges deserve absolute respect and total deference. Then they’ll perhaps accept positions at law firms or in the government, where they are advised their actions reflect on their employer, especially if they want to advance, so don’t ruffle any feathers.

When attorneys dissuaded me from providing congressional testimony two years ago, from speaking publicly, and from launching a nonprofit explicitly centered around judicial accountability, they pointed out the “reputational risk.” I was told, “The right professional decision would be to stay silent.” And that speaking publicly would “tarnish my reputation.” What reputation? A reputation for being a coward? For simply accepting the status quo — that the former judge could unfairly trash me and destroy my career, that the legal community would line up behind him, and that I should just stay silent and “move on?” I’ve made strong statements in interviews, legal scholarship, and on social media about the lack of accountability for judges who mistreat their clerks, and the legal profession-wide failure to do anything about it. But these bold statements — once deemed an unjustifiable risk — have sparked a nation-wide clerkship transparency [movement](https://www.legalaccountabilityproject.org/).

The legal profession is notoriously risk-averse. Lawyers are taught, [beginning in law school](https://yalelawandpolicy.org/inter_alia/law-schools-are-part-problem-they-can-and-should-be-part-solution) and continuing throughout their legal careers, to prioritize risk-mitigation over high-risk, high-reward endeavors. Yet risk-taking is necessary to implement wide-scale change. I encounter this risk-aversion when I approach law schools to propose common-sense solutions to [fix the clerkship system](https://columbialawreview.org/content/the-clerkships-whisper-network-what-it-is-why-its-broken-and-how-to-fix-it/) and they respond out of fear, desperately clinging to the broken status quo. I see it when I approach law firms to engage them in [supporting improvements](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/fear-of-retaliation-silences-law-clerks-employers-should-speak-up) to the clerkship system and they too respond out of fear: fear of angering judges they appear before, even though there’s no evidence judges broadly oppose transparency or accountability in the clerkship system. Judges often tell me that transparency benefits them, too, by fostering better matching between judges and clerks.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
I critique systems that must change, while not criticizing anyone personally. And still, there is so much fear of this [seemingly untouchable judiciary](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/80v610w7#main) — power we as attorneys have conferred upon them — and a profession-wide unwillingness to question the status quo on behalf of thousands of clerks each year.

We can change the culture in the legal profession: from one of silence, fear, and deification of those in positions of power, to one of honest dialogue about the full range of workplace experiences. We are the next generation of leaders, advocates, and thinkers. Soon we will be leading the government offices, law firms, and law schools. Some will become judges or politicians. Let’s question — and disrupt — the status quo.

If more law students say “no” to a culture of conformity, and more new attorneys within their workplaces challenge this culture too, the legal profession will be forced to change and adapt in order to attract and retain the best talent. One of the most important things I’ve learned over the past 20 months, as I’ve developed a reputation as a “disruptive” change-maker, is that individuals raising their voices [can change the culture](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/its-time-for-a-metoo-movement-in-the-judiciary/). It’s time to stop simply accepting the status quo. The profession will only change if we demand change.

New Jersey Gubernatorial candidate Jim Johnson.

It’s primary day in New Jersey for the race to replace Chris Christie. Christie has been reduced to “Trump Gimp” status thanks to scandal and Trump-induced humiliation, but Governor of New Jersey is still a position of national significance. The state might be solidly “blue” in national elections, but statewide it can be friendly to what’s left of the “educated” wing of the Republican party

On the Republican side, Lieutenant Governor [Kim Guadagno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Guadagno) holds a sizable lead over State Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli. Guadagno is a former AUSA for the Eastern District of New York, then she moved to the District of New Jersey. She’s also a former Assistant New Jersey Attorney General, and she served as the Monmouth County sheriff.

Prosecutorial experience is nice, if you like that kind of thing. The Democrats are countering with that private practice, though.

The Democratic front-runner is Philip Murphy. He’s a multimillionaire former Goldman Sachs executive. Because really, when Democrats are trying to tap into the grassroots, anti-Trump fervor, running a millionaire banker is totally the right call. What could possibly go wrong! It’s not like the last Goldman-to-Governor Democrat, [Jon Corzine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Corzine), is now known for epic failure at MF Global. (Please, just f**king shoot me).

Among his numerous opponents is Jim Johnson. [Johnson is a former partner at Debevoise and Plimpton](http://www.debevoise.com/jamesjohnson?tab=Biography). (Disclosure: Yes, I met Jim Johnson while I was an associate at Debevoise. When you are a young black lawyer, you meet the black partner(s) at your firm. But I couldn’t get Donald Trump a meeting with Johnson, we don’t all hang out.)

In addition to his private-practice experience, Johnson is also a former AUSA for the Southern District. Johnson was a Treasury prosecutor in the Clinton administration, and notably [led the Brennan Center for Justice](https://www.brennancenter.org/press-release/james-e-johnson-retires-brennan-center-board) from 2004 to 2011.

He’ll probably get creamed because Goldman money >>> Debevoise money. But if you are looking for a Democrat with a strong record on criminal justice reform, Johnson is probably your guy.

# Will Law Firm Fashion Change Because Of The Pandemic?

I think it depends on the law firm. At my law firm, yes, I think things will change because people think more about comfort and practicality now. If it wasn’t already clear, I think the pandemic certainly solidified that. At a law firm, people are still going to judge what you’re wearing. It does reflect on the professional part of the job. It’s heading in a way that’s a little bit more toned down, but may have to correct itself eventually and become a little more ‘formal.’ I think people will find more of a middle ground and just be more practical in understanding that you can have flexibility that maybe wasn’t there in law firms before.

— Meghan, 32, a lawyer at a Boston-based law firm, who is currently working from home in Hawaii, commenting on whether she thinks thinks the [pandemic will actually change the corporate dresscode](https://coveteur.com/2021/01/25/dress-codes-reflections/) at her firm. Although things are very casual right now, she says, “I don’t want to overdo it. I’ve been trying to be conscious of being in a totally different climate—I don’t want to be wearing a tank top— so that I look somewhat appropriate.”

They aren’t going to let people go that are essential to running their business and are essential to servicing their clients—whether they are in the office or not. The question becomes: Is it harder to be essential when you are remote?

— [Michelle Fivel](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/michelle-fivel?byconsultantorauthor=michelle-fivel), a partner at Major Lindsey & Africa, commenting on the [worries many associates may be experiencing](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/remote-lawyers-at-risk-of-falling-behind-if-big-law-demand-drops) as speculation about the [“very, very high risk” of recession](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-15/goldman-s-blankfein-says-companies-should-prepare-for-recession?sref=8s6CyRMm), per Goldman Sachs Senior Chairman Lloyd Blankfein, continue to make their way through the news. Recruiters, however, remain optimistic that associates working remotely in today’s hybrid environment will be spared from the layoffs that ravaged Biglaw firms during the Great Recession.

# Top 20 Biglaw Firm Hands Out Even More Money To Associates
## What an exciting time!

Big money keeps raining down on associates across the Biglaw landscape, and it seems like firms have officially received their marching orders to match the new Cravath salary scale.

The latest firm to do so is Gibson Dunn. If you recall, the firm matched the then-prevailing [Davis Polk salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/gibson-raises-22/) the day before Cravath announced its own bigger, better compensation scale for associates. Here’s what the new salary grid now looks like at the firm:



The new salary scale at Gibson Dunn goes into effect on March 31, and will be retroactive to January 1. Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Gibson Dunn & Crutcher.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs.

— Dentons Global Chair Joe Andrew explaining to [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2022/09/21/what-happens-to-law-firms-when-ey-ditches-its-troubled-audit-business/) that EY’s decision to ditch its audit business will have a significant impact on the legal sector, but probably not the one that [we’ve long predicted](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/twilight-of-the-law-firms-the-big-4-are-poised-to-conquer-the-legal-landscape/).

# Most Law Schools Did Horrendously On This State's Bar Exam
## At one law school, three out of every four graduates failed the test.

As we mentioned [earlier](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/morning-docket-04-11-17/) today, the results from Florida’s administration of the February 2017 bar exam are out, and they are not pretty. In fact, the passage rate on Florida’s winter bar is now at its lowest point since the February 2009 exam (and possibly even earlier, but that is the final date for which scores are listed on the [Florida Board of Bar Examiners](https://www.floridabarexam.org/web/website.nsf/52286AE9AD5D845185257C07005C3FE1/660E3F5B6C35DE2585257C0B006AA3F4) website). The state’s overall passage rate for first-time takers was 57.7 percent, and some law schools posted passage rates that barely hovered around the 50 percent mark. One law school’s passage rate was far, far lower than that.

Which schools performed the best on the test, and which schools performed the worst?

Here are the [results for all Florida law schools](https://www.floridabarexam.org/__85257bfe0055eb2c.nsf/52286ae9ad5d845185257c07005c3fe1/f84b5b4c568910c5852580fe0051eca6) for the February 2017 exam:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  


As you can see, Miami and Florida International blew away the competition, with passage rates of 80.6 percent and 78.9 percent, respectively. Congratulations to graduates of both law schools. On the flip side of the coin, hovering around or below a 50 percent passage rate are law schools like Barry (51.5 percent), Florida A&M (46.2 percent), Nova Southeastern (55 percent), St. Thomas (44.7 percent), and Stetson (51.3 percent). The school with the worst performance of all was Florida Coastal, which posted a 25 percent passage rate. Recall that its sister school, Charlotte Law, posted a [25 percent passage rate](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/law-schools-duel-for-the-worst-bar-exam-passage-rates-ever/) on the February 2017 administration of the North Carolina bar exam. Who knew two Infilaw schools could produce terrible twin passage rates?

You may be wondering why Cooley Law’s Tampa Bay campus is nowhere to be found on the list of Florida bar exam results. So were we. As we noted previously, Cooley has never been listed by name on the state’s bar exam results list, even though its inaugural class graduated in 2015. Today, we put in a call to the Florida Board of Bar Examiners and spoke with Executive Director Michelle Gavagni. She explained that Cooley Law’s results are lumped in with the results from non-Florida law schools, as it’s a campus of a law school that’s based in Michigan. The passage rate for all non-Florida law schools for the February 2017 exam was 41.3 percent. Although more recent data isn’t available, we found [Cooley Law’s combined passage rate](http://www.cooley.edu/publicinformation/_docs/2016_aba_standard_509_information.pdf#page=2) for the February and July 2015 administrations of the Florida bar exam — a solid 38.95 percent. Ouch.

Congratulations to all those who passed the Florida bar exam. For those who didn’t, don’t let it get you down too much — you’ve got a lot of company. Better luck next time.

# Biglaw Firm Cuts Associate And Staff Jobs In Latest Layoffs
## Cadwalader is letting associates go following 'performance reviews.'

Just when you thought that Biglaw firms may be putting an end playing “follow the leader” when it comes to layoffs, we have another firm that’s conducting layoffs. This time, the job cuts seem to be a mixture of both stealth and outright layoffs.

According to a report from the American Lawyer, the firm behind the latest round of layoffs is Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft. The firm brought in $544,832,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it in 84th place in the most recent Am Law 100 — an 11-spot drop thanks to a more than 10 percentage point decline in revenue.

The firm has cut ties with about 30 business professionals and 15 associates across all of its offices. Here are additional details:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Sources said the business professional ranks were slashed as the firm right-sized various roles, including legal assistants. Cadwalader saw redundancies and inefficiencies with its existing staff headcount as technology and more attorney self-help have created a lower need for those services, similar to staffing cuts at other firms.

As far as the attorneys are concerned, sources have said that their cuts were part of “annual performance reviews,” the corporate phrasing du jour for stealth layoffs. Curiously, “performance-based” decisions like these have resulted in job losses at several top-tier Biglaw firms in recent weeks, with one firm going to far as to claim that these were “not layoffs.” Hmm, this seems incredibly fishy to all of us here. If it walks, talks, and stinks like a stealth layoff, it’s a stealth layoff.

Best of luck to those who are being let go from Cadwalader.

# In-House Counsel, From Flat To Flow
## How do you measure your fulfillment at work?

For many of us who are in-house counsel, our career trajectories can look very different than at a firm. Compared to the rise from associate to partner to equity partner and beyond, there aren’t many rungs to climb at our usually flat organizations or within our legal departments of one or two. So if you’re a person who thrives on the climb alone or on attaining titles on your belt, going in-house should give you pause.

While I can’t deny that upward mobility at work has value to me, during my six years in-house, I have learned to focus less on the flatness of my company. Instead, I focus on growing my skills, knowledge, and influence. And I measure my fulfillment at work on how engaged and connected I am to what I call the “flow” of business. Here are some ideas on how you could do the same.

First, honestly assess your skills and come up with one that you want to work on for the next quarter, six months, or year. I’m a fan of choosing one to focus on because to have more can dilute your results. If you’re concerned that you’ll get bored with just one skill to focus on, my suggestion to you is to tailor how long it will be your focus, such as three, six or 12 months, instead of adding more than one at a time.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As with any goal, the more specific you can be, the better. For example, if you want to work on your communication skills — do you mean with clients, colleagues, your manager, or public speaking and presentations? To get some ideas on what to focus on, consider your prior performance reviews or asking a mentor or trusted colleague. Is there a particular leader you admire at the office? What skills do they have that you could learn or develop?

Next, consider what knowledge you want to acquire. Is it internal — such as a new product or line of business at your company? Or is it a new area of law or corporate focus like ESG? Natural curiosity helps here. If you’re looking for some inspiration, look beyond your company and consider where the excitement and energy is coming from in your industry. What are the current trends and future projections — and consider what you could learn through exploration.

Lastly, take the time to evaluate your relationships. Could you have stronger ties with your clients? Are you getting a seat at the tables that you want? Have you taken the time to get to know everyone on your team? Who do you want to get to know? Who do you want to know who you are and the work you do? If you’re not sure about the strength of your relationships, consider how and when you learn pertinent information. Are you one of the first or one of the last to know? Do you feel like people are open and honest and trust you or do you constantly have to ask and hunt for the information you need to be effective?

While this reflection exercise is not science by any means, with some focused efforts, working on specific skills, knowledge, and areas of influence can help you grow your career. And with some intention, the reality of a flat organization or legal department won’t feel stagnant, as you direct your energy to fueling your flow and personal growth.

# Shifting Dynamics In Law: The 2024 Guide To Navigating Legal Career Advances
## Discover the dynamic shifts and emerging opportunities in the legal industry as 2024 approaches, particularly in lateral attorney moves.

The legal industry is currently navigating a dynamic period, characterized by changes in lateral attorney moves. However, a closer look at the recent data suggests a market ripe with opportunities as we approach 2024.

Shifts in Lateral Moves: A Perspective

While 2023 witnessed a noticeable decline in associate lateral moves, dropping by 66% in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2022, this shift reflects a more nuanced legal hiring environment rather than a downturn. The legal market is adjusting after the unprecedented activity of the previous years, with total lateral moves still surpassing pre-pandemic levels. Specifically, there were 15,109 lateral moves in the third quarter of 2023, compared to the peaks of 2021 and 2022. This suggests a market adjusting to a new normal, rather than a significant decline​​​​.

Partner Moves and Regional Growth

Partner moves in 2023, while also experiencing a decrease, indicate a more subtle shift in the market. Cities like Philadelphia and San Francisco have seen the highest increases in partner moves, pointing towards regional growth opportunities. The second quarter of 2023 was notably the second busiest for partner moves since 2017, hinting at a resilient and adapting legal landscape​​​​.

Practice Areas with Steady Demand

Certain legal practice areas have demonstrated consistent demand, defying broader market trends. These include labor and employment, data privacy and cybersecurity, restructuring, intellectual property, and litigation. This sustained demand aligns with ongoing economic recovery and changes in legal service needs, presenting promising avenues for lawyers in these specialties​​.

Corporate and Transactional Areas: A Rebound on the Horizon

The corporate and transactional sectors, after facing setbacks, are showing signs of revival. This rebound, evidenced by recent M&A activity data, portends an optimistic outlook for 2024. As economic forecasts become more positive, these sectors are likely to see an uptick in hiring, creating potential opportunities for lawyers specializing in corporate and transactional law​​.

Looking Forward: Seizing Opportunities in 2024

As we approach 2024, the legal industry presents a landscape of opportunity and potential. The data and trends indicate that while some traditional paths may have slowed, new avenues are opening up, particularly in areas like labor and employment, data privacy, cybersecurity, and corporate transactional sectors. This period of adjustment is not just a challenge but a chance for forward-thinking lawyers to capitalize on the emerging trends and position themselves for success in a post-pandemic world.

# Cravath Hath Spoken -- And Beats Milbank For Senior Associates!
## Now, it's a party.

Cravath Swaine & Moore, the nominal Biglaw salary leader, has finally joined the party [Milbank started last week](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/).

Cravath has matched salaries along the [Milbank scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) for junior associates. For midlevel associates, the Cravath scale is a $5,000 bump up from where Milbank set the market, at senior levels the bump goes up to $10,000. And Cravath is giving out [special bonuses like Simpson Thacher](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/).

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Here’s the memo, sent to us by tipsters:

We are pleased to announce that the Firm will pay a special bonus and increase associate base salaries as follows:



Bonuses will be paid on June 29. An associate must be at the Firm on June 29 to be eligible for the bonus. Associates who have been with the Firm for only part of the year or are working part-time will receive a pro-rated portion of the applicable class-level bonus.

The base salary increase is effective July 1 and will be reflected in paychecks commencing on July 6. Summer associate salaries will also be increased to match the new first year associate weekly salary, effective July 1.

We would like to express the Firm’s appreciation for all your efforts.

Appreciation indeed. Cravath might be late to the game, but now that it’s here, we can expect nearly every other major Biglaw firm to follow. S&C will be here soon. Skadden, Davis Polk, Debevoise, they’re all coming now. This is the new Biglaw associate salary.

Which may or may not be a good thing for firms that don’t have Cravath’s flow. As with the last raise, Cravath could have blown other firms out of the water, and created real salary separation between, say, the top-50 firms and everybody else.

But why do that? Milbank was already out of the gate at $190K, many firms were following along, why spend money if you don’t have to?

On-campus recruiting is right around the corner. I assume most firms will get on this scale now, to make things right before they have to recruit new talent.

‘You want to go to law school?’ (photo of Donald Trump by Win McNamee/Getty)

To many, President Donald Trump is the cold-hearted Republican who threatens to lower taxes for the rich, brutalize immigrants, and rule us like a king. As individuals, they feel that there isn’t much they can do to stand up to him other than vote in the next election and in the meantime, attend a protest or two.

Then they saw lawyers nationwide band together [to fight Trump’s executive orders](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/the-day-the-lawyer-jokes-died/) banning certain immigrants. They saw the lawyers assemble at airports protecting immigrants from the overzealous border police. They took their cases before the courts, successfully convincing the judges that the executive order is unconstitutional and should be struck down.

These lawyers were considered heroes. And for the first time in a long while, lawyers in general were seen as role models and not as bloodsucking vampires. And this may continue to be the case for the next four to eight years.

For the young and idealistic, those who are jaded with their current careers, and those who hate President Trump for whatever reason, they may think that now would be a good time to become a lawyer and be part of the action.

There has a recent increase in LSAT and law school applications, with some speculating that it is partly in response to Trump. Some are calling it the [“Trump Bump.”](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=1202781563878/The-Trump-Bump-for-Law-Schools-Is-Kind-of-a-Thing) An increase in applications does not necessarily mean more people will go to law school, as some people apply to explore their options and use their acceptance letters as leverage for scholarships or job offers. But it is an indication of things to come.

Being a lawyer for the sole purpose of trolling President Trump seems very short-sighted considering he will be in office for eight years at most. Most are applying for the traditional reasons: political science majors, those who have no options with their liberal arts degrees other than degrading commission-only sales jobs, Saul Goodman fans, and those don’t want to practice law but are hoping that the LLM in Space Law will help them become a rocket scientist or an astrophysicist.

With that being said, going to law school because of President Trump is a stupid idea. It means you have done little research on law school and are going based on emotion. It makes no sense on a financial and practical level.

First, let’s look at the lawyer protests at the airports since that’s where most of the attention has been. Part of the reason lawyers are getting good press is because they were working for free. Everyone loves free lawyers. Can you imagine how the public would react if lawyers approached the frightened immigrants at the airport terminal with an attorney-client contract specifying their $250 hourly rate and requesting $2,500 upfront? I can hear the cries of the social justice warrior outrage: “How dare those greedy lawyers take advantage of the vulnerable!?”

If you are able to participate with the attorneys at the airport, you may learn ways to protect people from Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers who might force them to waive their rights and deport themselves. But other than that, I wouldn’t expect much more than a symbolic participation trophy or at least an admirable check-in post on Facebook. You see, the above doesn’t really translate well into a securities, banking or tax practice if you are gunning for Biglaw. It works if you want to be an immigration lawyer, although in a typical day, immigration attorneys’ encounters with ICE officers are not this up close and personal.

Also, let’s consider the time investment just to be a lawyer, typically three years in law school. During that time, you will not be spending too much time protesting because you will be too busy studying the nuances of the Uniform Commercial Code, the Parol Evidence Rule, and the Erie Doctrine. And by the time you graduate and pass the bar exam, Trump will be running for re-election.

As I mentioned before, [activists should not go to law school](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/4-types-of-people-who-shouldnt-go-to-law-school/) because they don’t have to be lawyers to make change. The three years spent in law school can be spent pursuing their social causes. In fact, the large student loan debt might limit their options and possibly force them to work for the dark side.

And speaking of student loans, I wouldn’t count on President Trump making student loan reform a high priority in his agenda. Unless you are savvy enough to negotiate a substantial tuition discount, frugal enough to limit your borrowing, and talented enough to land a high paying summer associate position, you will graduate with crushing six-figure law school and undergrad debt. Most of us are painfully aware that student loan debt is nearly nondischargeable in bankruptcy. Since President Trump has financially benefited from our bankruptcy laws on multiple occasions, I was hoping he would understand that making student loans dischargeable in bankruptcy would help make America great again. But now that it appears that most law school graduates (and most young people in general) will oppose President Trump to some degree, it doesn’t make sense for him to lighten their heavy financial burden.

So to those who want to be lawyers to fight President Trump, I understand where you’re coming from. Once you graduate from law school and pass the bar exam, you can do your part to represent an immigrant for free. But if you want to resist, there are other, less expensive ways to do it. When you graduate with limited job prospects and huge student loan debt, who do you think will get the last laugh?

Michael Potere

In late June, the Biglaw world was rocked by scandalous allegations against a former associate at Dentons. [Michael Potere](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-potere-92004b4/) had been fired by Dentons, and allegedly decided to [exact his revenge](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/biglaw-associate-arrested-over-plot-to-extort-partners/) against the firm by threatening to leak sensitive information taken from the email account of the managing director of the firm’s Los Angeles office (although no partner names have been released, this is most likely [Joel Siegel](https://www.dentons.com/en/joel-siegel)) — information that ranged from emails between partners to the firm’s quarterly financial reports to associate reviews — to Above the Law, unless he was paid $210,000 and given an expensive piece of artwork.

When we last checked in with Potere, he’d been charged with extortion, but had not yet entered a plea. One month has passed, and not only has Potere been indicted, but additional information about the case has been released.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Potere was indicted on extortion and attempted extortion affecting interstate commerce as well as transmitting threatening communications with intent to extort, and he faces up to 22 years in prison for these two felony charges. He pleaded not guilty to those felony charges yesterday, with the assistance of his public defender, Asal Akhondzadeh. (Yes, you read that correctly. A former Biglaw associate who once made a six-figure salary and allegedly threatened to extort his firm to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars is being represented in this matter by a public defender.)

Here’s some additional information from the [affidavit](https://www.law360.com/ip/articles/940253/dentons-ex-associate-pleads-not-guilty-to-extortion-plot) against Potere:

According to the affidavit, Potere had notified Dentons of his intention to return to graduate school in the fall to pursue a degree in political science and asked the firm to keep him on through the end of the summer, but the firm refused. Soon afterward, in April, Potere accessed the emails and searched for and downloaded confidential firm documents and items having to do with compensation, the criminal complaint says.

He told Dentons partners on May 17 that he might have compromising documents and stated his demands for $210,000 and a piece of artwork near the office of the managing partner whose emails he had accessed, among other items, according to the complaint. The FBI was notified two days later.

Potere, who’d worked at the firm since 2015 after working a brief stint at the Criminal Appeals Divison of the Illinois Attorney General’s Office, told the firm’s general counsel during a May 25 meeting that was recorded by the FBI that he’d chosen those course of action because he had “nothing to lose, it’s already been taken. It’s already gone.” Per the complaint, during that meeting, Potere suggested that he had information concerning a potential class action suit and a potential defamation action against the firm, and that such information could result in the dissolution of the firm.

On June 8, the firm’s GC spoke to Potere and told him that Dentons would agree to his demands in exchange for the documents he’d taken. At that meeting, on June 22, instead of receiving what he wanted, Potere was arrested.

Here’s a statement that has since been released by Dentons:

Dentons understands that Michael Potere, formerly an associate in our Los Angeles office, is the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation. We are cooperating with law enforcement and, as we do at all times, we have taken appropriate and necessary steps to protect the safety of our employees, the confidentiality of our clients, and the property of our firm.

Michael Potere was released on $25,000 bond, and contrary to his desire to prove to the firm that young people who were getting screwed can “screw back,” it looks like he’s still getting screwed. Better luck next time?

(Potere’s LinkedIn page is still online. Flip to the next page to check it out.)

# Vault's Top Law Firms By Practice Area And Region (2023)
## Which law firms are considered to be at the top of their game? Let's find out!

Vault recently released its closely watched rankings of [the nation’s 100 most prestigious law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/vault-100-rankings-the-most-prestigious-law-firms-in-america-2023/). It was there that we learned Cravath held onto its title as the most prestigious firm in America for the seventh year in a row, and that Davis Polk slid into the top 5 firms after cementing its role as a compensation leader in the Biglaw salary and bonus wars.

But what if your firm wasn’t top-ranked in the Vault 100? Perhaps your firm isn’t the most prestigious, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have clout. Some law firms reign supreme when it comes to certain practice areas, and others are known to dominate entire regions of the country.

Which law firms are considered to be at the top of their game by practice area and region in our post-pandemic world? Let’s find out!

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
For the purposes of the practice area ranking, Vault asked associates to vote for up to three firms they think of as the strongest in their own practice area, and the overall ranking indicates the firms that received the highest percentage of votes. Associates were not allowed to vote for their own firm. Pay attention, prospective laterals, because this ranking could be quite useful for you.

We’ve picked out a dozen of the practice areas that were ranked by Vault (you can see the full list by clicking [here](https://firsthand.co/best-companies-to-work-for/law/best-law-firms-in-each-practice-area)):

Appellate Litigation: Gibson Dunn

Bankruptcy: Kirkland & Ellis

Energy, Oil and Gas: Vinson & Elkins

General Commercial Litigation: Quinn Emanuel

General Corporate Practice: Cravath

Intellectual Property: Fish & Richardson

International: White & Case

Labor and Employment: Littler Mendelson

Private Equity: Kirkland & Ellis

Real Estate: Fried Frank

Securities: Davis Polk

Tax: Skadden

Next up, we’ve got a ranking that matters to those who think “location, location, location” is the most important thing in life. Vault’s regional rankings are based on votes tabulated from associates who were asked to rate firms on a 1 to 10 scale based on their prestige within the region.

Here’s the list of prestige by region from Vault (you can see the full list [here](https://firsthand.co/best-companies-to-work-for/law/best-law-firms-in-each-us-region)):

Atlanta: King & Spalding

Boston: Ropes & Gray

Chicago: Kirkland & Ellis

Florida: Holland & Knight

Mid-Atlantic: Skadden

Midwest: Kirkland & Ellis (replacing Jones Day)

Mountain States: Gibson Dunn & Crutcher

New York: Cravath (replacing Wachtell)

Northern California: Cooley

Pacific Northwest: Perkins Coie

South Atlantic: Alston & Bird

Southern California: Latham & Watkins

Texas: Vinson & Elkins

Washington, DC: Covington & Burling

Congratulations to the firms that moved up in this year’s practice area and regional rankings, and congratulations to all the firms that made the cut in the first place. It must be nice to see which firms associates consider as their peers in prestige, and it must be even nicer for partners to know whose pricing models they need to undercut the next time around.

# It's Hard To Be Your Best At Biglaw When You're Watching People Have Sex
## Attorneys at Covington find themselves distracted by, erm, inappropriate behavior.

Picture it: your Biglaw office, it’s late and you’re trying to edit the interrogatories for the third time. You just want to finish this largely thankless task so you can get home and binge watch some Fixer Upper, but what to your wandering eyes should appear but the distinct image of people knocking boots. No, you haven’t dozed off to sleep and this isn’t the start of a wet dream, but it’s folks living in a nearby office building that have thrown discretion to the wind and are locking legs and swapping gravy right in front of the window.

Now, while this specific scenario is fictional, it cuts pretty close to the bone for attorneys at Covington & Burling. People who live in The Apartments at CityCenter received the email below recently reminding them to close their blinds when they might be in a… delicate situation since building management has received complaints from their Biglaw neighbors.

In an incredibly awkward email, forwarded to Above the Law from a resident (though, hopefully, not one of the ones putting on a show), building management has to remind its residents to um, close the damn blinds:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Please be conscientious when opening your blinds to your apartment. The surrounding buildings such as the Covington, Conrad and other office buildings has [sic] reported that they have witnessed uncomfortable encounters that aren’t appropriate. If you have any questions or concerns about this matter, please do not hesitate to contact the front desk.

Warmest Regards,

The Apartments at CityCenter

 

Turns out fighting through the distraction of your neighbors’ exhibitionist tendencies is just another thing you have to deal with if you want to make it in Biglaw.

Fears about inflation have taken over in nearly every sector of life — from gas prices to food costs to the housing market. And now it’s a real concern for Biglaw.

That’s because, even though average billing rates for big firms went up in 2022, they’re not as generous a bump as in recent years. And the new rates are still below the inflation rate.  As [reported by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/08/22/firms-likely-to-make-course-corrections-as-inflation-challenges-billing/) Law.com:

While high-dollar corporate work has cooled and overall demand is flat, standard billing rates have risen 5.8% in 2022, according to a six-month report this week from Wells Fargo Private Bank Legal Specialty Group. That may seem like a significant increase, but it’s less than the standard increases the group calculated for 2020 (5.9%) and 2021 (6.7%).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And that 5.8% is less than the increase firm’s had been planning on — 6-7% — according to Joe Mendola, senior director of sales for the Wells Fargo group.

He said if firm leaders could have a mulligan this year, they’d probably try to raise billing rates higher. He said some firms conceivably could have implemented midyear increases, but that with a demand increase of only 0.2% overall, there probably weren’t that many that tried.

As inflation is usually less than rate hikes, Mendola speculates the current high inflation will be a factor in setting next year’s rates. “If you go back the last decade, inflation has been below standard rate increases for the legal industry, so I think that’ll be a bigger factor for when firms are budgeting for 2023,” he said. “And it would be my expectation that at the end of August next year, standard rate increases will be above what they were this time around. Particularly if you’re looking at inflation around 8%.”

Bill Josten, strategic content manager for Thomson Reuters, calls the inflation rates a “huge” issue for the industry, and that trying to keep billing rates 1-2% over inflation is unlikely to happen:

“Now, with inflation where it is, there’s no way to really keep rates above inflation. You could try to raise them at 1% to 2% points above inflation, but I don’t think the clients would be particularly happy about it. And in a market where we see this much volatility, and clients wrapping their head around ‘How do we do more with less?’ raising rates above inflation is not realistic.”

Josten also note firms should start looking for other places to make adjustments to stay profitable:

“I think that’s really more of what the index is telling us—take a look at potential warning signs there, make some course corrections,” he said. “And what those course corrections are going to be is different from firm to firm.

Direct expenses for law firms increased 12.4% in the second quarter of this year, while overhead increased 13.5%, according to that same report. Some of that is a result of low baselines last year while the industry was still coming out of total remote work.

It seems inevitable that Biglaw will remain profitable — though maybe not in the throw-money-at-associates way we’ve gotten used to over the last few years.

Locke McMurray

Co-parenting with a former spouse is not easy. And with the demands of a Biglaw job at a firm like Jones Day, well, there are a lot of obligations that must be juggled. You know, like heading to Paris with your new love interest.

According to court filings, [Locke McMurray](http://www.jonesday.com/lmcmurray/) left his two kids, aged 10 and 16, at home with his new paramour’s kids while they jetted off to Paris. Now his ex, Jennifer McMurray, is taking the issue to court, as [reported](http://nypost.com/2016/12/06/bigwig-lawyer-ditched-kids-for-trip-to-paris-with-girlfriend-suit/) by the New York Post:

Locke McMurray, a partner at the NY-D.C. firm Jones Day — where another partner, Donald McGahn, was recently named counsel to the Trump White House — allegedly let the 10 – and 16-year-old boys stay home alone in his apartment during his jaunt last January.

The childless trip was revealed only after his ex wife found online pics of him and gal pal Diana Rose Canlas enjoying the City of Light.

“I found out on Facebook,” Jennifer McMurray, told The Post.

Yikes.

After this incident Jennifer is seeking sole custody, instead of their current shared agreement:

The couple’s divorce agreement says the 52-year-old lawyer must notify his former spouse if he leaves town during his time with the boys, Jennifer said. He is also required to hire an adult babysitter, she said.

“He did not do any of those things,” she said.

The McMurrays had agreed to share custody of their boys when they finalized their divorce last year. But now Jennifer wants sole legal custody. She’s also wants the court to impose a $50,000 fine on her ex for breaking their divorce settlement.

# The Biglaw Firms That General Counsel Absolutely Adore
## Which Biglaw firms have forged the strongest relationships with their corporate clients?

Which Biglaw firm is most beloved by general counsel? That’s what the BTI Consulting Group set to find out with its latest Power Rankings. In case you’re unfamiliar with the BTI Power Rankings, they measure which law firms are best positioned with the most prestigious clients. These are either the firms that general counsel use as their go-to outside counsel, or in the alternative, the firms they recommend most to their peers. If a firm is able to woo a corporate client into such a state of bliss that general counsel both recommend that firm to peers and consider that firm to be a core firm, then it is one of the lucky few firms that has achieved a state of “clientopia,” having formed an ideal relationship with outside counsel.

According to the BTI Power Rankings report, which was compiled based on 960 in-depth telephone interviews that took place between March 2015 and February 2017, only 33 percent of general counsel find themselves in a state of “clientopia” with their go-to law firms.

Which Biglaw firms have forged the strongest relationships with their corporate clients? Which Biglaw firms have made their way into the paradise that is clientopia? Twenty-four firms stand out above all the rest, with the more ideal client relationships than any other firms.

If you’re disappointed that your firm didn’t make the list this year, there are some things you can improve upon. [Law360](https://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/944943/the-24-firms-gcs-love-the-most) (sub. req.) has more information:

The biggest area in which law firms are falling short from achieving client service bliss, according to BTI President Michael Rynowecer, is that many have a lack of understanding of their clients’ businesses, something he says is becoming “a bigger and bigger problem.”

“The average law firm only gets an eight out of 10 when it comes to understanding their clients’ businesses, and clients say that kind of understanding isn’t going to improve the nature of the legal advice they get, which needs to be put into a business context,” Rynowecer said. …

Law firms also often fall short when it comes to communication and the consistency of their client service, Rynowecer said.

“Clients want updates on where matters stand more often because they’re being asked to report more frequently to management on the business risks the company faces and what their status is,” he said.

If attorneys at your firm make more of an effort to better understand your clients’ businesses and provide them with more frequent updates, then you may find your place of work on this list next time around. Congratulations to all 24 firms that made the “clientopia” list. You’ve proven yourselves to be outstanding when it comes to making corporate clients happy, and that’s worth celebrating.

# A Holiday Most Fowl
## It’s hard to choose those who belong in what we shall call the 2020 Turkey Hall of Shame.

Happy Thanksgiving!

Sometimes it’s hard to choose what to have for Thanksgiving dinner, especially this year when things are unsettling and uneasy, and we’re cautioned to keep safe, mask up, and keep our distance. I love the Turkey Day sides, the stuffing (or dressing, depending upon location), the mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes in one form or another, at least two kinds of pie, and since there has to be a green vegetable, green bean casserole, which, in this form, doesn’t meet my definition of a vegetable. Plus, cranberry sauce, plus gravy. And rolls, in some form or another, for the inevitable next-day turkey sandwiches. Food coma, anyone?

I could not care less about the turkey; however it’s prepared, traditional baked in the oven, deep fried, spatch-cocked (look it up). What I do care about are the turkeys in our profession, and, as I think we all know, a slang definition of turkey includes the terms loser, naïve, stupid, inept, or all of them.

There have been so many this year that it’s hard to choose those who belong in what I shall call the 2020 Turkey Hall of Shame. I chose lawyers whose antics make any rational person (even a lawyer) question their sanity. What were they thinking? Do any of these turkeys deserve [the usual Thanksgiving holiday pardon](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-turkey-pardon-thanksgiving-corn-cob-2020-11-24/)?

How about this one? A Virginia attorney has been accused of cavorting with underage girls and engaging in sex trafficking. Normally, a defendant is “shocked, shocked” that a girl was underage. But [according to an affidavit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjbPi00k_ME) filed in the case, the attorney allegedly knew their ages.

The FBI is investigating the Texas Attorney General, Ken Paxton, as to whether his efforts to help a real estate developer and wealthy donor constituted bribery and abuse of office.  Several staffers in the Attorney General’s Office filed a whistleblower lawsuit against Paxton; those staffers have since resigned, been fired, or gone on leave. [Retaliation](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/526469-texas-attorney-general-under-investigation-by-fbi-report)?

A Florida lawyer must have skipped that part of the crimes class that discussed extortion. He’s been accused of shaking down an NFL player, DeAndre Baker, for $800,000. In exchange for the payment, the attorney’s clients would recant their stories that Baker was responsible for robbery and assault. So, instead of a case against Baker, William Dean, the Florida lawyer, who represented the “witnesses,” now faces [his own criminal case](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/16/sports/football/william-dean-extortion-giants-seahawks.html). Is this a delay of game penalty?

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
So much has been going on during the last month or so that the conduct of Jeffrey Toobin has not received much attention since his infamous Zoom call. The New Yorker has [fired him](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/11/media/jeffrey-toobin-fired-new-yorker/index.html) and he’s on leave from CNN for an unknown period. Watch your behavior on Zoom calls; you are not alone.

Define “disability.” Doesn’t that mean that you are unable to work, either temporarily or permanently, at your job? Apparently not. One attorney here in California who was receiving disability payments from the Federal Reserve System and the Social Security Administration has been well enough to work for Stanford University, two law firms, and three companies. The first law firm paid him almost $19K a month; the second and subsequent law firm paid him $175,000 a year. Where do I sign up? The attorney’s days of multiple dipping are over since he’s been [charged with wire fraud](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/former-federal-reserve-employee-charged-wire-fraud-connection-alleged-disability-fraud).

A 41-page ethics complaint has been lodged against an Ohio attorney who allegedly propositioned both existing and prospective clients. In one instance, he offered to represent a woman in a divorce case pro bono if she would clean his house … [in the nude](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/lawyer-is-accused-of-offering-legal-services-if-would-be-client-cleaned-his-home-in-the-nude?utm_source=maestro&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=weekly_email). All the allegations against the attorney are pre-COVID-19, but it makes me wonder if the attorney thought that housekeeping was worth the free legal representation even then and the subsequent ethics trouble.

Here’s another story about another Ohio lawyer who’s accused of running a sex trafficking ring for not just one or two years [but for 15](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/lawyer-is-charged-with-operating-sex-trafficking-ring-woman-says-no-one-ever-believed-her?utm_source=maestro&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=weekly_email). Is there something in the water in that state?

One victim said that no one believed her. The attorney’s quid pro quo was to get the women lighter sentences for drug offenses in exchange for prostitution. If convicted, he could receive up to 50 years in prison and since he is presently 74, we all know what that means.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

In Florida, the issue was which twin, Matthew or Christopher Brady, was responsible for filing an order full of typos, on a date when the court was closed, and which granted child custody to Matthew. The lawyer twin, Christopher Brady, already disbarred, faces five years in prison, having been convicted by a jury that did not believe that Matthew was the bad dude, although he claimed responsibility. Previously, Brady had broken into the law firm that fired him, using a rope from a truck to force open the firm’s front door, whereupon he and his accomplice made off with a safe and the computer server. Sounds a little like the gang who couldn’t shoot straight, and all [pilfering was caught on video](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/disbarred-lawyer-is-convicted-even-though-twin-took-responsibility-for-the-crime?utm_source=maestro&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=weekly_email). Disbarment followed.

Finally, on a lighter note, if you missed the story about the judges parodying the song “I’ll Be Back” from the musical sensation Hamilton, here it is: [Federal Judges Releasing Music Video About COVID Is Officially the Last Thing You Expected From 2020](https://d.docs.live.net/a670c69f30a455ad/Documents/ATL/Column%20for%2011-12-20.docx). It’s wonderful fun, and who knew that judges could sing? Usually it’s the defendants.

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

# Biglaw Firm Raises Salaries Again, This Time Going Up To $425K For Senior Associates
## Congratulations on the exciting news!

Look who’s back? Back again! Gunderson’s back. Tell a friend. Silicon Valley powerhouse Gunderson Dettmer — the OG of salary increases — is here with a second raise for its associates.

Last night, managing partner [David T. Young](https://www.gunder.com/david-t-young/) notified associates that they would be matching now prevailing Cravath salary scale. Here’s a nice little note from the firm:

[W]e once again thank you for your extraordinary efforts to provide clients with outstanding service, recruit talented new colleagues and contribute to the firm’s growth.

This is what the Cravath cash will look like at Gunderson:

Class of 2021 — $215,000

Class of 2020 — $225,000

Class of 2019 — $250,000

Class of 2018 — $295,000

Class of 2017 — $345,000

Class of 2016 — $370,000

Class of 2015 — $400,000

Class of 2014 — $415,000

Class of 2013 — $425,000

 

Once again, the firm is offering even higher salaries to its senior associates instead of sticking with $415K across the board for its most experienced attorneys. Only a handful of other firms have done this.

Salary increases at the firm will be retroactive to January 1, and associates will receive catch-up payments at the end of the month.

Congratulations to all U.S. associates at Gunderson!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Gunderson Dettmer.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Rudy Giuliani Hit With $550K Tax Lien
## He's in a financial tailspin, and the IRS is another creditor.

Last week, the IRS placed a tax lien on Rudy Giuliani’s condo in Palm Beach, Florida. It shows that he owes almost $550,000 for the year 2021.

The lien was signed by an IRS revenue officer, a specialist in collections. Recently, revenue officers have [stopped the practice](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/irs-collection-staff-will-stop-its-practice-of-surprise-taxpayer-visits/) of visiting a taxpayer unannounced. But that does not stop them from taking enforcement action such as issuing tax liens.

Let’s look at what a tax lien does to Giuliani and what he can do to remove the lien or at least minimize its effects.

The IRS (and state tax agencies) issues a Notice of Federal Tax Lien (NFTL) when a taxpayer has a large tax liability. The NFTL, like other liens, is a public notice of a taxpayer’s debt to the IRS. With a few exceptions, the NFTL attaches to all property the taxpayer owns although it has the most impact on real estate. According to the [Internal Revenue Manual](https://www.irs.gov/irm/part5/irm_05-012-002#idm140254801348032), an NFTL is typically filed when a taxpayer has a balance of over $10,000. However, in some cases, a lien can be avoided when the balance is under $25,000 and an installment agreement is set up.

Until recently, an NFTL would show up on a taxpayer’s credit report, which would negatively affect their credit score, making it harder for people to get loans. But in recent years, credit reporting bureaus stopped including tax liens due to reports that many of them could be incorrect. It also avoids the situation where a taxpayer seeking to get a loan from a bank to pay the tax debt but is likely to be denied, ironically due to the NFTL.

An NFTL is a matter of public record. This means that employers will see the tax lien during a background check. People with tax liens will have difficulty finding or keeping a job in finance or any job that involves handling money or sensitive information such as trade secrets. Also, you will get a seemingly endless amount of solicitations from companies and law and accounting firms offering to help settle your tax debt. And if you are a famous (or infamous) public figure, the news will report on it, which can damage your reputation, or in some cases worsen it. Sometimes the IRS might advise the taxpayers of this to incentivize the taxpayer to pay off the debt as soon as possible.

In most cases, the IRS will give the taxpayer some time to pay off the debt before issuing an NFTL. But in some cases can issue them quickly if they think that waiting could jeopardize their ability to collect.

Now that Giuliani is stuck with the tax lien, what can he do?

One option is to sell the condo. The NFTL was attached to his Florida condo, which is reported to be worth between $3 million and $4.5 million. Assuming there is enough equity in the condo, if it is sold, all or part of the proceeds will be used to pay the tax debt. In most cases, the IRS will not foreclose on a property, particularly if it is the taxpayer’s primary residence.

The other option is to work out a payment deal with the IRS. According to Giuliani’s representative, there is an installment agreement in place. However, setting up an installment agreement generally does not remove the lien.

Giuliani can also try to get the lien withdrawn. He can either do this by filing a Collection Due Process request within 30 days of the NFTL’s filing or by submitting a request to withdraw the NFTL. Generally, the IRS will remove an NFTL if it was filed in error, filed without proper procedures, or if removing the lien will be in the best interest of the government. Unfortunately, the IRS will rarely remove liens due to financial hardship.

The final option is to consider filing bankruptcy. But this is complicated. Income taxes are nondischargeable in bankruptcy for the three most recent years. Also, the tax returns for the years at issue must have been filed for at least two years. Also, the tax debt must have been assessed for at least 240 days (in other words, the IRS must have 240 days to collect). Certain actions can put collections on hold, extending the 240-day limit.

In addition, a bankruptcy does not remove the tax lien. In other words, if Giuliani sold the condo after the bankruptcy while the lien is still in place, the sale proceeds could be used to pay the balance unless the tax debt exceeds the collection statute of limitations, which is usually 10 years after the tax is assessed.

So why would Giuliani file bankruptcy despite the above hurdles? He appears to be in serious financial straits due to a number of lawsuits thrown his way. He is being sued for $1.3 million in [unpaid legal fees](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/rudy-giuliani-has-racked-up-some-pretty-impressive-legal-bills/). He is also being sued for [$10 million by a former employee](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12089633/Who-Noelle-Dunphy-woman-accusing-Rudy-Giuliani-sexual-assault.html) for harassment. He also did [not contest a defamation lawsuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/judge-beryl-howell-welcomes-rudy-to-the-find-out-phase-with-defamation-default-judgment/) which could lead to a default judgment. And just recently, [he was sued by Hunter Biden](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/hunter-biden-sues-rudy-giuliani-for-computer-hacking/) for hacking into his laptop. These potentially large judgments could incentivize Giuliani to file bankruptcy before these plaintiffs file liens of their own. Even if it means the tax debt still sticks.

Rudy Giuliani is in a financial tailspin and the IRS is another creditor. Even though the tax collector is late to the creditor party, its tax lien could give it the first bite on the upcoming feeding frenzy.

# The Best Law Schools For Getting A Biglaw Job (2023)
## This is a great way for current and prospective law students to gauge their employment prospects.

Rankings season is upon us, and many publications are rolling out their best offerings for readers’ perusal in advance of the release of the 2024 U.S. News & World Report Law School Rankings.

For more than a decade, Law.com has published a list of the best law schools to go to if you want to work in Biglaw after graduation. Law.com refers to these institutions of higher education as the “go-to law schools,” and this year, they’re ranked by the percentage of 2022 graduates who took associate positions at the 100 largest law firms based on attorney head count.

Before we get to the list of the go-to law schools, it’s worthwhile to speak about the landscape for entry-level employment in the legal profession. The class of 2022 actually did quite well when it came to securing Biglaw jobs. If you recall from our prior coverage, their success was historic.

That said, things are going great for the Top 10 Go-To Law Schools:

- Columbia: 66%
- Cornell: 64%
- Northwestern: 62%
- Penn: 56%
- U. Chicago: 56%
- USC: 53%
- Duke: 52%
- NYU: 50%
- Berkeley: 50%
- Vanderbilt: 48%
You can access the full list of the Top 50 Go-To Law Schools by clicking [here](https://www.law.com/2023/03/23/the-2023-top-50-go-to-law-schools/).

With 66 percent of its graduates heading to Biglaw firms after graduation, Columbia has ruled this ranking for the past 10 years. The top five schools look a little different from last year’s ranking, in that there was a lot of flip-flopping among Northwestern, Penn, and Cornell, with Chicago sneaking its way in by employing just a few more of its graduates in Biglaw than USC (a newcomer to the top 10 this year). Down goes Harvard! The elite school found itself at No. 10 last year, but now it’s gone from the top of the rankings entirely, sitting at No. 14. (It’s also worth mentioning that clerkship placements aren’t considered in this ranking, which is likely the reason why Stanford and Yale are both chilling at No. 20 and No. 26 on the list.)

Law.com also has a list of [“Firm Favorites,”](https://www.law.com/2023/03/23/2023-go-to-law-schools-firm-favorites/) noting the law schools that specific firms recruited most heavily from. Here are some highlights from that list:

Sullivan & Cromwell: Columbia (27)
Kirkland: Northwestern (26)
Latham: Georgetown (24)
Skadden: Columbia (22)
Gibson Dunn: Harvard (21)
Debevoise: Columbia (19)
Sidley: Northwestern (18)

Perhaps even more notable than these numbers are the tuition figures appended to this year’s rankings. Law school costs versus employment percentages can vary greatly. Unless you’re tied to a specific location, why pay ~$61,000 to go to a school that sends just under 40 percent of its graduates to Biglaw when you can spend ~$25,000 less to go to a school that sends about the same percentage of its graduates to Biglaw?

Either way you slice it, this list is incredibly useful. It’s a great way for law students, both current and prospective, to gauge their employment prospects. Use these rankings wisely — or ignore them, at your peril.

Former White House press secretary and gun regulation activist James Brady died last week. The coroner has apparently ruled Brady’s death a homicide. Nothing new happened, the coroner is simply saying that the bullet to the head that Brady took 33 years ago killed him. As murders go, this was an extremely long-tailed killing. Crim law professors of the world rejoice: life just delivered your next issue spotter.

But can a death three decades after a shooting open the door to a murder prosecution?

Has anyone ever asked John Hinckley Jr. his thoughts on Jodie Foster’s sexuality? I mean, he took pot shots at the President of the United States and now may well have successfully murdered someone to win the affections of a woman who publicly came out as a lesbian. That’s got to be very confusing.

Anyway, the fact that medical science has linked Brady’s death to Hinckley’s bullet has sparked discussion about a [murder trial for Hinckley](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/us/james-brady-s-death-ruled-a-homicide-police-say.html?_r=0):

The ruling could allow prosecutors in Washington, where Reagan and Mr. Brady were shot on March 30, 1981, by John W. Hinckley Jr., to reopen the case and charge Mr. Hinckley with murder. The United States attorney’s office said Friday that it was “reviewing the ruling on the death of Mr. Brady” and had no further comment.

Mr. Hinckley was found not guilty in 1982 by reason of insanity on charges ranging from attempted assassination of the president to possession of an unlicensed pistol. The verdict was met with such outrage that many states and the federal government altered laws to make it harder to use the insanity defense. Mr. Hinckley, now 59, has been a patient at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington since the trial.

Sure he was never tried for murder, but every underlying fact remains identical. Don’t we have some constitutional provision on that point?

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
There is no statute of limitations on murder charges, but any attempt to retry Mr. Hinckley would be a challenge for prosecutors, in part because he was ruled insane, said [Hugh Keefe](http://www.ltke.com/Attorneys/Hugh-F-Keefe.shtml), a Connecticut defense lawyer who taught trial advocacy at Yale University.

“They’re dead in the water,” Mr. Keefe said. “That’s the end of that case, because we have double jeopardy. He was tried; he was found not guilty based on insanity.”

But not everyone is convinced:

But George J. Terwilliger III, who was the assistant United States attorney in Washington when he wrote the search warrant for Mr. Hinckley’s hotel room, said there might be grounds for a new trial.

“Generally, a new homicide charge would be adjudicated on its merits without reference to a prior case,” said Mr. Terwilliger, who became a deputy attorney general under the elder President George Bush and is now in private practice. “The real challenge here would be to prove causation for the death.”

That would make for an unusual constitutional loophole, but then again this is a pretty unusual set of circumstances.

As for the factual question, the knee-jerk reaction among the press has been to cast doubt on just how sure a medical examiner could be that the cause of death of a 73-year-old man was a gunshot from 1981. But then again, today the [CSI effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSI_effect) is so powerful that a jury might just take the coroner’s office at its word.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Amazingly, this sort of long-tail killing [has come up before](http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/james-bradys-death-ruled-homicide-by-dc-medical-examiner/2014/08/08/686de224-1f41-11e4-82f9-2cd6fa8da5c4_story.html):

In 2007, a Pennsylvania man who had served 16 years for shooting a police officer in 1966 was arrested again and charged with murder after the officer’s death, which was ruled a homicide based on the bullet wound 41 years earlier. The man was tried by a jury and acquitted.

And in 2012, there was a shooting case in the District that was ruled a homicide when the victim died 23 years later. In that case, the shooter was serving an 85-year prison sentence. New charges were not filed.

Prosecutors will probably sit this one out. It just seems like there’s little advantage to reopening this can of worms and fighting uphill battles on tough legal and factual questions. Still, it’s best not to underestimate a prosecutor’s desire to pursue a high-profile case.

They guy may be trying to impress Ellen or something.

# Michael Flynn Thinks He's Going To Take On Covington & Burling? REALLY?
## It's a bold strategy, Cotton!

Michael Flynn will prove that he never did lie to the FBI if it’s the last thing he does! Sure they’ve got him on tape talking to the Russian ambassador about sanctions, then denying it when asked by those mean FBI agents. Yes, he did admit to it in his [plea deal](https://www.lawfareblog.com/michael-flynn-plea-agreement-documents) two years ago. And, okay, fine, he also allocuted to it under oath. TWICE.

But that was all because those rascals at his former law firm, a little mom-and-pop shop called Covington & Burling, gave him bad advice. So now he’d like to withdraw his plea based on ineffective assistance of counsel. And if that doesn’t work, maybe he’ll plead insanity.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
On Friday, Flynn and the government filed a [joint stipulation](https://www.usatoday.com/documents/6797180-Notice-of-Proposed-Order/) in which Flynn agreed to waive attorney-client privilege and allow prosecutors to interview Covington about Flynn’s ineffective counsel claims. It should be noted that U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan has gotten [a mite tetchy](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/after-judge-brings-up-treason-will-michael-flynn-be-getting-jail-time/) in the past when Flynn tried to deflect blame onto other people. But this time will be different, according to his new lawyer [Sidney Powell](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/is-michael-flynns-new-conspiracy-loving-lawyer-about-to-withdraw-his-guilty-plea/?rf=1), the only person in America who [tweets more](https://twitter.com/SidneyPowell1) than Donald Trump.

.[@GenFlynn](https://twitter.com/GenFlynn?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) motions to withdraw his plea because of ineffective assistance of counsel and dismissal of his case. When filed, the documents will be uploaded at [https://t.co/8PwG2zPFqy](https://t.co/8PwG2zPFqy)[@BarbaraRedgate](https://twitter.com/BarbaraRedgate?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@JosephJFlynn1](https://twitter.com/JosephJFlynn1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@flynn_neill](https://twitter.com/flynn_neill?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@GoJackFlynn](https://twitter.com/GoJackFlynn?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@Techno_Fog](https://twitter.com/Techno_Fog?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@SaraCarterDC](https://twitter.com/SaraCarterDC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)[#Flynn](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Flynn?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/4otUpqQWcC](https://t.co/4otUpqQWcC)

— Sidney Powell ????????⭐⭐⭐ (@SidneyPowell1) [March 6, 2020](https://twitter.com/SidneyPowell1/status/1235973774895386624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

If Flynn actually succeeds in withdrawing this plea, prosecutors will be free to use all of his statements to the FBI, including his proffer sessions, against him. And, although he wasn’t formally charged with it, Flynn admitted to violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act by failing to register his work for the Turkish government, both in his plea agreement and in [testimony](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.191592/gov.uscourts.dcd.191592.150.2.pdf) to the grand jury. Taken in this light, waiving the privilege and going to war with his former lawyers is probably not the dumbest thing Flynn’s ever done. But it ain’t exactly smart.

Those Covington guys gotta be shakin’ in their white shoes. Or maybe … not.

# Summer Associates Shouldn't Complete Fake Assignments
## Fake work doesn’t help summer associates evaluate what it is like to work at a law firm and discern if this is the right thing for them.

I usually like to write all of my articles on summer programs during the summer when organizers and participants of summer programs have the best chance to evaluate practices and implement improvements. However, I was just speaking with a colleague of mine about summer programs, and remembered a weird aspect of some summer programs. While most summer programs give summer associates real work to perform on behalf of clients, some summer programs do not. Indeed, from my experience, some summer programs give associates fake work either because they do not have real tasks for summer associates to perform or because they do not want summers to mess things up for clients. However, summer associates can complete fake assignments in law school, and they should be given real tasks when they work as summer associates.

I am not sure summer programs still give summer associates fake assignments, but this was definitely a phenomenon among summer programs around a decade ago. I personally did not handle fake assignments as a summer associate. If the firm did not have real client work to give me, they would give me assignments on pro bono matters, which I enjoyed.

However, I had one friend who worked as a summer associate at a top firm, and this person had to participate in a fake brief writing competition with the other summer associates at that firm. This friend also had to do a moot court competition, in which she argued the points in her mock brief before a panel of partners pretending to be judges. This friend told me the partners loved to play those roles! My friend lamented that this project did not give her the type of real-world practical experience that she hoped to gain after working as a summer associate.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
To be clear, I can understand why some summer programs might want to give fake assignments to summer associates and see how they perform on this work. It is very difficult to objectively evaluate summer associates. Each summer ordinarily completes different tasks, works for different partners, and has different experiences at a law firm. Some firms might make hiring decisions based on office politics or who they like more and not who can create the best work product.

However, partners can give all summer associates the same fake assignment and have a side-by-side comparison of how each summer associates did compared to the others. Moreover, law firms can theoretically make the process anonymous and score associates based on the quality of the work performed and not based on other subjective factors. Moreover, I bet some summer associates would buy into such a proposal since this helps ensure that the summer associate process is fairer for everyone involved.

Also, there is definitely a nontrivial chance that a summer associate will mess something up that could impact a client in unpredictable ways. It is no reach to say that summer associates may be more inclined to make a mistake than a seasoned lawyer who has handled similar matters in the past. In my own experience, I have witnessed summer associates and first-year associates making costly mistakes that likely would not have been made by more senior counsel. Law firms might want to avoid such an issue by giving summer associates fake assignments rather than real projects.

Moreover, I have heard that some clients refuse to pay for work billed by summer associates or might insist on paying far less for the time of summer associates than of full-time associates. Law firm managers might not want to waste projects on summer associates, for which they might not be paid, when they can give such projects to full-time associates and get full payment. However, with the right marketing, attorneys might be able to convince a client to pay for a summer associate’s work since this is at a discounted rate. However, some clients might not be persuaded into using summer associates for project in any circumstances, and this could make firms more likely to assign fake work to summers.

Nevertheless, the point of a summer program for many summer associates is to evaluate what it is like to work at a law firm and discern if this is the right thing for them. This is much more difficult if summer associates do not work on real legal matters. Even though law firms might be tempted to give summer associates fake projects, they should provide summers with real work so they can get practical experience in the legal profession.

[Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/morning-docket/)
# Morning Docket: 10.05.16
## * Who recently made partner at Kirkland & Ellis, Covington & Burling, Goodwin Procter, and Curtis Mallet-Prevost? Here's a nice round-up that highlights the names of the 112 associates who were promoted at these four firms. Don't be too shocked by that high number; the vast majority of partner promotions were made at Kirkland, where 81 attorneys were welcomed into the ranks of the firm's non-equity partnership. [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/who-made-partner-at-kirkland-covington-goodwin-and-curtis/)] * In what's hailed as a victory for gay rights, Massachusetts expanded the legal definition of the word ""parent"" to be read ""in a gender-neutral manner, to apply where a child is ‘born to [two people], is received into their joint home, and is held out by both as their own child.'"" The state's high court also allowed parentage laws to be construed to apply to members of same-sex couples without biological ties to the children. [[WSJ Law Blog](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/10/04/gay-rights-advocates-cheer-massachusetts-expansion-of-parental-rights/?ref=/blogs/law)] * Today, SCOTUS will hear arguments in a case challenging ""judge-made law,"" that is, what is and isn't considered insider trading. If you trade on information received from a third party who received it from an insider, is that insider trading? Even Mark Cuban wants to know, writing in an amicus brief that ""no one should be prosecuted for conduct that Congress is either unwilling or unable to define."" [[DealBook / New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/business/dealbook/supreme-court-case-to-test-prosecution-of-insider-trading.html)] * The Oklahoma Supreme Court struck down a law that forced abortion providers to save fetal tissue samples from patients younger than 14 years old, on top of other broad restrictions. The court unanimously ruled that the law violated the state constitution's ""one subject"" rule. In a separate concurrence, four judges would've struck down the law as an unconstitutional burden on a woman's right to have an abortion. [[Reuters](http://reuters.com/article/USLegal/idUSL2N1CA1AV?il=0)] * Much like America, the Supreme Court seems to have a problem with race this Term. The high court will be hearing three divisive cases having to do with racial slurs, racial rhetoric, and racial epithets, and the Court may very well be divided along ideological lines, resulting in 4-4 deadlocks thanks to the seat left vacant by the late Justice Antonin Scalia and the Senate's refusal to give Judge Merrick Garland a hearing.

Everyone on the West Coast today seems to be really excited about giving money to their associates hand over fist, because we’ve got an update from one of the most genteel California firms around. We’ve just been told that [Munger Tolles & Olson](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/munger-tolles-olson/), home to many former Supreme Court clerks and current Ninth Circuit judges, has raised associate salaries to match the new Cravath scale.

Tipsters tell us that the salary match was announced today at a firm lunch, and the news was met with cheers of joy and applause. A memo with the details of the match is forthcoming, but we’re told that it’s an exact Cravath match. As soon as we receive the firm’s internal pay-raise memorandum, we will post it here for readers to see.

Congratulations to everyone at Munger Tolles! What an exciting time to be an associate!

# Top 4 Causes Of Biglaw Injuries (My Best Guesses)
## What types of substandard conditions, injuries, and close calls have you seen or heard about in Biglaw?

So, I was enjoying my latest issue of must-read [Tulsa World ](http://www.tulsaworld.com/business/smallbusiness/father-s-fatal-fall-sparks-passion-for-workplace-safety/article_98f92ffc-d9d7-52aa-9001-0cf2f5f5acfc.html)with a cup of coffee last week when I noticed a short article about an entrepreneur who started a mobile app after his father fell from an oil derrick and was killed when his safety harness snapped. The app lets people report, in real time, three workplace safety problems: workplace injuries, “close calls” at work, and substandard workplace conditions.

He said that his key motivation for this enterprise is that “[w]e really want to understand what happened because we don’t want the next employee to be injured. … I knew that with better communication, with a better understanding of your workplace environment, that we could prevent workplace incidents.”

Sounds like a good idea to me.

As a litigator who does a good deal of employment-related work, that piece also nicely dovetailed with my review of a bar chart known as the [Liberty Mutual Workplace Safety Index](https://business.libertymutualgroup.com/business-insurance/Documents/Services/Workplace%20Safety%20Index.pdf) (“[Safety Index](https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2018/05/11/488752.htm)”). It’s a chart of the top 10 most disabling workplace injuries.

For example, #4 — “struck by object or equipment,” or #5 — “other exertions or bodily reactions.”

You get the drift.

Anyway, I got to thinking back to my times at Biglaw — and what types of substandard conditions and injuries I saw or heard about on the shop floor. And the causes.

And the “close calls.”

What if there was a central place — a Biglaw app, such as the Tulsa one, where Biglaw workplace incidents, “close calls,” and substandard conditions could be reported in real time. And what if there was a “Biglaw Safety Index” — the two could be joined and we could get a more complete picture of the varying degrees of safety risks at Biglaw.  And don’t kid yourself — there are plenty.

Hmmm …

Well, I am not aware of any “Biglaw app,” but a phone hotline will have to do in the meantime (or email). And there is no Safety Index just for Biglaw. (Maybe one of you Millennial geniuses can come up with an app and a safety index?)

Anyway, I took a guess as to what the top 4 Biglaw workplace injuries might be — based very scientifically on some of what I’ve heard second hand or experienced over the years — and was wondering whether witnessing or experiencing a workplace injury at Biglaw, and phoning it in, might go something as follows.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
- “Struck or Compressed By Object” (Safety Index #4 and #8)
Associate: Hi — is this the Biglaw App, I mean hotline? A partner at my firm just chucked a heavy paper weight at me and missed my head by inches. Does this count as a “workplace incident” or a “close call?” (NB: Based upon a real incident reported to me from a credible source some time ago).

Biglaw Hotline Safety Operator: Maybe both. Did a non-fatal injury occur?

Associate: Yes. After the paper weight whizzed by my head, I was so angry that I grabbed the partner by his collar and threw him against the wall. He was slightly injured, but it wasn’t fatal.

Biglaw Hotline Safety Operator: OK. Let’s break this down for statistical purposes. It was indeed a “close call” with the paper weight, but not a disabling injury under Safety Index No. 4 — “struck by object or equipment” — because he missed you.  Sorry.

On the other hand, if the paper weight had hit you in the head, you would have sufficed as being “struck” by an object, and maybe — depending upon how hard he threw it — you might have also qualified as having your head “compressed by an object.”  But that’s merely a hypothetical, of no moment to us.

However, your assault on the partner is indeed an “incident.”  Good work, you made the list.

- “Workplace substandard condition”
Associate:  I want to report substandard conditions in my workplace. I have been effectively locked in solitary confinement in a windowless room little bigger than a closet for 14 hours a day (or whatever works out to 2,400 billable hours per year). I am let out only once a day for a bathroom break and a quick walk around the floor, and then locked back in. They give me food after 10 p.m.

I feel like screaming!!  Can this be considered a #5 — a “bodily reaction?”  Is it a substandard condition?

Biglaw Hotline Safety Operator: Hmmmm. … It surely is a “bodily reaction,” but a “substandard condition?”  Nope, don’t think so.

“Substandard” means “deviating from or falling short of a standard or norm.” What you describe is well within the Biglaw “standard or norm.” In fact, it is the norm.

Your cell (I mean office) is climate controlled, right? You got food, right?  Some exercise?  You fall well within the U.S. Department of Prisons Guidelines and the UN Human Rights Protocols.

And only 2,200 hours? Why are you complaining, you’ve got it good. There are people cross town clamoring to take your job.

- “Workplace ‘close call’”
Associate: Please help!! 911!!!

Biglaw Hotline Safety Operator: This is not 911. It is the Biglaw substandard workplace condition hotline. What’s up?

Associate: I want to report a “close call.” A really close call. And it involves a “bodily reaction” and an “exertion” injury, I believe.

Biglaw Hotline Safety Operator: Go ahead.

Associate: After two months without a single day off, little sleep and no exercise, I was preparing to take off a day for the Memorial Day holiday weekend to visit my spouse and kids.  Right before I was to leave, the thought of taking a day off made me feel incredibly sick, and I had to bolt to the rest room. Surely a “bodily reaction,” right?

Upon my return, my officemate told me that the assigning partner was looking for me and like a shot I flew down three flights of stairs and hid in a closet for an hour. That was quite an “exertion” since I haven’t been to a gym in months — and a “close call,” huh?

Biglaw Hotline Safety Operator: OK, I’ll give you a “bodily reaction.”

But a “close call?”

Forget it.  A “close call” would be if as you were boarding a plane for Fiji for your first vacation in seven years you saw the assigning partner running towards you and as you feverishly tried to assist in closing the cabin door you almost got your fingers caught in it.

- “Workplace incident”
Associate: One of the known-bully partners was screaming at a young associate mercilessly — he stood there stoically and after this withering tirade, he went home — where he suffered a stroke. He’s OK, but boy, what an incident!!

Doesn’t this count — for something?

Biglaw Hotline Safety Operator:  Nope. Sorry, pal.  Didn’t take place in the workplace. Doesn’t count.

He should have had the stroke before he left the office — then, maybe, we could talk.

If you’re tuning in today to hear our thoughts on the leaked Dobbs opinion and what that means for the future of both reproductive rights and the entire superstructure of the 14th Amendment going forward… well, you’ll have to wait a week. Putting together a quality show takes time and that means we recorded this before that revelation. But that doesn’t mean there wasn’t a lot to cover! We have a breakdown of the latest Am Law 100 ranking of law firms, recaps of the “interesting” lawyering both in and before the Johnny Depp/Amber Heard trial, way too much talk about the legal woes facing Ron DeSantis as he goes after Disney, the racist standup career of Alex Jones’s lawyer, and some pointers on how and how not to report on legal news.

# Biglaw Firm Announces More Austerity Measures -- Attorney Layoffs And Salary Cuts
## Am Law 100 firm makes more austerity cuts.

After already announcing [monthly partner distributions would be capped and retirement benefits cut](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/am-law-100-firm-cuts-retirement-benefits-and-makes-other-cost-cutting-moves/), Dorsey & Whitney has gone back to the austerity measures drawing board. Yesterday, in a firmwide video call, additional cost-cutting — in the form of layoffs and salary cuts — were announced.

As a tipster at the firm tells Above the Law, the salary cuts are in ranges for those making over $150,000 and, in what many perceive as a change in course, announced an unspecified number of layoffs of both attorneys and staff:

Dorsey Whitney announced an unspecified number of terminations (attorneys and staff) and salary cuts in a video from the managing partner yesterday. Salary cuts are: 10-20% for income partners, 15-20% for of counsel, “generally” 15% for associates (with opportunity for true-up at end of year), 15-20% for management level staff making over $150k. No explanation was given for the vague ranges. The firm had been discussing the possibility of salary cuts for weeks and even solicited associate feedback on the matter, but had until now signaled strongly that they were not considering layoffs at this time.

And a shortened, virtual summer associate program and a delayed start for the new class of associates is also being implemented:

Additionally, early this morning, the incoming first year associates were informed that their start dates would be deferred to January 2021, and the summer associate class will be entirely virtual.

As[ reported by](https://www.law360.com/articles/1275355/dorsey-whitney-lays-off-attorneys-and-staff-reduces-pay) Law360, the firm provided comment on the cuts:

“After intense deliberation, we made these hard decisions so that we will continue to be a strong, efficient law firm,” Dorsey & Whitney managing partner Bill Stoeri said in a statement. “I am extremely grateful to all of those who have served the firm, and for those who will continue to work to serve our clients in this new environment.”

# Global Giant Finally Raises Salaries Across The U.S.
## Nine domestic markets are about to see an infusion of associate cash.

Earlier this morning, we [took a jab at Baker McKenzie](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/attorneys-are-fleeing-norton-rose-so-telling-everyone-theyre-evaluating-raises-doesnt-exactly-inspire-confidence/) for still dithering in the face of a clear market trend toward the $190K scale that Milbank kicked off at the beginning of June. While it’s entirely possible that the 4600+ attorney megafirm had already sorted out their anticipated raises and planned to roll out this news toward the end of the day, we think it’s much more likely that North Americas Managing Partner Colin Murray read our story and whipped up these raises over the last few hours.

In any event, we can now remove Baker McKenzie from our “Am Law 50 Salary MIA” list. The firm announced a match of the complete scale, as set forth by Cravath, as well as a summer bonus matching the Simpson bonuses. Baker McKenzie requires associates to have racked up 1000+ hours over the first six months to get the bonus, but the firm has the wisdom to recognize that some associates bill more on the tail end of the year, and commits to paying out the summer bonus at the end of the year — in addition to any holiday bonus — for associates who ultimately make their 2000+ hour requirement.

Baker McKenzie has nine offices in the United States — Chicago, Dallas, Houston, LA, Miami, New York, Palo Alto, San Francisco, and Washington — and all of them will be receiving this raise. Chalk another one up for the lucky stiffs in Dallas making the equivalent of $480K/year (give or take) relative to their NY counterparts.

Lawyers who are my age and older didn’t expect your law firm to do any of this. Lawyers coming out of law school expect every firm to do this.

— [William Shepherd](https://www.hklaw.com/en/professionals/s/shepherd-william-n), a partner at Holland & Knight’s West Palm Beach, Florida, and Washington, D.C., offices, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/02/09/with-wellness-at-the-top-of-mind-law-firms-expand-support-resources/) on the firm’s “early adoption” of a wealth of wellness programs. “We are trying to take it beyond just the lawyer down the hall,” he said. “Now it’s a focus on how can we make sure your family and loved ones can get these kinds of resources.” Not only is the firm is focusing on how Holland & Knight employees can get help from the firm for their family members who may be dealing with addiction and mental health issues, but it’s also offering meditation and mindfulness sessions, on top of its slate of nutrition and fitness programs.

# Women Law Students Are Pissed About The Biglaw Pay Disparity

This is what we know about partner compensation at Biglaw firms: overall, women partners are paid [44% less than their male counterparts](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/from-the-obvious-files-male-biglaw-partners-make-more-than-female-ones/). There is a [trend](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/biglaw-partner-alleges-sexism-derailed-her-career-in-a-new-lawsuit/?rf=1) of women [Biglaw partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/the-trend-continues-another-gender-bias-lawsuit-against-a-large-law-firm/) suing their firms [over gender discrimination](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/biglaw-firm-hit-with-100-million-class-action-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/?rf=1), including [lower pay allegations](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/biglaw-partner-files-class-action-lawsuit-over-male-dominated-culture/). If these facts aren’t enough to make you think something is wrong, well, you probably aren’t looking closely enough.

Law students understand something is foul in Biglaw. Karen Sloan at [Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/10/17/women-law-students-say-pay-disparity-is-systemic-problem/) spoke with law students at elite law schools, and they are disappointed in these stats.

“It’s unacceptable,” said Casey T.S. Jonas, a third-year student at the University of Virginia and president of the Virginia Law Women. “It’s yet another example of what the experience of a woman at a big law firm might be—that no matter how hard you work or how high you rise, you’re still going to see this pay gap, which is only one symptom of a greater issue.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The systemic nature of the issue is glaring, and discourages women from sticking around Biglaw to reach those highest levels.

Rose Kenerson and Caitlin Lackner, co-presidents of the Penn Law Women’s Association, see partnership promotions and the gender pay gap as interconnected problems. Some women leave law firms in part because they recognize that they won’t earn as much as their male colleague, they said.

“We think this could be a contributing factor in Big Law law firms having fewer women at the top of the pyramid, despite women making up half the population of most top law schools,” Kenerson said.

But despite the awareness of the issue, it may not stop people from traveling down the Biglaw path. The allure of MoneyLaw just may be too strong.

“I would doubt that people interested in going the Big Law route would be turned off on this,” Jonas said. “But I do wonder if there will be those who see that maybe there isn’t quite the payoff they were hoping for.”

# Being Boring Is Hard
## The legal industry won’t experience anything like WeWork’s $47B flameout, but that makes our problems more intractable.

If you want a microcosm of the schizophrenic, sugar-addled American economy in 2019, look no further than the rise and fall of WeWork. At the start of August, WeWork was a VC darling sporting a $47 billion valuation. Its eccentric CEO Adam Neumann was the subject of fawning press pieces focused on how he worked barefoot and forbade meat in the company headquarters. The company, which owned and marketed co-working spaces targeted at hip, urban, millennial entrepreneurs, seemed to have all the right buzzwords and demographics to remake commercial real estate in its image, and accomplish Neumann’s goal of being the world’s first trillionaire.

As Business Insider [compellingly documented](https://www.businessinsider.com/weworks-nightmare-ipo), though, it took all of six weeks for WeWork to come crashing down. The trigger was WeWork starting the IPO process mid-August. The IPO which was designed to get WeWork the funding needed to continue its expansion and continued domination of the shared workspace market. It may go down as WeWork’s undoing.

 WeWork WeWorked, Until It WeDidn’t

IPOs require disclosures, and when investors finally got a peek into the company’s otherwise opaque finances, they didn’t like what they saw. WeWork reported huge annual losses with no obvious path to profitability. The company’s commitments to future lease payments exceeded the income commitments they’d received from tenants by a factor of over 10:1. The Financial Times called its business model “magical thinking.”

Once the first concerns began to arise, the dam seemed to break, specifically around CEO Adam Neumann. Neumann’s many eccentricities had previously seemed like the sort of charming flavor we’ve come to expect from our Silicon Valley executives. New allegations that Neumann regularly smoked marijuana and did tequila shots on the job, though, seemed less colorful and more indicative of a toxic culture. Word also got out about Neumann’s prolific spending on personal real estate properties around the world, which only fed the indicia of mismanagement revealed in the disclosures.

In light of all the bad press, WeWork’s IPO flamed out. It suffered a major downgrade in valuation of both the company overall and bonds it had issued. Its primary investor is sweating bullets, with billions sunk into a suddenly precarious venture. Things got so bad the embattled CEO voted with the board in favor of his own removal.

It’s Hip To Be Square

We lawyers probably take some solace in the fact that nothing like what happened to WeWork is likely to happen to any law firm we work for. The legal industry tends to be a much less volatile, much less interesting sector of the economy. WeWork’s CEO spent $60 million of company money to buy a Gulfstream jet; most law firm managing partners I know are cautious about even submitting an Uber receipt for reimbursement.

Law firms are still carrying around the lessons they learned from the 2008 recession. We’re not splashing cash around on summer associate dinners at the [French Laundry](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/california/yountville/restaurant/the-french-laundry). We’re not going on wild spending sprees to hire lateral attorneys with unproven books. For many law firms, we don’t have to worry about cutting the fat because we’ve already done it.

And that, it turns out, may be a problem.

I had a chance to connect recently with Chris Ryan, the Managing Director of [HBR Consulting](https://www.hbrconsulting.com/) for his take on what strategies law firms can implement when the next recession hits. Chris noted that back in 2008, firms leaned heavily into cutting expenses. “They laid off administrative staff and attorneys, froze new hires, made significant cuts to overhead expenditures, and streamlined their operations.”

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Today, however, Chris noted those strategies aren’t likely to work as well as they did last time. “Much of the low hanging fruit in operations has been cut, so decisions may be much more difficult in the next downturn.” It’s easy to look at a company like WeWork and say, yeah, maybe don’t buy every intern a company Quarter Horse. Because today’s firms have been generally smarter about hiring and growth than they were in the mid-aughts, they don’t have those easy cuts to make when times get lean.

What Comes Next?

So, what is a management team looking to recession-proof their law firm to do? At the 30,000-foot level, it’s going to be either cut expenses, raise revenues, or both. Cutting expenses is generally easier to control, but finding places to cut is going to require getting technical and nerdy, diving[ deep into the weeds](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/revenge-of-the-nerds/) of the firm’s operations. Sitting down for a multi-hour technical review with the firm’s IT team to brainstorm ways to reduce the hosting costs of the firm’s document management system isn’t sexy, but it’s going to be the kind of effort needed to save your peoples’ money and jobs. We cut costs with an axe in 2008; now it’s time for the scalpel.

Raising revenues is the traditionally more challenging route, but it’s here I think law firms both face their biggest challenge and have their biggest opportunity. I’ve spoken at length in this column about the headwinds of increasing competition our once-insulated branch of the business world is starting to encounter. Non-traditional providers are taking more market share every year by offering structures and prices that law firms won’t.

If our customers are responding to these new offers, why not make them ourselves, and provide them the comfort of traditional law with the financial soundness of a modern business? Flat rate work in particular I suspect can be a huge area of growth for firms in the coming years. I recently attended a conference for firm management executives, and one team of law firm leaders out of the UK reported shifting as much as 50 percent of their work to flat rate pricing. One said, illuminatingly, “Why have we kept selling what our clients don’t want?” Doing this right requires careful attention to pricing, time investment, and technology. It’s otherwise too easy to underestimate the true costs of the services you’re providing and work yourself into bankruptcy.

I also maintain faith in us, in our profession, which is at heart more about personal relationships than price. There’s a faith placed in us that it’s hard for the competition to replace. We’re there for our clients in their most dire, difficult times. At our best, we’re secret-keepers and wise counselors. Those of us who can continue to forge and sustain those personal connections will always have work on their plate.

We’ve got three months left before we start a new decade. We might not know exactly what the future will contain, but I can promise you it won’t be boring. WeWork may be on its way out, but we’re still here, and our work is just beginning.

# Arnold & Porter Tries To 'Slip' One Past The Goalie, Gets Benchslapped For Its Efforts

Oh, the foibles of discovery are just the gift that keeps on giving, ya know?

The latest example of Biglaw discovery antics comes to us from the folks at Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer. They represent Endo Pharmaceuticals in New York’s multidefendant opioid trial. Former state appellate judge Joseph Maltese was appointed as a referee by Suffolk County Supreme Court Justice Jerry Garguilo to evaluate discovery disputes and it didn’t work out great for the Biglaw firm. Maltese recommended the award of costs and that Garguilo should consider monetary sanctions. So what exactly happened?

As it turns out, it wasn’t that they didn’t produce relevant documents, but that they were “deficient in not timely disclosing” them. The documents were stuff that A&P “should have known the full extent of” because they were sanctioned over similar issues in another litigation. As [reported by](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2021/10/15/referee-in-ny-opioid-litigation-recommends-award-of-costs-monetary-sanctions-against-arnold-porter-for-discovery-failures/) Law.com:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In August, the firm produced an email sent by a former Endo employee in 2009 in federal court in San Francisco but did not produce it in New York. It also “slipped…voluminous” documents into the federal multidistrict opioid litigation, Maltese found.

Maltese wrote that Arnold & Porter may have taken those steps “in the hope that the plaintiffs counsel was preoccupied with the ongoing trial to notice them.”

“Placing those documents in the federal MDL document database, while accessible to the plaintiffs’ counsel, did not give them or the Court timely notice of their existence for possible use in this trial,” Maltese wrote. “Therefore, APKS was deficient in not timely disclosing those documents. Consequently, all of the plaintiffs were prejudiced by this delay and accordingly, the Court should fashion an equitable remedy for this failure to timely disclose those documents.”

And though Maltese seemed none too pleased with A&P’s behavior, he said “it is not warranted or recommended” for Garguilo to discharge Arnold & Porter from the representation and he recommended against discharging A&P partner Pamela Yates, who was admitted pro hac vice for the case, and against referring Yates for discipline in California, where she is admitted. And in the firm’s statement, they are definitely leaning into whatever Ws they can:

“While we do not agree with all of the statements made in this report, we are gratified that the referee rejected the vast majority of plaintiffs’ unfounded allegations and attacks on the integrity of our firm,” the statement said.

But as you might imagine, the reaction from those on the other side of the caption is a different take:

From Pilot and Above The Law  
“Discovery gamesmanship will not be tolerated in [New York], especially when, as here, failure to provide relevant discovery directly prejudiced plaintiffs’ prosecution of its case,” said Jayne Conroy of Simmons Hanly Conroy, counsel for Suffolk County.

Paul Napoli of Napoli Shkolnik, who represents Nassau County, said the report “confirmed Arnold & Porter’s reprehensible conduct.”

“Today’s recommendation is the first step in holding the law firm and its lawyers accountable for hiding relevant documents of its client’s bad conduct,” he said.

And because the benchslap comes in the massive legal morass that is opioid litigation, Conroy — along with her co-counsel for the plaintiffs’ executive committee in the national prescription opioid litigation — said they expect there to be “grave ramifications” in other cases nationwide:

“Referee Justice Maltese’s decision will send shockwaves through all of the major defense firms in the opioid litigation, and spark similar recommendations in federal court and other jurisdictions where Endo is represented by APKS,” they said.

Ah, discovery sanctions — the stuff that dreams are made of.

“No! No more weird Web3 words,” my friend begged in response to my mentioning “phygital.”

The word phygital fuses “physical” and “digital” into one and refers to products, services, and experiences that blend the two worlds.

Ready or not, phygitals are quickly gaining traction as an exciting next-gen evolution of the digital and physical worlds. And, of course, they bring potential legal concerns that lawyers and businesses must consider.

How Do Phygitals Work?

Phygital is a relatively new name for combining the physical and digital worlds to create a seamless, integrated experience. Phygitals use virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and AI to enhance physical experiences. And they use physical elements to enhance digital experiences. 

For example, the Nike Fit app uses augmented reality to scan users’ feet and recommend the best shoe size. The Amazon Go store uses sensors and cameras to track customers’ purchases and charge them automatically as they leave the store.

Stores might allow customers to try on clothes virtually or provide product information through interactive displays. McDonald’s self-order kiosks are phygitals, as are QR codes and one-to-one online video calls, chats, and product tours with salespeople and real estate agents.

Phygitals can provide a more personalized customer experience, increase engagement and interactivity, and create new revenue streams for businesses. They’re great for helping companies offer experiences tailored to an individual’s preferences and behaviors. For example, a store may use facial recognition technology to identify returning customers and provide personalized product recommendations based on their prior purchases.

Manufacturers and corporations can use phygitals to optimize production processes and improve efficiency. Machine sensors can collect performance data and analyze areas for improvement. Sensors can track a product’s location and condition as it moves through the supply chain. Companies can enhance training by using VR to simulate real-world scenarios. The possibilities are endless.

What Are The Legal Concerns With Phygitals?

Phygitals that collect data about user behavior and preferences immediately trigger privacy concerns. Businesses must ensure they collect data in compliance with applicable laws and regulations such as GDPR or CCPA. This includes not storing personal data in public clouds and not transmitting personal data to third parties without user consent.

Accessibility can be an issue. Not all users have access to the technology required for phygital experiences, limiting their ability to participate fully. This could create issues around discrimination or exclusion if not addressed. 

Liability issues may arise if someone is injured or harmed during a phygital experience. If a user trips over an obstacle using an augmented reality headset in a store, the business may be liable for injuries.

Intellectual property rights are also a concern, as they often can be with digital products. Companies must be careful that a phygital experience doesn’t use copyrighted material without permission. And it’s not yet clear how to protect intellectual property while allowing users to remix or create new content for phygital experiences.

Take Steps To Mitigate Phygital Risks

Steps to mitigate these risks include: 

- Implement robust data privacy policies and practices
- Ensure all technology is monitored, secure, and up-to-date
- Consider whether [data lakes](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/data-lakes-and-data-warehouses-what-lawyers-need-to-know/) are appropriate for your organization
- Obtain proper permissions or licenses for copyrighted material
- Work to improve accessibility for all users
- Provide clear warnings or instructions to users regarding any potential hazards of participating in a phygital experience.
Phygitals are rapidly becoming part of the retail and marketing lexicon. Lawyers must ensure their clients use phygitals safely and responsibly as they become a significant part of the legal lexicon in the years to come.

# Am Law 100 Firm Rolls Back Its Salary Cuts, Offers Hope For Retroactive Pay

Another day, another Biglaw firm that’s decided to roll back its coronavirus crisis austerity measures. Back in April, Mintz Levin — a firm that found itself in [87th place](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=212&name=Mintz-Levin) in the latest Am Law 100 ranking — announced [compensation cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/mintz-levin-cuts/) ranging from 5 to 10 percent, depending on employees’ role within the firm, with partners shouldering a great deal of the firm’s financial burdens by holding back 40 percent of their distributions and reducing their draws by 5 to 10 percent.

Earlier this week, the firm announced via email (available in full on the following page) that it would be doing away with those cuts as of the October 23 payroll. Here are some additional remarks from Mintz Levin’s managing partner [Robert Bodian](https://www.mintz.com/our-people/robert-i-bodian):

The firm is doing well, and at the mid-year mark we are exceeding budget, and we were delighted to be able to make this change. There remains uncertainty, of course, in how events will impact the second half of our fiscal year, but we are hopeful that we will have sufficiently strong results at the end of the fiscal year to consider other adjustments, such as retroactive pay and discretionary bonuses (we already announced that the hours bonuses will be paid for fiscal 2021).

Congratulations to everyone at the firm on the good news. Let’s hope the folks at Mintz Levin see some retroactive pay by the end of 2020.

# Power Niche Marketing: A Great Example Of A Power Niche
## If banks can pull off Power Niches in their non-innovative and highly regulated industry, surely you can too.

You think you have problems being a lawyer or a law firm?  But consider how truly awful it must be to be a plain old bank?  It is one of the most boring businesses there is. And worse yet, the government has regulated all of the innovation out of this industry, and for a good reason. Basically, because the government is guaranteeing deposits, it doesn’t want innovation or creativity. It just wants banks to do what banks do, which is take in money and lend it out under highly regulated standards.

How could anyone follow [Peter Drucker](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/power-niche-marketing-always-start-with-peter-drucker/) or [Michael Porter](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/power-niche-marketing-moving-on-to-michael-porter/) or develop a Power Niche in such an industry?

My point – to be obvious here – is that if banks can develop Power Niches, then certainly we can as lawyers.

Watch….. I will start with Citigroup.

Citigroup is a great example. It is a huge bank, but can anyone reading this really distinguish it from JP Morgan or Wells Fargo or Bank of America?  Well, I guess you could remember that they all had different scandals and different degrees of misery during the global financial crisis, but otherwise there really is no way for the rest of us to know what is going on. They are just too big. So here is with Citi did……

What Citi did was pick a narrow segment of the business world — namely, us lawyers and especially the Biglaw firms. Citi reasoned that the major law firms have a lot of partners earning a lot of money and this would be a great place to get a lot of customers – not to mention referrals. They also did some background investigation and found that large law firms almost never fail to pay back their debts.

Then Citi staked out its Power Niche by saying that they were going to devote a great deal of focus to lawyers and major law firms. This meant:

They would learn everything they could about the legal world.

They would put on seminars where industry experts could come together and teach managing partners about managing the law firms.

They would assemble data from all the major law firms on profitability and other key metrics and make it available to their customer base.

They would offer advantageous terms to their law firm customers and the lawyers.

Effectively, they would put their vast empire of financial service business lines behind servicing the law firms.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
They would become a “go to” player in helping major law firms succeed.

And much much more…..

So what happened?  A classic Power Niche developed. Today Citi counts 85 percent of the Am Law 200 law firms as customers. It’s very difficult for other banks to challenge them in this niche since they are just too established. They not only know everything about how law firms are run, but they also know everyone in the industry as well.

As managing partner of my own (small-sized) law firm, I met with them a couple of years ago. Strangely, I felt sort of foolish that I was not working with them. Instead, we work with JP Morgan (which treats us extremely well, and I have only good things to say); however, how could I not be part of the Citi law firm machine?  At a minimum, I would miss out on critical data about my industry.

Interestingly – the “industry” that Citi is – brilliantly – focusing on is the legal industry and not the banking industry. Whether I like it or not, they are using their vantage point to know more about my industry than even I do!  And this is always the case when one builds up a Power Niche.

This is “so” obvious, in 20/20 hindsight. But think what they faced when they started. Focusing on lawyers probably sounded dumb to everyone. People probably said things like this:

Banking is banking. It is exactly the same for a law firm as an accounting        firm or pretty much any personal service industry.

This is a purely random idea that has no point to it.

Why lawyers – why not doctors or dentists?

And I am sure there were many more naysayers.

Another anecdote concerns Signature Bank. They were founded in New York City in 2001. Now you might think New York City might be a wee bit competitive in the banking industry – just a wee bit. But, somehow they are one of the fastest growing banks in the New York market and I think the second largest by lending volume in 2016. I ran into a business development fellow from Signature at a party a few months ago and asked him how they were doing it.

It took him three seconds to answer:  “we focus on niches.”

I smiled……

Finally, another banking Power Niche story illustrates my point. I have a friend at another major bank and all he focuses on is dentists. They are “killing” it in this niche he tells me.

So, if banks can pull off Power Niches in an industry as non-innovative and highly regulated as banking – surely you can pull it off in your industry.

And, can you see how simple this was to do?  All they did was chop up the industry “of their customers” into segments – or “niches” – and then created power in these niches. And – voilà – Power Niches!

# Biglaw Firm Announces Hundreds Of Buyouts And Layoffs, Almost 500 Affected
## What's the kindest way to tell an employee to pack up their crap and leave? With money!

We’re about to enter the fourth quarter of the year, and those who are intimately familiar with the inner workings of Biglaw firms know what that means: management will soon start thinking about or announcing layoffs in the hope of meeting the bottom line. Some firms, of course, offer kinder, gentler ways of ousting their employees in the form of voluntary buyouts. In the news this week is a Biglaw firm that recently announced up to 500 buyouts and layoffs.

Which firm could it be?

That would be Hogan Lovells, which recently decided to offer “voluntary retirement” packages to about 400 of its senior business support staff members in the U.S. Those who have been with the firm for at least five years were offered an out, and it’s expected that 5 to 10 percent of those who received the offer will take it. HoLove obviously plans show love to those who leave in the only way a Biglaw firm knows how — with money. [Legal Week](http://www.americanlawyer.com/top-stories/id=1202798366608/Hogan-Lovells-Offers-Voluntary-Retirement-to-400-US-Staffers?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=5) has some additional details:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Hogan Lovells said the decision had been taken in part due to a number of early retirement requests that it had received from business services staffers. The firm noted that it would be offering “enhanced terms” for those involved and that the move would enable Hogan Lovells “to look again at our business services roles and where we deliver those services from.”

In addition to the hundreds of voluntary buyouts Hogan Lovells is offering to business staff members here in America, the firm is set to cut up to 90 jobs in London thanks to a recent restructuring. Here’s more, from [Legal Week](http://www.americanlawyer.com/top-stories/id=1202798248669/Hogan-Lovells-Eyes-90-Job-Redundancies-in-UK-Restructuring?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=15):

Hogan Lovells said in a statement that the decision had been taken as part of a move to “build on the firm’s increased use of advanced technologies and legal project management.”

“This is part of our strategy to evolve our firm so it continues to meet our business needs as well as those of our clients in a rapidly changing and highly competitive market,” said Hogan Lovells deputy CEO David Hudd, who earlier this month [had his leadership term extended by two years](http://www.americanlawyer.com/home/id=1202797466587/Hogan-Lovells-Extends-Senior-Management-Terms). “We are fully committed to ensuring that our people are treated fairly and are fully supported throughout this process.”

We wish all of the legal professionals at Hogan Lovells the best of luck while they seek new job opportunities in the legal industry and beyond.

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)
Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Forget Bonuses, These Associates Just Got RAISES!
## At least one office outside of New York is about to get New York money.

Bonus season is exciting, but no matter how nice it is to get a little extra it’s always better to get your money guaranteed. So for these associates, Friday the 13th is turning out to be pretty lucky after all.

As the legal industry continues to flatten salaries across locations, Alston & Bird associates in the Charlotte office got the good news that they will now be paid per the prevailing NY Cravath scale for all classes. The bonuses remain discretionary, but at the end of the day there’s not much to complain about when you’re taking home $190K in Charlotte because the cost of living there is, shall we say, [cheaper](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/).

From Pilot and Above The Law  
The news was reportedly delivered via town hall so we don’t yet know if this is localized to the Charlotte office or if other non-NY markets are receiving identical news right now. If you’re an Alston & Bird associate in another office, drop us a line to let us know by email (tips@abovethelaw.com), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog))

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Is It Time For You To Move (Cities)?
## Moving your practice to another state is a difficult process, and one that you need not take alone.

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors. Andrew graduated from UCLA, and has worked for Lateral Link for five years, as a data analyst and product director. He has also previously worked as a Bioinformatics researcher for the John Wayne Cancer Institute. He is in avid mountaineer in his spare time.

Those who watched enviously as their friends and coworkers jetted off to escape last winter’s onslaught of sleet, snow, or storms, can attest that wanderlust should qualify as a basic tenet of the human condition. The desire to move is not novel, but it is becoming more feasible and commonplace as technology innovates in tandem. The days of practicing with one firm for your entire career are long gone. The intracity lateral movement that replaced it laid the foundation for the accelerating intercity lateral movement we see in the lateral market.

The idea of uprooting your life and practice for an untested lifestyle can be daunting. Firms are aware of this, and look at your ties to the region for assurance that you will stay long-term. In general, firms want to see that you have lived in your new potential city before, or that you have family or another compelling reason to be there. The stronger the ties, the better, but tenuous ties can be overcome with the right packaging. It is becoming more and more popular (and completely acceptable) for attorneys to move simply for a lifestyle change.

Firm openings in markets like Austin and Houston are attracting associates from other major markets, who seek relief from their comparatively onerous costs of living. New York associates in particular are having a hard time justifying the seemingly exponential differences in costs relative to most other major cities. For associates not on the partner track, the cost savings alone can be a parachute at that precipitous drop into the unknown “next.”

Using data from the Council For Community and Economic Research, we can see how disparate these differences really are.


Given the near ubiquitous nature of last year’s salary raises at Am Law 200 firms in major markets, the relative purchasing power of associates across the U.S. wildly varies. The equivalent of $500,000 in New York gives you the same purchasing power as $200,000 in Houston. The differences in locales cannot be compared strictly on a monetary level, as geographic differences also yield other benefits besides, for example, the option to give obscene amounts of money to James Dolan to watch the Knicks tank.

Vaguely generalizing, what money cannot buy you in law — outside of college admissions apparently — is opportunity. Historically, an associate in New York City has had the opportunity to work for some of the largest and most prestigious clients. The potential gains in partnership are massive, but the lifestyle demands can be equally severe in magnitude.

The increasing portability and globalization of business also means that New York is not as dominant a hub of business as it once was. Their corporate hegemony has diminished in light of the rise of powerhouse practices in what were once considered secondary markets. Startups and blue-chip tech companies are a large part of the impetus behind the growth of corporate and IP practices in Palo Alto, San Francisco, and in particular, Silicon Beach in Los Angeles. The opportunity exists in most major markets now to be the top partner in your practice.

As all attorneys know, the process of moving states can be long and arduous. The most significant of these roadblocks is the state bar. Navigating the seemingly convoluted rules that govern the admission process for each state can seem insurmountable, but it is not nearly as bad as it seems.

One of the rationales behind the system is that it discourages attorneys from cherry-picking the easiest bar exam, and then practicing in another state. The implementation of the Uniform Bar Exam (UBE) has restored some order to this chaos. Those who have sat for it in the 33 states that have implemented it know that it is not as uniform as it sounds. States have different criteria for passing rates, supplemental essay questions, and in some cases, additional classes required for admission. Additionally, the exam has an expiration date that varies by state. Regardless, it is a good step in the right direction for a national standard that increases an attorney’s ability to move or spread their practice to another state.


Navigating a cross-border lateral move can seem difficult. The rules for admission differ greatly by state. For states like California that have no reciprocity with any state, often a shortened bar exam (Attorney’s Examination) is available for attorneys who have practiced for at least four years.

Generally, the requirements for being hired are the same for local and out-of-state attorneys. Practicing in different markets can confer advantages that attorneys in that market do not have access to, like the ability to work on substantial matters or the ability to work with certain partners or within a certain prestigious practice group — similar to how every assistant coach for the San Antonio Spurs gets hired as a head coach.

Additionally, when moving cities, the conversation shifts from explaining why you are unsatisfied with your current firm, to why you want to settle in that particular city. It is in essence, a fresh start.

Moving your practice to another state is a difficult process, and one that you need not take alone. My colleagues have worked with hundreds of attorneys relocating not only across state lines, but international borders as well. Partnering with a recruiter lets you focus on the personal aspect of a relocation while we handle the business side — helping you negotiate a relocation package and navigate the cross-state complexities that arise during cross-border moves. Firms take our relocation submission seriously, because we stake our reputation and our business on successful lateral moves. If you are interested in relocating, or simply moving your practice to another firm, feel free to reach out to [our recruiters at Lateral Link](http://mainspringlegal.com/team).

It’s [becoming a trend.](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/parental-leave/) More and more Biglaw firms are realizing that they need to step up their parental leave game. Now, Paul Hastings has joined the party with gender neutral, extended paid leave.

The new program will be effective July 1, and includes 14 weeks paid parental leave for all new parents. Additionally, birthing parents will have up to an additional 8 weeks of leave, for a total of 22 weeks paid leave. Other key points of the improved program is that it applies to all legal and business professionals, and there are no longer any length of service requirements to enjoy the leave.

You can read the full announcement from managing partner [Greg Nitzkowski](http://www.paulhastings.com/professionals/details/gregnitzkowski) below:



Kudos to Paul Hastings on their new policy. Firms stepping up their family friend policies is something we’ll continue to pay attention to — particularly as we head into recruiting season.

The only thing you can do is cut costs and the number one cost is people. I imagine that some firms are going to find themselves in uncomfortable situations now and I just think that the reality is the longer this goes on the more cuts we’re going to see.

— [Bruce MacEwen](https://adamsmithesq.com/team/bruce-macewen/), owner and principal at law firm consultancy Adam Smith, Esq., commenting on the likelihood that [more people, lawyers and staff alike, will lose their jobs at Biglaw firms](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/law-firm-pay-cuts-to-continue-as-pandemic-worsens-in-u-s) the longer the coronavirus crisis continues. According to an [analysis performed by Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/law-firm-pay-cuts-to-continue-as-pandemic-worsens-in-u-s), 48 of the top 100 firms in the country instituted austerity measures due to the pandemic, be they equity partner payment reductions or delays, attorney and staff salary cuts, furloughs, or layoffs.

# Can You Share An Elevator With Your Adversaries?
## If lawyers are unable to share an elevator with their adversaries, they might want to rethink their practices.

When I was in law school, I thought that legal practitioners were professionals in every sense and that they treated each other with dignity and courtesy. In law school, no one mentions the gritty parts of legal practice, and surrounded by all of the mahogany walls and leather-bound books of law school, I thought that most lawyers get along with their adversaries. However, after interning for a judge the summer after my first year in law school, I quickly realized that adversaries do not always get along, and this is usually due to the friction inherent in the legal profession.

I interned for a criminal judge in Brooklyn, New York, and I had the opportunity to view counsel argue motions, present evidence to juries, and carry out other legal functions. One time, a defense lawyer and a prosecutor were arguing a motion before the judge for whom I interned. Although most interactions between defense lawyers and prosecutors I saw were cordial, this exchange was extremely tense.

That the lawyers did not get along was very clear to anyone watching. The court attorney told me that the bad blood between these two lawyers had been there for years, and if memory serves, it went back to when the two lawyers worked with each other some time ago. The lawyers could not look at each other directly, and the body language of each was incredibly hostile to the other. When the judge sided with one of the lawyers over the other, the victorious attorney let out a jubilant yell that was not typically uttered by professionals in court.

After the hearing, it was lunch time, so I headed to the elevators to go outside and grab something to eat. Standing next to the elevator bank were the same two lawyers I just saw in court. Often, adversaries will engage in small talk. Not these two. Each was looking at their BlackBerry (yes, this was when BlackBerries were popular) and facing in the opposite direction from the other.

When the elevator came, I stepped inside, expecting both lawyers would pile in as well. This did not occur. The lawyer who was closer got inside. The other feuding attorney just stood there with his nose in his BlackBerry trying not to acknowledge the existence of the other lawyer. For some reason, this image stuck with me throughout my legal career since it was such an archetype of lawyers who do not get along.

I am rarely the type of lawyer who cannot share an elevator with an adversary. I generally view the legal profession as brutal enough, and friction between adversaries should be avoided so that we do not create more stress than already exists between lawyers. Earlier this year, I had a contentious matter that was fiercely litigated. In the end, I did not get the result that I wanted, which is something that even the best lawyers need to deal with.

When it came time to leave the courthouse, I was waiting for the elevator to arrive, and my adversary came walking toward the elevator. When the doors opened, my adversary turned for the stairs as if it might be too awkward to ride down to the ground floor with me. I waved my adversary into the elevator since I got along with this adversary pretty well, and I did not think it would be particularly awkward to share an elevator with this lawyer. It feels like being able to share an elevator with my adversary is a pretty good measure of how I practice law, which is to build connections to adversaries and not create uneasy relationships.

In any event, there are reasons why you would not want to occupy the same space as an adversary, especially if attorneys are in court with clients. However, if lawyers are unable to share an elevator with their adversaries, they might want to rethink their practices. While some might believe that diligent representation requires conflict with an adversary that can boil over into interpersonal tensions, fostering a connection with counterparts is also vital to the practice of law.

# Fall Is The Perfect Time To Make A Lateral Move
## With the summer law school recruiting season over, firms turn their attention to lateral associate recruiting before the holiday season.

Ed. note: Please welcome Matt Moody to the pages of Above the Law. He’ll be writing about career advice for associates.

It’s October and we all know that brings cooler air, changing leaves, Halloween candy, and Pumpkin Spice Lattes. But what many Biglaw associates do not know, is that it also brings one of the best windows in which to make a lateral move.

In August and September firm recruiting resources are focused largely on filling their summer classes, but by fall that has mostly been sorted out and the recruiting personnel and lawyers can both focus on lateral associate hiring again. Firms are looking ahead to their needs in the new year and may have immediate needs now that the summer lull is over. Because many associates don’t even think about making any lateral moves until they’ve collected their bonuses, there are also fewer applicants for the positions that are open. Firms at this time of year will either be prepared to pay a full bonus if they want an associate to start this calendar year or they will make the hire with the expectation that the associate starts in the new year, so no one is expecting you to walk away from any bonuses you’ve earned.

Get your documents ready

So, what should you do to take advantage of the opportunity? First, make sure you have your documents in order. You’ll definitely need a resume and law school transcript, and it’s a good idea to have an updated deal sheet/matters list too. A good legal recruiter can help you edit your resume, but if doing it yourself, it should generally be one-page, list your experience above your education, and explain generally what sorts of matters you work on and your role in those matters. Law firms usually want to see law school transcripts, even for candidates who are pretty far removed from their law school days. Every firm differs on how much scrutiny they give those transcripts, but they’ll want to see them regardless. And deal sheets/matters lists can be very helpful to show both how busy you are and what sorts of matters you have been working on. Some firms will require them up front and others may ask for them later in the process, so it’s smart planning to have one at the ready.

Understand the market

You should also speak to a trusted recruiter about the state of the market. While the lateral hiring environment has not been as robust this year as in 2021 and 2022, things have started to pick up recently and there are more opportunities than one might assume. A good recruiter will listen to what you are looking for in a lateral move and present you with opportunities that align with your goals, and they will likely know of a few opportunities that aren’t necessarily out to the broader market. A scrupulous recruiter will also not send your materials to any firms without your express permission. Be sure to vet a recruiter before you work with them — ask them about similar candidates they have worked with in the past and what firms they place people into most often. You can certainly approach the market on your own or through friends, but you’ll be missing out on the knowledge and experience of a recruiter, and you’ll have to spend a significant amount of time managing your lateral process yourself. Recruiters are paid by the firms for successful placements, so working with a recruiter comes at no cost to the candidate, and large firms tend not to care whether a candidate has a recruiter’s fee attached to their candidacy.

If you’re considering making a lateral move in the new year, you should see if approaching the market this fall could make sense for you. This will allow you to essentially have two bites at the apple — you’ll be a candidate for positions open now and, if nothing pans out, you’ll still be able to approach new opportunities when associates start giving notice in January and new positions open. Talk to a knowledgeable recruiter who can advise you if this approach would make sense for your career!

[Matt Moody](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-j-moody/) is a Senior Consultant in Marsden Group’s New York office. He advises lawyers in a variety of practice areas as they consider lateral moves that will further their professional goals and places attorneys into leading law firms across the country. Prior to his career in recruitment, Matt served as the Senior Law Editor at Vault and as a litigation associate at two large law firms.

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Offers Market Bonuses, Depending On Office
## Bonuses at this firm are out, and they're right on track.

Biglaw bonus season is moving pretty quickly, with one firm after the next matching the prevailing market rate as a way to hold onto their best and brightest attorneys in this hot lateral market.

Perkins Coie — a firm that brought in $1,001,498,000 gross revenue in 2020, placing it at No. 42 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — is the latest firm to dole out bonuses to its associates. Bonuses at the firm are majority lockstep, and for most associates, it seems as if Perkins Coie is following where the market leads (depending on office).

Associates received a memo detailing special bonuses as well as salaries and year-end bonuses, depending on office location. All bonus-eligible attorneys in all offices (typically those who have billed 1950 hours or more) will receive a special bonus.

Salary increases and year-end bonuses are a little tricky. If you’re an associate in a major office, your salary and bonus will likely be within (or perhaps even above) market range. If you’re in less of a major market office, that’s where things take a turn — for senior associates.



We haven’t seen a salary and bonus table for Perkins Coie’s other offices. But sheesh… of all the times to offer high and low salary and bonus differentials, a talent war is not it. At least this isn’t happening in the firm’s major market offices, that we know of.

Above the Law’s 2020 Lawyer of the Year [Marc Elias](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/above-the-laws-2020-lawyer-of-the-year-contest-the-finalists/) is leaving Perkins Coie after 28 years to start his own firm focusing on preserving democracy in the United States. I don’t know if this counts as a lateral move, but it looks like some folks would have rather he’d maintained billables at his former firm and chain.

Rightwing trolls are in full panic mode this morning over the news that I am expanding my efforts to fight for democracy.????

[According to Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/democrat-elections-lawyer-elias-leaves-perkins-coie-starts-firm), Elias isn’t spinning off alone:

Elias is taking 13 lawyers, including 10 partners, with him from Perkins Coie, according to a statement released by the massive law firm Sunday. The move will allow the new Elias Law Group to “engage more directly in the political and electoral process,” Perkins Coie said in the statement.

Given his record, it’s no surprise Elias skipped right over a starting five and into an Oceans 13. The Perkins Coie political practice will carry on, and work with the new firm on voting rights cases, but it looks like a lot of the overtly Democratic Party work will be moving off the Perkins Coie books. [Am Law](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/08/23/star-democratic-party-attorney-marc-elias-is-leaving-perkins-coie-to-spin-off-new-firm/) has a comment from Elias on his big career move:

“The formation of Elias Law Group will allow us to more fully engage in representing our clients in the political process at this unique moment in history,” Elias said in a statement. “I look forward to continuing to work with Perkins Coie and want to thank the firm and its leadership for understanding and supporting us for the past decades and in this next step in our evolution.”

Given all he did while still working for the firm, I’m curious to find out what he’s capable of without, err, [differences of opinion amongst colleagues](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/biglaw-partner-email-perkins/). Guess we’ll find out September 2nd!

# DLA Piper Announces Black-Box Bonuses, And Associates Seem Really Angry
## The firm's bonus scale is so opaque that associates think it may be below market.

As 2020’s Biglaw bonus season begins to wind down, we’ve got to wonder: Is there anything worse than below-market bonuses? The answer to that question may very well be black-box bonuses. As opposed to offering the traditional, lockstep bonuses that most firms do, some firms shroud their bonuses in secrecy, leaving associates wondering if there’s something else they could have done to earn more money and if their firms have actually met the prevailing market standard.

One of the firms that uses the black-box bonus system is DLA Piper, a self-proclaimed market leader on compensation. This past fall, the firm announced that it would [not be offering its associates appreciation bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/dla-piper-announces-no-special-bonuses-for-hard-working-associates/) for all of their hard work during the pandemic. At the time, associates were livid, and now that the firm has finally announced its 2020 year-end bonus scale, let’s just say that associates were being polite when they referred to the firm’s financial moves as being “horseshit.”

Here’s an excerpt from DLA Piper’s brief bonus memo:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Bonuses again were determined based on seniority, Performance Rating (3, 4 or 5) and total bonus hours (including billable, billable equivalent, pro bono, shadowing, and knowledge management hours), with the largest bonuses awarded to the highest rated associates with the highest hours. Bonus amounts vary based on performance rating, and with incremental increases for bonus hours totaling 2150, 2300, and 2450. As we have previously communicated, we have modified our bonus program to enhance awards for our highest performing and most productive Associates in order to reaffirm our commitment to our Associates, and reward those Associates who have gone “above and beyond” our expectations. The total bonus pool for 2020 is materially greater than for 2019.

The firm’s total bonus pool may well be “materially greater” than it was for 2019, but associates who have reached out to Above the Law are angry. There aren’t enough adjectives to describe how unhappy they are with the bonuses they’ve received. Here are just a few of the comments we’ve received from associates:

DLA Piper bonuses finally announced via year-end assessment. Class of 2014, 2200+ hours, $102,000. Litigator in very busy practice. Extremely unhappy and will be talking to head hunters.

Individualized bonuses, but no special COVID bonuses. Baker reverses course on special bonuses, but DLA proves itself at least one tier below. Will be looking for a new firm in 2021 that pays market.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
No COVID bonuses. Disappointed to say the least. No longer can be considered a Vault 50 firm.

Associates still feel like management is trying to pull a fast one, especially with the proclamation that bonuses in 2020 were bigger and better than in 2019, but with most associates wondering why they weren’t seeing the money.

DLA Piper FINALLY released our official bonus information. And, it is both disappointing and impossible to figure out. I cannot begin to express how poorly this entire thing has been handled. After the last ATL article bashing the firm, management essentially went dark. They refused to communicate with the associates’ committee, they never provided us their “peer group” list they said they would and otherwise refused to engage. They never acknowledged the market bonus this year is Cravath scale plus special bonus even as basically every firm did so including even Baker McKenzie. They said they would make a decision once the year turned. Then they sent a very vague communication around the new year that they were still considering things. Then totally dark until yesterday.

Bonuses got released with an unbelievably vague email memo that says they are rewarding high performing high productivity associates to reaffirm their commitment to the associates and reward those who went above and beyond.

This is to use a legal word “hogwash.” I got a 4 rating on a 5 point scale with over 2000 hours. That is a very high rating in our firm and the firm says 3 ratings get market and 4s and 5s above market. Their memo provided no information whatsoever because they basically individualized bonuses to cover up that they did not give market bonuses. My overall bonus had a bit of a kicker over the Cravath scale, but that kicker was less than half of the special bonus scale for my level. My overall bonus was less than two years ago during the mid-year bonus year. They are just covering up that they are giving below market bonuses. The associates that I have heard of getting a full and true market bonus of Cravath scale plus DPW special bonus got high ratings plus had productivity in the range of 2,500 hours. So, basically the firm will say they paid market bonuses when it went to a tiny minority of associates. I think it might be something similar to what Hogan Lovells did. But again, it is impossible to even tell because they have kept it so hidden.

I believe it can all be summed up best by one of the comments in the last ATL article “absolute horseshit.” Opacity to cover up what they are doing, mendaciousness, lack of communication, obfuscation, and not matching the market.

Yikes. We’ve heard from approximately one associate who was pleased with his year-end bonus, who said, “Looks like DLA elected to give special bonuses after all. Rumor has it that you needed to hit certain performance thresholds to receive one but associates are much happier after seeing their official bonuses.”

So, if you billed your ass off during the pandemic and managed to earn a high performance rating, congratulations. It seems like DLA Piper may have handsomely rewarded those who did. If you came in just below the mark, you’re probably pretty upset — and reasonably so.

# In A Bid To Nab Top Talent, Biglaw Firm Introduces Work-From-Home Program

Weil Gotshal & Manges launched a program earlier this month designed to provide a great new perk to their midlevel and senior associates. Now third-year associates and above can work from home one day a week as part of a formal program.

As Weil’s executive partner, Barry Wolf, [told](https://www.law.com/2018/11/16/weil-gotshal-now-lets-associates-work-from-home-weekly/) Law.com, this is the kind of perk millennials expect from professional jobs. The firm is willing to put in the effort —- and cast aside the antiquated notion that attorneys needs to be chained to their desks in order to prove they have the chops to make it in Biglaw —- to make this program work and keep young attorneys happy:

“There are differences in the generations,” said Barry Wolf, the firm’s executive partner and chair of its management committee. “Millennials are a terrific generation … but they’re different.
….
“That’s what they’re used to,” Wolf said. “So it naturally would take some learning, some trying, some adapting for people now to understand that now you can work as efficiently and as well if someone is at home.”

Weil’s policy, which formalizes work-from-home arrangements up to one day a week, is one of the most generous we’ve heard about. Compare it to Sherman & Sterling’s work from home [policy](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/biglaw-firm-actually-does-something-about-worklife-balance/) which gives associates work-from-home flexibility twice a month.

What’s even more remarkable is this is the same firm that made an [April Fool’s joke ](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/04/biglaw-firm-makes-big-joke-out-of-worklife-balance/)out of work/life balance just a few years ago. I guess the notion that even Biglaw lawyers crave more balance in their lives is becoming mainstream. And if the firm garners a competitive advantage in the enternal battle for top talent by recognizing that, so much the better:

“We’re in a professional services business and our assets are our people,” Wolf said. “You need to attract and retain the best and brightest, and this is all in that effort.”

Congrats to midlevel and senior associates at Weil on this great new perk. Hope you enjoy working in your pajamas.

# What GCs Need To Know About Carbon Right Now
## If your company is large enough to have a general counsel, more factors at play will drive the need to measure and reduce your carbon footprint.

ESG and potential regulations requiring carbon reporting are all over the news. There are political arguments, heated debates, and misinformed statements. It can be tempting to tune it all out or file it away as “somebody else’s problem.” Unfortunately, if you are a general counsel, you can’t afford to take a pass on this topic.

There are real actions on carbon reporting and mitigations that general counsel must take today in order to protect the future of their company. To help you push through the noise, here is a primer on what you need to know now.

Your Company Will Be Required To Measure Its Carbon Footprint

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
This is not an “if,” it’s a “when.”

We’ve all seen the headlines about the proposed SEC rule to standardize carbon-related disclosures. You might be telling yourself “Those don’t apply to me. They are only for public companies. My company doesn’t need to get into carbon disclosures.” Think again.

If your company is large enough to have a general counsel, more factors at play will drive the need to measure and reduce your carbon footprint.

- Investors. If you are at a PE or investor-owned company, know that investors are already starting to ask for this data. More and more boards are considering carbon management as a part of their oversight duties. And investors know that a company’s carbon footprint could impact its exit prospects.
- Clients. If you are at a B2B company, your corporate clients will be asking for carbon measurements and mitigations (if they aren’t already). Clients who are adopting carbon reduction targets are required by carbon-accounting rules to collect data on emissions from across their value chain and drive reductions.
- Consumers. If you are at a B2C company, more and more consumers are demanding information on carbon. Sustainability is increasingly a consideration in buying decisions. In fact, some brands are already adding carbon labels to address this demand. Carbon data will become necessary to compete in large consumer markets like the United States and European Union.
- Talent. For many employees, a company’s commitment to sustainability is becoming a significant factor in where they choose to work. Interested in maintaining your talent pool? Measure, report on, and reduce your carbon footprint.

Measuring Your Company’s Carbon Footprint Will Take Time

Measuring your carbon footprint is not easy. Data from many disparate sources — factory emissions, fleet emissions, energy usage, travel data, emissions from purchased goods and services and more — is required. You will need to find someone who has a deep knowledge of carbon accounting, engage stakeholders across the business, and establish new processes and systems to collect and manage this data on an ongoing basis.

And don’t forget verification. If you are planning to share your carbon footprint data publicly, you should have it verified by an independent third party to avoid claims of greenwashing.

How much time will this take? It depends on the size of your business. If you have a simple low-carbon business and the resources you need — a good estimate is six months. If you are a large global company with complex emissions — it may take 18 months or more.

If you wait until you have an urgent need for your carbon footprint, you will be behind the eight-ball.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
What happens when your board suddenly demands carbon reporting data? I have seen boards give a six-week timeline for this information — which is impossible to accomplish. Your CEO will be in front of the board having to explain that it will take months to collect your company’s carbon data and why the executive team has not already addressed carbon management.

How about when your largest client goes to RFP and makes carbon reporting and reduction a key part of selection criteria? I can tell you what will happen next. Your sales team will email everyone in the company asking to have the data in a week. No dice. The best you will be able to do is submit a plan of action on carbon for the future.

The bottom line is that you need to start now.

You Will Find Unexpected Value

Once you have your carbon data, there is a lot you can do with it.

Carbon data often leads naturally to reduction plans, and many carbon reductions come with cost savings. Making your operations more energy efficient is a win/win from a financial perspective. Interested in reducing the cost of business travel? Carbon limits can provide strong motivation for changes in behavior. How about reducing waste by deploying circular economy techniques? Maybe you can find an opportunity to either re-sell your waste or reduce your disposal fees.

In addition, having a strong carbon-reduction program can make your goods and services more competitive in the marketplace. It will move you from being a laggard to being a leader. Add information on your carbon program to your website and pitch decks. Make it a reason to choose your company as a business partner.

You Can Do this!

Time for the best news of all. Measuring your company’s carbon may feel like foreign territory. But as general counsel, you have all the skills you need to succeed in this mission.

- Terminology. Lawyers are good at learning new words. And learning carbon-accounting terminology is the first step. Start by learning “greenhouse gas emissions,” “Scope 1,” “Scope 2,” and “Scope 3.”
- Advocacy. Moving your company to action when it comes to carbon is no easy task. I provided you with the outline of a business case in this article. Pull out the pieces that are relevant to your company and put those advocacy skills to work!
- Diplomacy. You will have to bring almost every part of the company on board for this journey. No problem. Your job already requires strong collaboration, and you know how to deal with all the key stakeholders diplomatically.
- Organization. You will need an action plan to coordinate multiple parties and steps. Think of the initial push as a large transaction. Bust out your Excel skills and start capturing all steps, timelines. and accountabilities.
Once your business leaders understand the “why” behind carbon measurement and reduction, everything will get easier. And as general counsel — you are in the perfect position to make this happen.

Are you inspired yet? If not, what’s holding you back? What will it take for you to drive this change?

# Latham Cancels The Rest Of Its Holiday Parties After Giving Everyone COVID

Honestly, I should have written this story on Wednesday because there was exactly ZERO chance it wasn’t happening. After a New York corporate group get-together ended with [at least 10 fully vaccinated associates contracting COVID](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/biglaw-holiday-party-turns-into-covid-outbreak/),[[1]](#f1)
Latham has suspended all future in-person holiday parties.

And so Latham will be Lathaming the rest of its parties. [Reuters has the scoop](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/major-law-firm-cancels-holiday-parties-after-covid-19-cases-tied-ny-bash-2021-12-09/):

“While we very much want to reconnect and celebrate the season together, the most important thing to us, now and throughout the pandemic, is the safety of our colleagues and their families,” Marc Jaffe, the managing partner of Latham’s New York office, said in a statement on the decision.

The firm didn’t say how many people attended the Dec. 2 party but said attendance was voluntary. An internal Latham email published by the legal blog Above The Law said attendees should not return to the office unless they have tested negative at least five days afterward.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Reading between the lines this means the firm HAD other in-person parties planned. As we said before, there’s nothing wrong with in-person events with a fully vaccinated workforce… but firms need to guard against a culture that would put undue pressure on associates to take risks at this juncture. COVID is still out there and surging right now, which may not be a problem for the vaccinated, but they can become carriers taking it home to kids or immunocompromised loved ones.  “Voluntary” firm events often cross the line into “Voluntold” events.

So, the firm did the right thing in closing up shop on the holiday get togethers for the time being. This is all horrible, but the firm has responded to this correctly at every turn.

We’ve not heard bonus news from Latham yet, but we’re also hearing a lot of chatter about a meeting where the firm told young associates that the class of 2021 wouldn’t be getting bonuses. We assume this means no “special bonuses,” which would put the firm in line with the market standard but we’ll see….
