# Court Docs Allege Biglaw Firm Made 'Undisguised Threat' To Potential Class Members
## The latest update in the Days Of Our Biglaw Lives saga...

Kerrie Campbell

Pretty much every single update to this story — the tale of a Biglaw partner suing in a purported [$100 million class action](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/biglaw-firm-hit-with-100-million-class-action-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/) over gender discrimination and unequal pay — starts the same: OMG, you will not believe what just happened!

That trend has continued in the latest round of insults traded in the case of Kerrie Campbell versus Chadbourne & Parke. [If you’ll recall](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/biglaw-firm-will-vote-to-oust-partner-suing-them-for-gender-discrimination/?rf=1), last week the Biglaw firm announced it was going to hold a partnership vote to officially oust Campbell from their ranks. Campbell’s lawyer, [David Sanford](https://sanfordheisler.com/team/david-sanford/), had his own strongly worded response to the press, and has followed that up with a motion seeking corrective action and related relief. Sanford calls the firm’s move to vote Campbell out of the tribe one designed to “demean and humiliate” her as well as “convey a direct and undisguised threat to the Firm’s other female partners” not to join the litigation:

Now, Chadbourne has administered the coup de grace with a vicious one-two blow. First, Chadbourne unilaterally cut off Ms. Campbell’s salary payments with no warning or explanation, leaving her without any income. Second, Chadbourne has publicly announced that it is scheduling a vote – now set for Wednesday, April 19, 2017 – to formally expel Ms. Campbell from the Firm.

In a press statement that the Firm distributed to reporters on April 5, 2017, Chadbourne makes no bones about the reasons for Ms. Campbell’s expulsion. Chadbourne explicitly connects the scheduled vote to this lawsuit and states that the Firm’s decision is “the inevitable result of the choices Ms. Campbell has made” in pursuing this case. It is highly unusual, if not unprecedented, to publicly announce an expulsion vote before it has occurred; and, here, Chadbourne contacted the press about its plans for a vote even before notifying the Firm’s partners. It is readily inferred that the purpose and effect of this communication was not only to demean and humiliate Ms. Campbell, but also to convey a direct and undisguised threat to the Firm’s other female partners: anyone who joins this action places her career and reputation in jeopardy.

The filing goes on to request the following:

1. A reasonable restriction on Defendants’ and their agents’ communications with potential class and collective action members about the Plaintiffs and this litigation.
2. Corrective notice informing female partners that they cannot be retaliated against for joining or participating in this lawsuit, that the Court is fully equipped to protect them from any actual or threatened retaliation, and that any such retaliation will not be tolerated.
3. An order suspending the expulsion vote for Ms. Campbell and otherwise prohibiting Defendants from taking or threatening retaliatory measures against Plaintiffs and potential opt-ins. If Defendants are permitted to carry through on their publicly-announced threats of retaliation, it will likely cement the chilling effect of these threats and ensure that no other female partner will pursue her claims against Chadbourne.
4. Equitable tolling on the claims of potential opt-ins.

It remains to be seen how the judge (and Chadbourne) will react to this latest development, but the latest update in the Days Of Our Biglaw Lives saga is keeping us on the edge of our chair.

UPDATE: A representative of the firm reached out to us with a comment on the latest development:

Over one year ago — long before she ever filed any lawsuit — Kerrie Campbell was advised for good and sufficient reasons to transfer her practice from Chadbourne & Parke LLP. She did not do so. It is time for the Firm to take the next step and hold a meeting of the partners to decide upon ending Ms. Campbell’s participation in the partnership. This event was entirely foreseeable and Ms. Campbell was well aware for some time that this step would be forthcoming. Plaintiffs’ effort to seek to stop an orderly expulsion proceeding, which conforms to the partnership agreement that Ms. Campbell herself signed, would have its own “chilling effect” on the right of partnerships to manage their own businesses and enforce their own contracts. Plaintiffs’ complaints about public communications regarding this matter can only be described as chutzpah. The Firm has not sought publicity on this suit. It has not initiated a single interview whereas both Ms. Campbell and her counsel have conducted numerous, ad hoc and ad hominem attack interviews in an obvious public relations offensive intended to deter the Firm from protecting itself from a partner like Ms. Campbell. This motion itself is another grandstanding measure by Ms. Campbell and her counsel, clearly written more for the press coverage they hope to receive than out of any real notion that the remedies they seek are justifiable or appropriate.

Jack Daniel’s may be crappy whiskey, but they’ve proven that they are willing to go to the Supreme Court to sue over their right to trademark it, bottle and all. Lower courts came to grips over determining if Jack Daniel’s v. VIP Products centered most heavily around parody and the right to free speech or trademark and the right to make a dollar. Today, the Supreme Court has decided which framing of the facts and law is most apropos — and yes, they came down on the side of the bigger monied company. From[ the opinion](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/22-148_3e04.pdf):

We hold only that it is not appropriate when the accused infringer has used a trademark to designate the source of its own goods—in other words, has used a trademark as a trademark. That kind of use falls within the heartland of trademark law, and does not receive special First Amendment protection…The use of a mark does not count as noncommercial just because it parodies, or otherwise comments on, another’s products.

The delineation between works that make a profit from their inspiration and ones that don’t is not the first time that the Court has dealt with this issue this term. In the recent Warhol case, Kagan and Sotomayor got into a petty — but [interesting](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/elena-kagan-footnote-withering-condemnation-warhol/) — spat about the importance that “transformation” ought play in cases where similar works of art could be used to the same end. If VIP got their way, the Rogers test would be the law that ought frame the dispute between Jack and the Non-Daniel’s bottle. The test is meant to balance the competing interests in respecting free speech on the one hand and trademarks on the other. Its first prong requires that the plaintiff show “that the challenged use of a mark ‘has no artistic relevance to the underlying work.’” I think that there is a parallel line of reasoning between determining what constitutes artistic relevance here and what would amount to a “transformative” take on an artist’s prior work in Warhol. The question of if there is and how VIP would have fared if they were able to get the Court on board with the Rogers test is moot though — they decided to bypass the issue completely and saw this squarely as a trademarking issue:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
[W]hatever Rogers’ merit—an issue on which this Court takes no position—it has always been a cabined doctrine: It has not insulated from ordinary trademark scrutiny the use of trademarks as trademarks.

…

The only question remaining is whether the Bad Spaniels trademarks are likely to cause confusion. Although VIP’s effort to parody Jack Daniel’s does not justify use of the Rogers test, it may make a difference in the standard trademark analysis. This Court remands that issue to the courts below.

In the short term, this is a green light for Jack Daniel’s to celebrate a little! For VIP, on the other hand, some times bull (dog terrier?) shit happens. Long term, much like with the outcome in Warhol, the effects that this Court’s jurisprudence on free use and parody remain unseen.

# Why Corporate-Versus-Corporate Lawsuits Are Frequently Undervalued
## Much like law firms, corporations operate under the premise that this quarter is the worst quarter in the history of the world.

Set aside for a moment cases that have no real plaintiff: Mass torts, for example, or securities fraud class actions. Someone is named as a plaintiff in those cases, but that person is largely irrelevant; the plaintiffs’ lawyers are calling the shots.

Set aside for a moment individual-versus-corporate lawsuits, where someone tripped and fell in the parking lot of a chain store or a corporation breached a product warranty. That’s routine litigation that generally garners little attention.

Think instead about a corporate-versus-corporate lawsuit: BigCo sues GiantCo for having done something wrong. And assume this is not an intellectual property dispute, where the game may operate differently.

Think about the internal politics of that corporate-versus-corporate situation.

At the outset, the situation is relatively uncommon; big corporations generally tend to find themselves on the bad side of the “v.”

Now assume that the end of the year is approaching.

In your law firm, at the end of each year, you’re told that this is the worst year (in terms of profitability) in the history of the world. The sky is falling! It’s absolutely imperative that every partner scramble to collect every nickel due to the firm before December 31. You must do this! It’s the worst year in the history of the world!

Of course you heard the same thing last year, and you’ll hear the same thing next year, and the year after that, and the year after that, and so on until the end of time.

It’s the nature of law firms.

Corporations are the same: This quarter is the worst quarter in the history of the world! What can we do to collect every nickel that is owed to us?

At the end of the year, it’s always particularly bad: This Q4 is the worst Q4 in the history of the world! And this year will be the worst year in the history of the world! (I know we told you the same thing last year, but we were kidding then.  This year really is the worst year in the history of the world. Believe me.)

So everyone’s sitting around in the executive suites fretting about how to bring money into the joint. One business says that it might be able to accelerate collections a little bit. Another business will try to close a deal that wasn’t supposed to close until next year.

And what can the general counsel, whose department only spends money, do for the team?

Well, there is that one plaintiff’s-side case that we’re pursuing.

What’s it worth?

It’s a big case. I figure if we let it play out, there’s a 60% chance that it would be worth $100 million to us three years from now, so I value the case at about $60 million.

Suppose you settled it by the end of this year, thus bringing in money this year?  (And remember, this year is the worst year in the history of the world!)

We wouldn’t get very much for the case — maybe $5 million.

Five million? That’s great! We could really use $5 million this year! In fact, we could use $3 million. I give you authority to settle the case before the end of the year for anything above $3 million.

The $60 million case is settled for $4 million.

Why are corporate-versus-corporate lawsuits frequently undervalued?

Just think about how corporations operate.

Taking its lead from Neil Gorsuch’s Supreme Court shenanigans, a Fifth Circuit panel [told attorneys to go maskless](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/federal-judges-ask-lawyer-appearing-before-them-to-remove-mask/). In Louisiana. The state that just edged past New York in COVID deaths per million. Though at least [some of its judges](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/not-everyone-on-the-fifth-circuit-is-anti-mask/) care enough about freedom to respect the judgment of counsel. Joe Rogan is still, unfortunately, in the news and he’s basically the poster child for how [little people seem to understand about free speech](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/neil-young-joe-rogan-discourse-proof-that-fascists-are-killing-free-speech/). Meanwhile, the Milbank raises still have a lot of notable holdouts. [When is the market going to catch up](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/why-havent-more-biglaw-firms-announced-raises/)?

Hooray! Another Biglaw firm has decided the weekend was a long enough wait to get behind the new prevailing market standard for associate salaries. In case you’ve been cut off from all things Biglaw since last Thursday, [Milbank announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/) they were upping the game on compensation, with associates receiving between a $10,000 and $20,000 bump, depending on seniority.

The latest firm to make a play in the associate compensation wars is WilmerHale. The firm, ranked 29th in the most recent Am Law 100, matched the new salary grid. That makes the new compensation scale as follows:

Class	Old Salary	New Salary
Class of 2021	$205K	$215K
Class of 2020	$215K	$225K
Class of 2019	$240K	$250K
Class of 2018	$275K	$285K

The HR manager is frantic about an employee issue that needs your attention right now. Sales needs updated versions of eight contracts by noon. It’s your turn to write a board report that is due in three days. Three weeks ago, the CEO asked you to rewrite the employee handbook to reflect the company’s growing DEI and ESG commitments. 

Your day is booked with calls till 6 p.m., when you’ll arrive at the city council meeting you’re part of, and you have 124 unopened emails in your inbox. 

Ding! Make that 125 unopened emails.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Years ago as a rookie GC, I quickly learned to delegate tasks (and entire projects when possible) to support professionals and other lawyers. It helps junior attorneys build specific expertise, and I would’ve been entirely overwhelmed otherwise. Here are three ways to make delegating smart and effective.

Reevaluate The Alleged Urgency Of Requests

Often, better communication is needed rather than a full-blown emergency response. Before prioritizing your to-do list, ask: 

- What are the sources of the given time constraints? As you’ll see below, it’s easy to overestimate the urgency of a request.
- Who could I talk with to inquire about adding flexibility to the project?
- Is there one part I can quickly complete while sending the rest to others to handle? 
- Can I change the scope of the project? 
- Who else can assist and perform these tasks?

Visually Supplement Your Communications

Succinctly declare your expectations for response and task completion times in your communications. Be specific and clear. And visually format your written delegation messages consistently to help readers see relevant details quickly. 

Set the information apart using a separate heading, bold font, or color. Underline or highlight it. Make your response and completion times stand out, and use the same format every time. Don’t hesitate to throw in an emoji or meme when it can help others laugh, smile, and understand you.

Visuals can help prevent [email urgency bias](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-12813-010). Research shows that receivers often overestimate how quickly senders expect responses to nonurgent work emails sent outside typical work hours, i.e., others may mistakenly claim urgency when there isn’t any.   

Use Technology To Track Tasks

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Some [84% of lawyers](https://www.artificiallawyer.com/2022/01/27/lawyers-live-in-their-inboxes-but-dashboard-legal-has-a-solution/) rely on email for task management, and 85% use email as a system of record for client projects. Nearly half ([45%](https://lawvu.com/the-connected-legal-function/the-2022-in-house-legal-technology-report/)) of 500 in-house legal counsel surveyed spend three or more hours a day managing their team, determining workload capacity, individual task status, and managing internal processes.

Why, when technology has long been available to streamline and automate the task management process? Relying on email alone is not only time-consuming and error-prone, but it also prevents you from tracking who does what, the types and volumes of tasks, and completion times. Data on these factors can help your team eliminate workflow bottlenecks and anticipate resource needs more accurately going forward.

Imagine getting more than three hours a day back. What would you do with it? Spend more time with family? Work on a passion project? Or tackle your overflowing inbox, which (ding!) is now up to 200 unopened emails?

# Who Will Match The Milbank Raise?

Milbank’s raised the bar for Biglaw associate salaries. The last time we saw a big salary bump, all the firms followed suit — even [the firms that probably shouldn’t have](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/crowell-moring-matches-wait-what-in-the-holy-hell-is-going-on-here/) and [the cities that definitely shouldn’t have](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/).

What will Milbank’s surprise salary increase do to the market over the coming weeks? You tell us.

Who Will Match The Milbank Raise?

- No One: The cheese stands alone.
- The Am Law 50: The elite know they can afford it.
- The Am Law 100: The lower half tries to keep up with the Jones Dayses
- The Am Law 200: Revenue figures be damned!
- Everyone, Everywhere: ""You get a raise, and you get a raise, and you get a raise!""
- OVER THE TOP: Cravath (or someone) will go to $200K because some people just want to see the world burn.

# Giddy Up! Associate Salaries Increasing Across Texas
## Texas firms are as generous as New York firms.

Welcome to the money party Texas! Though some Texas-based firms have already made a move, including [Vinson & Elkins](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/welcome-to-the-money-party-texas/) and [Baker Botts](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/look-who-decided-to-join-the-elite-biglaw-associate-compensation-scale/), now that Thompson & Knight has announced their raises, the Lone Star state’s dam may have finally broken.

The firm has announced a full match of the [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/)/[Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) scale. What makes this particularly noteworthy [is that back in 2016](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-raise-shy-of-the-cravath-scale/?rf=1) Thompson & Knight didn’t quite meet the industry standard as it applies to senior associates, but now, they are fully on board.


According to tipsters at the firm, there are also summer bonuses for associates — in excess of the going market rate:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
[The firm] generally gave out summer bonuses if associates were on pace to meet hours. Corporate associate bonuses were generally double Cravath (topping out at 45k for senior associates) and paid out half in July and half in December.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

[Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/morning-docket/)
# Morning Docket: 05.22.19
## * President Donald Trump has appealed a federal judge's order allowing the House Oversight and Reform Committee's subpoena of his financial records to the D.C. Circuit, where — GASP! — Merrick Garland serves as chief judge. The fact that Garland is involved apparently matters a lot to the MSM, you guys. [[The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/444792-merrick-garland-denied-supreme-court-spot-on-court-set-to-consider)] * “The memo says they don’t have to assert a legitimate legislative purpose — or any purpose at all.” According to a confidential draft IRS memo, tax returns must be given to Congress upon request, unless the president claims executive privilege. This pretty much blows up Trump’s rationale for refusing to turn over his taxes thus far, but opens up a whole new way for him to avoid doing so. [[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/confidential-draft-irs-memo-says-tax-returns-must-be-given-to-congress-unless-president-invokes-executive-privilege/2019/05/21/8ed41834-7b1c-11e9-8bb7-0fc796cf2ec0_story.html)] * “The Supreme Court is stacked against us for the first time in my lifetime. I feel like it’s scarier than ever before.” As hundreds of people protested state abortion bans before the Supreme Court, Democratic presidential candidates joined in, lending their support to all the women gathered. [[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-abortion-protest/hundreds-rally-at-u-s-supreme-court-calling-state-abortion-bans-as-step-backward-idUSKCN1SR1KG?il=0)] * Meet Leonard Leo, the Federalist Society executive Vice President who serves as Trump’s unofficial judicial adviser to make the federal judiciary “great” (i.e., extremely conservative) again. How’s he doing that? With millions upon millions of dollars of “dark money.” He didn’t want to talk about that part of it. [[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/leonard-leo-federalists-society-courts/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.5a2bf85b279b)] * Buckley, the law firm formerly known as Buckley Sandler, has filed suit against Johnny Depp, claiming that the actor skipped out on about $350K in legal fees and costs. Leave the poor man alone, he’s got better things to spend his money on... like scarves.

# Elon Musk Asks Court To Push Trial To 2023 Based On His Inability To Understand Statistics
## He complains about Twitter's sample size. That sample size probably dooms his 'materiality' claims.

The [opposition to Twitter’s motion to expedite](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2022/07/FirstMuskFiling.pdf) landed on Friday evening and asks to put off the trial until 2023, ironically to give him more time to prepare for the “complexities” occasioned by his demand for an accelerated “seller friendly” merger that he negotiated overnight while waiving most of his protections.

This isn’t [Starfield](https://www.pcgamer.com/of-course-starfield-is-delayedwhat-did-you-expect/), people.

Musk’s attorneys make one solid argument that may get them over the hump on this specific motion: Twitter’s claim that an expedited trial is necessary to beat the agreement’s termination clause makes no sense since that date is stayed due to the litigation.

But the filing is also a preview of Musk’s case in chief and it’s… mostly warmed-over whinging about the due diligence he wants despite expressly waiving due diligence in the agreement.

In a May 6 meeting with Twitter executives, Musk was flabbergasted to learn just how meager Twitter’s process was. Human reviewers randomly sampled 100 accounts per day (less than 0.00005% of daily users) and applied unidentified standards to somehow conclude every quarter for nearly three years that fewer than 5% of Twitter users were false or spam. That’s it. No automation, no AI, no machine learning.

Has this guy ever taken a statistics class?

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Because we routinely predict everything from elections to the public’s preference for Love Island off random samples of fractions of the population all the time. This is a sample size of 9,000 from a population of around 300 million accounts. Just assume the absolute worst on every quarter’s sampling for years and it’s not coming up with spam numbers substantial enough to constitute a material adverse effect.

Without reading Twitter’s summary of its methodology — which [apparently Musk didn’t either!](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/twitter-complaint-demonstrates-that-every-lawyer-everywhere-always-is-smarter-than-elon-musk/) — this sample is giving…



… Maybe 95 percent confidence with a margin of error of 1 percent or so? To get to 99 percent confidence, it’s maybe 1 and a half? That’s not going to be material.

But at least now we know where Musk gets the “100” number that he’s been tweeting about. While this may be functionally the same as Twitter’s claim that they sample 9,000 accounts per quarter, it’s disingenuous to say that Musk wasn’t blasting the number “100” in his tweets to suggest that Twitter only sampled 100 accounts total (which would be around a 10 percent margin of error and which still might not be material but it’s a hell of a lot closer and makes the case much more interesting factually if not legally).

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It also goes without saying that you don’t need to drag AI and machine learning into basic statistic sampling just because you’re a doofus who talks in technobabble.

It seems as though Musk thinks that some sort of AI system could get a “real” number by constantly scanning all of the 300+ million accounts. Perhaps. But “the juice isn’t worth the squeeze” as an economic modeling professor once told me. Building out and constantly running this hypothetical system — even if it worked perfectly — doesn’t give the company much more than the sampling does. Maybe they’d KNOW that spam bots really constitute 6 percent instead of 5 percent or something, but is it worth the cost and effort to get more clarity on a figure so immaterial to the company’s bottom line?

Alas, Musk seems to think this is necessary to complete the deal he explicitly agreed to complete without diligence. Twitter handed him “firehose” data for a comparable period so Musk could perform his fakakta machine learning tests on that, but he says that’s not enough.

The Firehose reflects all public Tweets and likes, but only approximately 30% of the accounts Twitter counts in mDAU interact with the platform in these ways.

Only public tweets? So… he doesn’t get to slide into the DM data? Does anyone actually care? Is that where the monetization is? Musk also claims that this data was not the actual firehose, but a “bespoke partial data set”… of 49 tebibytes?

But, again, none of this matters unless you accept the premise that it’s impossible to understand the likelihood of spam bots without checking in on every single account every day, which isn’t how stats work.

The core dispute over false and spam accounts is fundamental to Twitter’s value. It is also extremely fact and expert intensive, requiring substantial time for discovery

No, it doesn’t. Twitter has a sampling methodology that it’s used for years that consistently turns up a number below 5 percent. If Musk had issues with that, well, he shouldn’t have waived his rights to dig into it. As is, the only issue on the table should be “did Twitter perform the tests it claimed to perform in public filings and did those tests turn up these numbers?” That’s not fact or expert intensive. Even the restatements that the company made don’t necessarily make this a “complex” issue.

From the start, he announced his intent to “defeat” the “bots” that plague the platform, degrading the user experience…. Although Musk was aware there were bots, he was unaware that Twitter’s disclosures regarding mDAU were false.

This paragraph encapsulates the Musk conundrum. To make this work, he has to thread the needle of selling the argument that he fully believed bots were an insignificant number all along… and that’s why he publicly swore they were a huge problem that he alone could fix!

Honestly, this circular bot logic is the only complexity to this case. Either Twitter correctly represented the number of bots and Musk had no idea what he was talking about when he signed the agreement — which would defeat his efforts to get out of this deal — or Musk wanted to kill the bots because he knew Twitter was lying when he signed the agreement — which would defeat his efforts to get out of this deal.

Anecdotally, I’ll say I rarely interact with bots on Twitter. But I’m also not the world’s richest man with 100 million followers. I suspect Musk believes the bot problem is bigger than it is because he has a higher profile mega account and he can’t wrap his head around the idea that more bots are targeting him than the Twitterverse writ large. Which, in a way, also comes back to an overall failure to grasp statistics.

By the way, unrelated to the statistics issue, Musk also drops this superficially compelling, but ultimately irrelevant footnote, which functions as a microcosm for everything in this case.

With the sense of humor of a bot, Twitter claims that Musk is damaging the company with tweets like a Chuck Norris meme and a poop emoji. Twitter ignores that Musk is its second largest shareholder with a far greater economic stake than the entire Twitter board.

Yes, as a shareholder, Musk denigrating Twitter would hurt his own bottom line. But driving a $40 stock you already own down to $30 is a lot cheaper than having to spend $54.20 for a lot more $40 shares.

And that’s the whole problem with Musk’s case: it thrives in the realm of the superficial. “Why would he hurt his own investment?” sounds compelling until you realize it’s the cheaper option. “He just needs basic business data” sounds reasonable until you realize he specifically waived that when he was hot to get the deal done fast. There’s no way a Delaware court could order specific performance even if the buyer expressly agreed to it sounds… well, that actually sounds bad for him no matter how you slice it. Unless you’re [writing a dubious hot take](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/elon-musk-will-beat-twitter-wsj-says-its-obvious-assuming-you-change-every-single-fact-and-law/).

And, yes, sampling .00005 percent sounds bad. Until you run the numbers.

David Perla

Democracy can be challenging. Anyone watching political conventions for the past two weeks can see that.

I’ve also seen the principle up close in my work, where I’ve spent a career creating and delivering products and services to lawyers and law firms. Previously, as the founder of an outsourcing company, my world involved decision-making on offshoring large-scale legal projects; now, at Bloomberg Law, my world involves research and information tools and technology. In both cases, it has been fascinating to observe how law firms—which traditionally have a flat, democratic structure—go about making big decisions.

As I’ve watched the decision-making function (or, in some cases, dysfunction) of law firms, I’ve picked up a few things. For one, I have seen how frustrating it can be to both internal law firm staff, not to mention vendors, when a firm lacks a clear, identifiable decision maker. I’ve spoken with many exasperated librarians who would like to make purchasing or other decisions, but can’t get their ideas implemented because authority is so diffused or ambiguous. That’s just in my realm. In such firms, those responsible for systems acquisition, training, and similar areas are probably equally frustrated.

Of course, I’ve also learned that some firms are changing their structures. Increasingly, firms are vesting decision-making power with an executive director or chief operating officer. These administrators have varying degrees of authority, to be sure. But in some cases, the authority they hold is significant, and in many cases the individuals in those roles are non-lawyers.

I’ve been encouraged to see this development, frankly. But I only have my own perspective on the issue. For deeper insight on whether it is best for law firms to centralize leadership in a single individual, and if so who that individual should be, I called up three different law firm leaders.

The first leader I spoke to is the CEO of (and a partner at) an Am Law 100 law firm with offices in several major U.S. markets and a small international presence. The CEO’s message was clear: a non-lawyer could never be an effective leader of his firm. Lawyers simply aren’t going to listen to a non-lawyer, he said. Whether due to professional snobbery or the fact that administrators lack a partner’s ownership stake, the CEO took the view that a non-lawyer administrator could never garner the respect necessary to lead. He based this opinion, ultimately, on the fact that the lawyers hold the ultimate trump card: if they don’t like a decision, or series of decisions made over time, they can take their book of business and leave.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The second leader I spoke with is the executive director of an elite, global firm rooted here in the U.S. Unsurprisingly, the executive director, who is not a lawyer, had a more optimistic view of the possibilities for non-lawyer administrators. He explained that in the 1990s, when the headquarters region of his firm was struggling through the recession, the firm made a conscious decision to operate like a corporation rather than a federation of entrepreneurs. Among other things, the firm decided that when seeking business, it would pitch the firm, not individual attorneys. It defined core principles, like refusing billing discounts beyond a certain level. And it decided, well before most, to vest decision-making authority in a single figure who was, if not above the attorneys in the firm, apart from them.

What accounted for the vastly different experiences of these two leaders? The answer was revealed in my discussion with a third—the non-lawyer executive director of a regional law firm. Our conversation kept coming back to the same word, “culture,” which I realized holds the key. The CEO had acknowledged that a non-lawyer could be strong in a firm with a different culture than his own. He gave the example of a vastly larger firm, with a significantly more corporate feel. But another example is the second firm, which has worked to develop a culture in which partners think of the collective, rather than individual, success.

Each law firm must decide for themselves whether to discard more democratic leadership structures and follow that approach. I don’t have a horse in this race, but it may be instructive to look to the history of the second firm. When it made its management decision in the 90s, there was another equally large, peer firm headquartered in the same city. That firm has retained a more traditional structure. Today, the second firm’s profits per partner are among the highest in the country, and approximately 65% greater than those of its former peer. The executive director I spoke with attributed those decisions, made nearly two decades ago, to his firm’s success in far outpacing the revenue and profit growth of what were then its peer firms. And voluntary partner defections at the firm are among the lowest in the industry.

Finally, on the topic of culture, I was struck by the fact that each of the firms approached culture differently. One let it evolve organically, nudging and nurturing it in a desired direction; one changed it by conscious and deliberate action; and one concluded that it is immutable and had to be accommodated. Each had different results, both on the culture of the firm, its leadership approach, and its financial outcome.

Each of my conversations was enlightening, and I look forward to having more. But this much is clear to me already: what’s possible for any given firm is defined largely by its leadership model and by its approach to its own internal culture.

# Biglaw Firm Plans To Let Associates Bill For Being On Vacation
## It's a great way to encourage attorneys to unwind.

Picture it: You’re relaxed, sitting on the beach. Nothing more pressing going through your mind than which flavor daiquiri to try next. And all those hours are billable — and count towards your hours requirement.

That dream can be your reality at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner. The firm announced a new “time-off bonus” program, as [reported by](https://www.legalcheek.com/2023/01/bclp-offers-lawyers-time-off-bonuses/) Legal Cheek, and if attorneys hit certain bonus targets, they’ll be able to take a vacation and bill it to the firm. The initiative is designed to encourage associates to actually take a vacation and improve the well-being of the firm’s attorneys.

Co-chairs of the firm Lisa Mayhew and Steve Baumer said they “are very proud of our new global investment hours policy, which is focused on recognising and rewarding the wide range of valuable contributions made by our lawyers to BCLP’s culture and community.”

They added that the scheme had been “carefully designed to support the mental and physical health of those working at the firm, which sits directly in line with our firm values.”

Plus, for those who hit the “highest bonus eligibility target,” the firm will give them “cash vacation bonuses.”

Lloyd Stephenson, global director of inclusion and diversity and recruitment, had this to say about the program: “At BCLP we are looking to encourage a more holistic view of success and are pleased to be getting this broad policy in place firmwide. We see this as a great opportunity to ensure that our lawyers are taking the necessary breaks in order to protect their mental health while also contributing to the culture and long-term success of the firm behaviour.”

Additionally, up to 5% of an associate’s billing requirement can be devoted to non-client matters such as learning, diversity, well-being, knowledge, and innovation.

When it comes to associate well-being, it’s great to see a firm putting their billable hours where their mouth is.

# Vault 100 Rankings: The Most Prestigious Law Firms In America (2020)
## Money continues to matter most for Biglaw associates.

What do associates at major law firms care about more than money? Prestige, of course. But, at the end of the day, sometimes being a leader when it comes to compensation is enough to boost a firm’s prestige. As luck would have it, the closely watched Vault 100 rankings are here to remind lawyers at the nation’s largest law firms about exactly which ones are considered the most prestigious.

In last year’s Vault 100 rankings, Cravath — the firm that matched [Milbank’s $190K associate salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) last summer with [over-the-top monetary compensation](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) for senior associates — retained its number 1 slot after elbowing Wachtell Lipton out of the position it had held for 13 years in 2016. Was Cravath able to keep its cachet as the most prestigious Biglaw firm in the country in the latest Vault rankings?


Of course it was. Here’s what Mary Kate Sheridan, Vault’s senior law editor, [had to say](https://www.vault.com/blogs/vaults-law-blog-legal-careers-and-industry-news/vault-laws-2020-prestige-rankings-are-here) about Cravath’s placement in the latest rankings: “Cravath has become synonymous with ‘prestige,’ and its position as the nation’s top law firm is a combination of its high-profile work and industry influence. The firm is recognized as having the best corporate practice in the country, and its litigators are hard to match. On top of its elite practices, the firm continually sets the compensation scale and has defined associate hiring and training as we know them.” Sorry, Wachtell, but Cravath is now .377 points more prestigious than your firm.

Although Cravath and Wachtell kept their first- and second-place spots in the latest edition of the Vault rankings, there was some movement in the middle of the Top 10. Without any further ado, here are the Top 10 Most Prestigious Law Firms based on Vault’s Annual Associate Survey for 2020:

- [Cravath, Swaine & Moore](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/cravath-swaine-moore-llp) (no change)
- [Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/wachtell-lipton-rosen-katz) (no change)
- [Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/skadden-arps-slate-meagher-flom-llp-and-affiliates) (no change)
- [Sullivan & Cromwell](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/sullivan-cromwell-llp) (no change)
- [Latham & Watkins](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/latham-watkins-llp) (no change)
- [Kirkland & Ellis](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/kirkland-ellis-llp) (+2)
- [Davis Polk & Wardwell](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/davis-polk-wardwell) (-1)
- [Simpson Thacher & Bartlett](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/simpson-thacher-bartlett-llp) (-1)
- [Gibson Dunn & Crutcher](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/gibson-dunn-crutcher-llp) (no change)
- [Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/paul-weiss-rifkind-wharton-garrison-llp) (no change)
There was one noteworthy move within the Top 10. Kirkland, a firm that’s doing so well that it just held a meeting to let everyone know its [partners are rolling around in money](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/biglaw-firm-holds-firm-meeting-to-say-theyre-making-tons-of-money-and-wont-be-giving-it-to-associates-kirkland/), hopped over DPW and Simpson Thacher to claim the #6 spot. Outside of the Top 10, Milbank, which was ranked at No. 40 last year, soared to No. 25 this time around, with Vault survey respondents careful to remember how the firm affected their bank accounts with comments like: “Milbank scale,” “gave me a raise,” “market leader,” and last, but certainly not least, “Milbank more like thrill-bank.”

Congratulations to all of the Biglaw firms that made the latest edition of the Vault 100 rankings.

# Reinventing The Law Business: A Potential Impediment to Growth, Culture, And Client Development (Part 1)
## As a law firm grows, how can lawyers -- especially firm leaders -- keep track of everything going on?

Consider if you start your own firm as a solo practice. The bad news is – well, you presumably know the limitations and I don’t have to go into them. The good news is that you know everything that is going on at your firm. You know the clients, the worries, the concerns. You know everything. There is no issue about information flow and how to deal with it.

Then you add a partner. Things are still pretty good if you sit near each other and you are friends – you hear about everything and you each know everything the other one is doing.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Maybe at some point you have five partners and ten associates. At that point everyone doesn’t know everything but probably the managing partner knows pretty much everything that is going on so it is sort of okay.

But at some point it just breaks down. There are just too many things for a single brain to keep track of. What happens then?

I follow this back in my mind over the years. I used to know every single detail. And even a few years ago I kind of knew what everyone was doing and what was going on. But now I have about 35 partners – about 35 associates – over 400 clients – and probably 250 to 500 active matters in the firm at one time. I am the managing partner but it is completely impossible for me to know what is going on. Yikes!

There are (at least) two problems that flow from this situation.

The obvious first problem is that I don’t know if bad things are happening, even though I am responsible for them. For all I know a partner is abusing an associate – a lawyer is mistreating a client – or any of a myriad of bad stuff is going on.

Yet I am “the face of the firm.” People, within and without, expect that I somehow “know” what is happening. I am for sure “responsible” whether or not I actually “know” what is happening. But this first problem is that I no longer now have the ability to really know everything, so I am in a quandary.

The second problem is even harder to solve. How does each lawyer know what the other lawyers are doing? This is a pernicious issue and has numerous repercussions. For example, if lawyer A doesn’t know that lawyer B is an expert in widget law, she will miss the opportunity when the client says to lawyer A, “I wish I could find a widget lawyer somehow…..”

More subtly, the culture misses out on opportunities to build when people don’t really have ways to know what others are doing so they find it hard to relate to each other or build together. For example, if one person is hugely “into” a cultural issue (take your pick of one) but doesn’t know anyone else is “into” the same issue, these parties miss out on the opportunity to get “together” on something that would foster firm loyalty, friendship, etc.

These foregoing items might not sound like a big deal in any particular instance; however, if you multiply them a thousand-fold it becomes obvious that the firm is missing out on literally zillions of upside and opportunities – and without even realizing it.

However, it can get much worse. These two problems, if not dealt with (somehow), can result in people feeling like they are just a tiny silo in a major organization and feel zero connectedness to the mother ship. This for the reason that the mother ship isn’t mothering them.

So what’s a mother to do……?

I admit I don’t have a great answer here to either problem, but I have been devoting serious thought to both of these issues and I will write about them in my next two articles. However, since I don’t have an answer, being very honest, I am hoping someone will [email me](mailto:thehedgehoglawyer@gmail.com?subject=Your%20ATL%20column) with some magical solutions that I can not only put in the next articles, but also use myself at Duval & Stachenfeld.

# Biglaw Firm Impresses Associates (And Staff) With Enhanced Parental Leave Policy
## Wow! Which firm just rolled out a fully paid, gender-neutral policy, with additional time off?

One by one, Biglaw firms across the country have realized that in order to recruit and retain the best talent, they need to offer the best perks and policies for a progressive new generation of lawyers. That may be why yet another firm has decided to truly support its attorneys — and staff members — who are embarking upon the fantastic journey into parenthood.

Which firm is the latest to modernize its parental leave policies? That would be Shearman & Sterling, which recently announced that effective September 1, a new, gender-neutral leave policy would be implemented, ensuring that attorneys and staff members alike will receive additional time off following the birth, adoption, or fostering of their new child.

Female attorneys working in the firm’s U.S. offices used to receive 18 weeks of maternity leave, but now, primary caregivers in the U.S. will receive up to 20 weeks of paid leave. The firm will also be providing primary caregivers among the ranks of its staff up to 14 weeks of paid leave; previously, the firm offered up to six weeks of paid leave to its salaried staff members, and no leave time for its hourly staffers. For secondary caregivers, S&S is offering eight weeks of paid, gender-neutral “new child care leave”; in the past, the firm offered only four weeks of paid paternity leave.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Sherman & Sterling joins several other Biglaw firms (like [Fried Frank](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/biglaw-firm-updates-parental-leave-policy-to-address-unique-challenges-new-parents-face/), [Orrick](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/leader-in-biglaw-parental-leave-further-expands-its-already-unprecedented-benefits/), and [Winston & Strawn](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/biglaw-firm-makes-big-waves-with-gender-neutral-parental-leave-policy/), for example) that have recently adopted enhanced, gender-neutral parental leave plans, and [a handful of other firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/which-firms-are-doing-right-by-their-staff/?rf=1) (like Orrick, Lowenstein Sandler, and Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer) that treat their staff members somewhat equitably in terms of parental leave.

In a statement obtained by the [Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/top-stories/id=1202799103476/Shearman--Sterling-Gets-On-Board-the-Parental-Leave-Expansion-Train?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=5), senior partner Creighton Condon had this to say about the firm’s new policy: “Our enhanced parental leave policy allows us to further support our people at key stages of their life by increasing the length of paid leave and by providing greater support throughout. The next important step is to continue to enable our people to use this new policy to the fullest extent.”

We’ve often wondered whether associates will choose to take full advantage of the parental leave policies that are being offered by their firms, and it’s now clear that Biglaw firms really want them to, without fearing for their safety of their jobs upon their return to work. These benefits are being offered for a reason: these law firms want associates to feel that they can grow with the firm — not just professionally, but personally. Sherman & Sterling’s new policy strives help associates to do just that.

Congratulations to Shearman & Sterling for its willingness to assist new parents at the firm. With programs like these in place, it will be a lot easier for attorneys to successfully make the transformation from lawyer to parent and back again.

# Biglaw Firm Sued Over Discrimination Claims After Attorney's Concussion
## The firm denies the allegations.

Reed Smith finds itself defending against a lawsuit from a former attorney, Aaron Chase, who alleges the firm fired him in violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act, the New York State Human Rights Law, and the New York City Human Rights Law. The lawsuit also says Chase is looking to amend the complaint to add claims of discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act.

The complaint, which in addition to the firm names co-chairs of the firm’s global regulatory enforcement group, Michael Lowell and Jennifer Achilles, as defendants, alleges Chase was retaliated against after suffering a concussion on vacation in September 2019. As[ reported by](https://www.law.com/2020/08/05/former-reed-smith-attorney-sues-firm-for-alleged-retaliation-discrimination-over-concussion/) Law.com, Chase alleges that while suffering from the ramifications of the concussion in October 2019, Achilles brought up an error that he made on a case. She also is alleged to have brought up previous mistakes that Chase says she never mentioned prior to suffering from the concussion:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Chase responded to the criticism by stating he didn’t believe the error would have occurred without having suffered the concussion, to which Achilles allegedly said “It’s unfortunate that the thing that broke the camel’s back happened while you are suffering from a concussion, but you did basically the same thing a few months ago, so I don’t think it was the result of the concussion,” according to the filing.

The complaint alleges that shortly after that conversation, Achilles said she no longer wanted to work with Chase, and suggested he find work with other partners.

Chase took leave under the FMLA from October 24, 2019, to February 27, 2020. He says he was removed from his cases while on leave, and when he returned to work, had a difficult time finding assignments. According to the complaint, the October performance issue was never mentioned to Chase again… that is until he was terminated on May 8th. Chase is seeking compensation for past and future earnings, as well as punitive damages.

The firm denies the charges in the complaint, saying:

“Mr. Chase’s allegations are unfounded, and we intend to defend this case vigorously. Reed Smith routinely makes personnel decisions as we evaluate performance and productivity across the firm. We invest a great deal in all of our talent so they can be successful in supporting our clients and in pursuing their own professional goals.”

While plaintiff’s attorney, Lawrence Pearson of Wigdor, also had a statement on the lawsuit:

“By removing Mr. Chase from all of his cases before he returned from a protected medical leave, then failing to reintegrate him into the practice upon his return — which the firm’s own policies call for — Reed Smith has made its discriminatory animus crystal clear. We look forward to working to vindicate Mr. Chase’s rights in court.”

Trump’s ignorance about international law governing the use of force is extreme even by U.S. standards.

— Arnold & Porter partner [John Bellinger III](https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/people/b/bellinger-john-b) explaining to [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-ignorance-international-law-extreme-us-standards-expert-1482319) just how out of touch the current administration is with basic international standards. And Bellinger was the legal advisor to Condi Rice and advised the National Security Council in the run up to the Iraq War so he knows what he’s talking about when he talks about the improper use of force.

# Salary Wars Scorecard: Firms That Have Announced Raises (2022)
## Where does your firm stand when it comes to salary increases? Get all the latest updates here.

Since we broke the news of the new $215K salary scale for associates at large law firms in the United States — a trend that was [started by Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/) on Thursday, January 20, 2022, just six months after the firm [started the last salary war](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/milbank-raises-21/) in 2021 — several firms have fallen in line and matched the scale, but dozens more firms have remained completely silent. [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/davis-polk-raise-2022/) finally decided to step in with more money for associates, and [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cravath-raises-22/) added even more money on top of that. Coupled with Cravath’s final say, maybe this Above the Law feature will encourage more firms to pay up. After all, the lateral scene is white-hot right now, and increased salaries will only encourage talent to remain loyal to their firms.

[Ed. note: This table was last updated on September 6.]

Today, we unveil a table of all of the firms that have already matched the new salary scale (or instituted raises, generally, because of the new salary scale) and the date those matches were made for your viewing pleasure. We will be updating this table on a daily basis, sometimes multiple times, as news on raises unfolds. If you see any information here that is incorrect or needs further clarification, let us know.

We are covering this trend extensively, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”) — when you know of a firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. Sources are kept confidential.

# BakerHostetler Hires A.I. Lawyer, Ushers In The Legal Apocalypse

Probably a picture of IBM’s ROSS system.

When Jeopardy superchampion [Ken Jennings fell to IBM’s Watson](https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_jennings_watson_jeopardy_and_me_the_obsolete_know_it_all?language=en), a chill fell over the ranks of white-collar professionals who saw the cold, merciless grip of technology tightening its grip around their hearts just as surely as the steam hammer did in John Henry. Lawyers in particular recognized that the slayer of the Jennings dragon wasn’t destined to stalk syndicated television, making Alex Trebek’s contestant chit-chat, almost improbably, more stilted and awkward. No, Watson was coming for our jobs.

As much as lawyers lionize themselves in the media — pointing to the tenacity of Jack McCoy, the soaring oratory of Jake Brigance, and… whatever the hell those [How To Get Away With Murder](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/10/how-to-get-away-with-murder-is-just-wrong/) morons are doing — deep down lawyers know that the bulk of the profession involves document review, rote agreement-drafting tasks, and data mining caselaw. We make human [drones do this work now](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/04/this-new-low-for-document-review-will-surprise-you/), why not shift some of the work to the electronic brain?

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Back in 2014, we warned that this revolution would [overtake law eventually](http://www.atlredline.com/ibms-watson-continues-its-job-killing-evolution-1617880135), and now it has. As Steve Dykstra [discussed yesterday](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/the-view-from-up-north-computer-app-billed-as-new-super-intelligent-attorney/), Watson has begat [ROSS](http://www.rossintelligence.com), the “Super Intelligent Attorney.” ROSS doesn’t actually stand for anything, but I guess IBM thought it would market a little better than “Darrowtron the Destroyer.”

And BakerHostetler has brought ROSS on board to work with their bankruptcy practice. So if ROSS takes the lead of Microsoft’s [Tay system](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/03/24/microsofts-teen-girl-ai-turns-into-a-hitler-loving-sex-robot-wit/), expect a flood of racist, porn-filled petitions from the unsecured creditors’ committee.

There is nothing to be gained by resisting the march of technological progress. ROSS will assuredly help lawyers better serve their clients, but cannot fully replace — for now, at least — the job of an experienced attorney to parse the data ROSS compiles.

The danger ROSS poses to the legal profession is in disrupting the continuing education of lawyers. From the perspective of the partner (and, by extension, the client), a young lawyer billing 15 hours to collect and analyze caselaw across multiple jurisdictions to forge a comprehensive memo on a discrete question makes little sense when ROSS over there can do it in a matter of seconds. And serving clients is the whole point of this job and if ROSS can help lawyers do that better, it’s going to become a necessary cog in the legal machine. But all that mental drudgery is what transforms that young lawyer into the future top-billing legal eagle. When ROSS provides short-term convenience, how will lawyers get that practical education? We know it’s [unlikely to come from law schools](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/03/what-if-law-schools-were-really-serious-about-practice-ready-grads/) without massive overhaul, and law firms are so fanatical about denying practical experience to associates [they’ll ignore court orders](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/proof-that-law-firms-dont-really-care-about-associate-development/).

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Perhaps, in time, the legal profession will find a way to mentor young lawyers into future leaders without the hazing of performing their own legal research. Or maybe the “singularity” will arrive and old lawyers will just never die. But whatever happens, this is the legal industry apocalypse. The “Cravath System” might be a bit of a pyramid scheme, but it makes a lot of sense if your approach to legal training involves taking a lot of promising recruits and using the unpleasant yet necessary work of lawyering to hone the best of the best into the partners who will take the reins down the road. If ROSS eliminates the need for all or substantially all of those pups, the law firm as an institution needs to rebuild itself from scratch.

# The Twin Peaks Of Trial Prep
## Preparing for trial, hypothetical or actual, comes with a plethora of challenges.

The fearless leader of my firm, [Balestriere Fariello](https://balestrierefariello.com), is a self-described trial attorney. My first day on the job, he took me out for a coffee and told me about the work I would embark upon, and, more importantly, he told me that our team handles every case from the outset as though it will go to trial. To be fair, our firm litigates — to arbitration, mediation, trial, or appeal — the vast majority of its cases. As such, I suppose I must now self-describe as a trial lawyer, too. I am learning very quickly what that means.

As any litigator knows, preparing for trial, hypothetical or actual, comes with a plethora of challenges. One such challenge is that trial attorneys do not prepare for said trials in a vacuum or on their own — they prepare with a team. Even our leanest of trial teams consists of a lead attorney, an associate, and an analyst, or paralegal. The more people on a team, the more critical efficient workflow becomes, and this begins at the top. “The top of what?” you may wonder. That brings me to another challenge — there are two “tops.” Twin peaks, if you will.

The first peak is the top of the case itself — the theory of the case. The theory of the case is the driving force that informs every aspect of trial strategy, from client discussions to legal research to review, organization, and utilization of evidence. A wise professor in a white-collar investigation class once told me that the first thing to do in any investigation is to write down what you think happened — the theory of the case — and then get to work on figuring out the details. This pearl of wisdom applies to preparing for trial as well. A client walks in, tells their story, and, even before deciding to take the case, the listening lawyer starts to stitch together a theory of liability (or, if you’re defense-side, a theory of how to avoid it). If you cannot come up with a theory, the odds are there’s no case at all. And all work product in preparation for trial from that moment on is in service of fine-tuning and bolstering that theory — climbing to the peak, if you’ll continue the metaphor with me.

The second peak is the top of the team, the lead attorney. And that brings us back to nobody preparing for trial in a vacuum. The lead attorney at the top of the peak has command responsibility for ensuring the trial team reaches that other peak and proves the theory of the case. As such, communication is key, and efficient methods of communication are invaluable. Every firm has their own system in place for this, but I imagine every firm would agree — establishing a pattern for regular check-ins with the entire team working on any given trial cannot be underestimated. And this must be tailored to the communication style of the lead attorney, who must pull all the work product together come trial time to prove the theory of the case. My team, for example, without fail, has biweekly check-ins from the partner level down to the paralegals, Mondays and Fridays. As a case develops, and as trial looms near, we even reach daily evaluation of trial preparations — whether they be a regulated set of emails and replies or ticking boxes on a shared and synced to-do list. I’ve found workplaces to be most efficient when the top of the trial team peak chooses and enforces a communication style at the outset of a case, as the rest of the team looks up to the top of that peak for direction. As each team member is a different moving part, consistency in communication from the outset saves time down the line, and any new team member can pick up where any other leaves off.

Other metaphors work here, too. Trickle-down trial prep, top-down trial strategy, but I’m partial to a good media reference, and I’ll leave you with one more. At the base of both each of the twin peaks is, of course, [a damn fine cup of coffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvs7pmISe8I).

# Top Boutiques Continue To Match Cravath

If you’re a young Biglaw litigator at a top firm, you’re excited about that hefty raise, but still hankering to move on to a job that gives you some opportunity to, you know, really litigate. It’s a tried and true career path to cut your teeth at a Biglaw factory before lateraling to a boutique so you can actually take some depositions before you get your AARP card. But that new raise can become a golden handcuff, anchoring you to a sweatshop where “cog” is a generous description of your day-to-day.

Traditionally, you bought that increased responsibility with a pay cut, but the top litigation boutiques are breaking that model.

San Francisco’s [Keker & Van Nest](http://www.kvn.com) — who some may remember was The American Lawyer’s inaugural [Litigation Boutique of the Year](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=900005541738/Litigation-Boutique-of-the-Year-Keker--Van-Nest) — joined Hueston Hennigan and Holwell Shuster & Goldberg in raising associate salaries up to match the Biglaw leaders. For boutiques, the name of the game is talent. Sheer muscle power doesn’t get the job done at the lean and mean shops and keeping pay in line with the top Biglaw firms is the only way to secure that top talent.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
In the coming days, I suspect we’ll start getting reports of boutiques jumping salaries to some point just below the Cravath scale — when I moved to a boutique, my salary just moved back a class, which seemed like a fair trade — or “crunching” with the gap between Cravath and the boutique growing with seniority. But for now, we’re only getting reports from the boutiques really eager to fight on that top-tier.

So go ahead Keker & Van Nest associates… have your cake and eat it too.

Remember, when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Top 20 Biglaw Firm Announced Davis Polk Match Just Before Taking Controversial Stand On Russia
## So, when will the Cravath match be coming?

Last week, this top law firm saw some trouble after it essentially [banned its attorneys](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/norton-rose-says-we-dont-talk-about-putin-o-no-no-no/) from commenting on the sanctions against Russia. It didn’t ban its attorneys from commenting on their salary increases, though, and now that a week has passed, associates are crowing about their new compensation.

The firm we’re speaking about is Norton Rose Fulbright, which brought home $1,877,933,000 gross revenue in 2020, ranking it at No. 13 on the most recent Am Law 100. As it turns out, the firm matched the Davis Polk scale mere hours before Cravath upped the ante on associate compensation. Associates tell us that the firm has yet to match the new prevailing salary scale from Cravath.

Here’s what the Davis Polk salary scale looks like at NRF:



As we noted when Norton Rose first [announced its Milbank match](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/norton-rose-match-2022/), the firm will only be applying this new salary scale to some of its offices. Associates in the firm’s California, New York, Texas, and D.C. offices will be on the $215K to $396.5K pay scale, while those in Minneapolis and St. Louis will have “opportunities to earn into the national pay scale.”

Congratulations to (almost) everyone at the firm on their new salaries. For those in smaller markets, just remember, any raise is better than no raise! And hopefully, a Cravath match will be announced at the firm before long.

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Norton Rose Fulbright.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Milbank) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Milbank”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

It’s that time of year again! We at Above the Law are putting together our third annual list of the best outside law firms, according to the people who know best – you, the in-house counsel who hire them. We know you know which firms are the most efficient, cost-effective, and reliable, and which firms are….maybe not so much, and we want you to share that info with us (please)!

[Take our very brief survey](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2gaARufdt5v25MN) and tell us which outside firms you use and why you like working with them (or maybe why you don’t).

# 4 Ways To Address Mental Health Stigma In The Legal Community
## Many lawyers are afraid that asking for help could make them appear weak or unfit for the job. It's time to change that narrative.

Pressed shirts. Steely focus.
Perfectly chosen words.

To the outside world, attorneys are seen as having it all together. But behind those dialed-in exteriors, many hide crippling mental health issues or work hard to disguise signs of substance abuse.

According to a [recent study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0250563), mental illness and heavy alcohol use is “exceedingly high” among attorneys, and half are experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Concerningly, 20.4% of the women surveyed report moderate to severe depression symptoms, compared with 15.3% of men. Additionally, 22.5% of women report moderate to severe anxiety symptoms, compared with 14.5% of men.

When it comes to alcohol, 51.3% of all the lawyers screened positive for
[risky drinking](https://springhealth.com/blog/how-to-support-employees-struggling-with-alcohol-use/), with 34% of women and 25.4% of men engaging in
hazardous drinking.

With numbers like these, it’s no wonder stress-related attrition is a byproduct of the legal profession. A quarter of the women surveyed contemplated leaving their jobs for mental health reasons, compared with 17.4% of men.  In particular, women who struggled to balance work and family responsibilities were 4.6 times more likely to contemplate leaving due to mental health issues, stress, or burnout.

From an attrition standpoint, it’s not only expensive when attorneys leave a firm, but it can further contribute to the industry’s already notable diversity issues.

Changing the narrative around asking for help
The study highlights the urgent need to address mental health issues and [reduce the stigma](https://springhealth.com/blog/addressing-mental-health-stigma/) around seeking help. We need to create a culture where it’s okay for attorneys to acknowledge they’re struggling and need support.

Many lawyers are afraid that asking for help could make them appear weak or unfit for the job. This fear can be compounded by the expectation that attorneys should be able to handle any challenge.

It’s time to change the narrative. Here are four ways to do this.

The ripple effect to reduce stigma
Reducing stigma can begin with just one person talking openly about mental health, stress, or anxiety. It can be as simple as mentioning that they’re taking a break from alcohol, going to therapy, or that they unwind at yoga.

It’s amazing how one small drop of vulnerability can start a ripple effect of dialogue and normalization.

Providing confidential and safe support
As a former employee of the State Bar of California, I worked with attorneys dealing with mental health and substance use disorders, and saw how challenging it was for them to get the care they needed.

Many were in and out of rehab, putting themselves hundreds of thousands of dollars into debt. Or, they kept their struggles secret, as they unsuccessfully tried to “white knuckle” themselves to sobriety because they were too ashamed to talk to anyone.

By the time they reached me, their lives were often falling apart. This is where a [program like Spring Health’s](https://8056012.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/8056012/SH22-SUD-OneSheet-Final.pdf) can make all the difference, providing fast access to confidential and safe assistance — without fear of judgment or repercussions — before someone reaches that point.

Meeting employees right where they are
Spring Health provides [expanded access to mental healthcare](https://springhealth.com/level-up/) that’s precise, personal, proven, and 100% confidential. Our clinically validated technology gives each member a personalized care plan, which for some people includes addressing substances.

Our [alcohol and substance use support](https://8056012.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/8056012/SH22-SUD-OneSheet-Final.pdf) program meets members where they are, whether their goals are to get sober or to develop a healthier relationship with alcohol.

Breaking the cycle of problematic substance use
The legal community is rife with hard-driving personalities who are used to achieving success based on their individual grit. Often, the exact personality trait that has gotten them so far in life betrays them when attempting to get sober or drink less, because substance use disorder prevention requires the help of others.

Until [talking about mental health is normalized](https://springhealth.com/blog/addressing-mental-health-stigma/), there will be a perceived stigma around simply asking for help or guidance. Unless we provide attorneys with adequate access to mental health and substance use care, the cycle of misuse continues.

The legal profession is a very social and client-facing business, where it’s normal to have happy hours or take clients out to drinks and booze-filled dinners multiple times a week.

The regular course of business can normalize what is often problematic drinking. It also potentially isolates attorneys who have chosen to be sober and possibly alienates them from comfortably participating in events and business opportunities.

Proactively prioritizing attorney wellbeing
Even outside of social pressures, there are many factors that might coax an attorney into problematic substance use.

More than the average population, attorneys experience higher rates of depression. Some may use substances to escape or unwind, while others feel they need substances to achieve peak performance. Prescription drugs are often seen as okay, but there can be misuse there, too.

With the current rate of unmanaged mental health and substance use disorders in the legal profession, law firms must prioritize the wellbeing of their attorneys if they want to retain them over time. We need more attorneys who are willing to have more vulnerable conversations so we can break the stigma and support our peers.

Creating a culture where it’s okay to ask for help is crucial, and providing a comprehensive mental health solution helps each person find the appropriate care and avenue that works for them.

Sometimes it’s treatment. Sometimes it’s as simple as having a therapist to talk to a couple times a month.

It’s okay to ask for help, and we need to make that clear to the legal community as a whole.

As part of Above the Law’s 2020 in review each of the editors are throwing together [our own list of top stories of 2020](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/favorite-stories-of-2020-corruption-courts-and-ahem-jeffrey-toobin/). Of course, 2020 was a dumpster fire, so almost all of the stories on my personal list are a reminder of awful.

With that depressing note, here it is: my top stories of 2020.

#10 [New Law School Ranking Gives Different Spin On The T14](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/02/new-law-school-ranking-gives-different-spin-on-the-t14/)

Lawyers love a good ranking, especially an unexpected one. Law school rankings — at least at the top of the list — tend to be pretty static, the Top 14 law schools have pretty much always been the same. So a new ranking that upends that tradition — well, readers just loved that.

Pepperdine Law dean Paul L. Caron put together what he calls the Princeton Review’s overall law school rankings, ranking schools by giving equal weight to each of the Princeton Review’s most comprehensive rankings: Admissions Selectivity, Academic Experience, Professors: Teaching, Professors: Accessibility, and Career Rating.

So what’s the result? Well, while there are a lot of law schools that we usually see at the top of rankings, there are some surprises. Take, for example, BU and Notre Dame, shooting well above their USNWR ranking and coming in at a tie for 7th.

New York City-based 50-lawyer firm of Robinson Brog made the difficult decision to layoff staff members amid the global health crisis. As managing partner Roger A. Raimond wrote in an email sent to those remaining at the firm:

[T]he Executive Committee made the decision to trim our roster to curb the potential negative economic effects we face. Although we are all saddened by the reduction of our staff, the decisions were made in an effort to maintain the firm’s long term viability. I speak for the entire Executive Committee when I say that we remain committed to each of you and I am confident that together we will get through these difficult times.

Though it is currently unclear exactly how many employees were impacted by the firm’s decision to “trim [their] roster,” we sympathize with anyone who has to deal with the anxiety of a global health crisis PLUS financial insecurity.

Top 25 Biglaw firm Goodwin Procter also had to make some difficult cuts.

According to Above the Law tipsters, ~50 staff members were laid off by the Biglaw firm. A Goodwin Procter spokesperson confirmed the cuts and provided the following statement:

We recently reviewed the performance and size of our global operations team given the current and anticipated effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the global economy. As a result of our analysis, we made the difficult decision to ask a limited number of our global operations team members to leave the firm. We are providing severance packages, based on tenure, to impacted employees. In addition, we will make continued contribution to healthcare benefits through September 30, 2020 for all affected personnel. Our global operations team continues to play a key role in supporting the firm’s operations, lawyers and clients across the business of law.

And while the firm certainly seems to be doing the best they can by these now former employees, from the tips we’ve received, folks aren’t impressed. One tipster reported being “shocked.”

That wasn’t the end of the cuts at Goodwin.

We knew this was going to start happening. Stealth layoffs are a Biglaw specialty and the economic upheaval surrounding COVID-19 is ripe for them. Above the Law is hearing from multiple insiders at the firm that over the last month or so, Goodwin Procter has been letting associates go. They’ve already laid off staff members, and now it seems it’s cutting some associates from its payroll. As a reminder, the firm made over a billion dollars in gross revenue last year — $1,330,176,000 to be precise — making it 22nd on the most recent Am Law 100.

Particularly prevalent during economic downturns, stealth layoffs allow firms to cut headcount without confirming that there were economic-based layoffs. Rather than signal some perceived weakness, a firm tries to cut overhead without making a splash. So, they’ll give the associates X number of months/weeks to find a new job and the firm may even couch the reductions in performance review terms, making those let go doubt their lawyering skills.

The COVID-19 upheaval impacted everyone, but at Kirkland & Ellis, a partner wanted everyone to know it did not change associates’ billable hours requirement:

The email in question was sent to associates in the Houston office of Kirkland & Ellis by Andy Calder, a partner and member of the firm’s global management committee. The email scolds folks that they need to keep churning out billable hours and that the firm “isn’t a gravy train where you can just chill and be along for the ride” and that “the math is not going to work out well for you at the end of the year.”

Notice, if you will, the complete lack of empathy in the letter — no mention that people who work at the firm might be suffering from COVID-19 or have a loved one hospitalized with the virus, or that in-person school has been canceled and all the parents working for him are likely trying to balance the demands of their children with the demands of this job, or that the isolation caused by the pandemic can exacerbate existing mental health issues. Nope, none of these very real concerns are mentioned, let alone validated in the email. The message — from a member of the management committee — is clear: you are only useful to the firm if you keep on billing. And if you can’t bill because there is a goddamned pandemic going on? Tough shit, figure it out yourself.

#5 [Oh, To Be A Fly On The Wall At Jones Day As Dissension At The Firm Grows](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/oh-to-be-a-fly-on-the-wall-at-jones-day-as-dissension-at-the-firm-grows/)

Jones Day had an… interesting 2020. There was the New York Times [article blowing up](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/even-jones-day-lawyers-are-giving-trumps-election-lawsuits-some-serious-side-eye/) Jones Day (and Porter Wright) over their election litigation representations. Then there was Jones Day’s anemic [response to the controversy. ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/yesterday-was-the-day-america-learned-what-weve-known-about-jones-day-all-along/)The Lincoln Project also promised to spend $500,000 on [an ad campaign](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/jones-day-to-prepare-for-a-bad-pr-campaign-the-likes-of-which-theyve-never-seen-before/) going after them — and, importantly, their clients — over the representation. But the MeidasTouch PAC actually beat them to the punch by releasing a [Jones Day attack video](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/you-have-to-watch-the-opening-salvo-in-the-anti-jones-day-ad-campaign) first. All the while, other Biglaw firms [have been fleeing](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/biglaw-firm-withdraws-from-election-litigation-before-they-get-jones-day-ed/) the election litigation like[ rats from a ship](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/another-biglaw-firm-withdraws-from-election-litigation-no-not-jones-day/).

But the top Jones Day story was about an internal email expressing disappointment at the firm over their representation of the GOP in election litigation.

It’s pretty clear that the harm this representation is causing Jones Day goes deeper than those on the outside. Let’s not forget, “Pile On Jones Day” week got started because internal sources at Jones Day that were upset with the firm’s involvement in election litigation spoke with the New York Times. So we *know* there are people inside the giant Biglaw firm that are upset about… everything the firm’s doing right now. But this is one of the first quasi-public (send something to an entire office and it’s bound to get out) statements anyone from Jones Day has made on the subject, and it comes from an associate.

Thus far, partners at the firm have been conspicuously quiet, though I suspect they aren’t as sanguine behind closed doors. Because if I had a sizable book of business and portable clients and the firm’s pursuit of a pet right-wing legal theory was threatening to unleash this PR nightmare on them, well, I’d think long and hard about how to best serve my own clients.

#4 [No, Seriously, Amy Coney Barrett Would Be A Dumpster Fire Of A Supreme Court Justice](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/no-seriously-amy-coney-barrett-would-be-a-dumpster-fire-of-a-supreme-court-justice/)

From the moment of Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s unfortunate passing, Court watchers knew the Trump administration planned on installing Amy Coney Barrett in her seat. Barrett’s retrograde jurisprudence is the final step in the religious right’s takeover of the Court.

Here’s the thing — this is a really, really big deal. It’s not just because as someone with a uterus, it is impossible for me not to oppose the approaching erosion of reproductive freedom. But this is only the tip of the iceberg — one the right has been priming the public for since Coney Barrett was one year old. There will surely be other marginalized groups that see their hard won rights take a hit as a very particular sort of conservative philosophy keeps tightening its grip on American jurisprudence. You shouldn’t need your own rights on the chopping block to see the problem with empowering this jurisprudence.

#3 [Wishing David Lat A Speedy Recovery From COVID-19](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/wishing-david-lat-a-speedy-recovery-from-covid-19/)

This is one of the more awkward columns I’ve ever had to write. Above the Law is known for being irreverent and snarky, so a heartfelt post about a personal friend feels a little strange. But also strange is not acknowledging that a prominent figure in the legal world is currently hospitalized with the coronavirus. That’s right: David Lat, who founded Above the Law in 2006, has been diagnosed with the coronavirus.

Fortunately Lat made a recovery and is back to his regular duties as an Above the Law columnist. But his harrowing experience was a reminder of just how dangerous COVID-19 can be.

#2 [Am Law 100 Firm Announces Associate Layoffs And Other Cost-Cutting Measures](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-announces-associate-layoffs-and-other-cost-cutting-measures/)

Associate layoffs are, generally speaking, a firm’s cost-cutting measure of last resort. So, when a Biglaw firm starts cutting attorneys from the payroll, we take note.

According to multiple sources at the firm, Womble Bond Dickinson announced on Friday afternoon a series of cost-cutting measures. That includes associate layoffs, employee furloughs, and cuts to lawyer compensation for those left at the firm. As a tipster reports:

FYI Womble Bind Dickinson made an announcement this afternoon about layoffs and furloughs to associates and staff. They also announced a 10 percent pay reduction for anyone making over $100k and a lower percentage reduction in the $50k to $100k range and the below $50k range. Announcement was made via conference call. No memo sent out to anyone yet

It’s starting to feel a lot like 2009 up in here.

#1 [What Biglaw Is Saying About The Unrest Sweeping The Nation](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/)

My top Above the Law story of 2020 documented exactly how Biglaw responded to the unrest caused by the murder of George Floyd.

It is not an unfair criticism of Biglaw to say they are disconnected from the society they ostensibly serve. They frequently operate in a world of high finance and bet the company litigation that feels removed from the everyday lives of so many. But that’s the thing about 2020, it has a knack for bringing the problems of the world right to your front door.

So in the wake of protests against racism sparked by the death of George Floyd under the knee of police officer Derek Chauvin, how is Biglaw responding? Every firm will have it owns response from the concrete (donating resources and pro bono hours) to the symbolic (expressing outrage) to the silent (the work never stops in Biglaw). Above the Law is committed to documenting the reactions of all the Biglaw firms.

You know why you’re here.

White & Case, which grossed $2,387,800,000 in revenue for 2020, is matching the Cravath associate compensation scale. Have a look-see below.

Class	Base Compensation
1st year	$215,000
2nd year	$225,000
3rd year	$250,000
4th year	$295,000
5th year	$345,000
6th year	$370,000
7th year	$400,000
8th year	$415,000
Now that is a lot of money. If you haven’t already, I recommend that you get yourself a nice bed and weighted blanket. No point in making all that cash and being sleep deprived, after all. The bumps to income will be retroactive to January 1st of this year and hit banks by March 28th.

(Turn to the next page to see the White & Case memo.)

As soon as your firm’s memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”) or text us (646-820-8477).

# Washington Post Rips Elizabeth Warren Because They Have Absolutely No Clue What Lawyers Are Worth
## If anything, Warren was underpaid for her services.

While less catchy than “I’ve got a plan,” Elizabeth Warren’s campaign has put considerable effort into making transparency an additional pillar of her run. She’s put out a decade’s worth of tax returns and spends a good deal of time subtly and indirectly reminding folks that Joe Biden spent decades as the “Senior Senator from Visa” and Mayor Pete just refuses to talk about whole years of his life like he’s a Tom Hardy character returning to claim an inheritance. And mostly what Warren’s gotten for all her efforts is a bunch of undeserved flack.

The lesson is, to quote Homer Simpson, never try.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The latest public dragging she’s getting stems from her decision to release around 30 years of records relaying her legal work as a bankruptcy expert. Ironically, it’s a move she was prompted to take because of attacks from Buttigieg who started aggressively deflecting from his own opacity by calling out his rivals — a tactic that might be unsavory but empirically works on the mainstream media as evidenced by the mere existence of the current administration. So when Warren released her records, she got coverage like this from the Washington Post:

[Sen. Elizabeth Warren earned nearly $2 million consulting for corporations and financial firms, records show](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sen-elizabeth-warren-earned-nearly-2-million-consulting-for-corporations-and-financial-firms-records-show/2019/12/08/e8f56638-1a18-11ea-87f7-f2e91143c60d_story.html)

An alternative title not prepared to cater to the legally illiterate would be “Nationally Recognized Bankruptcy Specialist Earned Around $60K/Year As A Lawyer.” Social media is encouragingly pushing back at the mainstream narrative by pointing out that this story only seems to prove that Warren was underpaid for three decades of legal work proving that there are still a lot of people in the country who have a vague clue about the law. Unfortunately, the Twittersphere isn’t backed by a publishing empire.

Here we are yet again with the press trying to gin up outrage by trying to play up how much money attorneys make for their work. Yet this is a uniquely stupid episode in this ongoing trend because as journalistically irresponsible as it is to get breathless over a [Biglaw partner billing a few hundred bucks an hour](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/yes-this-is-how-much-a-biglaw-partner-working-for-one-week-bills/), it’s even dumber to try to tag someone as a hypocritical plutocrat for making $1.9 million over 30 years when there are partners making $1.9 million every six months that wouldn’t even get a society page blurb.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The most charitable reading of this coverage is that even if the amounts are disingenuously hyped, it’s significant that an attorney so fixated on standing up to corporate greed would take work from corporations:

For instance, the documents released Sunday show that Warren made about $80,000 from work she did for creditors in the energy company Enron’s bankruptcy and $20,000 as a consultant for Dow Chemical, a company that was trying to limit the liability it faced from silicone breast implants that were made by a connected firm.

Enron’s creditors may have been corporations themselves, but representing them is actually in line with Warren’s central thesis that unregulated corporate greed screws people over. The breast implant work dealt with Dow buying out another company and, almost assuredly, had to do with who was on the hook for damages, as opposed to whether or not someone was on the hook. That’s pretty standard legal work. We’ve addressed before [the limits of blaming attorneys for their clients](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/09/when-are-lawyers-to-blame-for-their-clients/). There’s not really a contradiction between arguing for Bankruptcy Code reform and counseling folks on how the current Code works.

No, what this coverage is all about is a cheap bid to turn one candidate’s transparency against them by playing to prejudices about the value of lawyers through misleading headlines.

You know what matters most to lawyers? Matters.

I know that’s a little redundant, but matters are the organizing principle for everything a lawyer does.

So, it’s pretty damn important to select an effective matter management tool, wouldn’t you say?

Well, we think so. And, that’s why we invited Rob Stote of Big Hand into the Non-Eventcast arena, so we could talk to him about how matter and legal spend management softwares can move law firms and legal departments forward.

We’ve got your deep dive into matter management right here; don’t forget your swimming cap! (And while you’re here, feel free to check out Above the Law and LegalTech publishing’s [Legal Operations: Matter & Spend Management Buyer’s Guide](https://resources.abovethelaw.com/hubfs/Non-Event_Legal_Ops_Spend_Management_Buyers_Guide_11152022.pdf) and [Non-Event section](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/the-legal-tech-non-event/legal-operations-spend-management-software/).)


[Jared Correia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaredcorreia), a consultant and legal technology expert, is the host of the Non-Eventcast, the featured podcast of the Above the Law Non-Event for Tech-Perplexed Lawyers.

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)
Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

‘Stay in there, kid. I need to litigate this case first because my opposing counsel sucks.’

Women in the legal profession regularly face discrimination simply because they’re women, but when those women work as litigators, that bias can take an undue turn. As we’ve noted time and again, basic human courtesy gets tossed to the wind when women lawyers become pregnant, especially when a trial is afoot. Do you recall the time when a trial attorney was [forced to bring her newborn to court](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/10/judge-refuses-to-postpone-hearing-because-maternity-leave-isnt-a-good-enough-excuse/) because a judge said her maternity leave was “no good cause” for a continuance? Or perhaps you remember the time a litigator with a high-risk pregnancy was [“shouted at and insulted”](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/pregnant-lawyer-shouted-at-and-insulted-over-request-for-trial-delay/) over the mere prospect of a trial adjournment? To be quite frank, it is an embarrassment to the legal profession that women continue to be treated in this way.

One state is trying to combat this perpetual issue with a proposal for parental-leave continuances. In Florida, although judges would still have the final say, a new rule would create a presumption that pregnant lawyers should get continuances as needed. Hopefully, this much-needed rule will be approved, but until that happens, we’ll still have Biglaw partners like [Paul T. Reid](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:CxUZYwrTwSoJ:https://www.shb.com/professionals/r/reid-paul+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us) of Shook Hardy & Bacon essentially accusing a woman of getting pregnant to delay trial in a case that’s been ongoing for years.

Please note the UPDATE below.

[Christen Luikart](http://www.murphyandersonlaw.com/christen-e-luikart.php) of Murphy Anderson is due in October, and a product liability trial she’s been lead counsel on is set for the same month. Luikart asked for a continuance to accommodate the final weeks of her pregnancy and the birth of her child, and Reid, of course, objected — and boy, did he object. Not only did he say in his [opposition](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qymIpOkcOS2qldQmbkOJl4IUXBcW2Mdm/view) that her parental leave wasn’t a “compelling circumstance” for a continuance, but you should check out the [transcript](https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/documents/392/26055/JudgeCRowe_COND.pdf) from their appearance in court.

Not only did Reid compare Luikart’s pregnancy to an illness and suggest that she pass the case on to another attorney at her firm, but he alluded to the fact that she may have gotten pregnant in an attempt to further delay the proceedings. Reid says that his critics are taking his words out of context, but in any context, they are abhorrent. No, a pregnancy is not like an illness. No, a woman should not be forced to have a pregnancy turned into a career stumbling block by handing off years of her hard work to a colleague. No, a woman would not carry a pregnancy to term and bring a child into this world in a sick effort to delay a case.

These thoughts and legal theories are absolutely, positively INSANE, and women who are leading the discussion regarding discrimination against pregnant attorneys in the Florida court system could not agree more.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“The problem is it’s not just Ms. Luikart. It’s a trend,” [[Jennifer Shoaf] Richardson](https://www.jacksonlewis.com/people/jennifer-shoaf-richardson), [associate at Jackson Lewis in Jacksonville and president of the Florida Association of Women Lawyers] said. “One, in implying that women would get pregnant or time their pregnancies to interfere with a trial date, which is completely ridiculous and absurd. And two, a common reaction is to diminish the role of women in a trial.”

[Deborah Baker-Egozi](https://www.gmlaw.com/attorneys/deborah-baker-egozi/), partner at Greenspoon Marder and member of the Florida Bar of Governors, had a similar reaction.

“I’m disgusted by what happened to this woman,” Baker-Egozi said.

Thanks to the wisdom of Palm Beach Circuit Judge Cymonie Rowe, Luikart will receive a continuance until January 2019. “I don’t believe Ms. Luikart got pregnant in response to this case. I do believe that Ms. Luikart is entitled to have some time to deliver her child and take care of her child before coming back to resume her duties as an attorney.” Until more judges are as compassionate, the court system needs to do something to ensure that pregnant attorneys are not subjected to this treatment.

Women litigators’ pregnancies should be celebrated and supported. Women have [taken the bar exam while in labor](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/07/outstanding-bar-performance-pregnant-woman-takes-bar-exam-while-in-labor-delivers-baby-right-after/). Women have [given birth at their law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/03/labor-lawyer-takes-job-literally-delivers-baby/). Childbirth is one of the most difficult things a woman will ever have to go through — it shouldn’t be made more difficult by the profession they’ve labored to be a part of.

UPDATE (3:45 p.m.): Paul Reid’s bio no longer appears on Shook Hardy’s website and he has been suspended pending further review by management. Here is a statement from [Hildy Sastre](https://www.shb.com/professionals/s/sastre-hildy), the firm’s Miami administrative managing partner:

As attorneys, we zealously advocate for our clients every day in court; but we expect our lawyers to do so in an appropriate and respectful manner. The statements made by Mr. Reid do not reflect the supportive and inclusive culture that Shook, Hardy & Bacon is committed to championing for our clients, staff and lawyers, opposing parties and counsel and others involved in the legal process. Mr. Reid’s comments are directly at odds with Shook’s advocacy on these issues, and our firm chair suspended Mr. Reid today upon learning of the situation, pending further review by firm management. We will use this situation as an additional opportunity to educate our lawyers and staff and foster a continued dialogue on diversity and inclusion. Shook fully supports the proposed rule under consideration by the Florida Supreme Court to create a presumption that pregnant lawyers should get three-month continuances in their cases and other initiatives reflecting fair and respectful treatment of others.

The oil and gas industry has been dealing with a slump in business for quite some time, and law firms specializing in energy law have felt the sting since 2015. Back then, several firms were forced to conduct layoffs, close offices, or close entirely (see [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/10/nationwide-layoff-watch-attorney-jobs-slashed-due-to-dismal-market/), [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/10/nationwide-layoff-watch-more-lawyer-jobs-slashed-due-to-weak-market/), and [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/struggling-firm-will-close-its-doors-by-years-end-leave-all-lawyers-jobless/)). Poor oil and gas performance continued through 2016, with Pennsylvania — the epicenter of the Marcellus shale industry for all intents and purposes — losing [32 percent of its jobs](http://www.phillyvoice.com/pennsylvania-oil-and-gas-jobs-drop-32-percent-over-last-year/) in this area over the course of the year. It was only a matter of time before a Biglaw firm fell prey to to the underperforming market, and one of the largest firms in the country is now waving the white flag of defeat.

In 2011, Norton Rose Fulbright (then known as Fulbright & Jaworski) opened an office in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with six lawyers it had recently poached from K&L Gates, in the hopes of cashing in on the Marcellus boom. Now, that office is closing, and the firm has confirmed that several people have been preemptively laid off.

The [Legal Intelligencer](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202776187552/Norton-Rose-Fulbright-to-Close-Pittsburgh-Office) has additional information on the NRF closure:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In a statement, the firm confirmed that the Pittsburgh-Southpointe office is expected to close. The two remaining partners in that office, Amy L. Barrette and Jeremy A. Mercer, will relocate to the Washington D.C. location, the firm said.

“With more than 50 locations worldwide, we continually evaluate where we have physical offices,” the firm’s statement said. “We plan to close the Pittsburgh-Southpointe office in the near future, as we can serve our clients’ needs in that area from our other offices.”

The firm also confirmed that one senior paralegal and one secretary were were laid off in anticipation of the closing. The exact date of the planned closure is not clear.

Janet McQuaid, who had been listed as an attorney in Houston and Pittsburgh, is now in Houston as her primary office. Michael Gaetani, who was counsel at Norton Rose in Pittsburgh, was laid off, according to the firm, as his role will be eliminated with the office closure.

# Top Vendors With Whom Lawyers Should Nurture Connections
## If lawyers develop solid relationships with a few categories of vendors, they can best serve the needs of their clients.

In order for lawyers to perform their best work, they often need to assemble a solid team, which usually includes seasoned lawyers, trained paralegals, and other professionals. However, lawyers should also nurture relationships with solid vendors in order to complete good work for clients. Although there are all kinds of vendors in the legal industry, lawyers should especially nurture relationships with a few kinds of companies since they can have a substantial impact on the work lawyers perform for their clients.

Title Companies

Lawyers who perform real estate work usually need to use a title company for their deals. A title company performs a lot of different functions for lawyers and their clients. Perhaps most importantly, the title company checks title records and determines if there are any open mortgages or other issues with the property that might impede the title to real estate. In addition, the title company also usually coordinates title insurance, which protects purchasers in the event that there is a defect of title that needs to be cured. Depending on the jurisdiction, the title company may also provide escrow services, which can make a lawyer’s job much easier since this task is delegated to lawyers in other instances.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Not all title companies are created equal, and some title companies might not provide concierge services. This can make a lawyer’s job more difficult and might force the lawyer to perform more work than they would need to if the title company was performing certain tasks on the deal. It can be difficult to deal with multiple title insurance companies since it can be confusing to communicate with different point people, and different title companies may have different procedures for handling deals. As a result, it can be helpful if a lawyer nurtures a relationship with one good title company that can handle most or all of the real estate deals the lawyer handles in a given jurisdiction.

Appellate Printers

When lawyers file appeals, they often need to engage the services of an appellate printer. Traditionally, appellate briefs and appellate records needed to be printed and bound in a certain way so that they could be properly presented to an appellate court. Since most law firms did not have the equipment to do this printing, it was important to outsource this role so that the appropriate printing tasks were completed. In more recent years, many appellate courts have accepted electronic appellate brief and appellate records and the traditional printing function is no longer needed. Nevertheless, appellate printing can ensure that cases are properly hyperlinked and that the tables needed for such briefs are created so that lawyers do not need to spend time on this function.

I know firsthand how much an appellate printer can be a lifesaver, since I have worked with appellate printers who have performed great work on a tight timeframe in the past. Many appellate printers also have counsel on staff to answer procedural questions about appeals. This is very helpful since most lawyers do not regularly handle appeals, so when lawyers need to file appeals, they may not be so well versed with appellate procedure. Finding a solid appellate printer can be invaluable when lawyers need to file an appeal for one of their cases.

Court Reporting Services

Every litigator needs to hire a court reporter from time to time. Court reporters are essential to recording testimony that is presented at depositions and during other proceedings. On certain occasions, law firms can develop relationships with individual court reporters who the law firms know can be trusted to provide prompt and accurate services when necessary.

A trusted court reporting service can be invaluable. Depositions can often be scheduled at the last minute, and some court reporting services can schedule last-minute depositions better than others. Moreover, other court reporting services might have reporters who are well-versed in a particular area of the law and know the spellings of unique names and the procedures of that area of the law. The connection between law firms and court reporting services is so strong that such companies might provide lawyers with individualized presents around the holidays. A litigator should have a good court reporting agency in their Rolodex, and potentially a solid individual court reporter to ensure that they can best serve their clients when the need for a court reporter arises.

All told, lawyers cannot effectively handle their jobs without the assistance of numerous outside vendors. If lawyers develop solid relationships with a few categories of vendors, they can best serve the needs of their clients.

## If the group is serious about improving access to justice by lowering the educational barrier to entry, they should lobby the ABA’s Section of Legal Education to adopt changes that would reduce the overall cost of law school by reducing course load or substituting work experience for academic credit.

The State Bar of California’s Paraprofessional Program Working Group (CPPWG) is soliciting [public comments](https://fs22.formsite.com/sbcta/jkzblts9fd/index.html) on a proposal to allow nonattorney paraprofessionals to practice law in a limited capacity. They will be allowed to advise and represent clients only in limited landlord-tenant, family law, debt collection, and criminal law cases.

The goal is to provide a lower-cost legal professional to handle matters that mostly impact lower-income people who cannot afford to hire an attorney. For the most part, paraprofessionals will be regulated and disciplined like attorneys to ensure that they act ethically and competently. They will require a certain level of education, although it will likely be cheaper than attending a traditional three-year law school.

However, there is opposition to the proposal, mostly coming from practicing lawyers. They have criticized the need for the paraprofessional program as well as many of the proposals and recommendations.

One proposal would allow paraprofessionals to own up to 49% of a law practice with an attorney. The purpose is to allow both to work together. But workarounds can lead to the paraprofessional having the majority vote. For example, the paraprofessional can recruit multiple lawyers who will each own a small percentage of the firm. The paraprofessional could take steps to ensure that one of these lawyers will vote the same way as the paraprofessional, thus squeezing out the minority partners. The dissatisfied attorneys could leave, which could put the law firm in chaos and affect existing cases.

Or what if one of the attorneys suddenly dies or becomes ineligible to practice? The paraprofessional could end up being the majority owner unless the affected attorney’s interest in the firm automatically passes on to the remaining attorney partners.

Finally, co-ownership is not required for professionals to work together. In fact, without the ownership issues, all parties can separate without the hassle of going through the dissolution process.

Another proposal would allow attorneys and paraprofessionals in the same firm to share fees. But fees cannot be shared if they work for different firms. Opponents argue that this will create the classic situation where the lawyer’s independent professional judgment will be affected due to financial incentives. Also, if the lawyer practices in an excluded area such as immigration, this can result in paraprofessionals getting a share of the profits from activities from areas of the law where they are not allowed to practice.

It is notable that the working group recommended excluding immigration law because undocumented migrants are typically people of limited means and will have difficulty hiring a lawyer to represent them in deportation proceedings. The stated reason for the exclusion was because the state did not have jurisdiction to authorize representation in federal courts. But letting paraprofessionals practice could raise the ire of the immigration bar who can put a serious dent to the access to justice narrative. There are many stories of [unlicensed notarios](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_interest/immigration/projects_initiatives/fightnotariofraud/) who run fly-by-night operations, charge high fees but deliver little to no results. So they know firsthand the costly and possibly irreparable consequences of letting just anyone represent vulnerable immigrants.

It is also strange that the working group does not recommend imposing fee caps to paraprofessionals, especially since the goal is to improve access to justice. They argue that imposing fee caps would be unfair, market forces will keep prices affordable, would discourage people to become paraprofessionals, and may negatively impact the financial viability of the profession.

The market forces argument is questionable because increasing the supply of legal professionals does not guarantee lower prices. There are many law schools in California of various shapes and sizes, but an increase in the number of practicing attorneys in the state (especially in light of recently lowered bar passage scores) has not improved the access to justice problem. They probably assume that the paraprofessionals would charge less than a comparable attorney. While that might be the case, the paraprofessional will ultimately charge whatever their clients are willing to pay, even if their fees match those of attorneys.

Also, paraprofessionals are most likely going to run their own practices or partner with lawyers or other paraprofessionals. In these situations, they will need to pay overhead expenses to maintain the business. This can also affect how much they charge for their services and may not necessarily result in lower costs to clients.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
One of the dissenting members of the working group questioned the magnitude of the access to justice problem. He claimed that the [access to justice report](https://bit.ly/3BGxmKx) relied on by the group points out that two-thirds of the people with legal problems surveyed made no attempt to find an attorney. And it is unknown whether the remaining one-third who tried to find an attorney was able to retain one. This suggests that there may be a “knowledge gap” rather than a “justice gap” because the public does not know all of the legal resources available to them.

California already has a number of professional programs where nonlawyers can assist clients in certain matters, so the state bar and the government should make an effort to inform the public about these additional resources. In addition, there are unaccredited law schools that charge less tuition than ABA-accredited schools. Graduates of these schools, who likely have much smaller student debts, should be able to charge lower prices. Unfortunately, since most graduates of these schools are unable to pass the bar exam on the first try, there should be an effort to assist with bar exam preparation.

Lastly, it is worth noting a few positive findings from the CPPWG’s proposals. First, the education requirement for paraprofessionals is shorter and more focused. Law schools should consider adopting a similar model for those who are not interested in a traditional three-year program. If the group is serious about improving access to justice by lowering the educational barrier to entry, they should lobby the ABA’s Section of Legal Education to adopt changes that would reduce the overall cost of law school by reducing course load or substituting work experience for academic credit. Second, paraprofessionals are required to be proficient in trauma-informed representation, which will teach how to effectively deal with clients who are experiencing traumatic situations. A similar course should be available to lawyers as a CLE session or as an elective law school course.

The CPPWG’s proposal to allow paraprofessionals to practice law in limited cases is another attempt to improve access to justice. But it seems like the working group is proceeding on the questionable assumption that paraprofessionals will charge less than lawyers and with the attitude of “doing something is better than nothing.” A better solution could be to put in an effort to improve what already exists. For example, the expanded use of telephonic and video conferences due to COVID-19 could allow attorneys to operate at reduced cost and pass the savings on to their clients. Also, certain matters should be simplified or not require court appearances at all. Or courts can mediate payment plans for uncontested debt cases. All of these options should be considered before creating an expensive professional program that could end up only gaining the interest of a few people.

We called it yesterday, the COVID-19 bonus wars are upon us. [Cooley’s announcement](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cooley-bonuses/) got the ball rolling — and sent a signal to elite Biglaw firms that they’re going to have to pony up additional bonus money, on top of year-end bonuses — as a special thank you for all the hard work associates have been putting in during this difficult time. Then [Davis Polk came over the top, ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/)offering associates a lot more money than Cooley did. Now we have our first match.

Milbank announced special bonuses today in the range of $7,500 to $40,000, depending on class year, matching the DPW scale. If an associate is below 80 percent utilization (inclusive of pro bono and work on behalf of the firm), they won’t be left out in the cold entirely, they’ll get 50 percent of the bonus for their class year. And for those extraordinarily busy (over 110 percent utilization), they’ll be rewarded with an extra 50 percent of their class rate.

And, as has become typical with the COVID bonus announcements, Milbank noted that their 2020 year-end bonuses will at least be as large as their 2019 bonuses.

These special bonuses will be paid on or before October 30th.

Protecting privilege is one of the most critical aspects of any legal matter. Unfortunately, it can also be one of the most confusing and time-consuming. While eDiscovery has seen significant advances in recent years, identifying potentially privileged documents, reviewing them, and ultimately logging them remains an arduous task.

[H5](https://bit.ly/3pv8sJm) is finally changing all that. H5’s sophisticated [Matter Analytics](https://bit.ly/3rFFqcT) application was built from the ground up to give you a better eDiscovery experience from within Relativity. The [Privilege Analytics](https://bit.ly/2ZYb8GD) solution within Matter Analytics blends together analytics capabilities and proprietary, pre-trained linguistics models to help you more easily identify privileged content, create better workflows for reviewing it, focus in on potential privilege-breaking scenarios, and seamlessly create privilege logs.

Simply put, privilege review and logging no longer has to be a chore you dread.

##How It Works
One of the key things to know about Matter Analytics and Privilege Analytics from H5 is that these tools exist inside Relativity. They don’t require navigating to outside applications like some other eDiscovery solutions – all of your data stays within Relativity and the privilege analysis happens there, making for significantly streamlined workflows and maximum functionality.

H5 has heavily refined its proprietary algorithms over the years, as well as worked hard to seamlessly integrate their analytics into Relativity to improve the privilege review experience, with the help of functions like their proprietary threading and name normalization (more on that in a bit). Better yet, H5’s staff uses the software itself every day – so they’re not just blindly developing it, they’re developing it to actually work. And they’ve succeeded.

##Privilege Identification
Privilege Analytics’ core functionalities target the two main facets of privilege – understanding who the privileged actors are and what legal concepts are at issue (the “who” and the “what” of privilege).

Identifying privileged documents starts with tackling the “who” through  threading and name normalization. On your main Privilege Analytics screen, you start with an analytics set of all documents that have been analyzed, broken down into useful graphic cards that give you a high-level snapshot of exactly what you’re dealing with.



You can click into any card to get more detail about the analysis, including insight into threading and name normalization.

Threading is an intuitive and powerful way of analyzing and viewing communications in your potential production. You can think of every thread as a tree with branches. Privilege Analytics makes it easy to see last-in-time messages, or the ends of the branches where privilege is often broken.



It also performs a full attachment analysis to find all inclusive attachments for every thread and a full recipient analysis that includes BCCs, which many solutions don’t take into consideration.

Name normalization is the next step, and it’s aimed at trying to really understand not just who the people are in your document set, but also what organizations they belong to and what function they play in the data population. Names can be associated with roles like in-house or outside counsel, or adversarial organizations and government agencies that might be privilege-breakers.



Privilege Analytics allows you to pre-categorize individuals based on their function, and you can reuse those categorizations from one matter to the next. If you do a lot of work on behalf of the same client, this feature is a great way to carry your knowledge base over, ensure consistency, and accelerate your privilege identification in subsequent matters.

Name normalization doesn’t stop at a party’s function. It takes into account all the different variations in how a person is addressed and the different email addresses they might use. Domain names are also parsed to better understand the organizations at play in your document set. Accounting for all these variances is usually a painful slog of merging profiles and cleaning up details that takes significant time in its own right. Privilege Analytics makes it easy, and this is yet another useful feature that you can carry forward into other matters. 

Running threading and name normalization together is a powerful combination that gets you to the “who” of your privilege review much more quickly and accurately than other eDiscovery solutions on the market.

Once you know the “who,” you can focus on the “what.” Privilege Analytics is pre-trained on over 500 privilege concepts to parse the subject of communications. Using linguistic modeling, the system can hone in on specific aspects of communications, rather than just recognizing likely patterns for privileged documents – so if you have two privileged lines in an email that’s otherwise about holiday plans, the system will still catch it.

The results of the threading and name normalization are then paired with the privilege concepts to quickly identify and tier levels of privilege in the data population.



Tier one communications are those that involve both identified privileged actors and privileged legal topics. 

One of the tricky but critical aspects of any privilege review is identifying when an existing privilege scenario has been broken. Privilege Analytics makes this complicated task much easier. The system looks not only for privileged actors in email threads, but also for third parties on otherwise privileged communications. When such a potential privilege-breaker is identified, the documents are flagged as being potential third-party waivers.



##Privilege Review
The tiering feature creates an ideal starting point for your privilege review because it allows you to get at the most sensitive material right out of the gates. 

The H5 Matter Analytics thread viewer takes your privilege review to the next level. Color coding of thread branches (red for privileged actors, blue for third parties) makes it easy to see if privilege was broken, and you get to graphically see the branches of how a communication evolved.



If you see a blue branch, you know your privilege might have been broken. This view is available right in Relativity, even though it’s a feature you don’t normally get in Relativity itself. It will also pull in flags from Relativity for things like redactions.

Privilege Analytics pulls together all parts of a thread into a comprehensive conversation view of the communication, with every segment in order. You can see exactly when people joined or left the conversation. In addition to the branch color coding, the privileges subjects that were identified via the linguistic modeling are highlighted.



Once you finish reviewing a thread and have made your privilege decision, you can simply advance to the next thread, rather than moving document by document.

Whether you’re engaged in second-pass review or the QC stage, Privilege Analytics is the easiest way to make informed coding decisions that eliminate some of the most common mistakes that increase the risk of privilege exposure.

##Privilege Logging
Unfortunately, your job’s not done when you finish your privilege review. Creating privilege logs usually ranks low on the list of any attorney’s favorite tasks. Thankfully, Privilege Analytics makes that easier, too.

As the system identifies potentially privileged documents, it also assigns auto-reasons for the privilege identification, which are a great starting point for your privilege log. While you may need to add more detail or make a few tweaks, the system gives you the building blocks to log your documents quickly and accurately.

To create a log, select a saved set of documents and select a template (or create a new one yourself). Privilege Analytics generates the document list populated with all the requisite fields, all the individuals identified in every branch of the thread, and the auto-reasons for privilege.



If you need to see an individual document, you can navigate to it with just a click.

You can edit the log just as you would in Excel to make the final version look exactly the way  you need it to look. Your final output can exist as either an object directly in Relativity or it can be exported to Excel. You get a beautiful and, more importantly, accurate privilege log without all the intensive manual labor you’re used to.

Installing Privilege Analytics usually takes less than 15 minutes and H5 has a great evaluation offer where you can try it for yourself. Chances are, you’ll be sold. If you’re interested in trying Privilege Analytics with your H5 hosted matter, please contact H5 for more information”.

With something as important as privilege on the line, you can’t afford to keep doing things the old way.

Ian Schick

Ian Schick is a legit genius.

He has a degree in physics, a PhD in nano-optics, and a J.D. After some advanced study and research in optics and lasers, Ian became a patent lawyer. He joined Pillsbury, and with clients up and down the West Coast, he became well-known among software companies for strong patent work. Most recently, Ian has started a company that addresses patent drafting, Specifio.

Ian is one of those guys that brings the goods. He has a casual, no-nonsense tone that is part polished lawyer and part confident engineer, preferring results and data over showy jargon and hype. He had a problem, he set out to solve it, and the results of his efforts were good enough that he is now betting on its utility in the market.

This is my conversation with Ian Schick, co-founder and CEO of Specifio.

Ian Schick: After my PhD, I was a little burnt out from lab life, but I was still very interested in tech and innovation. My first job was with a law firm in Silicon Valley, at Carr and Ferrell, where I got a job as an engineer consultant. And I ended up really liking it. It was great to have my fingers in all these cutting-edge companies.

Ed Sohn: Then you decided to become an attorney?

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
IS: Yeah. I went to law school in San Diego, then took a job with Pillsbury. I worked my way up to Counsel with a great practice with a focus on software startup companies. In the last five years, I started to work with more and more AI companies. Most of them were in machine vision, content recognition for image analysis, all basically based on neural networks, which can be applied to many different areas.

I started to think about how those technologies could apply to what I was doing in my practice, and I had this idea for automating the drafting of a patent application. To get more insight, I reached out to a former client I had worked with at Carr, Kevin Knight, now a professor at USC. Kevin had started a company called Language Weaver, where he was the co-founder, CTO and managed the IP portfolio.

I exchanged emails with Kevin with my ideas, and eventually went up to USC and spent a few hours in his office. By the end of the meeting he said, “This looks like it could be real. We should try to build it.”

ES: Let me guess — you built it.

IS: Yes. I was doing most of the coding, and Kevin was my mentor, providing guidance. We have our overlapping areas of expertise, I in patent and he in natural language generation, so we can communicate extremely effectively with each other. That’s the magic behind the founding team.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Around December of last year, we started getting output that looked like work from my Pillsbury junior associates and patent agents. When I saw that output on my screen, it was a real moment for me.

On January 15, 2017, I resigned from the firm, moved up to L.A. with my wife, and started this company. We are incubating at the USC Information Sciences Institute.

ES: Incredible. And you were doing this while you were practicing all year?  On the side?

IS: Yeah, exactly.  I had these ideas bubbling in my head for a while, and it got to the point where I had to act on this.

ES: That’s a big investment. Most counsel at a large firm who are trying to make partner don’t have a bunch of free time to dabble in computational linguistics and machine learning on the side.

IS: A big part of my motivation was just with turnover that I was dealing with at the lower ranks at the firm.  Usually, at a patent practice, first- and second-years do a lot of patent drafting, maybe third- and fourth-years, but as you get better, you start to leverage and review more than draft. And patent drafting is difficult: it’s an art form, it’s not a natural thing. You must spend time as an apprentice, you have to learn from someone good, and it just takes time.

Finally, after you get people trained up, they may not want to stick with it. It’s the source of burnout for a lot of patent folks.  It’s a super interesting area, learning about new technologies, but a lot of patent drafting is just wiggling your fingers on a keyboard for 20 hours. I kept thinking, if only I had a program that could do at least part of the job.

ES: If the task is that difficult, that nuanced, what made you think you could do it with technology?

IS: I’ve drafted hundreds of patent applications, and most of them were in the software area — one technology domain. Drafting patent claims is where almost all of the intellectual heavy lifting goes. You have to balance inventive concept, business strategy, competing products, prior art, and legal precedent. It takes some real reflection.

But once the claims are prepared, the next step is writing specifications that meet the statutory requirements for the claim.  The specification is a long narrative that explains how to make and use the invention. Going from claims to an application is more of the mechanical writing process. There’s a document plan that is basically the same for most patent applications — an excellent task for computer generated text.

ES: Do you have a product in market right now?

IS: We started pushing it out to the market early in the summer, got some nice feedback from our users, and spent the summer addressing the feedback we received. The big thing we did was getting it more reliable and more enterprise-ready. Recently we were at a conference, the IP Owners Association annual meeting, which is like the royal court of the patent profession, and we were well-received.

ES: Okay, brass tacks. How does this work? I’ve written and spoken about adoption of legal tech and the barriers to overcome when getting lawyers to actually use tech. How does Specifio work?

IS: We are a fully automated system, and importantly, it works over email. I worked at a law firm, I know lawyers can be technophobic, but they all know how to use Word and know how to use email. With our product, an attorney drafts a set of claims, sends it in an email to our system, and our system will draft the spec and send it back to the attorney in a couple of minutes.

Our hope is that it plugs right into the attorney’s workflow. Now the attorney fast-forwards through the process between claims and an application draft. It gets them from 20% done to 80-90% done, eliminating that middle chunk of the job, which is the onion-chopping part of the job and not the value add of these attorneys.

ES: How has it been starting a business?

IS: I’ve worked with startups for 10 years, but once you get on this side of the table, it’s very different. Your day-to-day is basically never the same. As a patent attorney, you are big picture and strategy focused, but as a new startup CEO, you work on those things but also a ton of little things, operational stuff. Building a team of attorneys, paralegals, and secretaries is different from building an engineering team.

Also, I started out as an engineer. It’s really exciting for me to be creating again. I feel super lucky that it leverages my two pasts, as a scientist and as an attorney.

ES: Words of advice?

IS: Your network has never been more important than now. Reach out to people that you haven’t spoken to for a few years, keep that network alive and put high value on it. If I wasn’t working with Kevin and the talented staff at USC, this whole thing wouldn’t be possible.

ES: Last question — do you think your software will shrink revenue at law firm patent practices?

IS: Are we going to replace patent attorneys?  I don’t see that happening. We separate out the creativity and judgment-driven portion of the task, leaving that with the human. It’s the mechanical writing part that we’re trying to automate.

What we’re doing is something like what accountants do with spreadsheets. They used to do everything by hand, but today you’d never pay your accountant to do math by hand, right? In a few years, I’m hoping that attorneys will think it’s crazy to write an application from scratch.

It’s not threatening jobs, it is improving jobs, improving job satisfaction, and capturing more talent. People should be running at 100% all the time, not 30% of the time.

I think it will lead to less burnout and happier attorneys.

ES: Thanks, and best of luck in the future!

Donald F. McGahn II (via YouTube)

The competition for [2016 Lawyer of the Year](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/above-the-laws-2016-lawyer-of-the-year-contest-the-finalists/) (“LOTY”) honors unfolded just like Election 2016. An elite leader of the Establishment led for most of the contest, but suffered a surprise upset at the hands of an outsider.

For most of the race, [C. Allen Parker](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/above-the-laws-2016-lawyer-of-the-year-contest-the-finalists/) — the [former presiding partner](https://www.cravath.com/aparker/) of Cravath Swaine & Moore, and the man widely credited with taking New York (and most of Biglaw) to a new [$180K pay scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/?rf=1) — enjoyed a healthy lead in the polls. But that lead eroded in the home stretch, and victory went to a relative outsider: Jones Day partner [Donald F. McGahn II](http://www.jonesday.com/dmcgahn/), who [served as general counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/jones-day-helping-donald-trump-to-make-america-great-again/) to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, and who will serve as [President Trump’s White House counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/biglaw-partner-to-be-trump-administrations-white-house-counsel/).

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Note the reference to McGahn as a relative outsider. It would be hard to regard a D.C. power broker, current Biglaw partner, and former chairman of the Federal Election Commission as a true outsider. (McGahn’s best claim to non-elite status: graduating from [Widener Law](http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/widener-university-03210).) But by the same token, McGahn’s boss — billionaire businessman, longtime celebrity, son of a real estate tycoon, graduate of Wharton — is no stranger to power and privilege, yet sailed on to victory as an anti-Establishment figure.

McGahn prevailed with 41 percent of the vote. Honorable mentions go to Parker, with 34 percent, and Hillary Clinton, with 11 percent. If there were an “electoral college” made up of Above the Law editors, we might have given the win to Parker, partly out of gratitude for the excitement — and website traffic — generated by the [Great Pay Raise of 2016](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/?rf=1). But our editorial discretion ends after we’ve selected the finalists; from that point forward, the popular vote controls.

And, in fairness to Don McGahn, there’s a strong case to be made that he was the most consequential counselor of 2016. If not for McGahn’s expert legal work — defeating challenges that would have kept Trump off the ballot in early primary states, avoiding a contested convention (with the help of fellow JD partner [Bill McGinley](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/jones-day-doubles-down-on-donald-trump/)), and keeping the Trump campaign on the right side of the FEC and the law — Donald Trump might not be our president-elect. Few lawyers can plausibly claim that they made such a difference in national and world history.

Now what about the third-place finisher, Hillary Clinton? One could argue that her mistakes paved the way for President Trump. But we’re focusing here on Lawyer of the Year, and Clinton’s missteps were more political than legal in nature; even the email scandal was more of a political than legal problem (since fellow LOTY finalists Jim Comey and Loretta Lynch never indicted HRC). And it’s also hard to say how much blame belongs to Clinton personally and how much must be shared with her campaign.

This is probably one of the few times that McGahn doesn’t mind being in the company of Barack Obama. Congratulations to Donald F. McGahn II, our nation’s 2016 Lawyer of the Year!

P.S. You know what would be a fantastic demonstration of Don McGahn’s power within the Trump Administration? If we could get a Twitter shout-out from [@RealDonaldTrump](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump) himself, congratulating his top lawyer on being named Lawyer of the Year — and sending his 19.2 million followers to this post. That would be, as DJT might say, “Very nice!”

# The Perfect Way To Compare Biglaw Firms Is Here
## How do you know if a Biglaw firm is right for you? The Law Firm Transparency tool gives you quick access to the data you need to know.

Figuring out which Biglaw firm to join is an important decision. Not only does it impact the kind of work you get to do, it gives your career a particular trajectory, and can have a massive influence on your sense of well being and mental health. But how do you know which firm is right for you?

Some folks will tell you to rely on your gut instinct, and that’s important — of course it is! But the interview process — no matter how thorough — is designed to only give you a small window into a firm, and a favorable one at that. Think about it, no firm has the ill-tempered partner conducting interviews. So, you try to delve into mountains of data about firms, but digging through everything to make sure you make an apples to apples comparison can be difficult. LOTS of firms say they pay market bonuses, but a firm that only ponies up market bonuses at 2,100 hours is very different than one with no hours requirement.

So, to help you sort through all that data, Above the Law is launching the[ Law Firm Transparency Directory](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firm-transparency/), powered by Leopard Data Solutions. We give you easy access to the intel you really need to make these incredibly important decisions. Yes, the basic info is there like the salary deets, bonus numbers with hours requirements, and head count. But so is some deep stuff, like average length of attorney tenure, promotion rate, the caregiver leave available, a full list of benefits, the legal superstars at the firm, whether the firm has a mandatory arbitration clause, and — of course — some selected Above the Law coverage to get a real sense of what life at the firm is like. The directory is currently populated with the top 50 Biglaw firms, but we’re working to expand it.

Plus, you can select a limited number of firms (like, for instance the two firms you have offers from) and create a personalized direct comparison between them. It really is the ideal way to compare and contrast Biglaw firms you’re thinking about working at.

— A former Freshfields partner, [discussing the decision of the firm](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/03/14/freshfields-sheds-city-aviation-finance-team-amid-wider-shakeup-of-finance-practice/) to focus its practice on a smaller range of financial products. It was recently announced that the London aviation finance team will be [joining Holland & Knight](http://www.legalbusiness.co.uk/index.php/lb-blog-view/9273-freshfields-loses-city-aviation-finance-team-as-exits-continue). The finance shakeup was part of a move by Freshfields to boost profitability. Another former partner noted, “Some people were told they needed to leave, but others saw the writing on the wall and realised they wouldn’t come out of the review well.”

# One Firm Decides To Pump The Brakes On This Whole 'Raise' Thing
## Firm gives the associates some unpleasant news.

Remember back when Covington issued [a Hail Mary memo](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-salary-hike-not-all-offices-are-created-equal/) to stanch the flood of firms flinging Cravath raises to every lawyer around the country? And then went ahead and jacked up everyone’s salaries to the Cravath scale anyway? Ah, good times.

Well, another firm is launching a preemptive strike against increasing associate salaries, and this one reads less like a veiled plea to the market and more like a stern lecture to the associates that “Santa’s had it rough and might be skipping our house this year.”

Seyfarth Shaw just told its associates that they are fully aware of the salary frenzy, but cautioned that:

While certain firms are often reactive to news like this, the consequences that follow can take more time — billing rate increases, higher productivity requirements, other cost-cutting measures.

Go ahead and read [the whole memo here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/one-firm-decides-to-pump-the-brakes-on-this-whole-raise-thing/2/).

That’s a not-so-subtle threat that we COULD give you more money but we’d probably have to fire half of you and make the rest work harder. No one wants that, do they?

Remember, this isn’t one of those “[hockey pads Batmen](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/crowell-moring-matches-wait-what-in-the-holy-hell-is-going-on-here/)” to borrow my colleague’s brilliant analogy. Seyfarth is firmly ensconced in the Am Law 100, with PPP over $1 million, and a healthy ratio of [2.6 attorneys for every equity partner](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/seyfarth-shaw/). It’s not like the firm has to give the full raise to all of their U.S. offices — [indeed they probably shouldn’t](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/no-your-office-doesnt-deserve-the-ny-to-180-raise/) — but this is hardly an instance that’ll break the bank like it might for some firms who have already matched. It feels like Seyfarth is using the fact that some firms are making questionable decisions as an excuse to skimp.

Still, Seyfarth doesn’t completely rule out a raise, they just preach caution:

This note is just to let you know that we are monitoring the information about which firms are doing what and where geographically, and that we will continue to evaluate what steps to take, if any, that will be appropriate for us, for our culture and for our clients.

That “if any” is ominous.

Seyfarth’s reticence is, of course, in line with a recent article by Seyfarth’s Chair Emeritus Stephen Poor [predicting calamity in the market](https://bol.bna.com/the-cravath-pay-raise-challenges-and-opportunities-for-law-firms-perspective/) — or at least for traditional law firms — from rushing to adopt this pay hike. Think of it as [David Lat’s warning](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/dear-biglaw-firms-please-dont-raise-salaries/) on steroids.

We’re entering new and uncharted waters thanks to Cravath. Look, firms are right not to issue a kneejerk response to these raises. But for a firm just a smidgen out of the Am Law 50 (Number 58 last year) and one of the top 100 grossing firms in the world, this seems an abundance of caution.

# Jones Day Facing Second Class-Action Lawsuit Over 'Fraternity Culture' Of The Firm
## What this complaint alleges happens at the firm is shocking.

Jones Day (photo by David Lat)

Jones Day is facing a second gender discrimination lawsuit. The [first, filed by former partner Wendy Moore,](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/jones-day-hit-with-explosive-gender-discrimination-case/) alleged the firm’s infamous “black box” compensation system is used to pay women partners less than their male counterparts. The latest lawsuit, filed yesterday in a federal court in Washington, D.C., also takes aim at the compensation system (under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the District of Columbia Human Rights Act) as well as what is described as the firm’s “fraternity culture,” but from the perspective of women associates at the firm.

The purported class action has six plaintiffs, two named — Nilab Rahyar Tolton and Andrea Mazingo — and four anonymous, and the complaint alleges the environment at the firm is harmful to women:

“Jones Day’s fraternity culture presents female attorneys at Jones Day with an unpalatable choice: participate in a culture that is at best inhospitable to women and at worst openly misogynistic or forego any hope of success at the firm

For a female associate to succeed at Jones Day, she must at least tolerate the stereotyped expectations of the firm’s male power brokers. To challenge these expectations by word or deed, even in settings ostensibly provided for ‘honest’ feedback, is career suicide.”

The complaint also goes on to allege that the compensation system is used to reify sexist assumptions, as [reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/04/03/associates-assail-fraternity-culture-at-jones-day-in-200m-sex-bias-suit/) Law.com:

“The evaluation process can be manipulated, and upon information and belief regularly is so manipulated, to justify pushing women out,” the complaint said. “Perhaps unsurprisingly in a firm where pay and promotion decisions are made by a single managing partner, these evaluations are easily marshaled to justify any given course of action.”

The “consensus statements” that allegedly underpin compensation and partnership decisions are riddled with gender stereotypes, the complaint alleges: “The tireless, childless female associate is inadequately ‘fun’ and excessively ‘intense’; the high-performing associate mother of small children is ‘deadline challenged’ or lacks ‘commitment.’”

And the complaint’s description of the type of behavior that is not only tolerated, but encouraged at the firm, is beyond the pale:

The complaint also describes a frat-house atmosphere at the firm. At one unidentified office, male partners allegedly kick off the firm’s holiday party by encouraging drinking in the office, followed by alcohol-fueled dancing, during which male managers “gawk” at dancing female associates for amusement. At another office, during a summer associate event at a partner’s home, after a female summer associate was allegedly pushed into the swimming pool while wearing a white dress, the male summer associate who pushed her was “applauded and high-fived” by leadership rather than reprimanded.

The complaint also called the firm’s efforts to provide support for women “window dressing”—a women’s affinity lunch group was allegedly mocked by male attorneys as an opportunity “to talk about women things and having kids.”

The complaint seeks $200 million in damages for a purported class of all female associates who are, have been, or will be employed by Jones Day in the United States.

# Lawyers Should Always Devote Time To Business Development
## Resting on your laurels in the present can lead to financial hardships in the future.

Business development is important for all lawyers since it can lead to promotion opportunities for associates and can be essential to generating revenue for self-employed attorneys. Generally, lawyers work on business development efforts during slow periods, when they have more time to devote to marketing, blogging, advertising, and other such efforts. However, lawyers should always be spending substantial time on business development because lawyers can rarely predict a slowdown and should try to have new matters in waiting for those fallow periods.

When I was an associate at a Biglaw shop, most of the attorneys in my office worked on one multimillion-dollar matter for years. This portfolio of work generated tens of millions of dollars of revenue per year for our office, and few people believed that the work would dry up anytime soon. Since we were so busy with that work, many associates in the office got promoted to partner on the basis of their track record on that one matter, and attorneys and staff all received bonuses since the firm was flush with cash from it.

I later came to find out that during the handful of years the law firm had this lucrative portfolio of work, few of the partners devoted substantial amounts of time to business development. The partners thought it was in their best interest to bill as many hours of possible to generate revenue in the short term rather than develop new business. I can somewhat understand this logic, and it might have been difficult for our office to handle new work when there was a huge matter we all worked on that required substantial time and energy.

Somewhat suddenly, the lucrative matter all but dried up, and many people at the office were left without substantial work to perform. The firm pivoted toward developing new business, and everyone including partners, associates, and staff started working on pitches and searching for different business development opportunities. The efforts paid off to a small extent, and we were able to originate some modest new business.

However, for the most part, the contacts partners made over the years had gone cold while the entire office worked on the one lucrative matter for a substantial period. The firm had difficulty developing new business since partners needed to spend substantial time and resources cultivating client contacts and networking. As a result, the financial hardships for the firm resulted in several rounds of layoffs. Some of this might have been avoided if the law firm had not rested on its laurels and devoted more time and resources to business development.

For many lawyers, business development takes a backseat to performing work for clients. In my own practice, when I am busy with client work, I often forget to publish blog articles, attend networking events, or complete other business development tasks that I typically execute in order to shake the branches and develop business for my own firm. However, I try to remember the example of the Biglaw shop at which I worked earlier in my career.

Since lawsuits can resolve and transactional matters can wrap at any time, it might be very hard to predict whether an attorney will be slow or busy in the near future. Although business development efforts can take time away from billing hours in the short term, it can have substantial long-term benefits for the financial health of a practice. As a result, lawyers should always be devoting significant time and energy to it even if they are satisfied with the amount of work they have in the present.

# Conservative Partners Give Female Associates Smaller Bonuses
## This is really disheartening.

For all of the talk those in Biglaw leadership dedicate to their commitment to promoting women in the practice of law, the results of a new study come as a slap in the face to those associates who believed their firms were attempting to close the gender wage gap.

According to the results of a study conducted by Forrest Briscoe and Aparna Joshi of Penn State’s Smeal College of Business, law firm partners’ political ideologies influence how they allocate bonus income to female associates — and it doesn’t matter if those partners are male or female. Their research covered about 360 associates and their supervising partners at a large law firm of more than 1,000 lawyers by headcount over the course of a six-year period.

This what they learned, courtesy of the [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2016/12/do-conservative-managers-give-smaller-bonuses-to-women):

Our findings revealed a gender gap in bonuses given to men and women that was minimal for partners at the liberal end of the ideological spectrum but much larger at the conservative end. Under the most conservative managers (those who only donated to Republican campaigns), men received nearly $5,000 more, on average, in annual bonuses than women. Importantly, these findings could not be explained away by differences in associates’ backgrounds or work efforts, including their billable hours.

Perhaps even more alarming is the fact that the difference in bonus payment amounts grew larger among more experienced female associates. This is disheartening:

This effect was even greater for law firm associates who had more seniority and worked for conservative partners. Under the most conservative managers, experienced men received over $15,000 more in annual bonuses, on average, than comparably experienced women.

What, if anything, is to be done about this problem? Briscoe and Joshi suggest that law firms must address such pay inequality by “increasing transparency on reward and promotion decisions for men and women.” As that seems far from likely to occur, Vivia Chen of [The Careerist](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202774850941/Its-True-Republican-Partners-Give-Female-Associates-Smaller-Bonuses?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL&slreturn=20161116131428) wonders, “Will any of this be achieved in the Trump era, when indications are that it’s the retro macho ideal that is celebrated?”

# Be Mindful Of Momentum
## Things in motion tend to stay in motion.

I will surely botch my Newtonian metaphors throughout this piece, but I am sufficiently proficient in Wikipedia to know that Newton famously promulgated three laws of motion in his Philosophae Naturalis Principia Mathematica. First, he posited that objects that are as rest tend to stay at rest unless acted upon by an external force — this is called inertia. Second, the acceleration of an object is proportional to its net force and inversely proportional to its mass — this is force and acceleration. Third, for every action there exists an equal and opposite reaction — I don’t think this has a special name, but it’s pretty famous.

Since I both somewhat understand it and have an easy metaphor building on it, I shall write about the first one: Momentum matters. Whatever you are doing right now, all else being equal, you will probably keep doing it. Whether it is good or bad, productive or wasteful, smart or stupid, you’ll probably keep doing whatever you’re doing at any point in time. This goes both ways: If you’re doing good, you’ll probably find it easier to keep doing good; if you’re doing bad, you will be more tempted to keep doing bad. Even if you’re not a physics expert, you can make use of this by keeping an eye on what you’re doing right now and through thoughtful planning.

First, keep a careful eye on what you’re doing — inertia means that even small deviations in what you’re doing now make a difference. And while planning is important, as the philosopher Mike Tyson taught up, no plan survives being punched in the face. Thus, even in a carefully planned scenario, micro-adjustments may be needed to maintain an optimal course. And because of Newton’s First Law, that optimal course obtains crucial future importance. Not only does it matter when you are being productive in the present, but it will affect your work later today, tomorrow, and, in a small and indirect way, the work you do in the weeks and months to come.

Second, you should take especially thoughtful care of your planning. Since what you plan out and execute will have lasting repercussions, you should plan accordingly and consider the Mike Tyson-plan-punching factor. Whatever you plan will have far-reaching effects — both in carrying out the plan itself and the inertial effects of those actions. Additionally, the act of planning will cause its own momentum, for good or ill. Thus, take special care, not just in what you plan but that you do so thoughtfully.

So, if you’re still looking for a New Year’s resolution, try this one. Take special care, at least for a few weeks, of the effects of the momentum of your actions and planning. You may like the results.

# Biglaw Heavy Hitters Add Vaccine Mandates To Their Reopening Policies
## More firms join in to protect their employees from the spread of COVID-19.

Biglaw firms continue to revise their return-to-office plans in light of the hypercontagious Delta variant of COVID-19. Firms that once waved away vaccine requirements are now embracing them, and office reopenings previously slated for next month are now being pushed into the fall. Which firms are the latest to add vaccine mandates to their plans?

Thus far, the firms that have made vaccination a requirement for those returning to the office include [Akin Gump](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-will-require-employees-to-be-vaccinated-some-push-back-reopening-dates/?rf=1), [Arent Fox](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/top-20-biglaw-firm-wont-make-lawyers-return-to-office-in-2021-but-vaccines-will-be-required/), [Clifford Chance](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/elite-firm-will-require-vaccination-but-other-reopening-policies-are-very-flexible/), [Cozen O’Connor](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-firms-continue-to-roll-out-vaccine-mandates-delay-reopenings/), [Crowell & Moring](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-will-require-employees-to-be-vaccinated-some-push-back-reopening-dates/?rf=1), [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Davis Wright Tremaine](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/the-first-biglaw-firm-to-announce-a-covid-19-vaccination-plan/), [Debevoise & Plimpton](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-firms-continue-to-roll-out-vaccine-mandates-delay-reopenings/), [Dickinson Wright](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-firms-continue-to-roll-out-vaccine-mandates-delay-reopenings/), [Fenwick & West](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Fried Frank](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Goodwin](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-will-require-employees-to-be-vaccinated-some-push-back-reopening-dates/?rf=1), [Hanson Bridgett](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Hueston Hennigan](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Lowenstein Sandler](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/lowenstein-covid-vaccine/), [McDermott Will & Emery](https://abovethelaw.com/company/social-meteor/), [Mintz](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/unvaccinated-lawyers-will-not-be-allowed-to-enter-this-biglaw-firm/), [Norton Rose Fulbright](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/vaccine-mandates-are-trending-across-biglaw-firms/?rf=1), [Patterson Belknap](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/vaccine-mandates-are-trending-across-biglaw-firms/?rf=1), [Paul Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/paul-weiss-vaccine/), [Reed Smith](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Ropes & Gray](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/top-biglaw-firms-chair-beseeches-lawyers-staff-to-get-vaccinated/?rf=1), [Sanford Heisler](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/this-firm-will-require-lawyers-staff-to-be-vaccinated-before-returning-to-work-or-else/), [Schiff Hardin](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Seyfarth Shaw](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-firms-continue-to-roll-out-vaccine-mandates-delay-reopenings/), [Simpson Thacher](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-delay-openings-lay-down-strong-vaccination-policies/?rf=1), [Stroock & Stroock & Lavan](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-firms-continue-to-roll-out-vaccine-mandates-delay-reopenings/), [Weil Gotshal](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/weil-reopening/), [Wilson Sonsini](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/wsgr-delays-opening-delta/), and [Winston & Strawn](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-delay-openings-lay-down-strong-vaccination-policies/?rf=1).

Now, we can add another five firms to the list. Ballard Spahr, Boies Schiller Flexner, Cleary Gottlieb, Davis & Gilbert, and Sheppard Mulllin have all recently added vaccination mandates to their safety protocols, and some of them will be delaying their full reopenings due to the Delta variant.

Ballard Spahr will now require everyone who wants to enter the office (e.g., employees, visitors, clients, and vendors) to be [vaccinated](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/08/09/law-firms-get-non-committal-on-return-dates-as-delta-variant-spreads/), according to chairman Mark Stewart.

On Sunday evening, Boies Schiller notified employees that they [must be vaccinated](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/08/09/law-firms-get-non-committal-on-return-dates-as-delta-variant-spreads/) if they want to go into the office. The firm will stage a full reopening in late September or early October, depending on the “specific health factors” of each office region.

Yesterday, Cleary Gottlieb announced that it would be mandating vaccines for all U.S. personnel before they can enter the office, with medical or religious exemption requests due by September 20. “This continues to be an unprecedented time, and the health and wellbeing of our Cleary community remains our top priority,” management noted in a memo to all employees. On top of its new vaccine requirement, Cleary will be putting off its full reopening until October 18 (its previous return-to-office date was September 13). Sources say that lawyers and staff will be expected to work in the office for three days each week.

A mandatory vaccination policy is being instituted at New York-based Davis & Gilbert, and according to chairman Ron Urbach, “Given the increased risk of infection from the Delta variant, we have determined that it would be unwise to set a specific return to office date at this time. For now, our current remote work policy will remain in effect.”

Today, Sheppard Mullin announced that it would be postponing its planned return-to-office date of September 7, and will “announce a new date in the future with plenty of advance notice.” Until then, the firm will continue to operate under its previously announced policy for employees to “do your best” to come to the office. Those who do go to the office will not only be required to wear a mask and remain socially distanced, but starting on August 16, the firm will have a new vaccination mandate. “This rule is consistent with those adopted by dozens of other Am Law 100 firms, the U.S. military and many of our clients, with more every day,” chairman Guy Halgren wrote in a memo. “It keeps us all safer and gives those who are vaccinated greater comfort in coming to the office. As under our current rule, proof of that vaccination must have been uploaded to our database. Over 1360 of us have uploaded their records.”

Will your firm be changing its plans when it comes to vaccination for attorneys and staff thanks to the Delta variant? Please let us know.

(Flip to the following page to read the memos from Cleary Gottlieb and Sheppard Mullin.)

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to the office.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

Laurie Green

“This goes out to all the women getting it in / Get on your grind / To the other men that respect what I do / Please accept my shine.” — [Beyoncé](http://genius.com/Beyonce-run-the-world-girls-lyrics)

In June, Laurie Green joined Kara MacCullough and Flora Perez at Greenberg Traurig LLP (GT). After some time apart, this was quite the reunion.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
MacCullough and Perez both attended the University of Miami School of Law, but didn’t meet until they worked together at Morgan Lewis & Bockius LLP and then Akerman LLP. Green graduated cum laude from the Shepard Broad College of Law at Nova Southeastern University and spent several years at the SEC before joining the other two at Akerman.


Flora Perez

Twelve years ago, Perez left Akerman and went in-house, eventually becoming deputy general counsel at Ryder. Nine year ago, MacCullough and Green departed and joined Holland and Knight LLP. Five years ago, MacCullough was the first of the three to join GT. Two years ago Perez joined MacCullough. And in June, Green made this three-wise-women reunion official. Rarely is a career path linear. In the cases of MacCullough, Perez, and Green, their career paths were educational expeditions that eventually served to reunite each other at GT and bring them all back to sunny South Florida.

If you think this introduction was a little hard to follow, try jotting down notes while listening to this team’s fast-paced conversation and witty banter.

Kara MacCullough

I told them their humor, remarks, and familiarity with each other reminded me of another team out of South Florida, [The Golden Girls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Girls). But they were quick to point out that they were much much younger than the cast of the 80’s and 90’s hit sitcom. In 2013, the [Guinness World Records](http://www.today.com/entertainment/betty-white-breaking-bad-earn-guinness-world-records-titles-8C11089734) recognized [Betty White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_White), a cast member of The Golden Girls, as having the longest television career for a female entertainer. Like White, I have a feeling the MacCullough-Perez-Green dream team will have a long and successful run before their final curtain calls.

If you’re interested in career advice or why MacCullough’s, Perez’s, and Green’s spirit animals are a dolphin, deer, and dachshund, respectively, be sure to reach out and ask them. In the meantime, here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation:

Renwei Chung (RC): You all have had the opportunity to reconnect in June and now have five associates as part of your team. What is the best part of working together again and what is your plan for the next five years?

Kara MacCullough, Flora Perez, and Laurie Green (KM/FP/LG): We brought the team back together at Greenberg Traurig because we all enjoy working together. We share the same work philosophy and the same approach to servicing our clients. Since we each have different backgrounds and experiences, we’re able to help and complement each other and provide our clients with a broader range of perspectives and solutions – all of which are a tremendous added value to our clients. As teammates and friends, we fill in for each other and support each other both professionally and personally.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The strong team concept allows us to balance our work and family lives. Our goal is to continue growing our client base by serving as partners and advisors to both public and private companies. For example, as part of our efforts to better service our clients, we have started a bi-weekly newsletter, GT Insights for Public Companies, that helps keep our clients up to date on recent corporate, securities, governance and accounting issues that are important for public companies.

RC: Many law teams consist of lawyers who started in Biglaw directly from law school. But your team brings a vast amount of outside experience — investment banking, in-house / general counsel, and SEC work. How do your clients benefit from this diverse knowledge?

KM/FP/LG: Because of this diverse background, we are better able to counsel our clients, proactively identify issues and find effective solutions. It is so much more efficient to be able to work with each other and know that we have these resources right here at Greenberg Traurig. We’re able to bring more to the table. With Kara’s banking background [she was an investment banker at Citibank in Latin America for 5 years before law school], Flora’s experience as in-house counsel and Laurie’s tenure at the SEC, we can examine client issues from a variety of perspectives and provide more well-rounded advice.  It’s truly more appealing to our clients knowing that we have such a diverse and experienced team.

RC: Your Ft. Lauderdale-based team works with global companies such as Restaurant Brands International (parent company of Burger King and Tim Horton), SBA Communications, and World Fuel Services. How were you able to establish these type of relationships in South Florida and be so competitive with larger market (e.g., New York-based) legal teams.

KM/FP/LG: We work with sophisticated national and global companies who understand that we are extremely competitive with other legal teams in larger markets. We certainly have the experience and important representations under our belts to represent high-profile clients and provide the counsel and guidance that they require.  Our clients like that they can get the same quality service and expertise as they would in larger markets while benefiting from our hands-on approach to client service. Our clients appreciate the level of responsiveness and commitment that we think is unique to our team. 

RC: What is your favorite aspect of securities law and/or what is the best part of being an attorney?

KM: As an attorney, I really enjoy the opportunity to learn about new industries, and I like to structure and solve problems for our clients. I really get into the details and learn as much as possible about each client so I can provide the most effective and relevant advice and solutions. The work I do for my clients allows me to leverage my banking experience and instincts in helping them solve problems and meet their objectives.

FP: Being in-house, I most enjoyed the collaboration and sense of community in a corporate environment. But now being part of this Greenberg team has allowed me to expand my reach into other industries, issues and transactions while maintaining that same level of teamwork.

LG: I really enjoy the challenging aspects of securities laws – it is constantly changing and never gets boring.  After spending years at the SEC, which I enjoyed very much, I like structuring deals, drafting documents and working with clients to find a practical solution.  I find that I have a more challenging role here as an attorney and this is a great opportunity for me to help grow the practice.

RC: For out-of-state law students and young attorneys who would love to practice in the state of Florida, what advice do you have for them to break into this legal market?

LG: They must have realistic expectations. Their first job may not be their “dream job,” but will provide the skills and knowledge to advance towards ultimate career goals. Working for the SEC was a great experience for me and I would suggest that new law graduates consider working for the government to gain valuable experience which will make them more marketable.

RC:  It was great chatting with all of you. Is there anything else you would like to share with our audience?

KM: It was great chatting with you as well. I want to add that as female attorneys, with demanding careers, children and families, and trying to balance life in general, it’s important for us to help support each other and help each other grow. This is part of what makes our team here at Greenberg Traurig so successful and what motivates us to grow our practice and be a legal powerhouse.

It’s a lot of work, but being able to work with women who are understanding and supportive makes it all possible. Now we are focused on continuing to grow our practice!

On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, I would like to thank Kara MacCullough, Flora Perez, and Laurie Green for sharing their experience and wisdom with our audience. We wish them continued success in their careers.

The Patriot Legal Expense Fund Trust was set up by three lawyers from what Am Law 200 firm? The fund was established to assist with the legal expenses of aides from the Trump campaign, transition, and administration in conjunction with the Mueller investigation and the House and Senate probes into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Hint: According to documents released by the Office of Government Ethics, the fund will not be used by Donald Trump or his immediate family.

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

According to a new survey by LawVision and BigHand of managing partners, COOs, CFOs, pricing chiefs, and other senior law firm professionals at 50 firms in the U.S., Canada, United Kingdom, and Europe, what percentage are satisfied with their firm’s profitability?

Hint: Last year’s profitability satisfaction clocked in at 87 percent — it is down this year.

# Top Biglaw Firm Returns To The Office With Mandatory Tuesday-Thursday Attendance
## Will mandating the hybrid days take away the soul of being hybrid?

Davis Polk announced its [new return to office policy](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2022/04/IMG_7563.jpg) late last week. As the whole Biglaw world waits to see which reopening plan becomes the new normal, DPW adopted an approach that maintains a work from home element while mandating full office attendance on certain days to facilitate the in-office mentorship and business development opportunities that offices bring.

Unfortunately, this also requires rejecting the flexibility that many lawyers have come to see as the primary benefit of remote working over the past couple of years.

Beginning Monday, May 2, and for the indefinite future, we will follow the policy outlined below.

Lawyers are expected to work in-office three to four days a week. Attendance is mandatory on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays for all practices and seniority levels.

It seems to me that “three to four days a week” and mandating attendance for three specific days means lawyers are going to work “three days a week.” Not that there’s anything wrong with that, but that’s what’s going to happen.

On the one hand, there’s a value to guaranteeing that everyone is in the office at the same time. On the other hand, is there really a benefit to everyone being there the same three days a week? Could the firm accomplish the same impact holding one “all hands day” on, say, Tuesday and leaving it to lawyers and practice groups to work out their own best practices on dividing up the other days? Perhaps.

In-office attendance throughout the month of August will depend in part on the configuration of our law school recruiting needs during that time period, which is under consideration and will be communicated in due course. We will not have floating remote weeks this summer in light of the importance of in-office attendance to our summer program. Our floating remote week policy for the fall and winter will be announced in due course.

Whenever lawyers say they never want to go back to the office, events like the summer program should give them pause. This is where the firm relies on lawyers to build connections to the next generation and, ideally, convince them to return and pick up a share of the load. If lawyers go fully remote that’s just never going to happen. But it doesn’t necessarily overcome the question of whether or not mandating three specific days of attendance is the answer.

Everyone is watching everyone else as they navigate the return to office. Maybe this is the experiment that just plain works. Maybe it’s too much and the firm has to reconfigure the policy in September. Either way it’s going to be an interesting summer all across Biglaw.

# Free Pizza For Palestine Is Too Messy For Milbank
## $250,000 is not enough money to make Harvard Law do anything.

Harvard students march to the pizza parlor.

Harvard Law School does not need your money. Harvard Law School wants your money and it will take your money, but HLS does not do, or not do, something because any one individual gave it some money. I know this is going to sound arrogant, but people give money to Harvard for the privilege of saying that they gave money to Harvard. There is no single donor who can hold the Law School economically hostage.

The law firm [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/milbank-tweed-hadley-mccloy/) has made a prestige endowment to Harvard Law School. It’s called the “Milbank Tweed Student Conference Fund” and, as you might expect, it supports student activities at the law school. Recently, Milbank reportedly threatened to pull the endowment because a group called “Justice for Palestine” used some of the Milbank money to sponsor a talk titled [“The Palestine Exception to Free Speech: A Movement Under Attack”](https://www.facebook.com/events/1170989229582453/) last fall. The students used the money to buy pizza and, while promoting the event, said, “This event is brought to you by the generous support of Milbank LLP.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Under ordinary circumstances, that would be the appropriate thing to do. For instance: [“Come to the Dealbreaker/ATL Town Maul tonight, sponsored by SoFi.](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/town-maul-tickets-20957850495)” (I, for the record, still owe Harvard money and therefore can be bought.)

But Harvard Law School’s Justice for Palestine (JFP) group, writing in the [Harvard Law Record](http://hlrecord.org/2016/02/hls-took-a-stand-for-palestine-programming-students-must-now-bear-the-cost-the-story-they-dont-want-you-to-hear-about-what-happened-to-milbank-funding/), claims that Milbank did not take the shout-out in an ordinary way:

[T]he Dean of Students office—citing a flood of angry phone calls and emails received from Milbank executives and other off-campus parties over the previous 24 hours—asked an organizer of the [Palestine Exception to Free Speech] event to disassociate from Milbank in all past and future Justice for Palestine programming…

Administrators would later reveal that Milbank had gone so far as to demand that JFP’s Milbank funding be rescinded completely. According to [Harvard Law School Dean Martha Minow], this was not a demand her administration could honor, so Milbank decided to pull out all of its annual $250,000 in student activity funding as a result of her administration’s “principled stance” in support of our right to speak openly and honestly about Palestine.

That is a bad look for Milbank. Throwing a hissy fit about speech over a panel about free speech is petty and tone deaf. And if anyone at Milbank thought that messing around with $250,000 was enough to make HLS do anything… they greatly overestimated the effect of $250,000 on the law school.

I could see HLS setting fire to a quarter of a million dollars in the middle of Wasserstein Hall just to see which students were desperate enough to fish cash out of the flames. I cannot see HLS regulating student activity based on the public relations concerns of Milbank Tweed.

There was some concern in the HLS Record article that Milbank’s decision would cripple all student organizations until HLS could find alternative funding. But, come on. You could shake $250K out of the couch cushions in the law library there.

Still, we reached out to Milbank to see why they wanted to “disassociate” from the Justice for Palestine student group and HLS student activities. Milbank didn’t give us a comment, but the firm did refer us to an HLS spokesperson. Which is weird, right? We wanted to know why Milbank wanted something done, not why HLS decided not to do the thing it was never going to do. If the firm wasn’t going to go full Trump, a banal “some of our best friends are Palestinians” statement seemed like the best move.

In any event, we asked HLS if Milbank had pulled its student activity funding, and why. HLS did its best to cover Milbank’s ass here, basically arguing that money is fungible, but I think it’s a tough sell:

Milbank has not terminated its five-year gift or its support for the Law School. Milbank was never involved in decisions about which events to fund or not to fund. The Law School and Milbank are committed to freedom of speech and they do not decide which events to fund based on point of view.

The firm has decided there are other ways its support could be used at HLS to avoid creating any misimpressions that the firm endorses the viewpoints expressed by any particular student organization or journal. The Law School is able to fund student conferences with other resources, and the Law School has continued to maintain the same level of funding to support student activities. We are grateful for the many terrific speakers, conferences, and events led by our thoughtful and creative students, and we look forward to many more to come. We have an exceptionally strong relationship with Milbank, which has acted appropriately and with the highest integrity in all respects. We look forward to continuing that strong relationship in the future, and to discussing with Milbank how best to deploy its gift to further the Law School’s mission.

Student groups seeking funds for conferences and speakers are invited to confer with the Dean of Students office and can receive advice about how to ensure the best quality of programming and to secure funding.

Milbank has not terminated its student activities fund… Milbank has decided that there are other ways to support the school without funding student activities. Okay. Roger, boss.

Joking aside, Harvard kids shouldn’t get too bent out of shape — soon somebody will pay them very well to make these kinds of distinctions without a difference.

Coming soon on Modern Campus Controversies: Students reupholster the new $250,000 “Milbank Chair” with the Palestinian Flag. Wry protest or anti-Semitic microagression?

# Biglaw's Bad Ideas: 4-Day Office Mandates And Attendance-Based Bonus Policies

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Firms are still trying to navigate this and figure out what makes sense, and I think some are thinking things are working reasonably well right now, and flexibility is a recruiting asset. … There are others who believe a four-day week is where firms will end up.

— [Lisa Smith](https://fairfaxassociates.com/our-people/lisa-smith/), a principal at Fairfax Associates in Washington, D.C., in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/08/01/ropes-move-to-4-days-in-the-office-also-applies-to-international-offices/) on Biglaw firms’ plans to bring associates back to the office four days each week on a mandatory basis. Smith also shared her thoughts on certain Biglaw firms tying office attendance to associates’ bonus packages, saying, “It depends on how they are really going to put it in place and practice. I’d be surprised if it were a popular aspect of the compensation scheme.”

# Biglaw Firm's Three-Day Office Workweek Descending Into Paranoid Surveillance
## As expected.

Transitioning to a hybrid work model was never going to be easy. When the pandemic forced lawyers to adapt to working from home, it started to dawn on the industry that those attorneys might not be excited to return to spending hours commuting to their office. After the work-from-home years resulted in absolutely gangbusters productivity and — more importantly — profitability, the days of the five-day office workweek were numbered as four- and even three-day office plans proliferated.

Get it? Days were numbered and… oh, never mind.

There are a lot of ways to build a hybrid system: from asking associates to show up on the honor system, to having lawyers claim certain days of the week to balance the in-office staffing throughout the week, to [Cravath’s flexible 3.5 model](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/cravath-lays-out-3-5-day-week-remote-working-model/).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And then there’s the dumbest of all models: mandating a Tuesday-Thursday work week.

What’s to be gained? Yes, the whole office is in one place at one time, but it also makes the place a ghost town on two days of the traditional work week. Permanent four-day weekends — to the extent “weekends” exist in Biglaw — aren’t the actual selling point of hybrid work models. What the associates (and [a lot of the partners too](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/partners-making-more-money-than-ever-but-gender-diversity-gaps-stubbornly-remain/), truth be told) appreciated about working from home was the flexibility of crafting their own schedule. It was about being at home Wednesdays because that’s the day grandma isn’t able to watch the kids. Forcing mandatory days on lawyers misses the whole point.

And the firm gets little out of it either because the advantages from hybrid work are gained in hoteling offices. When everyone shows up on the same days, there’s no opportunity to budget space and maybe cut back on square footage. Which brings us back to one of the low-key drivers of the “get back to the office” firms: how much time is left on the lease? These deals aren’t all public knowledge, but dollars to doughnuts says the firms most eager to have every office filled at once are locked in for the rest of the decade while the ones leaning into hybrid work are on the cusp of shaving a couple of floors off their ledger.

In any event, “mandatory hybrid” is the worst of all hybrid worlds.

Skadden Arps went with this stupid model and has already [started sending passive-aggressive memos](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/elite-biglaw-firm-gently-reminds-associates-to-get-back-to-the-office-after-remote-august/) about lawyers not following the square-peg, round-hole model.

Now comes Ropes and Gray, where we’re hearing reports that multiple associates are receiving calls from the firm staffing team whenever they aren’t in the office on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. Which, of course, could be for a million reasons. I don’t have access to my Biglaw-era billing diaries but it wasn’t uncommon for me to be out of the office for a full-day meeting with a client on one matter without partners on another matter knowing. My secretary could let everyone know, but of course Biglaw as a whole has drastically cut back on admins so that may not be an option anymore.

In a more rational office policy, the firm could see that lawyer pop up on a Monday to check in after being out Wednesday and think nothing of it. But now the firm is wasting resources checking up on people in pursuit of a vain “100 percent attendance” policy. One tipster reports, “General unhappiness around this and surprise that the firm is going this far to enforce the policy.” Obviously.

But this is also inevitable. Any hybrid policy focused on getting everyone under the same roof on the same days will descend into paranoid surveillance eventually because the policy itself indicates that the firm cares more about where lawyers are than flexibility. If a hybrid plan isn’t about empowering attorney flexibility, then it’s not really a hybrid plan — it’s a mandatory attendance policy dialed back to three days out of necessity to keep up with competitors offering real hybrid work.

And that can only work for so long.

# Biglaw Firms Leaking Profits Due To Write-Offs Are Pushing Lawyers To Bill Even More
## Bill, baby, bill! Bill, baby, bill!

The speed with which write-offs have increased this year should be sounding loud alarm bells. Not only have 75% of NA and 64% of UK firms confirmed an increase this year, but 55% of NA and 48% of UK firms confirm that write-offs have increased by more than 10%.

— An excerpt from new report from legal tech company BigHand, concerning an [increase in write-offs that “should be raising eyebrows”](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/12/02/increasing-write-offs-and-discounts-in-client-bills-should-sound-loud-alarm-bells-for-firm-profits/) because it could do serious damage to Biglaw profits. In response, firms are “driving lawyers hard to increase billable hours” but BigHand analysts say this could put talent at risk of making lateral moves because “lawyers, especially the next generation, don’t want to work more hours.”

To be a summer associate is exciting: great pay, limited responsibility, and your first glimpse into how the legal world works.

At the same time, there are risks.

You will be feted, but you will also be observed and your behavior scrutinized.

First impressions count and could determine whether you make — as long as you don’t give up or lose your mind — roughly $2 million over the next eight years as an associate paid on the current scale.

In this eBook, our friends at Kinney Recruiting share tips, tricks, and guidelines that will help you succeed, if you can remember and implement them.

# The Incredible Growing Presidential Legal Team
## Will the name Ty Cobb still be associated with a-holes?

Ty Cobb

Times of trouble, specifically legal trouble, are boon times for lawyers. This weekend the White House announced the personal legal team of the president was getting another Biglaw bump — this time from Hogan Lovells partner [Ty Cobb](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/ty-cobb).

[According to Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-14/trump-said-to-hire-lawyer-ty-cobb-to-respond-to-russia-probes), Cobb’s role will be one of “traffic cop, enforcer of discipline, and public spokesman — the point person for queries from congressional panels and the Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller. He’ll also work not only with Kasowitz’s team but with outside lawyers hired by others in Trump’s inner circle.” When the president is dealing with multiple investigations less than a year into his term, an enforcer is exactly what is needed, especially when dealing with a legal team that has brought [their own](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/jay-sekulow-masterful-showman-or-terrible-attorney/)… [baggage](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/marc-kasowitz-writes-angry-emails-and-everyone-completely-overreacts/) to the party. Sounds like Cobb will need some of the [his namesake’s](http://www.cmgww.com/baseball/cobb/) — who’s also a distant relative — legendary meanness (even if that reputation was [unfair](http://www.freep.com/story/entertainment/arts/2015/06/09/ty-cobb-myth-legend-popular-culture/28765125/)) to survive the task.

It’s also interesting that a HoLove attorney is making the switch to Team Trump — [according to Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/07/14/ty-cobb-resigns-from-hogan-lovells-to-join-trump-legal-team/), Cobb has submitted his resignation to the firm, but he is currently traveling and he won’t officially leave until the end of July. While big firms usually have lawyers of every political stripe working there, Hogan Lovells is involved in litigation directly opposed to the Trump administration. The firm is repping the state of Hawaii in the battle against the March 6th executive order that bans travel from six Muslim majority countries. And Law.com reports some of Cobb’s soon-to-be-former colleagues aren’t pleased with his new job:

One person affiliated with Hogan Lovells expressed frustration Friday over Cobb’s new assignment, and how it could conflict with the Hawaii case, which names Trump as a party. The conflict would evaporate when Cobb leaves the firm—but that isn’t planned for another two weeks. It is not yet known when Cobb will return from his travels.

Leaving discontentment in his wake? Sounds like Cobb is already ready for his work with Donald Trump.

# Debevoise Cuts International Business Travel Over Coronavirus Fears
## Likely the firmest of many similar policies.

As COVID-19 continues to spread, firms are taking the sort of proactive measures to ensure the safety of employees that the federal government eschews [in favor of praying about it](https://www.globalresearch.ca/photo-shows-pence-team-trying-pray-away-coronavirus/5705225). The latest move in the effort to address the spread of the disease comes from Debevoise, who announced the suspension of all “non-essential international business travel.”

The policy excepts only trips approved by senior firm leadership, so your team had better feel pretty confident about that trip before you bug the management.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Effective immediately, the firm is suspending all non-essential international business travel. For any international business travel to be considered essential, it must be approved in advance by me (for lawyers in New York), Arthur Armstrong (for administrative staff in New York), or your Managing Partner (for offices outside New York). Subject to the below, domestic business travel is not affected by this policy.

While the policy allows most domestic travel, the firm isn’t interested in putting employees in contact with large groups of people:

Also effective immediately, the firm is suspending all travel (international and domestic) for conference attendance, including conferences at which our personnel are scheduled to speak. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by me (for lawyers in New York), Arthur Armstrong (for administrative staff in New York), or your Managing Partner (for offices outside New York).

Personal travel is still not regulated by the firm, but management is requiring notification for travel to afflicted countries and a self-quarantine whenever folks return:

We will continue to leave to individuals the decision concerning whether to travel for personal reasons. If you do travel for personal reasons, however, that travel will still be subject to the policy announced on March 2: “You must continue to notify the Managing Partner in your office (or me, if you are in New York) if you intend to travel to any of the following: China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Macau, Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Italy and Iran. Please note that if you travel to any of these countries or regions – even if only to transit through an airport located in one of these countries or regions on your way to/from another destination – we are likely to ask you to stay out of the office and work remotely for 14 days after your last presence in the country or region in question. Assuming you exhibit no symptoms of COVID-19 at the end of that fourteen day period, you may return to the office.”

If health policies are anything like bonuses — and we suspect they’re everything like bonuses — expect the rest of the Biglaw elite to quickly follow suit.

And then expect Cravath to go over the top.

# Biglaw Associates Caught Overbilling Lose Jobs, Ability To Practice Law
## Stop padding your hours, because those pesky ethical obligations will always catch up with you.

Billing is a big — nay, huge — part of working at a Biglaw firm. As an associate, your life is divided into tenths of an hour, and if you don’t meet your hourly requirements by year end, you can expect to be penalized accordingly. Everyone else may be getting enormous bonuses but not you. No, you’ll be lucky if you’re able to receive half as much as everyone else if you miss your billing milestones.

Unfortunately, this harsh reality is why some lawyers overbill their clients. If they get caught, the punishment can be even worse than going without a bonus.

John P. Paleczny and Stephanie A. Gerstetter, now former associates at Lewis Brisbois and Reed Smith, respectively, learned this lesson the hard way. As reported by the [ABA Journal](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/2-former-biglaw-associates-get-suspensions-for-inflating-hourly-records), both Illinois attorneys will be suspended from the practice of law for inflating their hours, with their suspensions to commence on October 14.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Paleczny received a tougher suspension because his behavior was quite questionable. How questionable? We’re talking billing thousands of hours to a closed case. We previously discussed the matter [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/biglaw-lawyer-bills-2000-hours-to-closed-matter-disciplinary-committee-displeased/). Again, here are the details:

Paleczny was [accused in a June ethics complaint](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/former-biglaw-associate-is-accused-of-recording-more-than-2000-hours-on-closed-pro-bono-case) of recording more than 2,000 annual hours on a closed pro bono case, earning a $12,000 bonus as a result. …

Paleczny was fired in February 2021 after admitting that he was recording time on the case, even though it had been tossed, the ethics complaint alleged. Paleczny was representing a federal inmate who said he lost his prison job as an orderly in the law library after he complained about a new library policy.

After his firing, Paleczny interviewed with at least four Chicago law firms, falsely saying he was laid off from Lewis Brisbois because he did not have enough work to do, the ethics complaint alleged.

Paleczny will be suspended for one year’s time, and on top of that, he will remain suspended until he successfully completes a professionalism seminar.

Gerstetter, on the other hand, who worked at Reed Smith from September 2018 until June 2020, when the firm conducted an inquiry into her billing practices, merely (comparatively speaking) overbilled a client on a document review project to the tune of 86.4 hours. Gerstetter’s padding of her hours resulted in an overcharge of more than $40,000 to Reed Smith’s client, which the firm later refunded. Here are the details. courtesy of the [ABA Journal](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/2-former-biglaw-associates-get-suspensions-for-inflating-hourly-records):

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The complaint alleged that the time that Gerstetter entered into the billing system for the document review project was greater than the time recorded on Relativity, the program used to analyze and code digital documents. The times should have been about the same, the complaint said.

Gerstetter will be suspended for 60 days, and she agreed to the disciplinary action.

Stop overbilling on your assignments. No matter how big or how small the hourly overage, someone will eventually catch you, and you’re not going to like the results.

# On Succinct Advice
## What type of lawyer are you -- someone who underkills a project, or someone who overkills?

“My advice is succinct,” my lunch dates tells me. “I cut right to the chase, and I give the client what it needs in just two pages. Then I send a draft of that advice to other people in the firm, and they say it’s not what they need. ‘This is terrible. We’ll have to rewrite the whole thing. Don’t worry about it; we’ll do it here.’

“My two-page memo gets turned into 14 pages. They start with the main conclusion, which is just what I said in two pages. And then they lard the memo up with citations. And then they start with alternatives: ‘If this, then that.’ And then they rule out all the alternatives, and come back around to what I concluded in the first place. What fools! They’re just churning the bills! But it makes it hard for me to sell what I do within the firm.”

Maybe.

Maybe not.

It’s certainly true that I’ve seen overkill. The memo should have been a few pages long, and it ran on forever. That’s a sin.

But I’ve also seen the opposite. You ask someone for a contract interpretation, and they cite one case and draw a conclusion.

You give the same assignment to a real lawyer, and it turns out it’s a little more complex. There are several different cases pointing in different directions. And, if you look closely enough, it turns out that the negotiating history might be relevant. The real lawyer thus interviews the three people on your side involved in negotiating the contract, and reviews their notes of conversations, and gives a fully informed opinion.

One approach is basically costless. It gives you a conclusion, and it gets you to the finish line. (And, depending on the lawyer, it may or may not be correct.)

The other approach can be quite expensive. But if the issue is going to be the subject of massive litigation, then it’s worthwhile to learn what the real answer is before the case is filed.

The question is what you need. Do you need down and dirty, since no one is going to challenge the conclusion? Or do you need to know the real answer, because there’s going to be a fight?

It also depends on what you can afford to spend. If you can’t afford the real answer, then you might settle for a fake.

But it also requires — and this may be the key — that the lawyer doing the work can tell the difference.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The lawyer who underkills a project — producing a two-page memo where 20 were required — may not know what good legal work looks like. (She may, of course. And she may have proved that by doing thorough legal work in the past. But two pages and no deep thought may also be all that she’s capable of.)

The lawyer who overkills a project — producing a 20-page memo where two were required — has a different issue. You’re comfortable that this person can beat the living daylights out of a legal issue. But are you comfortable that that person has the self-restraint, and confidence, to produce the lesser product when that’s all that’s needed?

As for my lunch date, I don’t know what to think.

Maybe he doesn’t know what good looks like, and he’s in fact not thinking about issues hard enough.

Maybe he doesn’t have the capacity to think hard enough, and he couldn’t do it if he tried.

Or maybe, when the situation calls for it, this person thinks carefully about all the issues and produces work product that shows it.

For those guilty of underkill: Are you sure you know what a complete examination of the issues looks like?

For those guilty of overkill: You have the raw skills, and you plainly know how to think an issue through completely. But do you have the judgment (and the client’s agreement) to produce less than perfection when that’s what the occasion requires?

While we all knew the most recent round of raises would not be matched by all the Am Law 200, now we have a firm breaking with the pack in the other direction.

DC power firm Williams & Connolly, number 89 on the Am Law 200 with $523,250,000 in gross revenue, announced new associate pay effective January 1 and it’s… above the market scale.

Class	Salary	Difference
Class of 2023	$250K	$25K
Class of 2022	$290K	$55K
Class of 2021	$325K	$65K
Class of 2020	$365K	$55K
Class of 2019	$410K	$45K
Class of 2018	$435K	$45K

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm To Merge With Prominent Boutique, Creating 1150-Lawyer Powerhouse
## And the combined cultures at these firms can't be beat.

Not a week has passed in the new year without the mention of a law firm merger, and the latest one may be the biggest one yet.

Orrick — a firm that brought home $1,316,335,000 gross revenue in 2021, putting it in 35th place in the most recent Am Law 100 — recently announced that it would be combining with Am Law 200 firm Buckley, which generated $148,496,000 gross revenue in 2021.

Per the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/01/19/orrick-to-merge-with-buckley-nearly-doubling-its-dc-footprint/), Orrick’s and Buckley’s combined $1.47 billion in revenue would have ranked it No. 28 on last year’s Am Law 100. Around 100 lawyers (including about 35 partners) will join Orrick, for a total of about 1,150 attorneys. Together, they will create a Biglaw powerhouse, serving as a leader in representation among financial services firms and fintech innovators.

Through this merger, Orrick will not only significantly expand its D.C. footprint and grow its teams across the country in New York, Santa Monica, and San Francisco, but it will also add a new office in Chicago. It’s important to note here that while other Biglaw firms seem to be scrambling to think up ways to cut budgets and headcount, the Orrick/Buckley merger brings together two firms that have consistently been recognized as some of the best places to work in the industry, focused on a healthy work-life balance for their associates. If you recall, Orrick was one of the very first firms to offer associates [bonus-eligible hours, simply for taking time off](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/top-50-biglaw-firm-rolls-out-incredible-bonus-eligible-time-off-policy/).

Here’s what the leaders of both firms said in a press release about the merger:

“Our finance and tech clients are innovating in an environment of increasing regulatory and enforcement uncertainty – it’s one of their primary business risks. As these sectors converge, the combined firm will offer valuable regulatory and sector insight to these innovators and their investors who need to see around regulatory corners in pursuing their strategies,” said Orrick Chair Mitch Zuklie. “This kind of forward-looking advice is key to Orrick’s strategy – and we are extraordinarily fortunate to add the Buckley talent and strengthen our culture with the collaborative, innovative, entrepreneurial DNA of the Buckley team.”

“It’s a watershed moment as the consumer finance and technology markets converge. This transformation creates a host of novel and precedent-setting regulatory, transactional and litigation risks and opportunities for our clients – and by joining forces with Orrick, we will be able to partner closely with our clients on top-quality, holistic solutions,” said Buckley Co-Managing Partner Clint Rockwell.

“Buckley was founded on a vision of thinking differently about both our clients’ business opportunities and challenges, as well as the practice of law – and in Orrick, we have an extraordinary partner in taking that vision forward,” said Buckley Co-Managing Partner Chris Witeck.

The merger is expected to close by the end of the month. Congratulations to everyone at Orrick and Buckley on this exciting new venture.

A Dentons partner is facing charges for drunk driving that resulted in the death of a 16-year-old girl. Shane Stevenson, a corporate partner in the Edmonton office of Dentons Canada, had a blood-alcohol level over .08 at the time of his arrest.

According to police, Chloe Wiwchar, 16, was crossing the street at the crosswalk on Kingsway Avenue — a main Edmonton road — around 11 p.m. when she was struck by a pickup truck which immediately fled the scene. An off-duty officer witnessed the crash, and provided assistance to Wiwchar before following the pickup truck while providing information to police dispatch. Stevenson was arrested shortly after.

Wiwchar was taken to a local hospital where she was pronounced dead.

# Biglaw Firm Lays Off Stuffy Dress Code Instead Of Lawyers
## This law firm is ditching its suits and ties for t-shirts and sneakers.

When it comes to law firm mergers, everyone knows that layoffs are likely to follow most tie-ups, considering that there may be redundancies between offices. But what most people don’t know is that sometimes, personnel isn’t the only thing that’s expected to change dramatically following a merger. Sometimes, a firm’s dress code is in need of a major overhaul thanks to stylistic differences between the firms that have merged.

This seems to be what’s happening at CMS Cameron McKenna after its three-way merger with Nabarro and Olswang. CMS is a traditional law firm with stuffy suits and ties for all occasions, while Olswang focuses on creative tech clients, and its attorneys dress down accordingly. According to [Penelope Warne](https://cms.law/en/GBR/People/Penelope-Warne), chair of the combined firm, the dress code at the megafirm is about to change.

Here’s more information from [The Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/05/06/lawyers-get-dressing-uks-largest-legal-firm/):

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
CMS, the largest and most traditional of the three, has decided to loosen up its dress code, meaning lawyers can now turn up to work in trainers and a T-shirt to blend in with their new colleagues at the new concern, which will employ 7,500 staff.

“Even the most traditional of partners, who have been wearing a suit for years, feel like this is a breath of fresh air,” said Ms Warne, who hails from the CMS side. “Law has a reputation for being old fashioned, we want people to feel comfortable.”

Congrats to everyone at CMS Cameron McKenna on the casual new dress code. Now you’ll be able to [bill while you’re on the toilet](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/biglaw-firm-tells-lawyers-to-bill-clients-for-time-spent-on-toilet/) all the more comfortably.

Today’s topic: life as a patent litigator.

- What do you do in a typical day?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
As a patent litigator, a typical day depends on the stage of the case. Early work on a case involves a lot of prior art review and product analysis – dry but interesting strategic work. There is often a great deal of back-and-forth with clients to work out an overall litigation strategy. The mid-section of the case is the grind – written discovery, lengthy infringement or invalidity contentions, preliminary work with various witnesses, and expert reports. Claim construction briefing and fact-witness depositions are a welcome breeze during that section.

The fun comes with pre-trial and trial: taking expert depositions, writing summary judgment briefs, and drafting direct- and cross-examination outlines. Practicing with a trial-heavy firm means trial practice is a routine part of the day. It is an exhausting thrill.

- Who do you work with?
Early in their career, junior associates will generally report to a central senior associate or a junior partner. Expert witnesses take up a lot of air in patent cases, so junior associates can expect to work with them early and often throughout their careers.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Around their third or fourth year, associates should expect to have more direct contact with lead counsel on the case. Most associates will also start to routinely interact with the client – engineers, inventors, employees on the finance side, and in-house counsel. Associates will also start to work with third parties more often – prior artists, commercial partners, or former employees.

When associates reach more senior levels, they will still routinely work with experts and partners of all levels. But a more senior associate should expect to (mercifully) manage junior associates while they handle some of the less rewarding interactions. More senior associates will also directly advise in-house counsel or other executives when partners request it or when the client reaches out to them specifically.

- What does a common career path look like?
The most common career path won’t surprise anyone: STEM degree -> J.D. -> Patent litigation firm. It is also very common for former patent examiners to move into practice.

That said, the common career path isn’t the only career path. Patent litigation is a field that has an active, on-going demand for good writers and strategic thinkers. The STEM path brings in a lot of brilliant individuals who have not been forced to hone their written or oral advocacy skills or broader strategic thinking. If individuals are comfortable with and interested in tech issues or biology or chemistry, they should not be deterred from the practice. Stay curious, study a lot, and when stumped, ask an expert. As an English major, doing those three things ended with partners accusing me of “being too technical for my own good.”

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
- If variety is the spice of life, how spicy is this practice area?
Those who come to patent litigation with a technical background can find themselves pigeon-holed into certain types of cases and tasks. In that situation, a lawyer’s case diet can turn bland. It is easier to develop a varied caseload for those who focus on strategic thinking and communication skills, rather than subject-matter expertise.

From a broader task-based perspective, it’s hard to imagine a more diverse practice area. A patent litigator needs to be an effective written and oral advocate, a careful technical writer, a strong leader and tactician, a good manager of egos and eccentricities (in dealing with experts, inventors, prior artists and engineers, as well as colleagues), and an effective questioner of both fact-witnesses and wily technical experts.

- How much wear and tear?
Patent litigation can be slow and grinding or can proceed at lightspeed. Because patent local rules setting out strict deadlines have proliferated so widely, however, patent litigators generally have a good sense of when the big deadlines will fall. Learning to make reasonable guesses about which schedules will stick and which will not – and treating the partners who assign work with the love and respect they deserve – can keep the pace to a quick jog rather than a sprint.

Expectations are high. Because there is a lot of freedom to strategize, there are a lot of opportunities to make both good and bad judgment calls – what claims to assert and construe, what art to focus on, etc. Patent litigators can’t be scared of those calls, or the stress will eat them up.

- Of the people in this practice group who hate it, what exactly do they hate about it?
If anyone actively hates patent litigation, it is easy to move into general litigation. That said, people are deeply annoyed with two things: (1) the general inefficiency of patent litigation, and (2) the repetitive nature of a lot of tasks. Points (1) and (2) are related. Patent litigation lends itself to using standard documents and templates as a jumping-off point for most work, but if supervising attorneys are not focused on efficiency, lawyers can end up recreating the wheel on each and every case.

- Of the people in this practice group who love it, what exactly do they love about it?
Patent litigation rewards creative, strategic thinking. Each case presents the opportunity to interpret the bounds of a unique legal document (a patent) as applied to the real world (products and processes). Because of that, each case is a blank-slate opportunity to match wits with some (often) very smart people. It’s rare to be cornered by the law right from the start.

Put more succinctly, patent litigators love outsmarting each other, rather than attacking each other, with the law as a cudgel.

- Are there common avenues out of this practice area?
Absolutely. There are two common options: Patent litigators can move in-house at an established company or start-up within their subject-matter expertise, or move into one of the related fields like tech journalism or financial analysis of IP-heavy industries. Because patent litigators are often tech-savvy and entrepreneurial, it is also common for practitioners to start their own companies in the tech, analytics, or legal services spaces.

- What are some market trends that impact this practice area?
The commonly accepted wisdom is that patent litigation is more recession-resistant than other practices because companies can often squeeze profit from their portfolios when they can’t from the market. Beyond that, the courts, as well as the state and federal legislatures, are moving to fight bad patents and nuisance suits from non-practicing entities. Some of that work has already made a dent – particularly the new inter partes review (IPR) system and the recent Alice decision. Other initiatives, like state laws discouraging nuisance suits, haven’t returned clear results yet. Overall, expect to see a noticeable decrease in cases involving non-practicing entities that actually reach a jury.

- If you had to recommend one candidate from a room crowded with recent bar exam graduates, what specific qualities would he or she have that would ensure success in this practice area?
Creativity and confidence. A number of promising junior associates struggle, despite being diligent attorneys with a fine grasp of the subject matter. In almost every case, those attorneys either didn’t graduate from checking the standard infringement and invalidity boxes by rote to making choices with bigger case themes and strategies in mind. For patent litigators, making that next-level move requires creativity and the confidence to articulate and defend their ideas.

# Biglaw Partner Wants The World To Know He Suffers From Depression
## He has an important message to convey to all other attorneys with mental health issues of their own.

Lawyers are more likely to suffer from depression than any other profession, but they often suffer in silence for fear of alerting their colleagues about their mental illness and being stigmatized for the rest of their careers. One Biglaw partner recently stepped out from behind the dark veil that is depression to let the world know that not only is it possible to survive with the disorder, it’s possible to thrive.

Meet [Joe Milowic](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/milowic-iii-joseph), a partner at Quinn Emanuel. Milowic recently published a piece in the [New York Law Journal](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2018/03/28/quinn-emanuel-partner-suffers-from-depression-and-he-wants-everyone-to-know/) about his battle with depression. Milowic was first diagnosed with major depression more than a decade ago, but he didn’t say a word to his colleagues about it until very recently. “As a young associate, I was worried people would be less likely to entrust me with important matters if they knew that I sometimes go through periods where I lose motivation and focus,” he writes. “So, I said nothing.” He found everything meaningless, from his job to even his own life.

It was only after Milowic started taking Lexapro that he stopped questioning the purpose of it all. He found meaning in things again, and realized that “when your mind is ill, you can actually believe there is no point to anything, including living.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Milowic is now going public with his mental illness because he has an important message to convey to all other attorneys with mental health issues of their own.

I put financial security above the possibility that speaking up could alert a young attorney unknowingly suffering from depression that what he is suffering through is an illness that is treatable. I feel badly for staying quiet for so long—but I also believe that speaking out now as a partner at Quinn Emanuel could be more impactful. The fact is we should be talking about this, because you can succeed in Big Law, and at a top law firm, even if you suffer from depression. I’m writing this in hopes that someone who is unknowingly suffering from depression, like I was, will read this and get help.

Milowic has some advice for associates everywhere who may be struggling with depression: although you may think it seems impossible, you must prioritize your health and your well-being over your work. You must take care of yourself, because you are more important than your cases, no matter how important those cases are.

Milowic invites those dealing with depression to contact him via [email](mailto:josephmilowic@quinnemanuel.com) or phone (212-849-7225) if they have any questions, or if they’d be interested in joining an online support group for attorneys who suffer from depression.

We’d like to extend our thanks to Joe Milowic for his selflessness and his willingness to be the face of this important issue in the legal profession. Because of him, we’re sure that many more lawyers will find the courage and confidence to step forward and share this part of themselves with their colleagues in the legal profession. Thank you.

# The Racism You Have To Get Through To Be A Biglaw Managing Partner
## His story is important for everyone in Biglaw to read.

Ellisen Turner

Irell & Manella has a new managing partner. That fact isn’t particularly surprising — management changes at Biglaw firms happen with regularity. But[ Ellisen Turner](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/ellisen-turner/), who recently got the nod to manage Irell, is African-American. Given the lack of diversity in the upper echelons of Biglaw, well, this is big news.

Vivia Chen at the Careerist [explains](http://www.law.com/sites/americanlawyer/2017/10/11/yes-its-news-when-big-law-elects-a-black-leader/) her reaction to the news, “Wow. He’s African-American! Anyone who pretends that she didn’t react the way I did is, well, pretending.” Chen went a step further than just marveling at his promotion, and spoke with Turner about the ways in which race has impacted his career. The resulting interview is a fascinating inside look at the intersection of race and Biglaw.

Turner admits to feeling pressure to succeed in his new role, especially because he doesn’t want to “fail” his community. And he says those expectations are pretty universal when diverse persons are elevated to important positions, “Even if someone says, ‘I don’t feel that pressure,’ there’s pressure.” He hasn’t lost his perspective though, saying this is on a different level than experiences his father went through:

My dad was one of the Norfolk 17 who integrated public schools in Norfolk, Virginia. I know what real pressure is like. And this doesn’t compare to what my dad went through. They were spat upon, and people tried to stab them.

But one of the most illuminating moments occurs when Turner is asked if he’s experienced racism in his career:

Yes! I live in the United States, after all.

Fair enough, but the story he goes on to tell is important for everyone in Biglaw to read. It shows how even in the midst of trying to recruit diverse lawyers, firms can let their implicit bias show:

When I was interviewing at firms, a partner invited me to go to the firm’s box at a Lakers game. When I went showed up, one of the first things a partner there said to me was, “We have enough soda.” He assumed I was there to serve them. I didn’t go to that firm. That attitude is there. There are people who have not interacted much with blacks, who can’t imagine that a young black man could be a lawyer.

And Turner’s story isn’t some outlier to be dismissed. Go ahead and ask any African-American lawyer, and they’ll have their own story of being overlooked or worse because of their skin color.

Turner believes the new horizon for meaningfully increasing diversity at law firms is no longer whether an African-American attorney will be hired, but whether they are put in a position to succeed. He’s optimistic that Biglaw is on the path to making progress, even though there may be setbacks:

But I don’t think we’re in as bad a position as people think we are. I believe firms and companies are not just giving lip service to diversity. I believe they think diversity will lead to better outcomes. But they are not quite clear about the tools that will get it done. People are having serious conversations about diversity. You have might have setbacks, and some people—well-meaning people—will work against your goals. But even those setback open doors.

# Biggest Firm Yet Matches Cravath Pay Scale!
## A HUGE number of associates just got a raise.

UPDATE (6/10/16 10:38 a.m.): We have news about the summers. Check out below.

In honor of this firm’s [recent appearance on Jeopardy](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/did-you-notice-jeopardy-had-a-law-firms-category/), we pose the following statement:

This Chicago-headquartered firm waited three days, but just now raised its associates’ salaries to match the Cravath scale.

What is… [Sidley Austin?](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/sidley-austin-llp/)

Yes, the massive firm — [fourth in U.S. headcount](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/whats-the-biggest-law-firm-in-the-country/) — just sent out [its “me too” memo](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biggest-firm-yet-matches-cravath-pay-scale/2/) joining the leading Biglaw firms in offering the Cravath salary structure to their associates. This makes Sidley the largest firm so far to join Cravath, increasing its salaries in all of its U.S. offices. (That’s by headcount; Latham is the [largest firm by gross revenue](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/earths-highest-grossing-law-firm-increases-associate-salaries-worldwide/) to follow Cravath.)

Borrowing from some verbiage I briefly and incorrectly placed in the [Clifford Chance post](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/international-firm-brings-its-u-s-associates-up-to-the-new-market/)… let’s chalk up Sidley as one of the growing number of firms capping this increase at the Class of 2008 and $315K. The momentum on the ’07/$325K vs. ’08/$315K (bracketing for the moment Sullivan & Cromwell’s decision to [(keep) beating the market](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-announcement-youve-been-waiting-for-sullivan-cromwell/) for those lawyers) is definitely tilting toward the latter option, but it’s not settled yet.

Counsel and summers are not covered by this memo, so let us know what happens there. UPDATE: Summers are covered. [Read all about it here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biggest-firm-yet-matches-cravath-pay-scale/3/).

The firm — who, in case you missed it, we recently recognized for its [impressive bankruptcy practice](https://abovethelaw.com/top-law-firm-bankruptcy-practices/) — is certainly in no financial danger itself, as this move to rejoin the market leaders shows. How’s that for a natural transition?

Congratulations to Sidley Austin associates!

Memo available [on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biggest-firm-yet-matches-cravath-pay-scale/2/).

Remember, when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”).

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Everybody agrees the future is bright. It’s just—when does that future start?

— Kent Zimmermann, legal management consultant at the Zeughauser Group, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2023/04/26/big-law-capital-markets-is-dead-long-live-capital-markets-work/) on the coming revival of Biglaw capital markets work. After an incredibly successful year in 2021, business in this practice area lagged in 2022, with work slowing to a crawl in 2023.

# Cowardice In The Age Of Coronavirus: The Proper Attitude For Litigators In The Face Of Global Pandemics
## If there was any time to turn over a new leaf, you won’t get too many chances better than this.

“For Christ’s sake men—come on! Do you want to live forever?” – Sergeant Major Daniel Daly, U.S.M.C.

Probably my proudest moment in my legal career was as a third-year associate. I’d been up for God knows how long and was getting out a document production. We’d had some last-minute technical issue, and it was likely going to be going out a few minutes past midnight, which in retrospect was a self-imposed deadline, but I really wanted to get it out by midnight. Also, at that point I’d been doing two-a-week productions for about a month, so I was feeling especially invested in the whole production enterprise.

At some point while I’m walking around the office, the only person on the floor, waiting for the technical issue to resolve, I hit a wall fatiguewise and thought I might collapse. I was together enough to realize that I might fall and hit my head or have an aneurism or something, and if that happened, no one would find me until the next morning.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
What I’m proud of are my next two thoughts. The first was that if I was found dead the next morning, that would be a great excuse for the production being late, and it would help the case. The second was that I was going to be a damn legend posthumously. It’s easy to talk a good game, but then you live in constant uncertainty, wondering whether you’ll live up to it when put to the test. When you do, it’s an enormous relief.

Tracing The Problem

For most of my life, I assumed everyone — especially litigators — thought like this. It wasn’t until I was in my mid-30s that I realized that some people didn’t think like this, and weren’t ready, like [Harry on St. Crispin’s Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-yZNMWFqvM&feature=youtu.be), to go out in noble glory if the professional circumstances required it.

Maybe it was the people I hung out with in college. I remember when my college friends and I read about the Japanese concept of [karoshi ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karoshi)— death by overwork — how impressed we were at how seriously the Japanese people took their jobs and how great it was that they celebrated those who truly took it past the limit. It wasn’t until much latter that I realized that it was generally considered a bad thing and not, in fact, gloriously celebrated. I was disappointed.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In college, we also used to read and talk about Dennis Block, the legendary then-Weil Gotshal partner who was rumored to throw staplers at associates. This seemed totally normal to us, and we’d sit around and talk about how great it would be to work for someone who was so passionate and debate whether it was acceptable to dodge. We finally decided that if he didn’t say anything you should dodge (as it showed off your reflexes), but if he said “Don’t move” before the throw, then obviously you stood and took it.

Another time, when I was working, I got a decently ugly head injury during lunch after I tripped while trying to get out of the way of a tourist taking a photograph. Shirt drenched in blood, I spent half an hour in a hotel bathroom trying to stop the bleeding with a paper towel while people kept coming in asking me if I was okay — the usual. Once I stopped bleeding, I went into the office without even thinking; obviously, you go back to the office. It showed a proper work ethic and would be important to clients: they obviously wanted the type of firm where associates show up at the office drenched in their own blood. Who wouldn’t? And we shared a building with Debevoise, so there were real stakes in play if the right client saw me in the lobby and started asking questions.

So maybe the lesson is that lightweight rowers have atypical life experiences — although no one can ever take away from me my personal best of losing 10 pounds in 12 hours — or maybe I watched too many Aaron Sorkin shows in my youth. But it seems most people don’t think like this.

The Problem: Clients Deserve Better

Why is this a problem? Because clients deserve better. They trust us to be dedicated to their cases and to getting the best result. [Pigs, not chickens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicken_and_the_Pig), and so forth. I’m reasonably certain that if you ask most clients dealing in high-stakes litigation whether they’d expect their litigator to, if push came to shove, take a bullet for them, and they had to answer truthfully, the answer would be yes. And to be fair to them, most high-stakes litigations are dealing with amounts exceeding the actuarial [value of a human life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_life#United_States).

In perspective, this isn’t an unusual ask. Military personnel, police, and firefighters put their lives routinely at risk, and make much less than commercial litigators. And to that, now we can add medical personnel in the current climate. It’s almost insulting for us to act like we deserve some special treatment.

Character Is What You Do Under Pressure

Yet many litigators seem to think they deserve special treatment, and value their own safety over winning for their clients. I’ve lost track of how many blast emails I’ve seen from law firms — not to mention other service providers — assuring clients that the safety of their staff is their highest priority. But if I’m a litigation client, this is stunningly tone-deaf: I just care about winning my case.

Some litigators may think that their clients don’t think like this — but they don’t understand human nature. Sure, most litigation clients won’t admit it, and maybe many won’t even admit it to themselves. But they’re thinking it. In their heart of hearts, they are rightfully judging you for your lack of dedication.

But It’s Never Too Late To Change

But if there was any time to turn over a new leaf, you won’t get too many chances better than this. Wherever you’re off socially distancing yourself, this is your big opportunity to take the change in routine to become better, faster, stronger, and less afraid. Don’t let it pass you by.

UPDATE (6/11/16): A clarification about associates in overseas offices.

They may have taken a little longer to make the decision to move to the [MoneyLaw scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/what-firms-miss-the-moneylaw-cut/) than some associates may have preferred, but they sure know how to make a splash. We’d heard earlier in the week that Shearman & Sterling was planning on making the announcement of the associate raises at a firm-sponsored party — complete with champagne and tequila.

Turns out that wasn’t quite right, but there’s still a party of sorts going on:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Shearman just matched. With drinks rolled out on my floor.

So maybe it’s a roving party in the halls. Hey, it’s better than nothing. Shearman has now proudly joined compensation market leaders. The scale matches the now standard Cravath scale for all classes and offices in the U.S. (UPDATE: Many overseas lawyers have complained that their firms lack clarity in how they fit into the raise — not Shearman, who is giving the raise to folks on the U.S. track even if they are serving overseas) effective July 1. Summer associates are also getting a raise.



There’s lots of variety in how firms have handled the raise announcements — we’ve have voicemails, perfunctory emails, and flowery words. But this is the first party we’ve heard of. Well played, Shearman, and have a shot for me.

It’s March Madness time! Instead of forcing our readers to pretend to know the difference between the Southern and Southland conferences or the MAC and MEAC conferences, we are going to focus on the two things we know best: Biglaw and scandals.

For this year’s March Madness, we’ve set up a bracket of Biglaw attorneys who have gotten in some pretty big trouble. Many of them have served (or are serving) time in jail for their deeds, others are awaiting trial, and others many have gotten away with only a mea culpa to a state bar association — but they all know what it is like to suddenly find their legal careers in jeopardy.

Today we are revealing (and opening up the voting for) the first two regions in our Lawyers Behaving Badly Bracket. Check us out later in the week for the full bracket.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  


In the first half of the Al Capone, or learn how to do your taxes, region, we have #1 seed Keila Ravelo, accused of embezzling $7.8 million from her former firms and not paying proper taxes on it, against a #4 seed that served three months for his crime.

# 1 Seed Name: Keila Ravelo
(Former) Firms: Willkie Farr and Hunton & Williams
Legal Speciality: Antitrust Partner
Misdeeds: Ravelo, along with her husband, was initially indicted on charges of wire fraud and embezzlement for allegedly creating dummy corporations to funnel “legal consulting fees” (for work never done) from both of her former firms. The indictment was later updated to include charges of tax evasion and using fake billings to funnel the allegedly fraudulently obtained $7.8 million in litigation support fees. She is scheduled to go to trial later this year.
[Why you should vote for her](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/partner-allegedly-steals-millions-from-biglaw-firms-to-lead-luxurious-lifestyle/): “It’s too bad that what allegedly made Ravelo ‘happy and fulfilled’ was embezzling money from her firm.”

# 4 Seed Name: Jeff Galloway
(Former) Firm: Hughes Hubbard
Legal Speciality: Intellectual Property and Products Liability Partner
Misdeeds: Pleaded guilty to one felony count of criminal tax fraud. According to the terms of the deal, he had to pay $600,000 in taxes, resign from the bar, and serve three months in jail.
[Why you should vote for him:](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/former-biglaw-partner-to-plead-guilty-to-criminal-tax-law-violations/) “He’s one smart cookie, with degrees from M.I.T. (bachelor’s in engineering), Stanford (master’s in engineering), and Columbia (law).
Smart enough to follow the tax laws? Apparently not. But in fairness to Galloway, he’s not the first Biglaw partner to run into trouble on this front.”

Who should advance to the Elite Eight?

- # 1 Seed Keila Ravelo (92%, 546 Votes)
- # 4 Seed Jeff Galloway (8%, 49 Votes)
Total Voters: 595

In the other half of the Al Capone region, the 2 versus 3 seeds pit two former Biglaw partners who were both sentenced to time in prison for not knowing how to fill out their taxes.

# 2 Seed Name: John O’Brien
(Former) Firm: Sullivan & Cromwell
Legal Speciality: Corporate Partner
Misdeeds: Sentenced to over two years in prison for failure to file taxes relating to $9.2 million in partnership income.
[Why should you vote for him: ](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/08/ex-sullivan-cromwell-partner-accused-of-failing-to-pay-taxes-on-millions-in-income/)“First, and most obviously, one would expect a corporate partner at a top-tier firm to know a lot about — and follow — the law. Second, Biglaw partners usually receive a great deal of assistance in preparing their tax returns from the administrative / accounting staff at their firms (especially since they must file in all jurisdictions where the partnership does business).”


Ted Freedman

# 3 Seed Name: Ted Freedman
(Former) Firm: Kirkland & Ellis
Legal Speciality: Bankruptcy and Restructuring Partner
Misdeeds: Sentenced to one year in prison for failing to report $2.4 million in income.
[Why you should vote for him](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/07/mystery-departure-solved-ted-freedman-ex-kirkland-partner-hit-with-federal-criminal-tax-charges/): “Partners at K&E — at least equity or ‘share’ partners, as opposed to ‘non-share’ partners — earn buckets of cash. Would one of them really risk criminal liability in order to save an extra million?”

Who should advance to the Elite Eight?

It’s the most wonderful time of the year (all things considered). Thanks to a [bonanza of bonus news](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/biglaw-bonus-chart-2020/), the holiday season is off to a great start. Cravath was very merry this year, stuffing associates’ stockings with [good cheer and wads of cash](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/cravath-bonuses/). Thanks to the pandemic, law firm holiday parties will likely be pushed onto Zoom, but the virtual celebrations and hefty paychecks pale in comparison to what’s about to get underway: Above the Law’s twelfth annual holiday card contest. We’ve already received several emails asking about when this year’s contest would start. The answer: It starts today.

We are a legal website, so of course there are some rules to follow:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
1. Because we are committed to the environment here at [Breaking Media](http://breakingmedia.com/), we will consider ONLY E-CARDS. Please don’t send us paper holiday cards via snail mail this year — the Above the Law editorial team hasn’t been in our physical office since March 2020.

2. To submit an e-card, please email either a link to the card or the card itself (as an attachment) — but note that WE PREFER LINKS, if available — to [tips@abovethelaw.com](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Holiday%20Card%20Contest), subject line: “Holiday Card Contest.” The subject line is very important because it’s how we will comb through our inbox to collect the entries when picking finalists. If you don’t use the correct subject line, expect a lump of coal in your stocking.

3. Please limit submissions to holiday / Christmas cards that you view as WORTHY CONTENDERS. We’re looking for cards that are unusually clever, funny, or cool; we’re not interested in cards that are safe or boring (e.g., a beautiful winter landscape, a “Happy Holidays 2020,” and the law firm name). We’re seeking cards with some attitude, with that extra je ne sais quoi. If you send us a banal card, don’t be surprised if we [make fun of it](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/01/atl-holiday-card-contest-honorable-and-dishonorable-mentions/).

4.

More than ever, legal departments are under intense resource and budget pressures — all driving the need to improve internal efficiencies.

These challenges are exacerbated by escalating data volumes, emerging forms of communication like chat, heightened regulatory mandates and a whistleblower culture.

In this position paper, our friends at OpenText explore these types of pressures — and how eDiscovery solutions have evolved to help you fulfill the efficiency imperative. 

The paper highlights the following: 

- Architectural foundations of efficient eDiscovery
- New and emerging eDiscovery requirements
- Enabling efficient eDiscovery – the EDRM perspective

‘We love our firms!’

The summer of 2023 was pretty exciting for summer associates — after all, summer programs now seem to be back in full swing in the wake of the pandemic. From taking extravagant trips to London to attending the NBA draft to seeing Drake concerts and Taylor Swift concerts, this year’s summer associate experience did not disappoint.

But what matters most to summer associates, and which firms did they like best?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Unfortunately, in addition to their exciting outings, this year’s crop of summers saw the less-than luxurious side of Biglaw too, complete with layoffs of all varieties and return-to-office mandates galore. It’s no wonder that summer associates were concerned about their job prospects and mental health. Here are some of the details from the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/09/25/the-2023-summer-associates-satisfaction-ranking/):

[S]ince last summer, layoffs have rolled through Big Law at a pace not seen since the Great Recession, so it’s no surprise that this year’s associates now care more about job security than they do work-life balance or the strength of their preferred practice area. Gen Z is also more skeptical of law firms’ efforts around mental health; fewer of this year’s summers felt their firms genuinely cared about their mental well-being. And as firms call associates back to the office four days per week—a precursor to a return to full attendance, depending on who you ask—four out of five summer associates prefer hybrid work over complete in-office policies.

Before we get to the rankings, let’s discuss the methodology used by American Lawyer. Firms were ranked by their average scores based on the following categories: partner access and mentorship, interactions with other associates, interesting legal work, firms’ alignment with their own stated goals and self-image, and whether summers were concerned with their mental health or well-being as an attorney.

Without further ado, here are the Top 10 firms:

# Profits Per Partner At Top-Ranked Law Firms That Have Not Raised Salaries For Associates
## Why haven't these firms raised salaries?

Day after day, additional law firms continue to fall in line and raise associate base salaries to match the new $180K scale, a trend that was started three weeks ago by Cravath Swaine & Moore on June 6, 2016. Day after day, we continue to receive [complaints from associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/angry-associates-ask-wheres-my-money/) at firms that have either refused to budge on compensation or remained silent, perhaps hoping that their associates haven’t learned that they’re still receiving salaries that are woefully below the market scale.

Today, we will show you exactly which firms have failed to make a move with regard to base salaries for associates. This new listing includes each firm’s [most recent Am Law ranking](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/), [most recent Vault ranking](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/move-over-wachtell-theres-a-new-firm-at-the-top-vault-top-100-firms-2017/?rf=1), and most recently reported profits per partner. After almost a month of other firms’ partners spreading the wealth among their associates, if you see that your firm is listed here, then perhaps it’s time to consider a lateral move.

# Perkins Coie Partner Indicted Because He Forgot To Bill To 'Professional Reading'
## Inconsequential billing code issue turned into smoking gun.

[Now-former](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/09/16/michael-sussman-resigns-from-perkins-coie-amid-federal-indictment/) Perkins Coie partner Michael Sussmann was [indicted](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2021/09/Sussmann-Indictment.pdf) yesterday, becoming the sole casualty (so far!) of Special Counsel John Durham’s much-ballyhooed witch hunt to get to the bottom of who tipped off the federal government about all that shadiness involving Trump and Russia. If it seems weird to launch a criminal investigation into the people who uncovered criminal activity, you have to remember that the Mueller Report [exoneratedTM](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/five-important-takeaways-from-the-mueller-report-dumb-people-keep-screwing-up/) Donald Trump when it concluded that he obstructed justice but that it was beyond the power of the Special Counsel to bring charges against a president. An inverse, “no foul, no harm” thing.

Trump pinned a lot of his hopes on Durham rolling in with an indictment to “lock her up” in the waning days of the campaign and grew [increasingly outraged](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-voting-fraud-and-irregularities-elections-archive-a5d340d781afa64288ffaaf5ea9abebb) that his bumbling Javert couldn’t find a whiff of significant illegality. But now they’ve finally found their culprit! A lawyer who maybe, kind of, might have worked with the Clinton campaign told the FBI about a cybersecurity issue and didn’t say he was doing so on behalf of the campaign.

Oh.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Yes, the charge of lying to the FBI’s general counsel is predicated upon a Perkins Coie attorney — the firm that everyone in the world knew to be the Clinton campaign firm — handing over evidence without clarifying that his firm worked with the campaign. From the rest of the allegations, it appears that Sussmann was not in fact representing the Clinton campaign when he took this information to the FBI, but rather “Tech Executive-1,” who brought the information to Sussmann’s attention. Sussmann ultimately informed the campaign of the information, but seems to at all times be either representing this executive or just generally acting as an officer of the court reporting a credible tip of potential criminality to the FBI.

How do prosecutors jump from there to tagging Sussmann as an agent of the campaign? Here’s where the billing diaries matter:

For example, on or about July 29, 2016, SUSSMANN and Campaign Lawyer-I met with personnel from the U.S. Investigative Firm in Campaign Lawyer-I’s office. SUSSMANN billed his time in this meeting to the Clinton Campaign under the category “General Political Advice” with the billing description “meeting with [Campaign Lawyer-II, others regarding [ ] confidential project.” (For all of SUSSMANN’s other billing entries cited herein that he billed to the Clinton Campaign, he similarly billed his time to the campaign under the category “General Political Advice”).

There’s the smoking gun! Or slightly singed popgun anyway.

Maybe this was really work for the campaign, but reading this cold, my takeaway is that Sussmann couldn’t figure out where to put his time for this, felt guilty about the idea of billing anyone for general do-goodery, and parked it on the campaign because — and this is a critical fact here — the campaign was [on a flat retainer](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/15/us/politics/durham-michael-sussmann-trump-russia.html) so time billed to that client was meaningless. So now, Sussmann’s whole indictment may hinge on him tagging this work under the campaign billing number instead of billing the tech executive or — probably more accurately — parking it as “personal work” or some other non-billable code because it seems from this account that his meetings with campaign officials about non-campaign business don’t really belong in that account.

Because if you think the campaign’s stance was “we order you to take that to the FBI, but don’t tell them we said so” as opposed to, “that appears to be a serious allegation and you should bring it to the proper authorities if you have reason to believe it’s credible,” then you’ve never ever spoken with a lawyer ever. It was almost certainly the latter scenario and under that scenario he would be absolutely correct to say he wasn’t turning information over on behalf of any specific client.

Regardless, assuming arguendo that Sussmann was on marching orders from the campaign when he took this tip to the FBI, Lady Godiva wore more materiality than this indictment.

In the days following SUSSMANN’s meeting with the FBI General Counsel, and as a result of that meeting, the FBI opened an investigation of the Russian Bank-I allegations. SUSSMANN’s false statement to the FBI General Counsel was material to that investigation because, among other reasons, it was relevant to the FBI whether the conveyor of these allegations (SUSSMANN) was providing them as an ordinary citizen merely passing along information, or whether he was instead doing so as a paid advocate for clients with a political or business agenda. Had SUSSMANN truthfully disclosed that he was representing specific clients, it might have prompted the FBI General Counsel to ask SUSSMANN for the identity of such clients, which, in turn, might have prompted further questions. In addition, absent SUSSMANN’s false statement, the FBI might have taken additional or more incremental steps before opening and/or closing an investigation. The FBI also might have allocated its resources differently, or more efficiently, and uncovered more complete information about the reliability and provenance of the purported data at issue.

I’m offended on behalf of the FBI. The indictment’s stance is that the FBI are Keystone Kops unable to piece together basic information that, again, they were handed by a lawyer that they knew worked for the campaign’s outside counsel. Grand juries will indict a ham sandwich, but this one stretches even that maxim. When materiality allegations hinge on repeated use of the phrase “might have” it doesn’t inspire confidence in the prosecution’s chances.

And that’s before we get to the point, [raised by our colleague Liz Dye](https://www.wonkette.com/special-counsel-john-durham-blows-his-measly-load-trying-to-make-serverghazi-happen-again), that congressional inquiry into this issue has already gotten the FBI general counsel on record verifying that, even if this statement was false, it had no material bearing on the investigation:

DEM HOUSE LAWYER: So regardless of not being the most typical route for evidence besides the FBI, when the evidence is provided to you, does the FBI have a process to evaluate the credibility of the evidence, to vet it as it would any other piece of evidence coming to the FBI?

BAKER: Yes.

DEM HOUSE LAWYER: Okay. So whatever evidence was provided to you would have been evaluated by the same individuals the FBI as through whatever typical challenges the FBI gets its evidence?

BAKER: Yes. Yes.

Oof.

I guess Trump is going to have to return his faith to [Mike Lindell and his magic attorneys general](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/pillow-dude-seeks-state-attorney-general-for-hot-scotus-action/) because John Durham is a flop.

# Biglaw Leader Gives Lawyers The Day Off To 'Reflect' On Dobbs Decision
## It's nice to see Biglaw firms taking care of their own on such a distressing day.

The Supreme Court has issued its Dobbs opinion. For anyone who wants it, please take the day off. And take care.

— Steptoe & Johnson chair [Gwen Renigar](https://www.steptoe.com/en/lawyers/gwendolyn-renigar.html), in a statement given in a firmwide email following the release of the Dobbs decision, which overturned the constitutional right to abortion. When contacted for comment by the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2022/06/24/as-scotus-overturns-roe-steptoe-gives-lawyers-and-business-professionals-day-off-to-reflect/), Renigar added, “Whatever your political views, people are going to have strong emotions today, and they should be given the time to reflect.” Lawyers and business professionals at the firm may take today off. Many Biglaw firms are stepping in to provide comfort to their employees in the wake of the Dobbs decision. Earlier today, Ropes & Gray chair Julie Jones offered a [heartfelt message of support](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/now-that-abortion-rights-have-been-decimated-biglaw-leader-offers-heartfelt-message-of-support-for-lawyers/) to the firm’s attorneys.

# Texas: Your Next Frontier!
## Law firms, particularly in Houston and Dallas, are very interested in relocating well-credentialed lawyers here.

Prior to joining Lateral Link, Larry was an Executive Senior Partner with a national recruiting firm. He practiced as an attorney at Jenkens & Gilchrist and also spent time in global accounting firms in the U.S. and internationally, including Hong Kong and Vietnam.

Outside of work, Larry enjoys fitness and music. He is an avid guitarist who regularly performs at blues jams around Houston. Please contact Larry at lscott@laterallink.com.

The Texas market continues to be a great place for lawyers. If office openings are any indication, Texas is booming!  Since 2013, approximately 40 Am Law 200 firms have opened offices here.  For lawyers unfamiliar with the Lone Star State, Texas is referred to as “The Friendly State” — a well-deserved designation.  Law firms, particularly in Houston and Dallas, are very interested in relocating well-credentialed lawyers here.

Overview of the Texas Legal Market

As law firms continue to proliferate across the globe, there are fewer and fewer opportunities for firm expansion. Clients drive office openings as regional demands pressure firms to expand into new markets. It was not that long ago that Texas was considered more of a niche home for firms specializing in energy, albeit a large one. However, now Texas is drawing firms pushing to expand not just their energy offerings, but their litigation and high-tech IP practices as well.

What does this mean for you? Texas has become a top destination for attorneys with its low-cost of living and competitive salaries compared to New York and other major markets. Associates at large firms can expect to earn the same or very close to New York standards (especially when you factor in that Texas doesn’t impose any individual income tax). You’ll find your salary likely goes much further in Texas than it would in New York.

Texas has three primary legal markets, Houston, Dallas, and Austin.  Austin is a much smaller market compared to the market leaders, Houston and Dallas.  Houston and Dallas offices have become so significant that some of the Am Law 20 firms are reporting that the Texas offices have become the most profitable in the entire firms.

A question that frequently comes up in Texas is whether firms will seriously consider someone with limited ties to the area.  The short answer is a “yes!”  In the past, it might have seemed strange for people to move to Texas if they didn’t already have connections with the state.  However, now it’s completely normal, particularly in Houston and Dallas.  Most large firms are fine if people are upfront about coming to Texas for the opportunity.  They would much prefer to hear that than a manufactured reason. There are exceptions. For example, Austin can still be a difficult market to break into without strong ties to the area.  The remainder of this article will focus on the two larger markets, Houston and Dallas.

Houston

Houston is the fourth most populous city in the United States. Its economy is still very focused on the energy industry (particularly oil); however, health care, biomedical research, and aerospace also constitute large areas of the city’s economy.  Just over half of the Am Law 100 have offices in Houston. Texas firms such as Vinson & Elkins and Baker Botts have the largest offices.  However, new market entrants such as Kirkland & Ellis have grown rapidly and are doing some of the largest energy transactions in the city.  Of all the Texas markets, Houston is the most international.  For those without Texas ties, Houston is the easiest city to break into.

The energy industry drives a significant portion of the legal work in Houston, both in corporate and litigation.  In addition, firms represent a diverse range of industries in technology, healthcare, banking, and real estate.  Corporate, energy transactions, and commercial litigation are currently busy practice areas in Houston.  While bankruptcy groups are busy, this has not yet translated into actual hiring here.  Although IP litigation has slowed down, patent prosecution is showing demand.

Dallas

Dallas is the ninth most populous city in the United States.  Dallas’s major industries include financial services and banking, defense information technology, life sciences, semiconductors, and telecommunications.  There is also significant energy and energy-related work in Dallas, however the market is not nearly as energy-centric as Houston and is much more diversified.  You will find some of the larger banking and finance practices here in Dallas.

Compared to Houston, the largest offices in Dallas are predominantly Texas firms.  The number of firms on the “Cravath” scale in Dallas is currently smaller than in Houston.  However, that number is rising as national firms continue to open offices in Dallas.  Busy practices in Dallas are corporate/M&A, finance, and healthcare.  Although IP litigation has slowed down, patent prosecution is showing demand.

Why Texas?

In summary, the Texas market is a great destination for lawyers.  The firms are very open to relocation candidates and the majority of Am Law 100 firms have offices here.  When you factor in the competitive salaries, relatively cheap cost of living, and friendly tax laws, Texas makes a compelling case as the destination for your next legal opportunity.

# Firm Promises New Focus On Mental Health... Then Demands Young Attorneys 'Provide Evidence' They Can't Work All Night
## This is dumb.

Whenever a firm recognizes the dangers of mental illness and the corrosive effect that stressful, occasionally belligerent working conditions can have on people, it’s a positive sign. When one unnamed London firm (UPDATE: To be clear, this means a “London office” — it’s clearly a “global Biglaw firm” and we’re talking about its London office) made a public show of its commitment to employee well-being on World Mental Health Day — October 10 — it earned the goodwill of its attorneys and the greater legal community alike.

Which made it all the funnier when they blew all that goodwill to hell a mere two days later by sending around a bullying email demanding trainee attorneys cancel their frivolous weekend plans and work around the clock over the weekend.

Legal Cheek has copies of a [pair of disturbingly tone deaf emails](https://www.legalcheek.com/2018/10/exclusive-city-law-firm-asks-trainees-to-pull-all-nighter-just-days-after-publicly-promising-to-support-its-lawyers-mental-health/) sent around last Friday at 4:43 p.m.

Sometimes work just needs to get done. My first day as a summer associate was relatively uneventful until 5:30 p.m. when I got staffed on an emergency TRO and worked until 4:30 a.m. But due diligence is not a TRO. Where’s the tone of contrition from the partners who have clearly botched this whole process to find themselves realizing for the first time at close of business on Friday that they have tons of documents to review? An email begging for help with a bit of mea culpa for good measure might engender more support from the rank-and-file being asked to sacrifice because they had the foresight to plan their work week more efficiently.

The partner chose… another route. A mere 20 minutes later…

“[P]lease be prepared to provide evidence to me of your inability to help….” What a way to manage a professional organization! Apparently, the trainees who did stick around to help worked until 4:30 a.m. before coming back at 8 to finish up. Yeesh.

In fairness to the firm, Legal Cheek reports that it was already investigating this follow-up email before it was leaked and has spoken to the partner in question. That’s a good start, and what appears to have prompted Legal Cheek to protect the firm from the sins of one of its members. And that’s all a firm can really do after the fact. But ultimately, what firms need is a fundamental mindset shift among the partnership — a realization that their demands for instant gratification can’t be a replacement for proper project management and a commitment to earning buy-in from colleagues. The law’s embraced tinpot dictatorships for decades. It’s time to break that cycle for the good of the profession as a whole.

# The Am Law 200: Biglaw's Second Hundred Blows The Competition Out Of The Water
## Things continue to look up for the firms in the Second Hundred.

The past year or so has been full of powerful storms and rough seas for much of Biglaw, but when it comes to the Am Law’s Second Hundred, 2022 was clear skies with smooth sailing.

The American Lawyer recently released its Am Law 200 law firm rankings — a closely watched list of the smaller yet still elite law firms that represent the very best of what the legal profession has to offer. The highlights from the report reveal that in 2022, Biglaw’s Second Hundred had much to celebrate, with overall revenue growth (4.1%) that bested that of the Am Law 100 (2.7%). In fact, the Second Hundred beat out their higher ranked competitors in almost every financial metric that there is, including revenue per lawyer and profits per equity partner.

While some firms came out on top, others completely exceeded expectations. How did the Am Law 200 stack up?

Here’s an overview of how Biglaw’s Second Hundred performed in 2022:

- Gross revenue: $131 billion, up by 4.1%
- Average revenue per lawyer: $$763,541, up by 1.5%
- Average profits per equity partner: $959,108, down by 1.2%
How did we get here? Scale, resources, and expense management all matter, especially when there’s an economic downturn. From [Am Law](https://www.law.com/2023/05/23/smaller-but-mightier-the-2023-am-law-200-outperforms-larger-firms/):

While in boom times [client experience] may not make much of a difference, but when clients are being more selective of who they are doing business with (and what they are paying) during less productive economic times, it matters.

Marcie Borgal Shunk, founder of The Tilt Institute, says that the Second Hundred firms seemed like they did a better job of managing expenses and hiring than some larger firms did last year, and that also contributed to the smaller firms’ relative success.

“There were minimal losses in profits per partner,” she says of the Second Hundred firms. “They did a good job of protecting their profits. They were measured in their hiring and compensation decisions, more so than the Am Law 100. They were also more thoughtful about associate salary increases, as it wasn’t so much of a blanket mandate for them like it was for the largest firms.”

Now, the moment you’ve been waiting for: the top 10 firms in the gross revenue rankings, and the top five firms for the RPL and PPP rankings.

Gross Revenue

The top 10 firms by gross revenue appear below, with the Second Hundred led by firms that slipped out of the Am Law 100. The full Am Law 200 gross revenue chart can be found [here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/05/23/the-2023-am-law-200-ranked-by-gross-revenue/).

101. Steptoe: $434,601,000
102. Kramer Levin: $421,443,000
103. Cahill: $415,200,000
104. Baker Donelson: $412,760,000
105. Loeb & Loeb: $411,650,000
106. Jackson Walker: $402,298,000
107. Wilson Elser: $395,500,000
108. Bradley Arant: $392,220,000
109. Manatt: $382,100,000
110: Susman Godfrey: $370,000,000

Revenue Per Lawyer

See the alphabetized Am Law 200 revenue per lawyer chart [here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/05/23/the-2023-am-law-200-at-a-glance/).

- Irell: $2,303,000
- Susman Godfrey: $1,947,000
- Munger Tolles: $1,728,000
- Patterson Belknap: $1,472,000
- Manatt: $1,409,000
Profits Per Equity Partner

See the alphabetized Am Law 200 profits per equity partner chart [here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/05/23/the-2023-am-law-200-at-a-glance/).

- Cole Scott: $4,314,000
- Cahill: $4,036,000
- Irell: $3,785,000
- Choate Hall: $3,328,000
- Susman Godfrey: $3,236,000
We will undoubtedly have even more to say as we continue to dig into these numbers. But what’s clear is that the Second Hundred know what works — and what doesn’t — and that their luck hasn’t run out yet. Congratulations on all of your success!

# The Biglaw Files: How Power And Privilege Harm The Legal Profession
## This has shown us how Biglaw operates when push comes to shove with the billable hour and revenue.

This past weekend, I was plagued by two different jarring stories of Biglaw lawyers that hit social media: the [abuse and unyielding rage of Allan Kassenoff from Greenberg Traurig](https://westchester.news12.com/estranged-husband-of-deceased-westchester-family-court-activist-on-leave-amid-probe-of-suicide-note-allegations) that led to the planned suicide of his wife Catherine Kassenoff, and the vitriolic [antisemitic, racist, and misogynistic language spewed by Jeff Ranen and John Barber of Barber Ranen](http://forward.com/fast-forward/549265/barber-ranen-lewis-brisbois-bisgaard-and-smith-antisemitism/) (formed by 140-plus lawyers who departed from Lewis Brisbois at the beginning of May 2023). Both of these incidents are full of emails documenting the widespread abuse of power and privilege within the Biglaw world.

As I’ve previously written in my ATL column, these are the [toxic behaviors that push women out of law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/why-toxic-culture-is-to-blame-for-women-leaving-law-firms/) and hurt our profession as a whole. It’s this type of despicable behavior that perpetuates negativity in our profession and continues to corrupt it. Yet, it’s a sordid reality of how male Biglaw lawyers wield their power in and out of the courtroom — and how law firms often sweep it under the rug because it’s just regular business for them — after all, if the Biglaw machine is making money, who cares, right? Imagine working for a firm for a decade and learning that the white, male partners [refer to women and other POC with demeaning, condescending, and wholly inappropriate language.](https://nypost.com/2023/06/03/woke-la-firm-routinely-used-vile-language-to-refer-to-women-poc/) I’ll let you click on the link to see the examples for yourself.

I worked for various abusive male lawyers throughout my law firm days. I’d often ask myself: if this is how they talk to me, can you imagine how they speak to their wives, daughters, and mothers? Allan Kassenoff is a prime example of this — in various [TikTok videos from Robbie Harvey, a journalist,](https://www.tiktok.com/@therobbieharvey/video/7239750147268267306) which garnered more than 20 million views, he explains and documents the abuse and rage of Kassenoff calling his wife Catherine, a decorated and accomplished woman lawyer and mother to his three daughters, a “fat loser,” among other derogatory terms.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Yet, the PR stunts played by these firms should not go unnoticed. Catherine Kassenoff made her [public plea on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/1758801180/posts/pfbid0sGJsXviz42A7MaFKB3mUL8fPjHwogBTjut6NdxXf7D5WoTcc4Rci6BgKgdjxg9Dgl/?mibextid=cr9u03) before undergoing doctor-assisted suicide in Europe, shedding light on the magnitude of her life of hell with Allen Kassenoff. But like any good lawyer, she diligently attached a large file of documents and videos which noted the abuse and corruption in the case.

Greenberg Traurig has since put up a statement on its Facebook page defending its beloved firm partner. What we have yet to see are the comments from various legal assistants, law firm associates, and other women in Allan’s work life who may have been privy to the pervasive patterns of verbal and emotional abuse that may have just been swept under the rug since he’s a rainmaker for the firm. For such a brazen and bold figure, he’s certainly now hidden — removing his LinkedIn profile and causing GT to shut off all comments on its social media channels.

For Ranen and Barber, their abhorrent antisemitic, racist, and misogynistic behaviors have now come to light, but a little too late — as the documented emails occurred while they were employed by Lewis Brisbois. Thus, it appears to be more of a “gotcha” way to preclude their new firm from flourishing — perhaps from an insider at Lewis Brisbois who may be firing back after Ranen and Barber took away clients and lawyers from them. Yet, what’s even more despicable is that Lewis Brisbois allowed this behavior to permeate for more than a decade, with the [New York Post reporting emails that go as far back as June 2012](https://nypost.com/2023/06/03/woke-la-firm-routinely-used-vile-language-to-refer-to-women-poc/). Where were the internal controls since law firms monitor emails and have various firewalls and language filters? Did they only go up after they exited the firm and took the 100-plus lawyers with them for their spinoff? Where was HR in all of this?

Here’s the reality: emails are forever, as is the internet. Certainly, Kassenoff, Ranen, and Barber have shown us how Biglaw operates when push comes to shove with the billable hour and revenue. Yet, in the spirit of irony and hypocrisy, it makes complete sense that Ranen (as his LinkedIn profile denotes) was the editor of Boston College Law School’s Third World Law Journal, focusing on civil rights.

This year marks the twentieth anniversary of Boies Schiller Flexner, which was founded [in 1997](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boies,_Schiller_%26_Flexner). Over the past two decades, the litigation powerhouse has made a name for itself by handling — and winning — some of the biggest cases in the country.

This courtroom prowess has made Boies Schiller one of the most [prestigious](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/move-over-wachtell-theres-a-new-firm-at-the-top-vault-top-100-firms-2017/) and [profitable](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/2/) law firms in the world. And BSF partners share the wealth with their associates, in the form of generous bonuses that can go as high as [$350,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-boies-schiller-pays-up-to-350k-again/) in [some years](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/associate-bonus-watch-boies-schiller-pays-up-to-350k/).

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
What are the secrets to the firm’s success? In a wide-ranging [interview](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidparnell/2017/03/07/jonathan-schiller-boies-schiller-how-a-good-law-firm-should-be-managed/#3ff2288b2eca) with David Parnell of Forbes, co-founder and managing partner [Jonathan Schiller](https://www.bsfllp.com/lawyers/jonathan-d-schiller.html) revealed some of them, touching on such topics as risk management, talent acquisition, and the use of technology.

The whole interview is worth reading, but here are two portions, both relating to the future of the firm, that jumped out at me. First, on the importance from a rainmaking standpoint of David Boies, Jonathan Schiller, and Donald Flexner:

Parnell: Now, from a client intake standpoint, and perhaps even relationship ownership, I’m assuming the name partners are the ones who have most of the relationships, are indeed the rainmakers. Is that true? Are there other rainmakers in the firm that are bringing in large books of business? How diversified is that?

Schiller: Well, the answer is “yes” as to “other rainmakers,” and that has been the trend for the past ten years. There was a time when the managing partners were responsible for more than 60 percent of the business. We are well below that now – well, well below that, as reflected in a graph we prepare each year for the partnership that breaks down the business and everyone’s performance and contribution to that business. We track the origin and leadership of clients and those responsible for individual cases as part of our entrepreneurial incentives. We all know from the data how hard each of us is working year over year. We also document the growth of 40-50 partners who are building substantial client relationships, and perhaps most importantly, generating interesting, major cases and investigations, and diverse problems for our teams to solve.

Given the high profile of David Boies, Biglaw’s [most famous practicing lawyer](https://bol.bna.com/big-laws-most-famous-practicing-lawyer-is/), some have wondered whether BSF business development depends too heavily upon him, Schiller, and Flexner. But based on Schiller’s remarks, it sounds like the name partners are responsible for less than half of the firm’s business these days.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The next generation of partners, featuring young superstars like [Karen Dunn](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/02/boies-schiller-expands-in-d-c-by-hiring-young-legal-superstars/) and [Michael Gottlieb](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/michael-gottlieb/), is stepping up to the plate. And the firm continues to make new partners and hire top laterals — such as Travis LeBlanc, who recently [joined the firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/non-sequiturs-03-10-17/) after serving as chief of enforcement at the FCC.

The second comment that jumped out at me was made quite casually by Schiller:

Parnell: The firm is, obviously, very well-known from a litigation and arbitration standpoint. But you do have what appears to be a full-service offering – I know that you do some corporate work. Is there an interest in balancing the practice portfolio? Or is there an eye towards that as you move into the future?

Schiller: We haven’t really made an effort to grow that business, which is successful but small – it’s always been less than 10% of our budget. And I see us winding down that business line going forward.

Protip: don’t go to Boies Schiller to do corporate work.

I found this tidbit a little surprising — given my knowledge of the practice’s strong track record, plus the fact that it’s led by [Christopher Boies](https://www.bsfllp.com/lawyers/christopher-a-boies.html), son of David — but if it does eventually happen, it wouldn’t be a total shock. We are in a period of Biglaw retrenchment; firms are focusing on their cores, parting with [practices](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/ropes-gray-splitting-with-around-100-lawyers-and-staffers/) or [offices](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/project-rightsize-strikes-again-another-office-bites-the-dust/) that aren’t essential to who they are. Boies Schiller has a solid corporate practice, but at the end of the day, it’s most famous for litigation and arbitration.

Congratulations to Boies Schiller Flexner on its 20 years of success, and best of luck to the firm as it enters its third decade.

P.S. This kind of success comes with rich rewards. See, e.g., Jonathan Schiller’s $5 million [Lawyerly Lair](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/08/lawyerly-lairs-a-powerful-partners-5-million-mansion/), previously covered in these pages.

UPDATE (3/14/2017, 4:45 p.m.): That was fast! The BSF corporate practice — partners Robert Leung, Mike Huang, Stefan dePozsgay, Jason Hill, and Russell Franklin, plus several associates — is [joining Paul Hastings](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/boies-schillers-corporate-group-finds-a-new-home/). Christopher Boies is not moving with the group; he’s joining a Boies Schiller client.

# Even Jones Day Lawyers Are Giving Trump's Election Lawsuits Some Serious Side Eye
## The chances of the courts coming to save Trump's presidency are pretty slim, but there's still harm being done.

Jones Day (Photo by David Lat)

You know, we give Jones Day A LOT of shit around here. And, listen, there are tons of good reasons for that between being the [go-to law firm for the Trump administration](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/the-biglaw-firms-doing-trumps-election-bidding/) and their [opaque, black-box associate compensation system](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/), well, there’s a lot of fodder. But the truth is, behind the Biglaw firm are a lot of lawyers and plenty of them don’t [fuck with Trump’s politics ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/turns-out-lawyers-despise-trump-especially-his-own/)(though have historically been fine with making money off of defending them), and are pretty annoyed with the [compensation nonsense](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/jones-day-cant-even-raise-salaries-without-screwing-someone-over/). Now we have some Jones Day lawyers who are finally willing to speak up — well, anonymously.

In a [new article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/business/jones-day-trump-election-lawsuits.html) in the New York Times, they speak with nine senior attorneys — both partners and associates — at the firm who “are worried that [Jones Day] is advancing arguments that lack evidence and may be helping Mr. Trump and his allies undermine the integrity of American elections.” Well, no shit. Welcome to the party.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
We know that the series of lawsuits filed by the Trump campaign and his allies are on… [challenging legal grounds](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/trump-campaign-rubs-soothing-balm-of-pointless-lawsuits-on-presidents-bruised-ego/). And let’s be honest they’re designed to soothe egos and [grift money from right wing supporters](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/biden-victory-trump-lawsuit/) to cover campaign expenses. Though the chances of the courts coming to save Trump’s presidency are pretty slim, there’s [still harm being done](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/trump-is-not-attempting-a-2021-coup-but-republicans-are-working-on-one-for-the-next-decade/).

It’s the faith in American democracy that’s being eroded. And Jones Day’s involvement in the [specious Pennsylvania litigation](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/trump-campaign-charges-into-court-to-stop-vote-based-on-latest-internet-rumors/) (you remember, they had to segregate the ballots received after November 3rd, which they were already doing, and there aren’t even enough of those ballots to matter anyway) that finally seems to be giving some Jones Day lawyers pause:

Six Jones Day lawyers said that given the small number of late-arriving ballots involved in the litigation, and the fact that they already had been segregated, the main goal of the litigation seemed to be to erode public confidence in the election results.

Jones Day did not respond to a request for comment.

In recent days, two Jones Day lawyers said they had faced heckling from friends and others on social media about working at a firm that is supporting Mr. Trump’s efforts.

A lawyer in Jones Day’s Washington office felt that the firm risked hurting itself by taking on work that undermined the rule of law. “To me, it seems extremely shortsighted,” the lawyer said.

And you know, if you’re a law student or lateral candidate and you have a choice to go… anywhere else, it’s looking increasingly likely the best and brightest will exercise that option.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The Times also details “discomfort” at another Biglaw firm — the Am Law second hundred firm of Porter Wright — and their involvement in election lawsuits.

Chief among their concerns: How could lawyers, whose profession is based on the rule of law, represent someone who they felt had frequently tried to flout it? One lawyer said he was concerned that the firm might be asked to try to delay the election. Another said he quit in response to the decision to represent Mr. Trump in Pennsylvania.

At two meetings, associates at Porter Wright told the firm’s partners that they objected to the work for the Trump campaign, according to the three current and former employees. They were told that the assignment was limited to the election in Pennsylvania. That assurance struck some attendees as hollow, since the state might decide the election.

Robert J. Tannous, the firm’s managing partner, declined to comment in detail on the work for Mr. Trump. He said, “Porter Wright has a long history of representing candidates, political parties, interest groups and individuals at the local, state and federal levels on both sides of the aisle, and as a law firm will continue to do so.”

But as you know, thankfully a slew of other states besides Pennsylvania voted for Joe Biden, and the Trump litigation strategy would have to master the extremely unlikely feat of invalidating the election results in multiple states to change the results of the election.

At least it’s good to see that some attorneys prioritize the sanctity of elections over the value of billable hours.

# Are You -- And Your Law Firm -- Ready For Retirement?

For lawyers who have been grinding out [2,500 hours a year](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/will-millennials-make-the-2500-hour-year-the-new-normal/) for decade upon decade, retirement can seem like the Promised Land. But if you haven’t prepared for it properly, either as an [individual](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/empire-of-the-fund-an-interview-with-william-birdthistleor-4-tips-for-lawyers-on-saving-for-retirement/?rf=1) or as an [institution](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/reinventing-the-law-business-succession-planning-yuck/), retirement can pose some serious problems.

That’s the big takeaway from a comprehensive collection of articles on retirement and succession planning that went up earlier today over at the American Lawyer. The title of the special report — featuring pieces by reporters Julie Triedman, Katelyn Polantz, and MP McQueen, plus editor-in-chief Kim Kleman — summarizes things well: [Baby Boomers are Retiring and Law Firms Aren’t Ready](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202765982265/Baby-Boomers-are-Retiring-and-Law-Firms-Arent-Ready?cmp=share_twitter).

Here’s the core of the problem, outlined in Julie Triedman’s lead piece, [Retiring Boomers Pose Big Challenges for Firms](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202765209388/Retiring-Boomers-Pose-Big-Challenges-for-Firms?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL):

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The boomer generation—75 million Americans born between 1946 and 1964—and a tiny cadre of over-70s Silent Generation lawyers currently make up just under half of partners at Am Law 200 firms. As partners with the greatest seniority, they constitute a majority in the equity and management ranks, and control an outsize share of client relationships. The impacts of retirement are amplified because a long surge in hiring and promotion that began when boomers entered law firms has halted since the financial crisis….

The primary risk posed by all the retirements is the loss of substantial client relationships. That loss has been somewhat mitigated by the widespread elimination of mandatory retirement policies since 2007. But with the oldest boomers turning 70 this year, a full reckoning is finally here. Firms that aren’t focused intently on transitioning client relationships by now—particularly firms that emphasize originations and billings over collaboration—are at greatest risk.

It should come as no surprise that senior Biglaw partners, many of them control freaks, encounter difficulty in transferring power to the next generation. The trick, as outlined later in the article, is putting systems into place to essentially make this orderly transition happen.

Transitioning client relationships is the top challenge, but the upcoming retirement wave raises financial problems too:

Firms are also facing increased obligations or costs associated with retired partners. A minority with unfunded pension obligations like Milbank’s face increased costs as fewer current partners support successively more retired partners. Firms with tax-qualified defined benefit plans—61 percent of The Am Law 200, according to retirement plan analytics firm Judy Diamond Associates Inc., a sibling ALM company—carry the risk of topping-up costs if a retirement investment portfolio underperforms. And with partnership head count flat, most firms are returning more in capital to retiring partners than they’re taking in from new junior partners.

And boy [Dewey know](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/12/business/dewey-partners-and-retirees-face-huge-financial-losses.html?_r=0) how an underfunded pension can cause trouble for a law firm and its partners.

So what are law firms doing to prevent pension problems? Here are some strategies discussed in a second piece by Julie Triedman, [Pensions Pose an Increasing Threat for Some Firms](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202765211184/Pensions-Pose-an-Increasing-Threat-for-Some-Firms?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL):

- Scale back defined-benefit plans in favor of defined-contribution plans. This shifts financial risk away from the firm and toward individual partners (who are paid quite well as Biglaw partners and should be able to look after themselves). This is a strategy that firms like Haynes and Boone and Weil Gotshal have adopted.
- Reduce benefits, through measures like raising the age at which partners can retire with full benefits, lowering the cap on how much can be paid out of annual earnings to retirees, or tweaking the benefit formula. This approach has been taken by such leading firms as Cravath, Paul Weiss, and Milbank.
We’ve shared with you just a few highlights. Surf over to the Am Law [hub page](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202765982265/Baby-Boomers-are-Retiring-and-Law-Firms-Arent-Ready), where you can also access pieces on [succession planning](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202765210775), the British approach to retirement (retiring [by age 55](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202765211645) is common), common [money mistakes](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202765210853) made by lawyers, and [exit strategies](http://www.americanlawyer.com/current-issue/id=%201202765211267) for senior lawyers.

Retirement shares a lot in common with the life stages that often precede it, such as marriage and parenthood: it’s wonderful, but you have to prepare for it.

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Stat Of The Week: Corporate Counsel Incurious About Supposedly Important Topic

This week, [Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/) published its [Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report](http://about.bna.com/2016-diversity-survey) (sponsored by Paul Hastings). It’s hardly the report’s authors’ fault, but there’s not a lot of there there. The findings are the expected “it’s important and we’re terrible at” combo platter of virtue-signaling and inertia which could have been published any time in the last 25 years. Forget it, Jake, it’s Biglaw.

Even though they aren’t juxtaposed in the report, the symmetry between two of the stats cited together tell a story:

- Six out of 10 corporate attorneys with outside counsel feel the overall
diversity of their outside counsel is important.
- The majority of corporate attorneys with outside counsel do not know whether
or not their outside counsel has diversity and inclusion strategies in place (59
percent).

So, yay, a majority “cares.” But not enough to know or ask.

With [layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/layoffs/) and [deferrals](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/deferrals/) dotting the Biglaw landscape, many of America’s largest law firms are in a state of flux thanks to a turbulent economy. But at the same time, the biggest of Biglaw firms are still employing thousands and thousands of attorneys — and they’ve been quickly growing in size.

Which U.S. Biglaw firm is the biggest of them all? [Law360](https://www.law360.com/ip/articles/1690943) (sub. req.) can help us answer that question. Earlier this week, the website released its master list of the top 400 U.S.-based law firms by headcount, revealing that Kirkland maintained its stranglehold on the No. 1 spot, with over 300 more domestic attorneys than the firm in second place on the ranking.
