Bonus season — that time of year when Biglaw firms say thank you to hardworking associates in the best way they know how, with cold hard cash.

The latest firm to announce their own bonuses — of both the year-end and special variety — is Dechert. The firm made $1,071,163,000 in gross revenue last year, making it 37th on the Am Law 100, so they have plenty of money to show associates how much they care.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  


Associates are eligible for these bonuses if they make the 1,950 threshold for bonus hours. Additionally, associates who hit 2,200 billable hours will receive an extra 30 percent above the year-end bonuses; 2,400 hours will get folks an extra 40 percent. Not a bad extra thank you for those who billed their butts off this year.

The full memo is [available on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/dechert-bonuses-21/2/).

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

Though there have been rumblings of a recession – which we have yet to realize – we predict this trend will continue into the new decade if firm expansion and growth continues, providing more landing spots for incoming attorneys.

2) California Dreaming.


Firms extended their reach across the U.S., as the second wave of manifest destiny also…manifested itself. Gone are the days where a California office was seen as a luxury, a sentiment mirrored by 41 Am Law 200 firms that opened offices in Los Angeles in the last decade and another 27 and 25 firms opened office in San Francisco and Palo Alto, respectively. Texas saw firms pour in, especially towards the second half of the decade. We predict smaller markets will continue to burgeon as firms look to take advantage of the relative cost-savings compared to the expensive New York, Los Angeles and D.C. markets, and the propagation of sophisticated clients to what was previously thought of as tertiary markets continues as technology erases physical barriers.

3) Feed Me Seymour.


Lewis Brisbois rounded out the decade as the most popular lateral destination of any Am Law 200 firm, lateralling in 1,914 attorneys, or to put it in more topical terms, the same number of people who went to see Cats during its opening weekend. Their overall headcount grew a healthy 150%. Unsurprisingly, lateral movement correlated strongly with firm size, but some firms take a page from the Lakers and rely much more on lateral movement than entry level hiring.

4) Growth Is Good.


Polsinelli has “glowed up” over the last decade, increasing their headcount a whopping 2200%. In an increasingly competitive landscape, firms are bifurcating largely into two groups – the firms seeking high margin work with a lean staffing model, and a lower margin model that offsets smaller margins with higher volume. What we’ve seen over the last decade is the chasm between these two groups has risen and the middle ground that used to be well populated has become increasingly sparse. We predict as time goes on, this trend will only continue.

5)  PPP For Me.


PPP rose 33% over the course of the decade, and partner compensation rose in tandem. Associate salaries also rose to record highs, but these gains are offset by inflation and rising costs of living. Barring another recession, we predict this trend will continue into the next decade, though the pace of growth may slow.

6) To Everything, Merge, Merge, Merge.


Ten years ago, Sonneschein Nath Rosenthal and Denton Wilde Sapte combined into what would become SNR Denton, a healthy firm with a little over 1,000 attorneys. Ten years later, Dentons is a powerhouse with over 10,000 attorneys after consummating an additional 10 more mergers or acquisitions with firms with over 100 attorneys, the largest of which saw them bring on Dacheng’s 3,000+ attorneys in China. With offices spanning 78 countries, there may soon be a day where there are more countries that have a Denton’s office than those that don’t.

# Prominent Biglaw Attorney And Family Killed In Fiery Christmas Eve Blaze
## Their home had completely collapsed before firefighters arrived.

Geoffrey Taber, Jacqueline Gardner, and their sons (Photo via Osler Hoskin & Harcourt)

This week brings us incredibly sad news out of Canada. A leading technology lawyer from one of the country’s largest business law firms, along with his wife, a corporate lawyer who once worked at the same firm and later became general counsel of one of the country’s largest mutual fund companies, their two sons, and their dogs were all killed in a fire at their Ontario cottage on Christmas Eve.

[Geoffrey Taber](https://www.osler.com/en/team/geoffrey-taber) was the founder of the emerging companies group at Osler Hoskin & Harcourt, one of Bay Street’s [“Seven Sisters”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Sisters_(law_firms)) firms. His wife, Jacqueline Gardner, practiced corporate law at Osler before transitioning to an in-house role as general counsel of Altamira Investment Services. She later left the practice of law to care for her sons, Scott and Andrew. The entire family was killed when a fire destroyed their 4,000-square-foot vacation home. Osler posted a [memoriam](https://www.osler.com/en/about-us/press-room/2016/in-memoriam-geoff-taber-1960-2016) on its website yesterday.

According to the [Toronto Star](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/12/26/toronto-family-mourned-after-devastating-fire-in-peterborough.html), firefighters responded to the blaze at 4 a.m. on Christmas Eve, but by the time they arrived, the structure had already completely collapsed into its basement. Neighbors said that there had been some sort of an explosion at the cottage.

[Dale Ponder](https://www.osler.com/en/team/dale-r-ponder), Osler’s managing partner and chief executive, released this statement:

Geoff Taber was a generous, vibrant and wonderful person, a legal visionary and beloved partner at Osler. Geoff and Jacquie were first and foremost loving parents to their two remarkable sons.

Geoff was at the forefront of understanding the importance of the technology sector to Canada and was the founder of Osler’s emerging companies group. He advised many of Canada’s emerging and later stage companies as well as venture capital investors.

We here at Above the Law would like to extend our condolences and sympathies to the Tabers’ family, friends, and colleagues during this difficult time. May they rest in peace.

# Biglaw Associates Are Tired Of The 'New Normal' And Want More Remote Work
## The commute to the office really seems like a waste of time to associates these days -- especially since they know working remotely was so much more productive.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

They do want training, but I think a lot of them want free time, or the illusion of free time, sitting at home, where you don’t have corporate protocols and procedures.

So, I think some of those habits or behaviors crept in, or got calcified, during that period they were away [from the office], and people figured, ‘Why should I have to endure an hour or an hour and a half commute in some places, versus just being productive sitting at home?’

— Ronald Wood, managing director at Major Lindsey & Africa, and the author of the latest version of MLA’s Law Firm Culture Survey, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/01/25/the-new-normal-in-office-work-is-here-but-lawyers-still-arent-happy-with-it/) on one of the reasons why he thinks associates perceived a negative culture shift at their firms: the lack of remote work opportunities now that they’re being required to return to the office to work for three or more days each week.

The fund’s mission is to assist AAPI crime victims and to support education and awareness programs aimed at reducing [violence targeted toward the AAPI community](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/anti-asian-hate-incident-reports-nearly-doubled-march-new-data-n1266980). It is the first national fundraising effort focused on [crime directed toward the AAPI community](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/22/8-in-10-asian-americans-say-violence-is-risingyet-support-is-lacking.html).

While we work to untangle the Gordian knot of[ significant underrepresentation](https://www.apaportraitproject.org/) in the leadership ranks of law firms, government, and academia, our community is [being attacked on a daily basis](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/in-the-face-of-asian-american-hate-crimes-congressional-tri-caucus-members-preach-unity-while-other-politicians-sow-the-seeds-of-division/) based on our race and ethnicity. It seems like only yesterday we lost [Trinh Huynh](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/in-memoriam-celebrating-the-life-of-lawyer-trinh-huynh/) in a senseless tragedy.

Since then, and throughout this pandemic, we have lost countless more to [targeted acts of violence and hate crimes](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/our-country-is-failing-its-asian-american-senior-citizens-we-must-step-up-to-protect-them/). Racism and xenophobia during this COVID-19 era have not only been dangerous for our community, but [they have also been deadly](https://stopaapihate.org/).

Asian American attorneys like Hamilton and Hsu and affinity groups like [GAPABA](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/millennial-attorneys-can-learn-priceless-life-lessons-from-legal-affinity-groups-like-napaba-and-gapaba/) have given me hope that our country can do better and that our community is ready to [turn this historic moment into a movement](https://www.advancingjustice-chicago.org/aapis-and-multi-issue-movement/). This year, I have often thought about Lincoln’s famous quote: “We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.”

And after speaking with Hamilton and Hsu, I’m convinced our community will not only survive this coronavirus pandemic, [we will emerge stronger](https://www.familyfriendpoems.com/poem/good-timber-by-douglas-malloch) from the pandemic. We will not only dream of a better state, [we will fight](https://www.splcenter.org/news/2021/05/13/fighting-aapi-hate-violence-against-asian-americans-and-pacific-islanders-rising-amid-covid) for a [better state](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2021/05/05/anti-aapi-hate-conversation-dr-jennifer-lee).

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Without further ado, here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation:

Renwei Chung (RC): Can you share with our audience a bit about your backgrounds and why you became attorneys?

Sara Hamilton (SH): I grew up in Oregon, where I studied music and philosophy. I became interested in government after interning with State Rep. John Lim. I love and appreciate music and art, and law actually complements that. I spent some time abroad in Asia afterward. Law school seemed like the natural next step.

So yes, it was part planned and part, “What the heck else am I going to do with my music and philosophy degrees?!” I practice labor and employment law in Atlanta at Thompson Hine LLP. I particularly enjoy labor law and might be the only management-side labor AAPI lawyer under the age of 40 you have ever met.

Angela Hsu (AH): I stumbled into becoming an attorney because I had an undergraduate degree in architecture, but I knew I did not want to become an architect. So my dad told me to go to law school.

RC: How would you describe the current social climate for [Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders](https://thediversitymovement.com/aapi-heritage-month-guide/?utm_source=welcome&utm_medium=eml&utm_campaign=aapi-guide) (AAPI) in America?

SH: Challenging and inspiring. The term “AAPI community” is a misnomer for an incredibly diverse group. For instance, AAPIs have the fastest-growing buying power, but once that data is disaggregated, AAPIs are actually the most economically disparate. Similar trends are found when reviewing disaggregated data with regard to education, political beliefs, etc.

But recently, no matter where you fell under this massive umbrella, it’s been almost universally challenging, albeit in different ways. Even younger AAPIs in particular who do not strongly identify as Asian-American could not help but feel a tug at their heart seeing local businesses shutter and grandmas being randomly attacked on the streets. But it’s also been inspiring. I’ve not seen such civic participation before. There’s a genuine interest in helping others and helping the community.

AH: Racism against AAPI and other people of color exists, but I see our culture shifting towards greater inclusivity. When I just arrived in the United States in the early 1970s, for example, there were almost no images of Asian Americans anywhere, not in print media and not in movies or television.

My brother and I were always two out of a handful of Asian Americans at school. We were picked [on or ] harassed on a regular basis, both in Southern California and in Tennessee. My kids were definitely not subjected to the same level of racism.

RC: Angela, you mentioned how today’s racism against China and those of Chinese descent is reminiscent of the racism against Japan and those of Japanese descent in the 1980s. Can you expound on this concept?

AH: There is a real danger in being seen as the perpetual foreigner. During WWII, 127,000 Americans were incarcerated for being of Japanese descent. Descendants of European axis powers were not incarcerated. In the 1980s, Japanese car manufacturers were out-competing American car manufacturers. Angry, laid-off auto workers killed Vincent Chin, a Chinese American, because they were angry at Japanese carmakers.

You can draw a straight line to today and Trump rhetoric attempting to blame the coronavirus on the Chinese government. This blame sticks to Asian Americans, even though the virus is a disease and China is a foreign country. The people who have been scapegoated are often not even of Chinese descent. When the U.S. has a conflict with European Countries, people do not run around looking for Caucasians who might look French or Russian to attack. When the U.S. was angry at France in the early 2000s some French fries were rechristened Freedom fries, but no one punched any grandmas in the face.

RC: Sara, there was an incident in 2014 you briefly addressed. And you said our community doesn’t really talk about its struggles rather we internalize it in our attempt to be “good Asians” — what do you mean by this?

SH: In 2014, I was walking home when strangers committed a totally unprovoked act. They used derogatory race-based language and laughed afterward while asking whether I could defend myself with kung fu or jiujitsu.

I was lucky because the DA prosecuted it, resulting in a plea. At the time, I didn’t tell anyone, including my employer or closest friends. In hindsight, that was a mistake. But the whole thing was just so bizarre. Although everything was caught on CCTV, I actually doubted whether people would believe me, or worse, I worried they would think it was comical because Asian people and culture are so frequently the butts of jokes.

There is an invisibility of such crimes or even a belief that AAPIs are discriminated against in other ways. I felt pressured as a young professional to keep my head down (I was at a different firm at the time) and just work. I only recently decided to share this in light of the disbelief over the many sad and unprovoked attacks that made the news and after meeting Rep. Andy Kim, who bravely shared his struggles with discrimination as a young professional and encouraged us to speak up.

RC: Sara, you discovered only .2 of 1% of donations go to the [AAPI community](https://aapip.org/). How did you figure this out and why does this matter?

SH: Only 20 cents out of every $100 of foundation giving goes to support the AAPI community. It’s the worst of any group, even though AAPIs are the fastest growing. Moreover, nearly 33% of that already-limited funding is designated for communities in California.

As a lawyer, I believe in government and strong institutions. But government cannot be the solution for everything. Individual people have incredible ability, and I think with that, a special duty.

We need to commit to individual giving and also elevate our stories and community to put them on the radar of foundations and corporate giving departments. I was so pleased to hear of the Asian American Foundation that was launched recently.

RC: Angela, xenophobia against the AAPI community hasn’t just been dangerous, it’s been deadly. As you accurately observed, thousands have been victimized during this pandemic and this is a historical moment for our country … . How can we best meet the moment?

AH: We can meet this moment by speaking up and speaking out when we have the opportunity. We have to shape our own narrative because people outside of our community will get it wrong. I can’t tell you how many well-meaning DEI initiatives are focus on Asian food culture which is accessible, but may emphasize the exotic and foreign aspects of our stereotype.

We can take the time to learn more about Asian American history and the history of other people of color which is often glossed over in U.S. history. We can engage politically. AAPI political engagement in Georgia was likely a large factor in sending Democrats to the Senate. Many AAPI are politically conservative, but they are turned off by racist rhetoric from certain segments of the GOP.

We can raise money for causes that will help our community. Through the tragedy of the shootings, it has galvanized our community as well as the larger community, leaders, major companies, all wanting to do something. The shootings finally focused attention on violence against AAPIs which had been brewing for over a year; we have some momentum and energy, so we need to direct these resources towards solutions and assistance.

RC: What prompted you to come together and create the AAPI Crime Victims & Education Fund?

SH: In short, we saw a need and felt a duty. We were put in this time and place due to the tragic mass shooting on March 16, which killed eight people, six of whom were AAPI women. It occurred in a broader context of nearly 3,800 incidents of harassment or crime against AAPIs in a 12-month period.

As lawyers and AAPI community leaders, we are uniquely situated. We have one foot in the legal system, which is intimately connected to any incident of crime, and one foot in the community, where we go to church and get our late-night fix of bulgogi.

We are blessed to have the perspective of many experienced lawyers such as former U.S. Attorney BJay Pak, who is co-chairing the initiative. Although bias and crimes against AAPIs just now seem to be making the news, they were happening even before now.

At our press launch, BJay spoke of a business owner who was robbed and shot while cowering in fear. The perpetrators had targeted numerous AAPI businesses based on false stereotypes that they held cash and wouldn’t fight.

She didn’t have a GoFundMe, it barely made the news. In some cultures, some victims may not seek financial assistance even if they desperately need it. The GAPABA Law Foundation has raised and granted over $250,000 in the last few years. We already had the structure in place. We felt a calling. We didn’t know what we could do, but we figured we would try and do something.

AH: Because there were many, many people both inside and outside our community who decided after the Atlanta shootings that enough was enough. We and others had issued statements during the pandemic, but talk was getting us nowhere.

RC: What would success look like for the Fund?

SH: Raising $1 million and using our knowledge as lawyers and leaders to get that money where it can be used best. GAPABA and KABA-GA are professional bar associations first and foremost, we do not provide direct services. We find that supporting groups that do provide direct services, through the GAPABA Law Foundation, is how we are best situated for the moment.

GAPABA Law Foundation has supported big groups like Asian Americans Advancing Justice and other, smaller groups that are desperately in need of funds and doing important work, but are way off the radar of any large corporate departments or foundations.

The fund is also an opportunity to start a conversation. It’s not easy to talk about race or social problems, but it’s vital that we do so because we are all connected in the end. I get that it’s not easy to start that conversation. The hesitation is from a good place, mostly not wanting to say the wrong thing. The current environment is tragic, but the silver lining is that it has opened a pathway into these discussions and into the community.

AH: Raising enough money so that it can both fund prevention efforts and provide resources for bias crime victims across the country.

On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, I would like to thank Sara Hamilton and Angela Hsu for sharing their stories with our audience. We wish them continued success in their careers.

Accounting and finance issues regularly arise as part of legal work — and lawyers need to be comfortable addressing them when they do.

To that end, PLI is offering a critical, two-day program for lawyers of all experience levels titled [Basics of Accounting for Lawyers 2022](https://www.pli.edu/programs/basics-of-accounting-for-lawyers?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2), which will cover the most common accounting concepts that emerge in the practice of law. Experts from both the legal and accounting professions will lead attendees through practical discussions that take an in-depth look at the elements of financial statements and what they reveal about organizations.

The program will also offer insightful analysis of how legal ethics intersect with accounting professional rules of conduct. Attendees can expect a lively discussion as legal and accounting experts review the Rules of Professional Conduct, legal ethics opinions, and court cases to highlight common areas of potential ethical risk for attorneys dealing with financial information.

Other basics of accounting to be covered in the program include:

- How to read the balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows, and notes to the financial statements
- An overview of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)
- The evolving legal ethical issues that arise when dealing with financial information
- Recent regulatory changes, along with insights from those impacted or involved in the changes
- An overview of what attorneys need to know about the components of internal controls
This program will provide a solid foundation in accounting fundamentals for attorneys of all levels and roles, giving you a better understanding of financial issues that may arise in your matters. [Register](https://www.pli.edu/programs/basics-of-accounting-for-lawyers?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2) today.

# Ex-Biglaw Partner Pleads Guilty In Bankruptcy Fraud Case
## He's now looking at some time behind bars.

Back in March, John Roesser, a former Biglaw partner, was [arrested for making false statements](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/ex-biglaw-partner-arrested-for-bankruptcy-fraud/) and submitting falsified records in the course of his own bankruptcy proceeding. Roesser was a partner at five firms between 2010 and 2018, jumping from Seyfarth Shaw to Winston & Strawn to Alston & Bird to Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer before he finally landed at Dechert.

As we noted previously, while Roesser’s income was “substantial,” so were his tax obligations (to the tune of approximately $3.8+ million). Those allegedly went unpaid, and he resigned from the New York bar in 2020 after he admitted to misappropriating six figures in client funds. He filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2022, and was later indicted after claiming that he was about to receive nearly $10 million to pay his immense tax debts — that money never materialized.

Earlier this week, Roesser pleaded guilty before Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York to one count of making false statements under penalty of perjury and submitting falsified records in his bankruptcy case. The [New York Law Journal](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2023/09/12/former-big-law-partner-pleads-guilty-to-making-false-statements-in-his-personal-bankruptcy-case/) has additional details:

Roesser said he participated in the submission of false records and a false monthly operating report filed in the bankruptcy proceeding in September 2022.

“At the time I made the falsified records and submitted the falsified report, I knew it was illegal to do so,” Roesser said.

U.S. Attorney Damian Williams (S.D.N.Y) offered these comments in the wake of Roesser’s guilty plea:

“The United States bankruptcy system does immense public good and provides a backstop for people trying to lawfully navigate their way out of debt,” Williams said. “The defendant—who used to be a lawyer and knew exactly what he was doing—manipulated and corrupted a system that helps so many. He lied to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York so that he could use its protections to keep his assets and to avoid paying his bills. This Office will bring to justice those who abuse the public’s trust and use their status to try to place themselves above the law.”

Roesser faces up to five years in prison and three years of supervised release. He will be sentenced in January.

# Reports Of Another Biglaw Firm Engaged In Stealth Layoffs
## Best wishes to anyone who suddenly finds themselves out of work during a pandemic.

Some associates at Snell & Wilmer have been let go from the firm. According to insiders, in an associate meeting, the firm characterized these terminations as performance based. But… when enough people are non-voluntarily exiting the firm that it gets folks talking, well, there’s a good chance there’s something deeper going on.

Of course, we’re talking about stealth layoffs. [Biglaw is known](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/stealth-layoffs/) for this particularly pernicious form of headcount management. If you’ve never heard of the phenomenon, consider yourself lucky. But the basic outline is that during economic downturns, firms will cut associates (that usually had good performance reviews until, coincidentally, the economy took a hit) all the while calling them performance-based cuts. These stealth layoffs allow firms to cut headcount without confirming that there were economic-based layoffs. Rather than signal some perceived weakness, a firm tries to cut overhead without making a splash. So, they’ll give the associates X number of months/weeks to find a new job and the firm may even couch the reductions in performance review terms, making those let go doubt their lawyering skills.

Of course, Snell & Wilmer, an Am Law 200 firm, [previously cut associate salaries by 10 percent and furloughed staff who can’t work remotely.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/another-am-law-200-firm-cutting-salaries-and-furloughing-staff/) Now multiple tipsters from the firm are reporting there’s been some headcount management at the firm. And though they’re being told the terminations are performance-based (you know, exactly like the definition of a stealth layoff), the rank and file are deeply suspicious of the line they’re being told. Talk a look at a sampling of the tipsters’ reports:

Snell Wilmer has laid off associates in LA and OC, for, supposedly, underperformance. Definitely BS… we all know they were stealth layoffs.

 

Layoffs were confirmed by the firm on the last associate call. The reason given for the layoffs was because of “underperformance.” This is literally the definition of stealth layoffs.

Hi there, I’m an associate at Snell and Wilmer… the firm has been quietly making layoffs over the last two months during COVID. The firm is publicly stating that they are not doing layoffs, and has reduced all employees salaries as a way to “avoid layoffs” but had secretly been conducting layoffs anyways. Numerous associates in both Orange County and Los Angeles have been asked to leave despite having positive performance reviews, and other attorneys and associates have not been informed.

 

Snell Wilmer on an associate call … stated, after a question about layoffs, that “some” associates have been let go for “performance reasons.”

 

Snell and Wilmer conducting stealth layoffs. A few associates have been let go. Frustrating, since the EC stated that we were all in this together. Guess not.

Yeah, it doesn’t sound good. [I have nothing but the deepest sympathy for anyone that finds themselves going through it](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/what-the-2009-legal-layoffs-were-really-like/). And let me reassure you — it isn’t you.

Matt Feeney, Chair of Snell & Wilmer, provided the following statement, denying any associate departures were the result of layoffs:

“Snell & Wilmer is not conducting layoffs, ‘stealth’ or otherwise. Out of respect for the privacy of our former employees, we do not provide details on departures.”

New York lawyers are known for starting their day on the later side, strolling in at 10:15 a.m. is nothing out of the ordinary. Well, when [Willkie Farr & Gallagher](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/willkie-farr-gallagher-llp/) associates began their day today, they pretty quickly received a pleasant surprise.

Yup, at 10:19 a.m. this morning, Willkie became the latest firm to jump on the Cravath scale. And it isn’t just the New York associates getting the good news, folks in the D.C. and Houston offices (which are all of Willkie’s U.S. offices) are getting raises too.

UPDATE (10:58 a.m.): Tipsters note that the summer associates got their share of the love too.

As a tipster noted:

A little cheer just went up in the hallways.

See, Willkie associates, waiting three days for your cold, hard cash wasn’t really that bad. And now you can have your [Willkie button](http://www.answers.com/Q/Was_there_an_old_saying_wilkie_button_and_what_does_it_mean) (yes, that was apparently a real phrase in the ’50s, used similarly to the [brownie button](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Brownie%20Button)).

# Stat Of The Week: Actually, $180K Is A Mediocre Raise

Our friend [Bruce MacEwen](http://adamsmithesq.com/2016/06/new-york-to-190k/) offers a bit of sobering perspective amid all the fuss over the Great Biglaw Pay Hike of 2016:

Actually, if you adjust for inflation since the last hike, to $160K, in early 2007, associates are losing ground—especially if you focus on changes in the cost of living in the New York metropolitan area, which is presumably the only locale Cravath cares much about. Courtesy of the BLS, to achieve the same purchasing power as $160,000 would have gotten you in 2007 would require about $189,500 in 2016. Maybe “New York To $190″ was more accurate than anyone realized.

# David Boies Sues Alan Dershowitz, Becomes A Pro Se Litigant

After fighting to get pro se litigants a better break from the federal judiciary — [joining Judge Posner and Matthew Dowd in the William Bond case](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/10/worlds-most-fortunate-pro-se-litigant-represented-by-judge-posner-now-also-represented-by-david-boies/) — David Boies is going to experience life as a pro se litigant himself, filing suit on his own behalf against Alan Dershowitz.

Boies will probably not face the same challenges as most pro se litigants.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Until recently, Boies had represented Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking ring, in her lawsuit against Dershowitz for defamation. Giuffre claims Epstein made her sleep with Dershowitz while she was a child — Dershowitz publicly claimed she was alternately confused or blackmailing him and then demanded that she file a defamation suit against him for calling her a liar. She filed a defamation suit and Dershowitz started in with the “[whoa, I didn’t mean that literally](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/after-publicly-demanding-his-accusers-sue-him-dershowitz-is-arguing-that-his-accusers-have-no-basis-to-sue-him/)” act.

After roping Boies into the argument by claiming Giuffre’s famous lawyer was running an extortion ring, Dershowitz argued that [Boies had to be disqualified as an advocate-witness](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/harvard-law-schools-dershowitz-moves-to-disqualify-boies-schiller-in-sex-trafficking-case/). Judge Preska [indulged this theory](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/judge-mocks-that-bonkers-republication-argument-dershowitz-made/) and Giuffre [secured Chuck Cooper to take over the case](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/dershowitz-wanted-to-get-boies-disqualified-so-now-he-has-to-deal-with-another-famous-scotus-litigator/). Yesterday, Dershowitz filed a counterclaim citing emotional distress. Cooper responded:

Recycling the same false claims from his increasingly stale playbook, Alan Dershowitz has once again launched an attack on Virginia Giuffre and her lawyers. Lets call his counterclaim what it is:  a failed attempt to make something old and tired look new.

Meanwhile, Boies filed a defamation complaint of his own today against Dershowitz because, you know, Dershowitz went to the press repeatedly and claimed that Boies was running an extortion racket. He actually said, “I believe the law firm of Boies Schiller is a RICO” which is… just wow.

Yet somehow, it feels as though Dershowitz is going to be surprised to learn of this suit. Maybe Dershowitz is playing nine-dimensional chess, but it sure seems like every argument he makes creates even worse fallout: Don’t just deny… demand they sue you! Then get sued. Don’t just litigate the case… get Boies kicked off! End up facing Chuck Cooper. Don’t just claim Giuffre’s mistaken… accuse Boies of blackmailing you! Get sued by Boies.

Plus, if you assume what Dershowitz was hoping to avoid in disqualifying Boies was allowing Boies to conduct discovery — he’ll still get to see everything anyway.

But this is setting up a truly epic disqualification motion!

# The First Biglaw Firm To Match Cravath's Mega-Money Salary Scale
## Exciting times at this leading law firm!

Cravath waited a good and long time to [make a salary move](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cravath-raises-22/), upping the ante to $415,000 for its most senior associates after Milbank and Davis Polk had already gotten dozens of firms to follow their lead. We wondered for a brief moment yesterday how long it would take for other Biglaw firms to step up and match Cravath’s incredibly generous cash compensation for associates. The answer was apparently not long at all.

Quinn Emanuel — a firm that brought in $1,301,077,000 gross revenue in 2020, putting it in 28th place in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — announced that it would be matching Cravath yesterday afternoon, shortly after the compensation leader raised the stakes for Biglaw salaries. This is what associate pay will now look like for attorneys at the powerhouse litigation firm:

- Class of 2021: $215,000
- Class of 2020: $225,000
- Class of 2019: $250,000
- Class of 2018: $295,000
- Class of 2017: $345,000
- Class of 2016: $370,000
- Class of 2015: $400,000
- Class of 2014: $415,000
As with almost all prior announcements, Quinn Emanuel is making these raises retroactive to January 1, and associates can expect to see their new salaries in their March 31 paychecks. Congratulations!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Quinn Emanuel.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# How Many Files Are Too Many For Associates?
## The penny-wise and pound-foolish method of saving money by assigning one attorney numerous files can actually hurt the firm.

Associates can be responsible for drastically different amounts of files depending on the type of work the lawyer handles and what type of firm employs each lawyer. Attorneys in Biglaw might only work on a few larger matters since massive lawsuits or transactional matters can keep tons of lawyers busy for a while. At smaller shops, lawyers might be responsible for more matters since those matters do not require as much effort to manage. However, law firm managers should be careful when determining how many matters is too many for an associate to handle so that each lawyer can perform their best work and so that no billable opportunities are wasted.

When I was an associate in Biglaw, I did not really have primary responsibility over any matters. I worked on a few massive litigation matters, and partners would give me projects associated with those matters so that I could bill enough hours to satisfy expectations. When I left Biglaw, I had primary responsibility over the matters I handled. Our firm managed over a thousand files, and associates needed to take a hands-on approach toward managing all of those files.

When I started working at a midsize firm at which I had primary responsibility over matters, I initially only managed 25 cases. At the time, it seemed like a lot of files since I was not that experienced with aspects of litigation, and it was difficult to stay on top of all of the cases. As I got more experienced, the managing partner assigned more files to me throughout my time at the firm, and by the time I left that shop, I was managing 44 cases. I definitely had an easier time handling those 44 files at the end of my tenure at the firm than the 25 cases at the beginning, and the partner did a good job of ensuring that no one was overloaded with files.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
However, I have heard horror stories of associates at firms that have too many files to handle, and that impacts the quality of work performed in those cases. Lawyers might handle too many files for a few reasons. Perhaps the main reason is that the shop simply does not have enough attorneys. Some law firms charge lower billable hour rates and just cannot hire enough people to handle files more effectively. As a result, the shop saturates all of the other associates with numerous files in the hopes that the associates will be able to churn out many billable hours from the files they have.

The other main reason why associates might have too many files is because managers simply do not understand how many files an attorney can reasonably handle. Partners at some firms only have minimal responsibility on files, or might only get involved in cases after they are scheduled for trial (which is somewhat rare) and accordingly, they simply might not know that associates are overburdened with files, and they might not be too efficient in handling the files to which they are assigned.

Of course, not every file is the same, and I once worked in a mass torts practice at which I was assigned hundreds of files. However, there was very little work to do on these files at any given time, so this was not a big deal. However, when it comes to run-of-the-mill litigation matters, such as those handled by insurance defense firms, associates should rarely be assigned more than 50 to 60 files. That amount of files ensures associates have a solid source of work, and associates can reasonably be expected to know the happenings in several dozen files.

However, I have heard of associates handling 90 or 100 run-of-the-mill litigation files, and in most circumstances, this is too much. Of course, some people might be really good at time management, and can in fact handle this load of files, but most people will struggle to manage this amount of files. Things will naturally be forgotten by the handling attorney if an associate is assigned this number of files since there is no way that an associate can keep all of those files straight when juggling all of the tasks attorneys handle in their jobs.

All told, law firms might think they are saving money by assigning one attorney numerous files, but this can actually hurt the firm. An associate might not have sufficient time to bill all of the hours that could be devoted to such files, and attorneys may perform worse work if they are assigned too many cases. Law firm managers need to consider efficiency and billable potential when selecting the number of files to assign each associate.

# Paul, Weiss Touts Anti-Death Penalty Reputation... So Why Is The Firm Helping Oklahoma Kill A Man?

The state of Oklahoma recently filed cert in [Oklahoma v. Bosse](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2021/08/Bosse.pdf), asking the Supreme Court to overturn McGirt v. Oklahoma, the Gorsuch opinion recognizing that Oklahoma cannot just fiat away treaty obligations the United States owes to American Indian nations. At the very least, the state wants the Court to say that it doesn’t have to overturn the scores of illegal convictions it racked up in violation of federal treaties over the years.

It was a 5-4 opinion relying on Justice Ginsburg’s vote, so it’s safe to say the opinion is likely to be overturned soon unless you believe the other conservative members of the Supreme Court will adhere to basic principles of stare decisis, which is just silly. It’s a wild case because after years of the conservative legal community leaning on “if the legislature didn’t intend this outcome, it’s up to them to fix it, not us,” the right-wing (sans Gorsuch, of course) responded with “Congress?!? Are you crazy? They can’t do anything, we have to legislate from here!”[[1]](#f1) Could it be that the whole “Congress must act” thing was just a disingenuous tool hauled out to permanently table civil rights? Hmmmmmmmmmm.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In this matter, Shaun Michael Bosse, a death row inmate convicted of murdering his girlfriend and her children is using the McGirt decision to argue that he was improperly convicted in state court. Oklahoma is trying to stop that from happening.

And the state hired Paul, Weiss to make that argument for them.

It’s a curious representation given the firm’s proud history — [touted on its own website](https://www.paulweiss.com/about-the-firm/history):

The firm and its lawyers participated in efforts… to resist the death penalty by defending scores condemned to die and obtaining a historic victory in the U.S. Supreme Court forbidding execution of the mentally disabled….

Paul, Weiss has always relished its reputation for supporting liberal causes. No one is confusing the elite Biglaw firm for the National Lawyer’s Guild — it’s still fundamentally the Wall Street firm that began in the late 1800s, but its lawyers have dedicated considerable effort over the decades advancing social justice.[[2]](#f2) This case seems to be a change of direction.

The argument here seems to be that the firm isn’t so much “sticking up for the death penalty” as it’s sticking up for Oklahoma having a functional criminal justice system. It does sound like McGirt precipitated a lot of problems in Oklahoma, but remember it didn’t cause those problems, Oklahoma’s historical “oopsie” of ignoring federal law for decades did.[[3]](#f3)

Repping Oklahoma is Kannon Shanmugam. When he joined the firm, we wondered if it might change the firm’s personality to [add a FedSoc lifer who clerked for Justice Scalia](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/paul-weiss-launches-supreme-court-practice-as-press-spotlight-returns-to-partnership-diversity/). It seems like it might have because one assumes a blood red state government like Oklahoma’s hires its Supreme Court advocates directly off the Federalist Society approved list.

At some firms, you can brush unsavory cases off as a professional commitment to being a true advocate-for-hire. Some lawyers are like stone-cold action movie villains… “it’s not personal, just business.” But that’s just never been the Paul, Weiss character before.

Whether law firms should be held responsible for their representations or not is a complicated judgment call. “Everyone deserves a lawyer” doesn’t mean “everyone deserves you as their lawyer.” Once attorneys choose to take work for pay, it becomes a business decision. A lawyer dedicated to [victims of sexual misconduct shouldn’t represent Harvey Weinstein](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/09/lisa-bloom-staked-her-whole-reputation-on-harvey-weinstein-hows-that-working-out-for-her/), while an attorney passionate about zealous criminal defense as the bedrock of a functioning legal system can.

It may feel weird to say that branding is what matters, but when it comes to holding lawyers to their representations, whether or not they’re being true to themselves says a lot. Because the business of law is a business and the work a firm does defines it. And for Paul, Weiss, it might be time to stop holding them to their history and start recognizing that the firm contains multitudes now and that for every heroic pro bono matter there’s going to be a death penalty defense in there.

[ [1]](#reff1) This is an actual passage from the petition: “While the Court believed that compromise or congressional action could limit the disruption from its decision, it is now clear that neither is forthcoming. The tribes do not agree among themselves, much less with the State, on the proper path forward, and Congress is unlikely to adopt any proposal not supported by all of the parties involved.” Basically, “we tried to do it the legal way, but it’s too hard.”
[ [2]](#reff2) This isn’t meant to downplay past problematic representations. The phrase “[Indonesian torture case](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/indonesian-torture-case-not-exactly-the-phrase-you-want-to-see-attached-to-biden-official/)” isn’t exactly inspiring.
[ [3]](#reff3) This is almost the opposite of the Nestle matter that [got everyone mad at Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/is-biglaw-really-depraved/). In that case, we all had to begrudgingly admit that federal law doesn’t cover the awful consequence of transnational capitalism contracting out for child slave labor. Here, federal law does cover the situation, but Oklahoma is arguing that the Court shouldn’t let it because the consequences are bad. And as we said when covering the Nestle case, asking the legislature to micromanage everything is naive and unrealistic, but it’s pretty ominous to go all the way to asking the Court “to usurp the role of the legislature out of necessity.”

Hint: Before now, it’s only happened two times since 2006, the year Above the Law first started tracking Biglaw bonus news.

# Biglaw Firm Won't Give Associates Fall Special Bonuses, But Makes Vague Promises About Year-End Bonuses
## Associates are torn as to what it all means.

Another day, another Biglaw firm’s associates are told to wait on COVID appreciation bonuses. Last month it seemed like all the elite in Biglaw would just have to spread their[ considerable wealth](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/whats-the-real-reason-biglaw-firms-are-begging-off-fall-bonuses/) with associates in the fall, but now the tide has turned.

Let’s go through a little special fall[ bonus history](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-fall-special-bonus-tracker-which-biglaw-firms-are-handing-out-cash-for-associates-hard-work-during-the-pandemic/), shall we? Cooley started the [COVID appreciation bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cooley-bonuses/) game, and it was exciting when [Davis Polk ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/)came over the top of the Cooley scale. And firms [quickly](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/milbank-bonuses/) started [piling](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/irell-bonuses/) on this [new bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/sullivan-cromwell-makes-a-move-in-covid-19-bonus-war/) [scale.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/debevoise-bonuses/) Weil did their own, seemingly unpopular, [hours-based bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/weil-offers-a-new-take-on-fall-bonuses-theyre-hours-based-and-theyre-huge/), but, still, it was better than no bonuses at all.

But, sigh, Kirkland — the [world’s richest law firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/the-global-100-the-richest-law-firms-in-the-world-2020/) — [begged off](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/kirklands-not-giving-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-salty-about-it/) fall special bonuses, and seemed to be asking the market not to follow the trend. And [Cravath seconded that](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cravath-is-not-offering-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-pissed/). And that was… pretty much all she wrote. With the [exception of Willkie Farr](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/willkie-announces-fall-bonuses-blowing-off-cravath-followers/), the only bonus news Biglaw has had is a lot of nothing, as firms are just asking [associates to wait for market bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/whats-the-real-reason-biglaw-firms-are-begging-off-fall-bonuses/).

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
So it really isn’t a surprise that Cahill announced on Friday that their associates will have to wait until the year-end bonuses to see any financial appreciation for their hard work during this difficult time. But the firm did note that, whenever 2020 bonuses happen, they’ll “reflect prevailing market bonus activity across the New York area (including covid related bonuses).” But what that means is up for debate. One tipster told Above the Law “Cahill is paying COVID bonuses!”

Others…. well, they took a harsher view on the firm’s note:

The firm has repeatedly said this has been our best year ever throughout the year, so it’s kind of hard to understand why they are deciding to delay this, but not super surprising given how unbelievably cheap they are.

The least they could have done is respect us enough to give us an explicit answer as opposed to referring to “prevailing market bonus activity”. Nice seeing a “market leader” in compensation proudly announce they’re a second tier firm.

Hopefully when year-end bonuses roll around, Cahill associates will find the wait was worth it.

# Biglaw Firms Delay Reopenings Due To Omicron Variant, Setting Returns For April (And Beyond)
## Will your law firm be adjusting its course due to the new viral variant?

As we get closer and closer to the end of 2021, more and more Biglaw and boutique firms are realizing that 2022 may wind up being just like how it sounds: [“2020 Two.”](https://mobile.twitter.com/alyssalimp/status/1468826751685959682) This time, law firms are prepared for the COVID-19 sequel. Omicron is now the dominant variant after just a few short weeks, and it’s even more transmissible than the delta variant. Magic Circle firms in the UK have already told their personnel to [start working from home](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/uk-magic-circle-firms-bring-back-covid-19-remote-work-requirements-thanks-to-omicron-variant/), and quite a few US firms have already revised their return-to-office plans for the end of this year and early next year (see [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/litigation-boutique-revises-its-hybrid-return-to-office-plan-due-to-omicron-variant/), [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/goodwin-rto-march-2022/), and [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/sidley-bans-the-unvaccinated-from-the-office/)). The latest firms to announce changes to their office return plans are hoping that this version of the virus will be gone by spring.

Yesterday, Cooley — a top 20 Am Law firm — announced that it would be extending its fully remote operations as a firm until at least April. Back in July, Cooley formally announced that it [would not ask lawyers to return to the office in 2021](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/top-20-biglaw-firm-wont-make-lawyers-return-to-office-in-2021-but-vaccines-will-be-required/), and would require all of its employees to be fully vaccinated.

At the same time, Mintz Levin announced that it was scrapping its January 4 return-to-office plan and would instead be taking things month by month. The firm no longer has a set reopening date, and in a memo to all employees, managing partner Bob Bodian said, “[W]e do not know when a formal RTO will be appropriate.” Mintz will require everyone at the firm to get booster shots.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
What has your firm announced as far as a revised reopening plan due to the omicron variant? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a new market standard for a return.

As soon as you find out about reopening plans at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

They say three is a [trend](http://www.npr.org/2013/01/29/170535707/two-is-a-coincidence-threes-a-trend)…

Chadbourne & Parke, soon to be [merged with and take the name of ](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/biglaw-merger-means-the-end-of-chadbourne-parke/?rf=1)Norton Rose Fulbright, has been dealing with a a gender bias suit since last August. That’s when Kerrie Campbell, a former partner at the Biglaw shop, filed a $[100 million class action lawsuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/biglaw-firm-hit-with-100-million-class-action-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/) against the firm. Then things started to get… [ugly](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/chadbourne-swings-back-over-gender-bias-suit/).

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Highlights (lowlights?) have include: allegations of a [videotape](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/theres-now-allegedly-videotape-in-the-latest-biglaw-lawsuit-twist/) capturing supposedly retaliatory behavior; a former partner in the Kiev office, Jaroslawa Z. Johnson, [joining as a plaintiff](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/biglaw-pay-discrimination-case-adds-a-new-plaintiff/); claims [partners are not employees](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/biglaw-firm-claims-partners-are-not-employees/) (an issue the court still hasn’t ruled on); and a [letter](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/these-biglaw-partners-are-super-pissed-someone-filed-a-class-action-lawsuit-on-their-behalf/) was sent — filled with all sort of tropes about the kind of women who “let” themselves be discriminated against — signed by 14 female partners at the firm who disputed the claims Campbell made.

But you know who didn’t sign onto that letter? [Mary Yelenick](https://www.chadbourne.com/myelenick). At the time, [she was the only current female partner](https://bol.bna.com/chadbourne-gender-discrimination-case-gets-amended-complaint/) that did not sign the letter. Now she is joining the lawsuit. As [reported by Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/02/28/another-ex-partner-targets-chadbourne-in-sex-bias-case/):

Mary Yelenick, a former chair of Chadbourne’s products liability group and a longtime New York partner now working as of counsel at the firm, [filed papers late Monday](http://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/doc1/127119808912) seeking to join the proposed class action as a plaintiff. According to [Yelenick’s profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/mary-t-yelenick-110922b/) on professional networking website LinkedIn, she spent more than 35 years at Chadbourne after joining the firm in 1981.

“During my employment, I believe Chadbourne paid me less than men who performed similar work,” Yelenick wrote in Monday’s filing.

Yelenick’s attorney is [David Sanford](https://sanfordheisler.com/team/david-sanford/) of Sanford Heisler, the same representation as the other plaintiffs in this case, and he was tight-lipped about whether we might see additional plaintiffs:

Sanford refused to say whether he had spoken with additional current or former Chadbourne lawyers who could join the case as plaintiffs. He said that he often speaks confidentially with potential clients.

“People are very concerned about economic stability, professional continuity and testing the waters for new opportunities,” Sanford said of the reluctance that many lawyers feel about joining an employment action. “Many times I will hear that people are evaluating their circumstances and will let me know if they have a reason to reconsider their options.”

This case just keeps getting more and more interesting.

Associates running from Biglaw for in-house jobs.

The most intelligent associates don’t make partner, they go in-house.

— a midlevel associate at Cleary, in response to a question found in the [American Lawyer Midlevel Associates Survey](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/08/03/the-2022-midlevel-associates-survey-quotable-associates/) about what most surprised them about working at their current firm.

# Another Firm Matches Cravath

After a blistering evening of 10 salary bumps all announced after 5 p.m., this morning gets off to a rollicking start with a Biglaw mainstay announcing raises just as associates stroll in the door.

Fried Frank has matched the Cravath scale in its New York and D.C. offices (which are, of course, its only U.S. offices). The scale runs up to Class of 2007 receiving $325K, placing Fried Frank on the happy end of the ’07/$325K vs. ’08/$315K debate. That’s fitting because Fried Frank is very much on the “nice” list when it comes to associate compensation, having offered the most hardworking associates bonuses up to [$20,000 above the Cravath scale last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-a-chance-to-exceed-the-cravath-scale/).

Summers are of course receiving the bump too. Have we focused yet on how f**king nuts tax day 2017 will be for these summers? That’s when all that money they got taxed upon assuming an annual salary of $180K starts coming back because they made only $60K for the year. Enjoy your splurging.

Remember, when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”).

Top Biglaw firms are exiting or reducing their presence in China at a breakneck pace, while others are now reconsidering their lobbying relationships with Chinese companies thanks to heightened government scrutiny.

In January, the Defense Department released a Section 1260H list of “Chinese military companies” operating directly or indirectly in the United States, which spurred Biglaw firms to cut ties with several of the named companies. According to the [National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/04/02/law-firms-terminate-lobbying-relationships-with-chinese-companies-405-139215/), some of those Biglaw firms include Brownstein Hyatt, Akin Gump, and Steptoe. Here are some additional details:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck terminated its relationship with Chinese lidar-maker Hesai Group at the end of February, reporting $70,000 in income for its work for Hesai since Jan. 1, according to a termination disclosure. The firm was first hired in September.

Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, which started working for Hesai last August, also parted ways with the company at the end of February. The firm reported earning $60,000 for its work since the beginning of this year, according to the disclosure. …

Akin also parted ways with Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co. in mid-February, though did not report any income for this quarter.

Steptoe cut ties with BGI Shenzhen Co. in mid-February, reporting $100,000 in income for its work for the Chinese biotech company since the beginning of this year. The firm was first hired by the company back in July.

In a client memo, Akin said, “We expect companies to undertake closer scrutiny of entities on the Section 1260H List given the reputational considerations associated with such a listing.”

Which Biglaw firm will be the next say zàijiàn to its offices in China or its lobbying relationship with Chinese companies?

# 5 Things Lawyers Need To Understand About M&A In 2022
## Opinions from experts have varied greatly, from pessimism to beliefs that the trends of Q4 2021 will continue for the near future.

Although the private equity and M&A sectors may have taken a hit during the beginning of the pandemic, they’ve come back stronger than ever.

As the world learned how to better navigate the pandemic, deal activity saw a significant uptick — so much so that 2021 ended up being a record year for global M&A. Q4 of 2021 closed out a year that saw increasingly stronger deal activity as it progressed.

This was true across virtually all sectors, geographies, and deal sizes.

What does this all mean for the private equity and M&A sectors in 2022?

Opinions from experts have varied greatly, from pessimism to beliefs that the trends of Q4 2021 will continue for the near future.

Of course, the invasion of Ukraine has recently caused more general economic uncertainty, so the industry will have to wait and see how that ever-changing situation might impact private equity and M&A deals around the globe.

Regardless of what the future might hold, there are five key things that practitioners need to understand in order to position themselves for a successful year in private equity and M&A:

- The landscape of private equity and M&A deal activity in 2021 and how it shifted in light of the pandemic
- How 2021’s activity and trends might shape private equity and M&A deals in 2022
- The private equity and M&A deal landscape as we entered 2022 and whether that is likely to shift as the year goes on
- The top structures, terms, and strategies for M&A deals in 2022
- The biggest drivers of M&A activity in 2022
PLI’s upcoming program, [2022 Private Equity and M&A Update and Forecast](https://www.pli.edu/programs/2022-private-equity-and-ma-update-and-forecast?t=live&p=348906?tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2), will include a discussion all of these topics. In addition, industry experts will be providing an overall outlook for private equity and M&A activity for the rest of the year and the years to come.

Register today to prepare yourself to navigate the ever-changing M&A waters in the year ahead. And visit [Practising Law Institute](https://www.pli.edu/programs/find-program) for more.

In October 2021, Alec Baldwin fatally shot cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, 42, with a prop gun on the movie set of the film “Rust.” As we [previously noted](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/cinematographer-shot-by-alec-baldwin-was-wife-of-latham-watkins-associate/), Matt Hutchins, Halyna’s husband, is a corporate associate in the Los Angeles office of Latham & Watkins. The widower quickly [lawyered up](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/biglaw-widower-of-halyna-hutchins-hires-firm-specialing-in-wrongful-death-suits/), hiring Panish Shea Boyle Ravipudi, an L.A.-based plaintiffs’ firm specializing in wrongful-death litigation. He officially filed suit last February.

It’s now being reported that Hutchins has reached a confidential settlement with Baldwin, the film’s production companies, its producers, and other key members of the crew. As part of the settlement, he will now serve as one of the film’s executive producers. Here’s a statement from Hutchins, via CNN:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“We have reached a settlement, subject to court approval, for our wrongful death case against the producers of Rust, including Alec Baldwin and Rust Movie Productions, LLC. As part of that settlement, our case will be dismissed. The filming of Rust, which I will now executive produce, will resume with all the original principal players on board in January 2023. I have no interest in engaging in recriminations or attribution of blame (to the producers or Mr. Baldwin). All of us believe Halyna’s death was a terrible accident. I am grateful that the producers and the entertainment community have come together to pay tribute to Halyna’s final work.”

Director Joel Souza, who was also injured in the shooting that led to Halyna’s death, said, “[A]ny decision to return to finish directing the film could only make sense for me if it was done with the involvement of Matt and the Hutchins family. Though certainly bittersweet, I am pleased that together, we will now complete what Halyna and I started.”

For those who wish to honor Halyna, a rising star in her industry, the American Film Institute has established a scholarship in her memory. Click [here](https://www.afi.com/halyna-hutchins-scholarship-fund/?form=FUNYUNXCHMH) to make a donation. We at Above the Law continue to extend our condolences to the family, friends, and colleagues of Halyna and Matt Hutchins during this difficult time. We hope this settlement brings peace to the Hutchins family.

# Biglaw Merger Creates New 1,000 Lawyer Firm
## After months of speculation, two firms with complementary energy practices merge.

It’s been a rocky road to merger for Hunton & Williams and Andrews Kurth, but it’s finally official. Hunton Andrews Kurth will be born on April 2 at… let’s say 175,364 lbs. 6 oz. And, yes that’s probably being generous to a firm that will have 300 lawyers in prime BBQ territory. Or maybe it’s best to blame Tex-Mex, given the parties agree that the merger was first hatched in a Houston Tex-Mex restaurant.

Whatever restaurant you pick, the two firms had no trouble splitting the check. The downfall of most firm mergers is a pronounced gap between each firm’s financial position. But Hunton & Williams and Andrews Kurth paint almost frighteningly similar portraits. Per [Texas Lawyer](https://www.law.com/texaslawyer/2018/02/21/its-official-andrews-kurth-and-hunton-williams-will-merge/):

In 2016, Andrews Kurth posted gross revenue of $289 million with 327 lawyers, while gross revenue at Hunton & Williams was $541 million with 661 lawyers. But revenue per lawyer and profits per partner at the two firms were very close. RPL was $883,000 at Andrews Kurth in 2016 compared with $820,000 at Hunton & Williams. PPP was $1,259,000 at Andrews Kurth, compared with $1,100,000 at Hunton & Williams.

Those revenue figures are sufficient to land the new firm in the Am Law 50, the coveted upper-tier of the legal landscape that smaller firms — especially Texas firms — are clawing toward in an era where the Am Law 51-200 are getting increasingly edged out:

The merger is another sign that firms outside of the Am Law 50 are feeling increasing market pressure to remain competitive and looking to achieve this by growing larger. Other large Texas firms are also in merger talks, including [Foley & Lardner and Gardere Wynne Sewell](http://bit.ly/2h2xCQf) and [Strasburger & Price and Clark Hill](http://bit.ly/2Hk3Ajx).

Unfortunately for firms grasping for the brass ring, a slot in the Am Law 50 isn’t even a guarantee of success anymore, with the gap between the top 10-20 firms and the rest of the pack growing every quarter. But there’s reason to believe Hunton Andrews Kurth will have an advantage that the rest of the Am Law 50 don’t.

While growth for the sake of growth is usually a recipe for disaster — a costly exercise in ballooning overhead to capture scraps of additional revenue — the Hunton Andrews Kurth merger offers growth with purpose. Melding a heavy oil and gas business with a firm elbow-deep in representing utilities creates a Biglaw force with pronounced expertise in the energy sector at a time when energy is among the hottest global business segments.

The exodus of Andrews Kurth attorneys, including whole practice groups, [raised concerns that the deal may be in trouble](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/will-partner-poaching-stop-this-rumored-biglaw-merger-in-its-tracks/). Worse, it raised concerns that if Hunton & Williams walked away, Andrews Kurth could find itself picked clean in short order as rival firms smelled blood in the water. In the end, these concerns were all overblown and the departures may have actually eased the merger by shuttling off expertise that didn’t match the core mission of the new firm.

Congratulations to both sides for completing this [long-awaited](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/will-they-or-wont-they-rumors-abound-about-potential-biglaw-merger/) deal.

# Special Bonuses Are Just Another Way To Keep Associates Hooked On Biglaw
## Associates have options, they should use them.

It’s super easy to get blown away by the big money being given away by Biglaw. In addition to the typical year-end bonuses, this year, Biglaw is giving out special bonuses — ranging between $12,000 and $64,000, depending on class year — across two payment dates. While that’s nice for associates’ bank accounts, it can also act like golden handcuffs keeping them in Biglaw until the last deposit is made.

Corporate Counsel [details](https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/2021/05/24/legal-departments-caught-in-big-law-bonus-battle-crossfire/) how in-house recruiters and Biglaw firms are “slugging it out” over a limited supply of talent. Recruiter John Gilmore points to the bonuses as a clear factor in the associate battle:

“We’re trying to pull a lot of women and minorities out of law firms and bring them in-house. It’s not an easy task,” Gilmore said. “These law firms are doing everything they can to hold onto people. The comp is high. The bonuses are high.”

….

“Before, we only had to worry about the bonus that was paid once a year. Now, they’re paying bonuses three times a year. It’s just a way of keeping a hook in these lawyers to stick around,” Gilmore said. “The good news for them is that it’s working.”

He added, “It’s not that we can’t close deals. But it’s taking a lot more at-bats to get it done.”

As we’ve [noted in the past](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/the-biglaw-lateral-market-is-fire-right-now/), Biglaw is well aware how valuable associates are right now. And, yes, they are using the bonuses to keep them at the firm:

Bill Malley, firmwide managing partner at Perkins Coie’s Washington, D.C. office, explained in a written statement that the beefed-up bonuses “reflect our commitment to recruiting and retaining top talent to provide the highest quality legal work and client service.

“Our record profitability in 2020, along with a strong first quarter and the firm’s consistent conservative financial management have positioned us to provide these compensation and bonus enhancements,” he added.

The biggest takeaway is, of course, that associates have a lot of options right now. So use that information to make your career work for you.

Spooky season is upon us, and you know what that means: Above the Law’s annual Halloween costume contest will soon be here.

For more than a decade, the ATL editors have solicited legally themed costumes from our readers, and we’re continually impressed with how creative lawyers and law students can be when when it comes to bringing the law to life.

As a little reminder, here are some of the very best winning looks from past years of the contest: [Assault and Battery](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/11/legally-themed-halloween-costume-contest/2/) (2010), [Grandfather Clause](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/11/2011-legally-themed-halloween-costume-contest-winner/) (2011), [Original Intent](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/11/legally-themed-halloween-costume-contest-winner/) (2012), the [Donald J.

# Another Am Law 100 Firm Hands Out Bonuses, Walks Back Salary Cuts
## Bonuses, post-COVID austerity measures, is the new Biglaw trend.

No sooner did Above the Law hear about the first Biglaw firm that cut salaries as part of COVID-19 austerity measures making it up to associates through bonuses, that we have another firm getting on the bonus bandwagon. This time it is Baker Botts, a firm that placed 58th on the latest Am Law 100 ranking, that is seeing a financial uptick.

After previously announcing [a plan of “collective sacrifice” t](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/baker-botts-cuts/)o get through the global health crisis, Baker Botts has changed course. The salary cuts — 20 to 30 percent based on salary level for counsel, 20 percent for associates, and 0 to 20 percent based on salary level for staff — will be reduced by 50 percent. So, at the associate level, those cuts are now just 10 percent.

Plus, the firm is making good on its promise to award interim bonuses for exceptional performance of non-partner timekeepers. As managing partner John Martin said in a firmwide email:

As I mentioned in my April announcement, we will be awarding interim bonuses to non-partner timekeepers who have made exceptional contributions over the past months. Bonus eligibility will be determined based on a number of factors, including utilization and exemplary client service, for the May 1 – July 31 period, as recorded in adherence with the Firm’s time entry policy and deadlines.

Over 200 Baker Botts employees are expected to take home these bonuses, and Martin said this isn’t the end of the bonuses:

We will look to award bonuses later in the year to supporting staff who have demonstrated extraordinary dedication and provided exceptional support across the Firm, to enable us to operate so effectively in this remote environment.

# Progress For Women In The Legal Profession Is Moving At A Glacial Pace

It’s Women’s History Month. Is there much to celebrate? Apparently only incrementalism is going to move the parity needle, not that we wouldn’t like it to be way faster, but that’s how our profession seems to work, like it or not.

Just one example: out of all the Fortune 500 companies, [only 43 general counsels](https://mcca.com/mcca-article/women-gc-fortune-500/) (or whatever name you choose to use) are women. By my calculation, that represents less than 10%. I don’t think that it is a stellar statistic almost halfway through the third decade of the 21st century. Anyone disagree? I thought not.

Everyone agrees that there is still much work for women to do, but I am tired of the same old platitudes about what to do and how to do it. All you have to do is read any recent survey of how hard it is for women to succeed at the top, whether it’s a law firm or corporate law department. Granted that the numbers are way better than 20, even 10 years ago, but we are not there yet, despite concerted efforts. Perhaps if men could bear children and then be the sandwiches between child care and elder care, progress for women lawyers could be a lot faster.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The second annual MCCA/Winston & Strawn General Counsel in the Fortune 500 Survey comments: “Leadership skills, visibility, and the lack of emphasis by corporations on hiring women are some of the remaining obstacles.” Calling Captain Obvious!

One suggestion: “Women who want to become GCs should seek out more training, mentoring and education, specifically business training.” But do all women who want to be GCs also need to have MBAs to be considered qualified for GC positions? Let’s think about the debt load (assuming no trust fund babies, parents willing to underwrite all the education, or being really lucky at lottery scratchers.) Four years of college, three years of law school, and then another two for an MBA. Ka-ching!

But wait! There’s more! From the survey: “Another female general counsel who responded to the survey said that the board of directors needed to be more accepting of women as general counsel. And women must work harder to overcome the perception that they are not “technologically savvy.” She recommended that women seek out positions on board of directors and for the media to promote the achievements of women in high tech and dot com companies. Echoing that suggestion, another woman general counsel said in the survey that women in nontraditional roles, such as in manufacturing companies, should seek out more press attention.” As if we don’t already. We do that. You can audition all you want, but you may not get any callbacks. Why not?

Yes, there should be more women on corporate boards, and not just on nonprofit boards. Women need to be on Fortune 500 boards, on the compensation committee, audit committee, and other committees that command the respect and attention of CEOs, other board members, institutional investors, and the like.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
We are still often just window dressing. The California law that mandated a certain  percentage of women on corporate boards headquartered here is now [enmeshed in litigation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/judge-strikes-down-california-law-mandating-women-on-boards-11652724832), testing its constitutionality.

Women rise to the top and then, poof, they leave to pursue “other opportunities” or the equally insincere phrase “to spend more time with their families.” We’ve all read that phrase or had it applied to ourselves.

But it’s not just our profession that diminishes women’s contributions. I’m sure that every woman lawyer knows at least one woman in another field, just as talented and brilliant as her male counterparts, who has been screwed over professionally. No surprise there.

It happens in business, academia, medicine, science, architecture, any field in which the presence of women, just as smart and capable, has grown. A new book, “[The Exceptions: Nancy Hopkins, MIT and the Fight for Women in Science](https://www.amazon.com/Exceptions-Nancy-Hopkins-Fight-Science-ebook/dp/B0B3Y7BFW5/ref=sr_1_1?crid=LF8I06O8CPAX&keywords=the+exceptions&qid=1678134854&sprefix=%2Caps%2C168&sr=8-1),” by Kate Zernike, depicts the epic [battle for gender equality at MIT](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/25/books/review/the-exceptions-kate-zernike.html). Sound familiar?

Hopkins was denied lab space, received less grant funding, and was the target of inappropriate sexual behavior. Men tried to appropriate her work. Just like in our profession, especially for those of us who came into the profession 40 or 50 years ago, Hopkins and other women scientists at MIT were marginalized, accused of not working as hard, not being as smart. They suffered a myriad of other slights.

When MIT’s women scientists banded together, the school admitted in 1999 that it had discriminated against its women scientists. What a surprise!

Some things haven’t changed. Women lawyer attrition should concern all of us. We can’t stop pushing forward. “Good enough” is not good enough. We can’t let our guard down. We mustn’t settle. Look at the still dismal numbers of women equity partners in Biglaw, look at the dismal percentage of women general counsels in Fortune 500 companies. Look at women leaving the profession for any number of reasons. I had hoped more than 40 years ago that there would be parity today. Ha!

This may be Women’s History Month but women’s history, past and present, is still replete with the same old crap. There’s no question that women lawyers have progressed, but this old lady lawyer is not at all ready to [sing along with Kool and the Gang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6GZpmi8Z9Q).

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

According to the Thomson Reuters Institute and the Georgetown University Law Center on Ethics and the Legal Profession’s 2022 Report on the State of the Legal Market, how much are profits per equity partner up in 2021 — over 2020 — for the Am Law 100?

# Elon Musk's Attorney Responds To Sanctions Motion Over Messy Deposition
## These actions may not be sanctionable, but nothing about this is helping Musk's case.

Elon Musk trumpeted conspiracy nut Tweets suggesting that a random college grad was a government agent running a false flag operation to, I guess, give neo-Nazis a bad name. Since this false claim managed to throw Ben Brody into the crosshairs of the far-right mob, he’s understandably ticked off that the world’s richest red pill connoisseur blasted it all over his global platform. He’s sued Musk in Texas and Musk sat for a deposition, taken by Brody’s attorney [Mark Bankston](https://fbtrial.com/attorneys/mark-bankston/), that turned out… [very badly for the billionaire](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/elon-musk-didnt-want-his-latest-deposition-released-here-it-is_n_66133d2ce4b0d81853f9a766).

But it went even worse for Musk’s attorney, Quinn Emanuel’s [Alex Spiro](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/spiro-alex/), who [earned a sanctions motion out of the deal](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-elon-musk-about-to-get-quinn-emanuel-sanctioned/). And, perhaps even worse than the risk of sanctions, he came across really bad on the transcript — even before he closed it by asking to seal the transcript seemingly without realizing that he needed to make that motion before Musk dropped a slew of critical admissions.

[Quinn Emanuel filed its response](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/elon-musk-lawyers-respond-to-sanctions-motion/2/) to avoid sanctions late last week. Befitting [Musk’s penchant for “hardcore” litigation](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/elon-musk-takes-time-out-from-failing-to-buy-twitter-to-fail-to-build-his-own-law-firm/), the motion spends time on offense as well as defense, culminating in an oh yeah, well, we think YOU should pay our legal fees cross-motion.

First off, you’re probably wondering what the brief has to say about signing filings despite not being admitted pro hac vice? Well… not much.

…a Texas-admitted attorney appeared on the signature block of the motion to dismiss, filed the motion electronically under his name, and signed the certificate of service….

Not sure even Quinn Emanuel buys that defense, which is probably why the firm filed a motion proposing the court fire up the TARDIS and [just pretend the motion to dismiss had been signed by a Texas attorney all along](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/quinn-emanuel-proposes-using-time-travel-to-avoid-sanctions-motion/). That’s not a motion you make if you’re convinced that using a Texas attorney’s ECF login cured the issue.

The sanctions response, actually signed by Texas-admitted partner John Bash this time, begins by calling out the plaintiff’s team’s brief for lacking the required certification that the parties meet and confer before the filing of the motion. Maybe they [should all go to lunch](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/motion-to-compel-lunch-case/).

Nor could Plaintiff’s attorney reasonably make that representation to the Court. He made no real effort to resolve or narrow the issues. The attorney contacted defense counsel on a Friday afternoon seeking a meet-and-confer about a “sanctions motion” at 10:30 a.m. the following Monday. Delgado Decl. ¶ 3. Defendant’s counsel requested that Plaintiff’s attorney identify the basis for the motion in advance of the conference, but Plaintiff’s attorney did not respond. Id. When asked during the conference why he did not provide advance notice of the grounds for the motion, Plaintiff’s attorney responded that he did not work over weekends. Id. at. ¶ 4. At no point during the meet-and-confer did Plaintiff’s attorney endeavor to find a compromise short of a sanctions motion, such as soliciting answers to written questions that Defendant was instructed not to answer or reopening the deposition. Id. ¶ 2. The meet-and-confer lasted 30 minutes before Plaintiff’s attorney declared it concluded. Id. Within minutes thereafter, Plaintiff’s attorney filed his motion for sanctions, which apparently he had ready to file before the meet-and-confer took place, notwithstanding his statement that he “does not work weekends.” Id. ¶ 4.

So… Bankston did meet and confer? That seems like a problem for the response. Musk’s team claims this meeting wasn’t in good faith because Bankston did not “endeavor to find” certain potential compromises, but pointedly DOES NOT SAY in the text that Quinn Emanuel offered those options only to be rebuffed. It seems as though that would make for a much better response to the sanctions motion.

And they’re throwing shade over a Texas attorney not working on the weekend? I’m sure that’ll go over well with the judge that Bankston already felt would be a favorable audience for a “these big city slicker lawyers need to be stopped” frame.

The fact that Bankston immediately filed the motion afterward isn’t evidence that he misled Quinn about working weekends… it meant he finished the draft motion that would frame the conference before it started like every lawyer ever.

As for defending the deposition without a pro hac admission, Spiro cites precedent allowing out-of-state counsel to defend depositions while their admission is pending. Which makes sense, especially in a case where the attorney has been temporarily admitted in Texas in the past — like Spiro has. Which should have been the entirety of the argument.

Instead…

At no point during the deposition did Plaintiff’s attorney ever object to Mr. Spiro attending the deposition to assert objections on the witness’s behalf on the ground that the Court had not yet ruled upon the pro hac vice motion that Mr. Spiro had filed in January. Although at two points he seemed to wield the pendency of Mr. Spiro’s pro hac vice motion as a kind of playground insult (“you’re not even pro hac in this case”; “you’re not even pro hac admitted,” Ex. K at 7:17, 11:11), Plaintiff’s attorney did not actually object to Mr. Spiro’s attendance.

Wait, what? He did not object except for those times that he said “you’re not even pro hac admitted” on the record? That… sure sounds like he was objecting. Even if it wasn’t a phrased as, “I hereby and forthwith object…” it’s hard to suggest that this motion wasn’t predictable after the plaintiff’s lawyer says that.

But, as our initial post explained, the problem wasn’t so much merely defending the deposition, as it was the string of Texas law shortcomings that Bankston kept putting on the record that local counsel could have either avoided or been equipped to address on the record at the time. The response brief keeps coming back to the idea that Bankston asked questions that exceeded the discovery order, which might be true, but the sanctions argument is that there’s a proper form for objecting to those that a Texas lawyer would know and Spiro not only didn’t allegedly employ that method, but said on the record that he “didn’t care” about the rule.

That still may not be a sanctionable problem. Sanctions are serious and even if there’s an explicit rule breach, there are plenty of arguments why that doesn’t rise to the level of punishing a lawyer — particularly when the proposed punishment involves robbing a client of their chosen counsel. But it’s still a problem for Musk to the extent this alleged behavior is the basis of this spotlight shining directly upon Musk’s disastrous deposition.

Which might be why the sprawling brief’s introduction includes two pages of single-spaced bullet points striving to explain why Musk’s embarrassing testimony wasn’t really all that embarrassing despite absolutely none of this having anything to do with whether or not his lawyer did anything sanctionable.

That might make Musk feel better. Judges… well, they tend to be a less excited when briefing goes off on unrelated tangents. Hopefully this doesn’t blow up in Musk’s face — like, say, his cars or spaceships.

# Care About Biglaw Diversity? Well, Now You Can Bill For It
## Firm puts billable hours where their mouth is.

If a Biglaw firm cares about something then there’ll be a way to bill for it. The billable hour is more than just a way for a firm to collect money owed to them (though obvi, it’s that too) but it’s also a way to track what their employees are actually doing with their time. Billable hours — particularly at firms that have hours requirements for bonuses — assign a clear value to the time and effort that went into a particular task. Now a Biglaw firm is saying diversity is something worthwhile and will be counted in billable hours.

Hogan Lovells [just announced](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/news/hogan-lovells-introduces-diversity-and-inclusion-billable-hour-credit) that approved Diversity & Inclusion activities — up to 50 hours — will be billable and count toward bonus thresholds. And they’ve got a pretty thorough list of what counts toward the credit:

The D&I activities eligible for billable credit:

- Leading or organizing D&I events or diversity network initiatives.
- Recruiting underrepresented professionals to the firm.
- Mentoring or sponsoring underrepresented professionals.
- Participating in allyship and action-oriented D&I programs that extend beyond education.
- Preparing for and participating in client-related D&I activity.
- Additional activities to be approved on a case-by-case basis.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
HoLove’s Global Head of Diversity & Inclusion, [Bendita Cynthia Malakia](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/malakia-bendita-cynthia), explained the firm’s thinking on expanding what’s billable in this manner:

“The rationale behind establishing billable D&I credit is twofold: to ensure our underrepresented colleagues are credited for disproportionately undertaking diversity and inclusion activities, and to incentivize all our people to undertake activities that enhance diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging at the firm.”

And [Susan Bright](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/susan-bright), Global Managing Partner for Diversity & Inclusion and Responsible Business, said:

“The introduction of D&I billable hour credit is part of our global strategy to create and maintain a diverse and inclusive working environment throughout our firm, and at the highest ranks. It also enables us to achieve our global minority and LGBT+ goals, and measure engagement at a substantive level. We recognize that diversity of all kinds creates better teams, and better serves our clients.”

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The move to billable D&I hours is part of a larger diversity effort at the firm. They’ve [previously announced](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/news/hogan-lovells-commits-to-global-diversity-and-inclusion-goals-for-racial-and-ethnic-minority-and-lgbt-partners) concrete goals of 15 percent minority partners by 2025, 4 percent LGBT+ partners by 2025, and 30 percent women partners by 2022. Billable credit is a great way to make sure everyone at the firm is pulling toward these very important goals.

# From Russia -- With Lawyer Sanctions
## What’s most interesting is that lawyers from Jones Day, Morgan Lewis, DLA Piper, Cooley, and other major firms are now forbidden from entering Russia -- for life.

In a little-noticed act, [Russia indefinitely banned over 1,000 U.S. citizens ](https://www.mid.ru/ru/maps/us/1814243/)from entering the country a couple weeks ago. In a big departure from traditional sanctions tit-for-tats, many of them were lawyers.

Why did this happen? And how will it affect the practice of law?

President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris — both JDs — and many members of Congress with law degrees find themselves on this list. But that’s purely political. So must be the inclusion of Sens. Harry Reid and Orrin Hatch, both of whom were lawyers. But also both of whom are no longer actually alive.
What’s more interesting is that lawyers from[ Jones Day,](https://www.jonesday.com/en) [Morgan Lewis,](https://www.morganlewis.com/) [DLA Piper](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/uk/), [Cooley](https://www.cooley.com/), and other major firms are now forbidden from entering Russia — for life.

[Kevin Wolf at Akin Gump](https://www.akingump.com/en/lawyers-advisors/kevin-j-wolf.html) immediately posted on Linked In that he was “[Honored to have been sanctioned by the Russian government!](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6933903001174597632/)” brushing off its implications by telling me “Since I don’t have a dacha and I don’t do work for Russian clients, it has no impact on me personally or professionally.”
Maybe that’s true on a personal level but if lawyers are increasingly in the cross-hairs, that could have seismic effects.
Lawyers often occupy a special place in adversarial global relationships and are treated like diplomats in these types of spats. That is to say, diplomats and lawyers are usually spared sanctioning as recognition that their roles are required to keep international relations functioning. But not in this case.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“There is something new here and there does seem to be a perhaps unprecedented mass sanctioning of lawyers,” [John Bellinger III ](https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/people/b/bellinger-john-b)told me. Something so new that Bellinger, who used to be the State Department’s top lawyer and now heads the Global Law and Public Policy practice at [Arnold and Porter](https://www.arnoldporter.com/en), hadn’t suspected his own inclusion on the list until I pointed it out to him.
But why lawyers and why now? As Bellinger and I discussed, it’s unlikely to have been because someone in the Kremlin said to go after them and more because its the lawyers whose names end up on sanctions orders, regulations, and court cases, and often they are trotted out to publicly justify political actions. So, they are bearing the downside fallout of the clients they represent because their fingerprints are all over controversial actions.
It makes sense that if your “client” is the U.S. government, and Russia and the U.S. are engaged in a tit for tat, that you would be dragged in. But this list goes well beyond that.
For instance,[ Leon Spies,](https://spiespavelich.com/firm-overview/leon-f-spies/) an Iowa City criminal defense lawyer was on the list along with Judge Patrick Grady, who presided over a[ trial that Spies won](https://www.thegazette.com/news/iowa-city-murder-suspect-found-not-guilty/). Spies told me he suspects it was this case, where he was defending an Iowan father whose Russian-born adopted son died due to head trauma, which earned “this dubious distinction,” as he called the travel ban.
Now that’s something very different. That’s a signal to the legal establishment that a foreign country is watching the work they do in private practice and extracting a price for representations it finds offensive.
Many on the list may brush off the sanction as they had no plans for Spring Break in Sochi. But the reality is that these types of lists provide a ready set of individual and firm targets for exploitative attack by cyber operatives working in favor of Russia. As [Gillian Power,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gmpower/) who served for a decade as chief information officer at law firm [Lathrop GPM](https://www.lathropgpm.com/), wrote on social media to one of the sanctioned lawyers [“I do feel for your firm’s information security team](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6933903001174597632/).”
This time it’s Russia, but once the glass is broken on targeting lawyers, other countries could follow suit to perpetuate their prerogatives. That type of pressure could send a chill through the legal system when combined with the fact that lawyers are increasingly in the spotlight for unpopular representations.
For instance,[ I wrote last week](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/the-geopolitics-of-selecting-lawyers/) that a member of Congress was seeking to ban British lawyers from major firms from the U.S. because of the work they had done for Russian oligarchs. And any member of the U.S. legal establishment that has political aspirations is increasingly careful about whom they choose to represent for fear that they wouldn’t achieve Senate confirmation.
This is all not to mention that in-house teams are increasingly scrutinizing the alignment of their counsel with their corporate values. With[ law firm data breaches on the rise](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/two-law-firm-data-breaches-and-new-breach-stats/), I wouldn’t be surprised if corporate legal departments have sharp opinions about their external counsel winding up on lists like these. And, of course, being restricted from Russia could be problematic should a corporation’s interests require their external counsel to access the country.
[David Aufhauser,](https://www.wc.com/Attorneys/David-D-Aufhauser) who served as general counsel at UBS and the U.S. Treasury Department, replied to my questions about landing on the list with a quote from the founder of [Williams and Connelly](https://www.wc.com/), [Edward Bennett Williams](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edward-Bennett-Williams): “Some of the cases you most remember are those that you declined.”
With Russia’s latest move, foreign pressure can be added to the list of factors lawyers may now consider when accepting or declining a case.

# World's Largest Law Firm Closes Two Offices Thanks To COVID
## They're going fully virtual thanks to their successful working from home during the pandemic.

The coronavirus crisis has driven law firms of all sizes to call into question the way they do business. After working remotely for months thanks to global quarantines, law firms have learned that they can do more with less — less office space, that is — and now the largest law firm in the world is leaning into the changing times by closing some of its offices for good.

Dentons, the Biglaw behemoth with nearly 10,000 lawyers, has decided to shut down two of its UK offices, allowing all employees there to permanently work from home, with the option to travel to other “nearby” offices (i.e., at least two hours away by train) to work if they choose. The offices subject to closure are located in Watford and Aberdeen, and between the two, 66 people will now be able to work remotely.

Lisa Sewell, Dentons managing director for the U.K., Ireland and Middle East, said in a statement: “The success of remote working during lockdown has made us really stop and think about how we can learn from this new way of working to accelerate the physical and behavioral changes that form part of our strategy to build the law firm of the future.

“In that way, the lockdown has forced the behavioral shifts that are the basis of any real change of this type, so we want to use this to ensure we don’t just assume we will return to the way we used to work post lockdown. It’s an exciting shift for us, our people and for how we will be able to serve our clients in different ways in the future.”

Dentons has no plans to close its four other UK offices in London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Milton Keynes, but when its London lease is up in 2025, the firm may “re-define the volume and kind of space it now needs in this new dynamic, whether that be in a new premises or through an overhaul of its current premises.”

Office closures in favor of remote work structures may become a trend in the legal profession thanks to the success that we’ve seen as the pandemic has traveled its way across the globe.

# Associate Attrition In Biglaw Was Quite High In 2022
## Changing geographic locations was a big prompt for associates to leave their firms.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

The very high levels of both associate hiring and attrition, particularly in the first half of 2022, show significantly elevated and ongoing associate mobility, but with increasing dispersion based on location and practice area…and troublingly persistent differences for associates of color, which should be a pressing concern for the profession.

— NALP Foundation President & CEO Fiona Trevelyan Hornblower, in comments given on the Foundation’s newest annual [Update on Associate Attrition](https://www.law360.com/legalindustry/articles/1598354/associate-attrition-rate-down-in-22-but-numbers-still-high), which found that the overall associate attrition rate for 2022 was 20% (down from 2021’s 26%). Attrition was higher among associates of color, at 26%. Geographic relocation was cited as one of the top reasons associates elected to leave their firms for the first time since NALP has been tracking this information.

I hold the law firm of [Ropes & Gray](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/ropes-gray-llp/) in very high esteem — and I’m not alone. The firm routinely appears at or near the top of major law firm rankings, including the [American Lawyer A-List](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/what-firms-are-atop-the-a-list-2016/), the Vault and Law360 [diversity rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/the-best-law-firms-for-diversity-2017/), and Vault’s list of the [best law firms to work for](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/the-best-law-firms-to-work-for-biglaw-quality-of-life-rankings/).

Another plus of working at Ropes & Gray: if your career at the firm is long and successful enough, you could end up owning some pretty fabulous real estate. Last Sunday, the New York Times [profiled](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/realestate/a-co-op-overlooking-central-park-for-11-75-million.html?_r=0) the apartment at 1150 Fifth Avenue that was once the home of noted British journalist and social commentator Alistair Cooke — before it got acquired by a Ropes partner who took it to a new level of luxury:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Mr. Cooke and his wife, were they still around (Ms. White died in 2011), likely wouldn’t recognize the place today, except for the stunning views of the park and reservoir from the living room and most of the bedrooms. The current owners, Othon and Kathy Prounis, bought the simplex, No. 15A, from the sponsor in 2006 for $4.35 million, and commenced a top-to-bottom overhaul that took nearly two years, modernizing and reconfiguring the entire space.

The reimagined apartment, at East 96th Street, was recently refurbished and refreshed with new millwork, lighting and kitchen appliances, and is now about to return to the market. The asking price is $11.75 million, according to Randall Gianopulos, the agent at Sotheby’s International Realty who is listing the property. Monthly maintenance is $7,467.

The Prounises, who have two daughters, one of whom is in college, say they are looking for a home closer to Midtown, where Mr. Prounis works as a corporate lawyer.


Othon A. Prounis

To be more specific, at Ropes & Gray — where Othon Prounis [practices in the corporate department](https://www.ropesgray.com/biographies/p/othon-a-prounis.aspx) and serves on the policy committee, the firm’s managing body. Prounis graduated from Columbia College in 1983 and Columbia Law School in 1986. He [previously worked](https://www.ropesgray.com/biographies/p/othon-a-prounis.aspx) at the distinguished boutique of Reboul MacMurray, which Ropes [absorbed into its New York office](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20030501005812/en/Ropes-Gray-Reboul-MacMurray-Hewitt-Maynard-Join) in 2003.

Now, $12 million is not a small asking price, and the Manhattan real estate market is cooling, especially in the segment north of $10 million. But this co-op apartment — with almost 2,500 square feet of living space, incredible Central Park views, and high ceilings — is a very impressive property.

HBR Consulting’s roots in analyzing and advising law firms stretch back to the disco era, so when you get a chance to sit under the learning tree with HBR CEO Nicholas Quil, you take it. Over the course of the interview he graciously granted me, Quil shared his thoughts on overcoming the structural problems of law firms, how the industry can transition through the COVID-19 crisis, thriving in the coming decade, and more.

Ways Law Firms Are Structured To Fail

I’ve often argued in this space that the legal industry suffers from a lack of entrepreneurial thinking. When I asked Quil about that concept, he was quick to defend us. “Lawyers do have, I think, pretty entrepreneurial minds, pretty creative minds. It’s just how you lead an organization and create a culture that is aligned to addressing those that I think is challenging.”

In Quil’s view, what law firms really suffer from in comparison with other market sectors is a lack of incentive to reinvest the firm’s profits back into growing the business. He chalks this up to some basic structural impediments inherent in most firms.

First, lawyers and legal staff command a lot of salary. Quil sees firms as engaged in a “war for talent” that generally ensures those salaries keep creeping higher every year. Individual attorneys have little incentive to cut their own salaries for the benefit of the larger entity. Firms that try to make those cuts may see their best talents and biggest clients walk out the door to another firm that will keep that comp high. All that money spent on payroll leaves little for structural improvements.

All of this is exacerbated by the dominant law firm financial model, where the partnership cashes out at year’s end. Since there’s no inherent mechanism for retaining earnings and building up a war chest, many firms struggle to even think about investing long-term in the firm’s growth, much less systematically build out their infrastructure over a series of years.

This all means that law firm leaders hoping to push for reinvestment in the firm itself don’t have many sticks, and so they need to get creative on using carrots. “I think the challenge for a law firm leader is how do you shape a culture, how do you create a vision and a consistency in communication and alignment, that brings people together on the journey of what you’re trying to do in growing your law firm.” It takes conscious effort and buy-in from the partnership to grow an entity, but the firms that can pull it off will be far better off to grow and expand than those that simply ride their current momentum and drain the coffers every year.

Quil On COVID-19

Most of the issues being raised by the COVID-19 crisis are, in Quil’s view, nothing new. “The pandemic has just accelerated some known issues or opportunities that have persisted for a long time.”

That said, the opportunity for change is real. The shared burdens and tragedies of this crisis are creating bonds and culture that otherwise wouldn’t likely exist among law firm members. For example, whereas most law firm leaders would traditionally communicate with their firms from a podium wearing full business formal, the shift to more casual, informal Zoom meetings (with kids and pets occasionally breaking into frame) allows those same leaders to come to their teams from “a much more authentic place.”

Quil also senses that many leaders in the industry are seeing COVID-19 as not just a crisis, but an opportunity. “We’re starting to see a shift toward asking ‘How do we make some strategic transformational bets in this period of time?’ And I think people who acknowledge that you can make tough decisions but implement them compassionately given what’s going on in the world around us, that can be an exponential differentiator versus a mindset of, ‘Let us get through this period, and then we’ll tackle all these things on the other side.’”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As for how to handle those risks, Quil sees financial discipline as key. “Not having a real enough assessment of where we are in this journey” is the biggest mistake Quil sees firms making right now. “Firms right now are in an interesting spot [compared to] the projections that they modeled in spring; they fared better than those. Not as good as the original plan, but I think generally speaking firms are in a better spot than they anticipated.” Quil continued, “A lot can happen in the last three to four months of the year. You can’t overestimate the importance of continuing to have strong financial discipline.” Rather than simply distributing unexpected cash to the partners, Quil suggested that investing in infrastructure or bringing aboard new talent are likely stronger long-term plays to keep firms primed to compete and grow.

Lean Into Who You Are

Quil added that he sees many firms as suffering from a lack of internal identity. “There’s probably not enough true reflection across the industry of what business or what segment of the market we are in as a law firm, and doubling down on what makes [a firm] unique. I think there are firms who are doing that, and I think they are excelling. They’re probably less impacted by competition and price sensitivity to their clients because their clients value them for who they are; they’re not trying to be all things to all people.”

Quil advises firm leaders to spend this time figuring out who they are as a firm and using that knowledge to double down on their key clients. “What can you do to go engage proactively with a certain segment of your client base to say ‘Here’s some observations around what’s happening in the portfolio of work that we’ve done with you historically, here’s some observations on what’s happening from a regulatory standpoint in the industry, and here’s how we think we should be thinking more proactively with you?’”

Most firms struggle to engage in that kind of self-reflection, whether due to a lack of training in such analysis or the more general pressures of the billable hour model to always be moving on to the next chargeable project. “It’s tough to do that in a law firm environment just given the way information flows as well as the metrics that are measured,” Quil said. Spending that non-billable time on self-examination can be worth it, however, for firms that find ways to unlock new value for their clients. In an ever-more-competitive market, clients appreciate the firms that appreciate their budgets and outcomes and are visibly working on improving both.

Tomorrow’s Firms Today

Lastly, I asked Quil to peer into his crystal ball and tell me what the legal industry looks like in 10 years. Quil said that he sees the current flexibility of the COVID-19 quarantine remaining largely in place, even after a vaccine is found. Firms that continue to offer that flexibility and that tailor their cultures around it, will be best situated to continue waging Quil’s war for talent.

Quil also spoke of the market continuing to segment away from all-in-one firms and more toward specific firms for specific needs. “It’s not a great analogy, but think about the automobile industry. They’re all cars, right? But what’s the purpose of the vehicle you need? Is it a heavy-duty pickup truck? Is it a sedan? An SUV? A sports car?” Quil anticipates the legal service market moving in the same direction, with law firms filling niches depending on the sophistication and cost needs of their clients, with ALSPs and the Big Four nipping at our heels all the way.

The moral of the story for today’s law firm leadership is to focus on understanding what niche their firm fills and expanding into that identity. “The opportunity for law firms is in understanding who you are as a law firm, understanding what makes you unique. It’s not what you believe makes you’re unique but what your clients believe makes you unique and really leaning into that. Don’t get distracted with a homogeneous narrative on what the legal industry is doing. Run your own playbook.”

Game on, Mr. Quil.

“Shri’ve” been waiting on this one. OK, Shriver isn’t really conducive to this game.

In any event, yes, we’re talking about Fried Frank, who announced associate raises as part of today’s wave of firms that likely held out to see if Cravath was going to spice up this raise cycle even more.

Of course, [Cravath opted to merely call the bet on the table](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/cravath-raises/) opening the floodgates of firm announcements.

At this point, everyone knows what the salary scale looks like, but as a refresher, here’s what Fried Frank is offering as of July 1.

Comp Year	Annual Base Pay
2021	$202,500
2020	$205,000
2019	$215,000
2018	$240,000
2017	$275,000
2016	$305,000
2015	$330,000
2014	$350,000
2013	$365,000
2012	$375,000
The firm joins the clutch of employers offering $375K for the class of 2012 and confirms that it will up summer associate pay to match the 2021 scale.

When the news [broke in December](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/judge-kozinski-accused-of-sexual-misconduct/) that Ninth Circuit judge Alex Kozinski was being accused of sexual harassment by several former clerks, it sent shockwaves through the legal community. Though the judge’s… bawdy behavior was [well known](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/more-women-acknowledge-judge-kozinskis-behavior-was-an-open-secret/), the extent of the allegations surprised many lawyers, especially as [more and more](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/more-yes-more-allegations-against-judge-kozinski-reading-them-will-make-you-feel-gross/) women came forward with their stories of working with the noted jurist.

But when a man with[ lifetime tenure ](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/what-will-it-take-to-get-alex-kozinski-off-the-ninth-circuit/)is embroiled in a scandal, dealing with allegations of misconduct can be tricky. The Ninth Circuit identified a complaint pursuant to the Judicial Conduct and Disability Act of 1980, and it was referred to the Second Circuit. It looked, for a moment, as if there’d be an actual investigation into Kozinski’s behavior.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

A mere three days after the complaint against him was sent to the Second Circuit (but notably after [clerks stopped wanting to work with him](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/sources-report-3-kozinski-clerks-are-out/)), Kozinski was out. Now the Second Circuit has closed the case against him, saying, “The Act is concerned with individuals who currently exercise the powers of the office of federal judge.” Which means there’s no statutory authority to continue their inquiry:

In sum, within the space of three days, the Chief Justice transferred the proceeding to the Second Circuit Judicial Council and then-Judge Kozinski resigned, completely relinquishing his office, placing himself outside the parameters of the Act and precluding any inquiry by the Judicial Council. Because the Judicial Council is without statutory authority to do anything more, we must close this matter.

This predicted result was[ exactly what concerned ](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/the-biglaw-partner-that-called-out-judge-kozinski/)former Kozinski clerk and current Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati partner Katherine Ku. She wrote an [op-ed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/pressuring-harassers-to-quit-can-end-up-protecting-them/2018/01/05/0d44aeba-ea5d-11e7-8a6a-80acf0774e64_story.html?utm_term=.d4c7840a6ac6) for the Washington Post detailing her experiences working for the judge (she alleges Kozinski “regularly diminished women and their accomplishments” and even asked her to look at a picture of a nude man with him). She [went on](https://www.law.com/sites/therecorder/2018/01/17/qa-wilson-sonsinis-katherine-ku-talks-about-decision-to-call-out-kozinski/) to warn the profession that retirement may well have been the easy way out for the judge, and without the benefits of a full investigation the extent of Kozinski’s conduct will never really be known. That means if and when the judge tries for a second act in the industry, those decision makers will not have the full information before them:

[I]t appears that Kozinski’s future in the legal profession almost certainly will be decided without the benefit of a robust investigation. At some point, a law school dean may have to weigh whether to place him in a position of trust over budding legal careers. Law firms may need to assess whether he’d be a fair mediator or arbitrator for their clients’ disputes. And the people making those decisions will have to do so without knowing the full scope of his misconduct.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As for the Second Circuit, their hands are pretty much tied, though they do try to refer the matter to… anyone who might have jurisdiction:

Given the seriousness of the conduct alleged, however, the Judicial Council acknowledges the importance of ensuring that governing bodies with clear jurisdiction are aware of the complaint. Accordingly, the Judicial Council requests that the Committee on Judicial Conduct and Disability of the Judicial Conference of the United States forward a copy of this order to any relevant Congressional committees for their information, and that the Secretary of the Judicial Council forward a copy of this order to all other judicial councils.

As of now, there’ll be no formal inquiry into the allegations against Alex Kozinski, so we’re robbed of shining a bright light onto the misconduct that allegedly went on in his chambers. That’s probably a bad thing for the entirety of the profession.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump plans to sue all of the ""liars"" who have accused him of sexual assault within the last two weeks when the election is over. As an attorney representing one of Trump's accusers noted, a lawsuit would provide a ""field day"" to depose him under oath.

Will Judge Merrick Garland be confirmed to SCOTUS?

# Biglaw Firm Raises Salaries -- But Don't Get Too Excited
## The firm still employs the dreaded block box for everyone but first-year associates.

Listen, at the end of the day, any raise is better than no raise. And while associates may get pangs of jealousy when they hear about the $205,000 pay day for their peers, there’s still a place for Biglaw firms that don’t live up to the big raises going around.

Snell & Wilmer, a firm with $283,500,000 in gross revenue last year making it 115th on the AmLaw 200, announced raises this week. But they’re not quite as generous as other Biglaw firms are handing out. Announced during an associate town hall, salary raises will vary by location. According to tipsters at the firm, first-year associates will be on the following scale, effective July 4th:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

LA/OC/SD/DC: $190k
Denver/PHX/SLC: $150k
LV/Portland: $145k
Reno/Tucson: $135k

As for everyone besides first-year associates, well that’s a black box.

Firm chair Matt Feeney said during the town hall that practice group leaders would call associates to communicate their new salary. And the new salary increases will NOT be uniform across class years, meaning some variance (either up or down) in the raises.

While this isn’t the $205,000 scale that has emerged a the new standard, insiders seem happy the firm is responding to the market at all:

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Another year is over and a new one will begin.

Is your law firm [creating a clear value proposition](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/5-takeaways-from-mckinseys-diversity-matters-report-for-the-legal-profession/) for having a diverse and inclusive culture and setting a few clear targets that balance complexity with cohesiveness? Will you take the time to define the roll-out strategy for your diversity initiatives, launch one to two highly visible flagship projects at the beginning of the year — and monitor them rigorously?

So now we are approaching Christmas.

I [hope you have fun](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/during-final-exams-law-students-should-heed-the-words-of-legendary-basketball-coach-jim-valvano/) and do your best to stay in touch with the near and dear ones and [remember](https://twitter.com/RenweiChung/status/778337402955849733) the old and the young.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

I hope y’all have a [great holiday season](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/for-giving-families-hope-during-the-holidays-brittany-byrd-is-my-inspirational-attorney-of-the-year/) and a Happy New Year. I hope it’s a good one, but I do have some fears.

Minorities in the legal profession have increased by [less than 1% ](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/minorities-in-the-legal-profession-have-increased-by-less-than-one-percent-since-2000/)since 2000. And diversity in our profession has [flatlined](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/diversity-in-the-legal-profession-has-flatlined-since-the-great-recession-who-is-to-blame/?rf=1) since the Great Recession.

In 2009, Black/African-American lawyers represented 1.71% of law firm partners. Today, Black/African-American lawyers represent 1.81% of partners. Currently, Asian-Americans and Hispanics make up 3.13% and 2.31% of partners, respectively. Both groups have increased by less than 1% since 2009.

Without significant changes, diversity in the legal industry will remain [on life support](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/without-significant-changes-diversity-in-the-legal-profession-will-remain-on-life-support/?rf=1).

Last December, many attorneys and law firms made New Year’s resolutions to improve themselves and their organizations’ cultures. Were you able to keep yours? Was your law firm able to [raise the floor](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/how-attorneys-and-law-firms-can-raise-the-floor-for-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-in-2017/?rf=1) this year for diversity, equity, and inclusion?

If so, great. If not, what do you plan on doing differently? Another year has passed, do you know if your firm’s diversity initiatives are actually [helping or hurting](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/another-year-has-passed-are-your-firms-diversity-initiatives-helping-or-hurting/)?

If you have found success in your D&I initiatives this year, what is working for you? For everybody else, what will you and your organization do differently in 2018 to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in your workplace?

If your law firm is working on new and disruptive diversity programs and initiatives, please let us know. We’d love to hear from you!

# Top Biglaw Firm Offers Signing Bonuses To Summer Associates

Have you ever heard of a summer associate receiving a signing bonus for accepting an offer? What about a first-year summer associate receiving a signing bonus for accepting an offer to return to the firm? After a brief discussion between all of the editors here at the Above the Law office, we couldn’t recall offhand the last time a Biglaw firm had engaged in this practice — but that all ends today.

Which Biglaw firm would be so bold as to do something that could very well be considered revolutionary for summer associates in 2017?

We’ve received reliable intel that Andrews Kurth has offered a $3,500 bonus to their outgoing 1L summer associates if they accept their offers to return to the firm for their 2L summers within two weeks. Here’s the way the firm framed the offer that rising second-year law students would be foolish to refuse:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Should you accept the return clerkship offer by Wednesday, August 16, 2017 you will receive a one-time $3,500 bonus. The bonus will be paid in two installments of $1,750.00; the first installment being paid upon acceptance and the second installment will be paid on your first day of the 2018 Summer Clerkship. If you choose not to take advantage of the early acceptance option, we follow the standard NALP guidelines regarding the deadline for acceptance of a return summer offer.

Andrews Kurth, which [adopted the $180K Cravath pay scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/a-top-texas-firm-matches-in-all-u-s-offices/) last summer, is really spreading the wealth, because these signing bonus offers were made on a firmwide basis. According to one of our sources, the firm has understandably received a “great reception” from the 1Ls. Congratulations!

We’ve reached out to Andrews Kurth for comment on this progressive move. If and when we hear from them, we will be sure to update this story.

Have any other Biglaw firms offered signing bonuses to their summer associates upon acceptance of their offices? Please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Summer%20Associate%20Signing%20Bonuses) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Summer Associate Signing Bonuses”), or text us (646-820-8477) if you know of any other firm that deserves recognition for doing this in recent years.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

We’re not seeing the peaks we saw in 2021, which were exciting but we knew they weren’t sustainable. We’re not seeing the valleys we saw in 2022 and 2023, which we knew were temporary, but were disconcerting. That pendulum is hopefully returning to middle ground.

— Bill Josten, strategic content manager for Thomson Reuters, in comments noted by the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/02/26/has-big-law-finally-returned-to-a-point-of-normalcy/) on the economic path that may lie ahead for Biglaw in 2024.

# The Biglaw Firms Rolling Out Good News, For Now

It’s Monday, and yup, it’s still a terrifying time to be alive. There’s just a crap ton of uncertainty right now, both health-wise and financial, and it is hell on everyone’s anxiety.

Some Biglaw firms feel you. And rather than let you linger in the unknown and fall back to opacity, they’re giving associates a heads-up about the firm’s financial condition — and it’s good news.

The first firm Above the Law heard was [reassuring associates was Cahill](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/biglaw-firm-assures-associates-they-will-not-cut-salaries-or-furlough-lawyers/). But since then our tipster network has reached out with even more encouraging tales.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Weil:

Weil told associates in a townhall that layoffs, furloughs, and pay cuts are not on the table. Associates will get a reimbursable tech budget of 250. Most importantly, Weil is still paying its contractors, cafeteria staff, etc. while the offices are closed.

Latham:

Latham (Chicago) has repeatedly reassured us in video calls that leadership is not discussing cuts or layoffs and that we are extremely well positioned.

Quinn:

Quinn has assured (for now) there will be no layoffs, no salary cuts, no furloughs. Tech stipend provided. Very caring and comforting messaging.

Shearman:

Shearman had a firm wide call this morning, saying that we are in good financial standing and that the firm has frozen promotions and raises, but does not plan on any furloughs or salary reductions

Perkins Coie:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Perkins Coie made similar assurances to associates as Cahill Gordon on a call yesterday. The executive committee members on the call touted our strong balance sheet and diverse set of clients and practice groups to help weather this slowdown. Partners are apparently delaying their distributions for now.

Morrison Foerster:

Re big law layoffs: MoFo has also been touting its financial stability to associates. Although the firm isn’t as explicit as Cahill, the messaging is clear: the firm had a huge year last year, a big first quarter, prepaid a bunch of expenses this year last year, and hasn’t touched its line of credit in nearly a decade.

Fried Frank (excerpt from an email from Chairman David Greenwald):



Honestly was so relieved when this email landed in my inbox. He has been so honest and open with us through all this. So grateful.

Vinson & Elkins:

Vinson & Elkins had a conference call with associates Friday morning and made assurances that no layoffs/furloughs or reductions to base pay are contemplated as of now.

Ropes & Gray:

Ropes has, in several ways and at different times, gone out of the way to reassure associates that they should not worry about their jobs or their pay and that the firm is well positioned to weather the storm. The communication from the powers that be, going back to late January when the virus fears started spreading, has been pretty incredible and made associates feel like the firm had a good grasp on the situation. That continues to be the case with regular communication from firm and practice leadership. Ropes also offers a 500 tech stipend every three years to associates and counsel for new home office equipment.

Kramer Levin:

No layoffs/furloughs/paycuts as of now. Healthy financially and well positioned. Existing tech budget (50% reimbursement of up to $2000 cost every three years) still valid. If exhausted, can get 50% reimbursement of up to $400 cost of next three-year period.

Morgan Lewis:

Morgan Lewis also made assurances to associates that no layoffs, furloughs, or pay cuts are expected.
Firm Chair Jami McKeon has said this multiple times (on a video call as well as on a voicemail sent out to all associates). In fact, professional staff just received cost of living raises.

Schulte Roth and Zabel:

Schulte Roth and Zabel has made assurances that they have no plans for layoffs/furloughs of any attorneys. The firm also shared that it had a strong last year is well positioned. $500 tech reimbursement is offered (in addition to existing $1000 tech reimbursement every 2 years). The firm leadership has been very supportive for everyone.

DLA Piper:


Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner:

The firm’s conservative financial footing has paid off. BCLP had an amazing first quarter despite the last two weeks of March and has no debt. To increase cash flow, the firm has cut equity partner draws, but is leaving associate pay alone and has assured everyone that no furloughs, layoffs or salary cuts are being planned for associates or staff. Overall message: we are in a solid position to weather the storm.

UPDATE: Apparently Bryan Cave spoke too soon. [Check out the latest from the firm’s austerity measures.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-50-bclp-salary-cuts/)

# How Merger Mania Affects Your Practice Management Tech
## Don’t bury your head in the sand. Stick some AirPods in instead, and join us for the latest Non-Eventcast.

[](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/legal-tech-adoption-guide-practice-management/)There has been lots and lots of movement within the legal technology space of late. And law practice management software providers are the ones doing most of the moving — whether they are acquiring or being acquired. 

But every single one of those moves is seismic for a not insignificant number of attorneys who are users of the affected software programs.

So, in this episode of the Non-Eventcast, we brought in a fabulous foursome of guests, who helped us cut through all the noise:  [Dov Slansky of Litify](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dovslansky/), [Jim Garrett of Assembly Software,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jameswgarrett) [Colin Li of Paradigm](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colin-li-607527b) and [Igor Selizhuk of Smart Advocate](https://www.linkedin.com/in/igors).

First things first, though, I invite everybody to give their death predictions for Stranger Things, Season 5 (2:41).  

Next, we address all of these acquisitions, what they mean for lawyers, and what attorneys need to do, if anything (7:10). And, of course, in a world in which acquisitions are hot and heavy, we discussed the ins and outs of migrating from one software to another (12:06).

We finished up by trying to untangle the vast array of integration options for law practice management software tools (28:16).

If you’re looking at all the changes happening in legaltech, and just wish you could bury your head in the sand, don’t do that just yet. Stick some AirPods in instead, and let us help you stabilize.

And while you’re here, feel free to check out our [Practice Management Buyer’s Guide](https://bit.ly/3RvPora) to ensure you have the best possible system in place.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs.

[](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/the-legal-tech-non-event/law-practice-management-software-by-practice-area/)Over the course of the last several years, law firms have been buying in to case management software like never before. 

Modern attorneys seek further organization, buttressed by processes, and law practice management software delivers the goods.

So, in this episode of the Non-Eventcast podcast, we brought in two experts in the space, Joyce Brafford of Cosmolex and Bob Culliton of ZenCase. Here, they provide a deeper dive into what case management software has to offer.

First up, the group talks about the most annoying Christmas present requests from children (1:55). Next, Bob and Joyce deliver their favorite law practice management software features (8:37). 

After that, Joyce and Bob offer their thoughts on the importance of data management for law firms, and how case management software can help them to better leverage the data they do capture (10:47). Lastly, the group ends up waxing poetic on the future of law practice management software (17:32).

If you want to get up to speed on the latest news about law practice management software, this is one podcast you’re going to want to listen to right now.

# Federal Judge Reams Junior Associate Because Biglaw Firm Refused To Send A Partner To Court
## Lesson to Biglaw: don't send an associate to do a partner's job.

This is uncomfortable.

Even though the judge in this case probably had every right to be pissed off at Biglaw powerhouse Kirkland & Ellis — due to a scheduling conflict, the firm sent a junior associate with little client contact to a status conference — ripping into the sacrificial lamb sent to slaughter is cringeworthy. But you cannot look away.

Eastern District of New York Judge [Nicholas Garaufis](https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/content/judge-nicholas-g-garaufis) is the pissed-off jurist, and [Aulden Burcher-DuPont](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=11515) (fka [Thomas Aulden Burcher II](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/fashion/weddings/alden-burcher-ii-and-tyler-dupont.html?_r=0)) the unlucky third-year associate who had the worst day of his professional life. Kirkland’s client is Facebook, accused by 20,000 Israeli plaintiffs of using the social media website’s algorithm to incite and connect terrorists.

The K&E partner on the case got called away to Texas on another matter, and left Burcher-DuPont to attend the status conference in the Facebook case in front of Judge Garaufis.

The judge was not pleased. As reported by the [Daily News](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/brooklyn-judge-unfriends-top-nyc-law-firm-defending-facebook-article-1.2802454):

“You tell your folks back at Kirkland & Ellis that if they think so little of this court that they didn’t send a partner here to talk about this kind of problem which implicates international terrorism and the murder of innocent people in Israel and other places,” Garaufis said. “I think it’s outrageous, irresponsible and insulting.”

He was so infuriated he refused to even engage with a lowly third-year associate:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“I’ve been a lawyer for 41 years and a judge for 16 years and I’m not having this discussion with you,” he said.

That’s one way to make the young associate feel small. Isn’t there a better way to express the ire over the perceived slight than a public reaming of the associate just trying to do his job? But I suppose this judge has a lot of feelings he needs to get off his chest:

“Maybe Kirkland & Ellis can scrounge up a partner who isn’t busy in Texas to come see a lowly judge in the Eastern District of New York,” Garaufis shot back.

Lesson to Biglaw: don’t send an associate to do a partner’s job.

When you’re a Biglaw partner, it’s not too often that you’ve got a celebrity client singing your praises on social media. Then again, it’s not too often that your client is Britney Spears.

[Mathew Rosengart](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/professionals/r/rosengart-mathew-s), the Greenberg Traurig partner who succeeded in freeing the pop star from more than a decade of conservatorship, recently clinched the title of Above the Law’s [2021 Lawyer of the Year](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-partner-who-set-britney-free-is-the-ringleader-for-2021s-lawyer-of-the-year/) for his zealous representation in the closely watched matter. Biglaw’s [“zaddy”](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/the-lawyer-who-freed-britney-spears-has-some-thoughts-on-his-zaddy-status/) is still working with Spears, and she heaped many compliments upon him today after meeting to chat over lunch.

# ChatGPT's First-Ever Rap On Why The Legal Industry Is Not Diverse

“Judge it how you judge it, say we going corporate / Nah, we just corner boys with the corner office /
I’m at the cap table, what the splits is? / Not that cap table, boy, we live this.” — [Jay Z](https://genius.com/26583480)

Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ve no doubt felt the wake from [ChatGPT’s launch](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/), landing, and exploration into our collective minds. In case you’ve been disassociated from society over the past few weeks (I wouldn’t blame you), here is a good [ChatGPT primer ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT)and why it [matters for lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/chatgpt-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters-to-lawyers/).

Naturally, having covered DEI topics in the legal profession for the past eight years, I couldn’t resist asking ChatGPT: “Why is the legal industry not diverse?”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Here was ChatGPT’s response:

“The legal industry, like many others, has historically been[ dominated by white men](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/ball-dont-lie-what-percentage-of-biglaw-partners-are-white/). This has led to a lack of diversity in the field, with limited representation of women, people of color, members of the LGBTQ+ community, and individuals with disabilities. The reasons for this [lack of diversity](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/americans-rank-law-firms-dead-last-in-commitment-to-diversity/) are complex and can be attributed to a number of factors, including:

- Bias in hiring and promotion practices: [Unconscious bias](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/unconscious-bias-remains-silent-deadly-legal-diversity-renwei-chung/) can play a role in the [hiring and promotion processes](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/double-jeopardy-gender-bias-against-women-color-legal-renwei-chung/) within the legal industry, leading to the continued dominance of white men in leadership positions.
- Lack of diversity in law schools: The pool of potential hires for the legal industry is limited by the [lack of diversity in law schools](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/without-significant-changes-diversity-legal-profession-renwei-chung/?articleId=7324506011601817418). This can create a vicious cycle where individuals from underrepresented groups [are not encouraged](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/asian-americans-being-used-wedge-advance-action-agenda-renwei-chung/?trk=seokp-post-image) to pursue careers in law, and as a result, are not represented in the industry.
- Barriers to entry: The high cost of a legal education, as well as the [competitive nature of the field](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/132269516.pdf), can [create barriers to entry](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/diversity-in-the-legal-profession-has-flatlined-since-the-great-recession-who-is-to-blame/?rf=1) for individuals from diverse backgrounds.
- Work-life balance challenges: The demanding nature of the legal profession, combined with a [lack of supportive policies and cultures](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-wag-my-finger-diversity-inclusion-law-firm-partners-renwei-chung/), can make it difficult for individuals from diverse backgrounds, particularly [women](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-women-leave-law-firms-what-anusia-gillespie-hopes-renwei-chung/) and [individuals with disabilities](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/bayou-brief-founder-lamar-white-discusses-disability-louisiana-and-the-law/), to thrive in the field.
To address the lack of diversity in the legal industry, it is important to address these underlying issues through [targeted initiatives](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/differentiating-diversity-goals-from-quotas-legal-profession-chung/), such as [diversity and inclusion training](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/how-the-diversity-movement-is-helping-legal-organizations-leverage-dei-principles-to-unlock-business-excellence/), scholarships for underrepresented groups, and flexible work arrangements. By promoting a more inclusive culture and increasing representation of diverse groups in the field, the legal industry can become more equitable and better serve the needs of [society as a whole](https://footnote4.com/2023/02/09/helen-wan-attorney-and-author-of-the-partner-track-on-bringing-her-biglaw-novel-to-netflix/).”

Of course, I also requested for ChatGPT to respond to my request in a rap. Without further ado, here is its (perhaps first ever?) legal rap:

“Law So Hard”

Verse 1:

Listen up y’all, I got a story to tell

About a field that’s lacking in diversity as well

From Pilot and Above The Law  
The legal industry, where power’s at play

But diversity’s lacking, it’s time for a change today

Chorus:

It’s time to bring diversity to the legal floor

Where everyone’s voice can be heard and more

Race, gender, religion, all should have a voice

Equality’s the key, it’s the right choice

Verse 2:

From partners to associates, it’s still a [white man’s game](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/92-of-biglaw-partners-are-white-is-this-problematic/)

With limited representation, it’s not the same

Women, people of color, struggle to climb the ranks

It’s time to break down these barriers, give them their chance

Chorus:

It’s time to bring diversity to the legal floor

Where everyone’s voice can be heard and more

Race, gender, religion, all should have a voice

Equality’s the key, it’s the right choice

Bridge:

Different perspectives bring new ideas to light

It’s time for the legal field to embrace this sight

Inclusion and diversity, that’s what we need

To make the legal industry, one that truly succeeds

Chorus:

It’s time to bring diversity to the legal floor

Where everyone’s voice can be heard and more

Race, gender, religion, all should have a voice

Equality’s the key, it’s the right choice

Outro:

So let’s come together and make a stand

For diversity in the legal industry, it’s time to take command

No more excuses, no more delays

Equality’s the future, let’s lead the way!

# The Future Of Law: ILTACON 2023's Legal Tech Innovations
## Ready Or Not, Generative AI Is Here.

Last week, I attended ILTACON 2023, and from the very start, it was clear that this is a pivotal time in legal technology. Excitement about the future was palpable as industry leaders presented innovative solutions designed to revolutionize the practice of law. Whether in the exhibit hall, over lunch, or during late-night parties, discussions converged on the incredible potential — and the challenges — of integrating generative AI into legal workflows.

No matter where I went, there were lots of great conversations -= too many to recount. So instead, here’s a round-up of some of my learning, which include newly released or beta technologies along with notable survey insights that provide a glimpse into the future of legal tech.

Ready Or Not, Generative AI Is Here

According to the [LexisNexis Global Legal Generative AI Survey](https://www.lexisnexis.com/pdf/lexisplus/international-legal-generative-ai-report.pdf?) released at ILTACON 2023, 65% of global lawyers identified research as the primary utility for generative AI tools. Drafting documents (56%), analyzing documents (44%), and email writing (35%) followed closely. Notably, 86% of legal professionals are aware of generative AI, but awareness among consumers stands at 57%.



The [Everlaw Ediscovery Innovation Report](https://www.everlaw.com/resources/reports/2023-ediscovery-innovation-report/?trk=public_post_comment-text), also released at the conference, provides a more cautious perspective. A mere 6% of respondents believe the legal industry is prepared for generative AI, with 72% disagreeing or strongly disagreeing that it’s prepared for what will come. Only 21% were undecided. However, a significant 40% are either already using or plan to use generative AI in their practice. The primary concern was accuracy, cited by 46% of respondents.

In other words, a top reservation is fallout from the types of errors generated by current versions of generative AI, which are often referred to as “hallucinations.”

Generative AI (And More) Announcements

Of course, as [LexisNexis](https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/gateway.page) Chief Product Officer Jeff Pfeiffer shared, there’s no such thing as perfection or perfect results, and as one of their customers, a partner in a law firm, told him: “My first-year associate also hallucinates a lot.” In other words, regardless of who — or what — generated a draft of work product, the supervising attorney has an obligation to carefully review it for errors.

During our conversation, Jeff also shared news of a generative AI product that is currently in beta release, Lexis + AI, which is expected to be commercially available at the end of September. It will include the ability to answer legal questions (conversational search), summarize case opinions, and draft documents such as emails, argument clauses, and advisory notes to a client.

I also spoke with Chuck Kellner, strategic discovery advisor at [Everlaw](https://www.everlaw.com/), and he updated me on the generative AI functionality that is in beta and will soon be available in Everlaw AI Assistant. Using it, customers will be able to summarize documents, ask a question when reviewing documents, and obtain writing assistance to, among other things, generate a statement of facts or write counterarguments.

[DISCO](https://www.csdisco.com/) also revealed a noteworthy feature, AI Timelines in [DISCO Case Builder](https://www.csdisco.com/). Katie DeBord, VP of product and strategy, explained how this new tool is designed to autonomously construct timelines from uploaded legal documents, such as formal complaints, review protocols, and internal memos.

I also learned that [LiquidText](https://www.liquidtext.net/), a platform specializing in an incredibly user-friendly interface that provides document analysis, reading, and note-taking capabilities, is strategically aligning with iManage Work, a leading platform for work product management. According to founder and CEO Craig Tashman, this integration combines LiquidText’s capabilities in advanced reading, document analysis, and annotation with iManage’s strengths, which include document and email management, thereby offering a streamlined and seamless workflow.

Lastly, [NetDocuments](https://www.netdocuments.com/) announced the expansion of its AI-equipped app suite in the ndMAX Studio, a resource and application library available to its clientele. These ready-to-deploy apps, designed for users of PatternBuilder MAX, offer efficient solutions for common legal tasks. The new AI features include content summarization (Summarizer), agreement revision (Contract Playbook), and document information extraction (Auto-Profiler), among others.

The Future Is Now

There were so many fantastic announcements and connections made at ILTACON this year. All in all, it was a great conference, and no matter who you talked to, one thing was certain: there was a palpable sense of excitement and optimism this year in the face of major shifts on the horizon. Everywhere you looked, people were talking about generative AI and the promise it holds for revolutionizing the legal profession. It’s an exciting time for legaltech, and I, for one, can’t wait to see what the future holds!

# Facing Mounting Pressure Over Shortchanging Attorneys, Baker McKenzie Doubles Down And Blames Associates
## Morale at Baker McKenzie is sinking like a stone.

Baker McKenzie associates reacted with [shock and outrage](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/associate-bonus-watch-biglaw-firm-retroactively-changes-bonus-rules-associates-left-with-50-to-80-percent-of-expected-bonus/) when the firm retroactively changed its existing bonus policy, jacking up the billable hours requirement without warning and leaving attorneys with bonuses as little as 50 percent of what they’d counted on. Facing mounting pressure over the move, Baker McKenzie scheduled a firmwide call to address the policy.

And told associates to screw themselves.

According to reports of the call’s contents, the firm expanded on its new bonus expectations:

Apparently we need to bill 2,100-2,200 hours, log 100 pro bono hours, and log 300-400 promotional/business development hours and do “excellent work” just to get market bonus. According to those at top, “Baker is not for everyone, if you just want to do the minimum and receive the highest bonus possible.”

This tracks with the rumor that Baker bigwigs have convinced themselves that the elite firms setting the market are requiring 2200 hours of associates to get their full bonus, which isn’t really true. Certainly most elite Biglaw associates are probably billing 2200 hours or more, but there’s a big difference between billing 2200 hours and being required to bill 2200 hours. Baker McKenzie seems to think the reason it’s off a step from the elite is that its associates aren’t properly motivated to grind out hours which is… probably not the reason. Perhaps Baker is coming to grips with the reality that it shouldn’t have rushed to join Cravath’s salary bump cavalcade. Whatever’s wrong, Baker McKenzie is sure it’s the associates’ fault.

This is where the call took a turn for the desperate. Baker McKenzie declared to the assembled firm that they’re turning away lawyers begging to work there, basically daring associates to find a new job if they don’t like their compensation package. This is crazy significant other “you’re lucky to have me” territory. It’s also an argument that proves a bit too much — people wanted to join Baker McKenzie when it was telling the world that it was paying bonuses in line with market expectations. It’ll be shocking if as many young lawyers are still beating down their door three months after this debacle.

Because that’s what Baker McKenzie doesn’t seem to get at all. It’s not really about paying subpar bonuses — plenty of firms off the top-tier pace do that. And it doesn’t really matter that the firm teases some outside possibility of a higher-than-market bonus for associates who move into their office and pump enough Adderall to bill 4000 hours or whatever. The firm lost its credibility with its lawyers and, in short order with the lateral market, when it switched its policy midstream. A 2200-hour billing requirement sucks but it’s something a lawyer can plan around when they have a year ahead of them. Springing it at the last minute evinces a lack of respect for the associates doing the firm’s work and makes you wonder what else the firm might do without warning.

But for now, it’s clear that Baker McKenzie’s leadership has decided that the beatings will continue until morale improves.

# Partners Shouldn't Show Favoritism Toward Associates
## Even if you have favorites, you should try not to show favoritism.

Even though people may say that they don’t have favorites, favoritism is a fact of life for all of us. As one of five boys (I’m a triplet and my older brothers are twins, if you can believe it), I could tell that my late parents liked some of their kids more than others, even if they said they didn’t have favorites. It’s just natural that individuals get along better with certain types of people, and it is hard to avoid having favorites among a group. However, it is important that even if you have favorites, you should try not to show favoritism in a number of circumstances. This applies to law firm partners, and managers at law firms shouldn’t show favoritism toward associates because this can lead to a number of negative outcomes.

Let me say at the onset that partners should absolutely promote and favor associates who are better at performing their jobs. Partners can use a number of objective metrics to assess associates, and partners are justified in favoring associates who are simply better lawyers. However, there are a number of problems with partners favoring associates who have personalities that mesh better with the brass at a shop or are more socially involved with partners and important people at a firm.

I worked at a number of different law firms of all sizes [before I started my own practice around a year ago](http://www.rothmanlawyer.com). During this time, I worked at firms where I was treated better since I was part of the “in crowd” of a firm, and at shops where I definitely did not mesh with firm management. These experiences have taught me how showing favoritism toward associates based on subjective factors can have a number of consequences at a law firm.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
For one, showing favoritism towards associates can have a negative impact on morale. No one wants to feel like they are being treated worse because of factors largely outside of their control. For instance, I once worked at a shop that paid thousands of dollars for some favored associates to attend conferences and trainings across the country. The expenses were purportedly justified so that these attorneys could network and obtain the CLE credits they needed to meet bar requirements.

For a variety of reasons, I was definitely not part of the “in crowd” at this firm. While working at this shop, I asked for permission to have the firm spend a few hundred dollars to attend a whole-day CLE event so that I could complete all of my live CLE credits for the year at once. Despite the fact that the firm had approved thousands of dollars in expenses for others to attend trainings, I was not given permission to spend a fraction of this sum on my request. I never received a good reason for why my request was declined, and since the live CLE classes were only a few hundred dollars, there wasn’t a good reason to reject my request. It was apparent that partners were simply showing favoritism toward some associates over others, and this negatively impacted the way I felt about the firm.

Another reason why partners shouldn’t show favoritism toward associates is because this may open partners up to criticism that they are favoring attorneys based on their gender or other similar reasons. For instance, I once worked at a firm that needed to get associates individually approved by a certain client for attorneys to perform work for that account. There did not appear to be any specific criteria to be approved to do work for this specific client other than being nominated by one partner, since it never seemed like a candidate was rejected by this client. Associates wanted to be approved to do work for this client, since this could increase the amount of matters an associate could be tasked to handle, and this might lead to an associate billing more time and hopefully receiving a higher bonus.

The partner responsible for this account decided to submit the names of all the attorneys he liked to perform work with to the client so that he could work most closely with associates he favored. On a certain level, it makes sense that a partner would want to work with associates she or he likes the most, since partners need to interact with associates they work with a lot more than other associates employed by a firm. However, one of the associates noticed that at a certain time, many of the associates authorized to perform work for this client were men. I’m not entirely sure there was a significant gender disparity among associates who worked on this account, but the partner involved with this client was an old-school type of male lawyer, and it could be perceived that he favored male associates. In any case, no one likes to be excluded, and if the partner made decisions based on objective criteria rather than how much he liked associates, the partner would have never been open to this criticism.

All told, it is difficult to avoid favoritism, whether it be in your family or in the workplace. However, partners should not show favoritism toward associates and should evaluate attorneys based on objective criteria. In this way, partners can help maintain morale at a firm and lower the risk of being accused of favoring attorneys for illicit reasons.

# 4 Leading Litigators Leave Cadwalader For Greenberg Traurig
## The head of this group is a major rainmaker, but not necessarily fun to work for.

We recently reported on a [slowdown in litigation](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/catching-up-with-cadwalader-partner-profits-associate-bonuses-lawyer-departures-and-more/) at [Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/cadwalader/), causing litigation associates to “drop[] like flies.” And they’re not the only ones leaving (some of them involuntarily, or so we hear); partners are heading for the exits as well.

Earlier this week, four CWT litigation partners announced their departure for [Greenberg Traurig](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/greenberg-traurig/). The GT-bound partners are Louis Solomon, Colin Underwood, Michael Lazaroff, and Hal Shaftel. Solomon, a significant rainmaker, is the most prominent of the four; he served as co-chair of Cadwalader’s litigation department, and he will serve as global co-head of the international litigation practice at GT. We understand that they’ll be joined by several associates.

If the names of all four sound familiar, they should; we covered their [move to Cadwalader from Proskauer](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/03/musical-chairs-cadwalader-snags-three-prominent-proskauer-partners/) back in 2010. Some viewed their hiring as a coup for Cadwalader, while others [weren’t sad to see them go](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/03/the-proskauer-to-cadwalader-litigation-defections-another-perspective/) — basically because, in the opinion of some, Lou Solomon can be difficult to work for.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And one of our Cadwalader sources also isn’t a fan, sharing these opinions about Solomon:

Lou Solomon took over litigation a few years ago in a coup d’etat of sorts. [Ed. note: for more on that coup, see this [prior post](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/01/musical-chairs-a-major-move-out-of-cadwalader/2/).] He promised to revitalize the practice group and make it more well respected, a tough challenge given that CWT is overwhelmingly transactional.

But he was a major problem internally re: CWT’s increasingly ambitious diversity agenda. He actively tried to sabotage the CWT’s women sponsorship program (which resulted in three women making partner this past year). Male partners gave him leeway on his anti-diversity views, chalking it up to his orthodox religious identity.

What effect, if any, will Solomon have on diversity at Greenberg Traurig? Time will tell.

This isn’t the firm time GT has nabbed a notable rainmaker with a challenging personality from CWT. Back in 2011, [Dennis Block made the same move](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/09/musical-chairs-greenberg-traurig-snags-a-major-player-from-cadwalader/) (and [remains at Greenberg Traurig today](http://www.gtlaw.com/People/BlockDennisJ), where he serves as senior chairman of the firm’s global corporate M&A practice).

We reached out to both firms for comment yesterday, after noticing the four partners vanished from Cadwalader’s website (although not yet up on Greenberg Traurig’s). CWT confirmed receipt of our inquiry; if we get a response, we will add it to this story as an update.

UPDATE (1:45 p.m.): Here is the Cadwalader statement: “Cadwalader’s strong and diverse litigation practice includes more than 40 partners and counsel and is highly ranked by major legal publications. The firm will continue to invest in building upon this strength. We wish our former partners success in the future.”

GT sent us a copy of their press release about the new partners — who are now up on the firm’s website — and we’ve posted the release on the next page. As it notes, these arrivals are just the latest additions to Greenberg Traurig’s talent stable:

The new team follows on the heels of the firm adding former New York City Mayor [Rudolph W. Giuliani](http://www.gtlaw.com/People/Rudolph-W-Giuliani), a litigation shareholder who leads the firm’s Cybersecurity and Crisis Management Practice; new Co-Chair of the White Collar Criminal Defense Practice, [Marc Mukasey](http://www.gtlaw.com/People/Marc-L-Mukasey); Litigation Shareholder [Robert Frenchman](http://www.gtlaw.com/People/Robert-S-Frenchman); and former Associate Judge of the New York Court of Appeals [Susan Phillips Read](http://www.gtlaw.com/People/Susan-Phillips-Read), who also joined the firm’s New York office in 2016. Greenberg Traurig is the only law firm in New York State with two former New York Court of Appeals judges.

Greenberg Traurig is sticking to its historical practice of growth through the addition of specific lawyers and groups as opposed to growth via merger. As you may have noticed in today’s [Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/morning-docket-03-17-16/), it has decided not to go forward with any merger with London-based Berwin Leighton Paisner.

# Elite Biglaw Firms Are Offering $400K Bonuses To Supreme Court Clerks
## But have any firms decided to offer bonuses that are higher?

Just how much is a former Supreme Court clerk worth? How much are Biglaw firms and prestigious boutiques willing to pay to woo associates with supreme intellect and inside insights about how the nation’s highest court operates and how certain justices think? Back in 2018, we [reported](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/400k-is-now-the-official-market-rate-for-supreme-court-clerk-bonuses/) that $400,000 was the prevailing rate for signing bonuses for former Supreme Court clerks. Yes, you read that correctly: former SCOTUS clerks were making almost double their Supreme bosses’ salaries in bonus money just for signing on the dotted line, on top of their base salaries and regular bonuses.

We know of several firms — off hand, those firms are Jones Day, Kirkland & Ellis, Orrick, Paul Weiss, Skadden Arps, Gibson Dunn, and Susman Godfrey — that have offered $400,000 bonuses to their SCOTUS clerk recruits in the past. Two years later and with the economic upheaval of a pandemic to deal with, has anything changed?

According to Michael Scanlon, hiring partner at Gibson Dunn, “the signals that we’ve seen to date indicate that the market remains at a $400,000 bonus level.” In this morning’s Supreme Court Brief, a National Law Journal newsletter, Tony Mauro provided the following evidence about how the $400K bonus has persisted:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
> Kathryn Mizelle, a 2018-2019 clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas who has been nominated to a district court judgeship in Florida, reported in her financial disclosure form that she received $400,000 as a hiring bonus in 2019 from Jones Day, the firm that has harvested dozens of clerks in recent years. For 2020, at least the months up to the filing, her salary at Jones Day was identified as $333,333. [Court filings](https://link.law.com/external/21518646.22931/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY291cnRsaXN0ZW5lci5jb20vcmVjYXAvZ292LnVzY291cnRzLmRjZC4yMTAyMTEvZ292LnVzY291cnRzLmRjZC4yMTAyMTEuMS4wLnBkZj91dG1fc291cmNlPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW5sJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1zdXByZW1lY291cnRicmllZiZ1dG1fY29udGVudD0yMDIwMDkxNiZ1dG1fdGVybT1ubGo/5163247e34b9b0a8048bf4b9Bd9a169ef) in a discrimination suit against Jones Day show a Supreme Court clerk bonus in 2017 was $350,000.

> In August Michael Francisco, said to be the first clerk from the 2019-2020 class to start working at a firm, also [acknowledged](https://link.law.com/external/21518646.22931/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY291cnRsaXN0ZW5lci5jb20vcmVjYXAvZ292LnVzY291cnRzLmRjZC4yMTAyMTEvZ292LnVzY291cnRzLmRjZC4yMTAyMTEuMS4wLnBkZj91dG1fc291cmNlPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW5sJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1zdXByZW1lY291cnRicmllZiZ1dG1fY29udGVudD0yMDIwMDkxNiZ1dG1fdGVybT1ubGo/5163247e34b9b0a8048bf4b9Cd9a169ef) that the market has been steady. “Clerks are getting hired at pretty traditional places, in pretty traditional numbers,” Francisco told NLJ. “I don’t particularly care to be talking about compensation and money, but in the general sense, the market hasn’t changed very much.” Francisco is a partner at McGuireWoods in Washington.

> If there are bonus fluctuations, one reason may be a growing trend among Supreme Court clerks, said Carter Phillips, the Sidley Austin partner and longtime appellate advocate. More and more are working at law firms before they clerk at the Supreme Court, he said. “Those people will feel like ‘lateral’ associates to some law firms and my guess is a lot of firms have a hiring freeze on lateral associates. That might explain some hiring issues.”

While the market seems to have settled at $400K, longtime appellate advocate Carter Phillips of Sidley Austin isn’t exactly thrilled about how high the bonuses have climbed. Phillips was one of the first lawyers to offer signing bonuses for Supreme Court clerks, and back in 1987, the bonus was just $10,000. He says the firm “learned the hard way” that offering an off-market bonus wouldn’t work for SCOTUS clerks, telling Mauro that “no one was willing to accept an offer with the lower bonus.”

Jones Day tends to corner the market on Supreme Court clerks each year, and Phillips made a wry comment about it in light of the expected six-figure bonuses. “Maybe Jones Day will successfully recruit 30 clerks this year. If so, God bless them,” he said. That would be $12,000,000 in signing bonuses alone for a group of new hires who may wind up taking the money and running after just a few years at the firm.

If you know that your firm is paying $400,000 for SCOTUS clerks (or more), [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=SCOTUS%20Clerkship%20Bonuses) (subject line: “SCOTUS Clerkship Bonuses”) or text us (646-820-8477), and we’ll compile a list of every firm that’s paying so generously for supreme talent.

# Biglaw Attorney Takes A Crack At Income Inequality: 'The Poor Are Nothing'
## How about we don't ridicule the poor?

It started out so damn simple. A email went around Magic Circle firm Freshfields, scheduling a BBQ for new attorneys as COVID restrictions are easing up. How nice! The original email contained the line, “In case helpful, a reminder that I am rich in barbecues (there are 2) and so meat will be cooked on one and everything else on the other.” Which is useful information for those on a plant-based diet.

But someone couldn’t leave well enough alone.

An unnamed attorney edited that line to make a “joke” (it isn’t funny, but that was reportedly the intent), and[ Roll on Friday details](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/freshfields-lawyer-criticised-joking-poor-are-nothing) the exchange:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The trainee solicitor, whom RollOnFriday will identify as ‘Wedge’, sent the gag to his second year intake this week.

Another trainee, whom RollOnFriday will call ‘Stack’, had emailed the cohort to arrange a Summer social event. Stack wrote, “In case helpful, I am rich in barbecues”.

Wedge changed Stack’s text so it read simply, “I am rich”, and sent it to the group with the message, ‘Now amended below’.

Stack altered the revised text so that instead it read, “I am rich in colleagues and so poor in nothing”, responding to the group, “And now amended for sake of clarity”.

Wedge then smashed the banterbus into fifth gear and circulated a final version to his intake with the message, “Thanks [Stack] – a final amendment below”, after changing the email so it read, “I am rich and the poor are nothing”.

Stack appears to have surrendered, replying, “Great, thanks [Wedge], will send to [a colleague] now if everyone else on the chain is happy with current drafting”.

The line circulated among ~40 colleagues.

Some seemed to give the… attempt at humor the benefit of the doubt, saying it was “so outrageous that it seems to be self-mocking” and was “poking fun at living in an ivory tower.”

But not everyone approved of the joke. A firm spokesperson [told Legal Cheek](https://www.legalcheek.com/2021/07/exclusive-freshfields-trainee-jokes-to-fellow-rookies-the-poor-are-nothing/) “the comments are not reflective of the firm or its values.” Which, you’d certainly hope not. And the blog from across the pond also reports colleagues aren’t pleased with the unnamed attorney:

The rookie’s tweaks didn’t go down well with some colleagues, with one insider telling us that it was a “shame” they appeared to have chosen to poke fun at people from “working class” and “less privileged” backgrounds.

Which is a powerful reminder for this new lawyer: think before you hit send, especially to such a large group. Not everyone will share your opinions and even things you mean as a joke may not read that way to others, particularly when you’re taking aim at as large a swath of humanity as the “poor.” Also a healthy dose of compassion for people other than yourself goes a long way.

# Nice Litigators Finish First
## Litigators can benefit from a civil and courteous attitude toward adversaries and other with whom they interact.

I have been interested in litigation since I first considered attending law school over a decade ago. The thought of presenting arguments in court and participating in trials really appealed to me, and I knew I wanted to work mainly on litigation matters from the beginning of my legal career. When I first conveyed to a few practicing lawyers that I wanted to be a litigator, they said that I was too nice to be effective at litigation. Indeed, some of my earliest mentors in the legal profession told me that good litigators need to be ruthless and that being civil and empathetic were not good qualities as a litigator. However, in my own experience, nice litigators finish first, and litigators can benefit from a civil and courteous attitude toward adversaries and other with whom they interact.

The main reason why nice litigators succeed more often than rude litigators, is because congenial litigators can build better relationships with adversaries, witnesses, and others involved in the litigation process. The vast majority of lawsuits are resolved through settlement before cases are ever presented to a judge and jury. Settling a case often requires that the attorneys involved in a matter get along with each other. This is especially true if the parties themselves are on bad terms, because then their attorneys can have conversations that may amicably resolve a matter. If the attorneys on a matter do not get along, it is far more likely that mediation may be required or that judicial intervention will be sought, which can be costly. People do not want to settle lawsuits with jerks, and being nice to adversaries can help attorneys achieve the best outcome possible for clients.

In addition, courtesy is an important part of litigation. Attorneys often ask for extensions, courtesy copies, notice about events in a case, and other favors throughout the course of a lawsuit. If a party has been rude to another lawyer, it is far less likely that the other attorney will provide a courtesy that can make it easier to litigate a matter.

Sometimes, courtesies are more important than legal arguments a lawyer might make during a lawsuit. For instance, I once worked on mass torts matters during which it was extremely difficult for defendants to have a case dismissed if a party was named at a deposition. However, over the course of years litigating these cases, defenses attorneys like myself at the time got to know the plaintiffs’ lawyers relatively well, and we built a rapport with many of them. This friendship was important to receiving notices about when and where depositions would occur and which cases would implicate a particular defendant.

One time, I asked a plaintiffs’ lawyer to dismiss one of my clients based on a relatively complicated bankruptcy argument. Although the lawyer could have taken the matter to court, and possibly could have won, the lawyer eventually convinced the client to dismiss my defendant from the case, possibly because of the good relationship I had with the attorney. The litigation bar is smaller than you think, so if you earn a reputation as a courteous lawyer, it might follow you around to other lawsuits in which you may be involved later in your career.

Of course, there are some situations in which it is difficult to be courteous to an adversary in litigation. Sometimes, clients are so upset with adversaries that they refuse to allow you to extend courtesies in litigation. Of course, in these circumstances, lawyers may need to accede to their client’s wishes, but I always try to explain how extending courtesies can impact a case.

One time, I filed a lawsuit on behalf of a client, and the client refused to allow me to extend the time for an adversary to answer the complaint. I explained that we were trying to resolve the matter, and extending the time to answer would give us more time to negotiate before the defendant needed to spend resources on legal fees, which may make them less willing to settle the matter. The client eventually agreed to the extension, and we resolved the matter shortly thereafter. Of course, in other situations, it is more difficult to convince a client to extend courtesies, but it is usually beneficial to explain the value of courtesies in litigation in most cases.

Of course, all litigators need to be prepared to ruthlessly litigate a matter if this is necessary to advance a client’s interests. Indeed, I am not afraid to “let the Jersey out” and pounce on adversaries who act discourteously or underhandedly in litigation. However, it usually pays to escalate matters only after an attorney has been provoked by an uncivil adversary, in order to preserve the moral high ground and give courtesy a chance.

All told, there is an old saying that “you attract more flies with honey than with vinegar,” so I am not sure why so many people think that effective litigators need to be ruthless and discourteous. In my experience, being kind and civil can have a number of benefits for litigators and their clients. Of course, litigators need to be prepared to do battle if provoked by an adversary, but in most instances, nice litigators finish first.

It is just about mid March so you should be expecting everyone and their cousin to be matching the new salary scale very soon. The newest addition to the family is King & Spalding. Here is their scale:

 
Class Year

Year

2022 U.S. Salary Scale

Effective January 1, 2022

7th+

2015+

400,000+

6th

2016

370,000

5th

2017

345,000

4th

2018

2019

250,000

2nd

2020

225,000

1st

2021

Their scale announcement is no surprise, considering that the firm grossed $1,529,418,000 in revenue in 2020. When you make big money, you can afford to dish it out!

We like hearing about salary increases almost as much as you enjoy spending them. As soon as your firm’s memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Salary & Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Get The Knowledge You Need During The 'New Normal' Of Remote Work
## Having access to a robust online library of legal publications can make a real difference, especially during the era of remote work.

[](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2021/02/s_Video_Conference_Call_-_Online_Meeting_-_Videoconference_-_Business_Meeting.jpg)From the way you meet clients to the way you do research, everything’s more virtual in today’s pandemic climate. Practising Law Institute (PLI), known as the industry’s established provider of continuing legal education, also provides authoritative, practical guidance in an online format that makes finding information easy – even if your “office” is in your dining room.

Alexa Robertson, PLI’s Senior Director of Legal Information Services, answers some questions about PLI’s publishing offerings, including PLI PLUS, PLI’s online legal research system.

Many lawyers will know PLI for CLE. How would you describe PLI Press and the PLUS platform to those unfamiliar with this side of your organization?

As a nonprofit learning organization, we’re dedicated to keeping attorneys and professionals at the forefront of knowledge and expertise – this includes not only CLE and other training programs, but publications as well. [PLI PLUS](http://bit.ly/2OyhLcD) is our legal research database. We make all our publications available, so you have the benefit of finding answers in any of our renowned treatises, journals, or program course handbooks and transcripts. Subscribers to PLI PLUS have unlimited access to all PLI publications and course materials.

What makes your offering stand out in the crowded marketplace?

It is often said in legal publishing that “content is king.” For us, that is especially true. Our authors are experienced thought leaders who provide detailed and practical materials.

For example, we’ve been told that while there are other titles on regulation of broker-dealers, only the PLI treatise Broker-Dealer Regulation by Clifford Kirsch has a chapter that walks you through the FINRA registration process. These types of elements underscore the practicality of our titles, which can be guides that help you in your day-to-day practice. You can find these standout insights across our titles, including Manning on Estate Planning, Friedman on Leases, Fragomen on Immigration Fundamentals and Trial Handbook. A PLI treatise is a comprehensive resource.

What makes PLI PLUS especially useful is that it offers the complete library of these resources, so you can easily find the answers you’re looking for. And though it is a robust database covering 25 practice areas, we’re committed to making it as easy to use as possible so our customers can focus on the content, not the platform itself. For example, we call out the legal forms and checklists in our titles and allow you to download them to Word so they are easy to use. And with the “My Preferences” feature, users can customize the database settings to suit their needs.

What changes have you seen as a result of the pandemic?

When the legal world quite abruptly moved to remote work in March, we saw the effects right away; there was no one in their offices to receive our books. We immediately provided PLI PLUS access to print subscribers as a stopgap measure because attorneys and law schools across the country were shifting to remote work and remote learning. Throughout the summer and fall, we saw a large number of our print subscribers opt for electronic access through PLI PLUS. We hear people talk about the “new normal” and an increasing preference for resources that cater to remote work – that is something we will continue to respond to as we look ahead to the post-pandemic world.

How can non-subscribers benefit from PLUS?

Even if you don’t subscribe, we make some content freely available. The [PLI Chronicle](http://bit.ly/3qsDlxc) is our newest publication, aimed at giving voice to the diverse array of professionals working in the legal industry. It features concise articles contributed by legal scholars, practitioners and other experts on a range of timely topics that are practice-specific (such as renewable energy, SEC policy, copyright law, and pro bono advocacy) as well as relevant to the profession (such as negotiation skills, well-being in law firms, and remote work policies).

We also offer the[ Journal](http://bit.ly/3aqRoxT), which is an essential resource for timely, in-depth and authoritative analysis of topics impacting the law and the legal profession. Articles in this publication are more heavily researched, with footnote citations to relevant case laws and statutes, as well as links to interesting articles for further reading.

Looking ahead, what enhancements does PLUS have planned for the coming year?

Our enhancements come directly from customer requests we receive throughout the year – we have an ongoing dialogue with our customers that we find very beneficial. Next year we are focusing on integration between our programs and publication products, in response to our customers’ desire for easy access across all formats. We also plan to modernize the PLUS interface so that it is more in line with the main PLI website. We’re looking forward to working with our customers throughout the year to ensure we’re developing an enhanced site that meets their needs.

[](http://bit.ly/3quHCjK)Practising Law Institute is a nonprofit learning organization dedicated to keeping attorneys and other professionals at the forefront of knowledge and expertise. PLI is chartered by the Regents of the University of the State of New York and was founded in 1933 by Harold P. Seligson. The organization provides the highest quality, accredited, continuing legal and professional education programs in a variety of formats which are delivered by more than 4,000 volunteer faculty including prominent lawyers, judges, investment bankers, accountants, corporate counsel, and U.S. and international government regulators. PLI publishes a comprehensive library of Treatises, Course Handbooks, Answer Books and Journals also available through the PLI PLUS online platform. The essence of PLI’s mission is its commitment to the pro bono community. View PLI’s upcoming live webcasts [here](http://bit.ly/3quHCjK).

# Industry Insights On Am Law Marketing And Business Development

In an increasingly competitive and crowded legal field, law firm business developers and marketers are turning to outside data sources at an accelerated rate to identify new business opportunities, differentiate their firm’s offerings, and drive continued revenue growth. 

But how are they actually using internal and external data sources for business development (BD)? To better understand what law firms are really doing, UniCourt partnered with Baretz+Brunelle’s New Law team, co-led by Brad Blickstein, to conduct research on how Am Law firms are using data to win business from both existing and new clients.

Over a span of three months, Baretz+Brunelle interviewed 17 chief marketing officers (CMOs), chief marketing and business development officers (CMBDOs), and other members of the C-Suite responsible for business development at leading firms to produce the report, Marching Toward Data-Driven Business Development: Industry Insights from Am Law CMOs.

In this article, we’ll review the five key findings from the report, provide some candid insights from our Am Law interviewees, give a preview of The Law Firm Business Development Data Maturity Model, and share how you can learn more.

The Current State of Marketing and Business Development Strategy

Throughout our interviews with BD and marketing leaders at forward-thinking Am Law firms, including Akin Gump, BakerHostetler, Cooley, Paul Weiss, Perkins Coie, and Wilson Sonsini, five key findings crystallized from our research.

Finding #1: Most firms (76%) have a data strategy for business development, but most are not systematized firmwide.

Though we did find that a clear majority of firms have a data strategy in place, we also saw that many firms lacked the people, processes, technology, and/or data needed to enact their data strategies for BD on a systematic, firmwide basis. Further, few marketing and BD teams have developed the infrastructure or automation capabilities needed to fully enact their data strategies, as this was largely seen as “a lofty undertaking,” according to one respondent. 

However, most firms do have dedicated teams tasked with using traditional research tools to manually pull data and use it to respond to attorney or marketing team requests. These teams are either driven by, or collaborate closely with, the leaders of the marketing efforts, such as Luke Ferrandino, Chief Marketing Officer of Paul Weiss, who firmly believes in “the power of numbers [and data] to generate ideas for clients and to inform strategies.”

Finding #2: While the majority of our respondents are using data for business development, no one has fully automated the collection of that data.

One of the defining features underlying our second finding is that even though firms are actively tracking potential business opportunities that might be worth reacting to, such as newly filed litigation or a reported transaction, the current processes they have in place for collecting data often lead to information being received much too late in the sales cycle to be leveraged effectively.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.

This has sparked increased interest from firms to move from manual to automated data collection for their business development and marketing efforts. From the firms we interviewed, 35% reported using completely manual processes for data collection, while the remaining 65% reported having a hybrid mix of manual/automated processes in place. As Iris Jones, Chief Marketing & Client Development Officer of Akerman, shared, “It’s very exciting that our firm leadership is supportive of pursuing new opportunities to automate.” 

Finding #3: Most firms (65%) have built a strategy for identifying qualified leads. But there is little process built around how to manage leads through the sales funnel, with most leads skipping any nurturing phase and going straight into a sales cycle.

The legal industry lags far behind others in terms of having mature processes for lead generation, nurturing, and conversion. Firms are often limited in the use of data for lead identification and primarily use data for warm leads, with their maturity levels ranging significantly from ad hoc to responsive to proactive. This remains a major untapped area for potential gains and competitive advantages for law firms.

On the more sophisticated and proactive end of the spectrum, both Nancy Kostakos, Chief Marketing Officer of Cooley, and Despina Kartson, Chief Marketing Officer of BakerHostetler, highlighted the critical importance of their competitive intelligence teams in supplying key data to their marketing and business development teams. “We have a solid Competitive Intelligence team that has become the primary resource for providing reports to attorneys regarding new leads from both clients and prospects,” said Despina. “The team pulls data from many data sources to identify and assess potential opportunities.”

Finding #4: Most firms (82%) proactively monitor for potential opportunities with current clients, but the process is too slow to be fully effective.

Every one of the firms we interviewed shared that they have lost potential business from current clients because they didn’t learn about the opportunity before it was awarded to a competing firm. The “need for speed” was seen as a core problem by a strong majority of our respondents, with many firms seeking to build better systems to address needs connected to:

- Getting information faster;
- Integrating data into usable information more nimbly;
- Automating alerts to react more quickly; and
- Obtaining more targeted and normalized data to empower faster analysis.
“We leverage data to identify and track practice and industry trends, support lawyers in developing novel business development strategies, and deepen client relationships,” said Amy Shepherd, Chief Marketing & Business Development Officer of Ballard Spahr. “Access to that kind of information helps us be more proactive and is what clients expect.” 

Finding #5: Limited information, speed, and especially lack of collaboration inhibit the ability to proactively turn data into usable insights.

The sheer difficulty of collecting data on a timely basis, normalizing it, and instantly putting clean data into systems remains a pivotal pain point for many firms. To better manage their data quality, most law firm marketing and BD teams are fully controlling data entry. They reported that their attorneys have limited or no access to their experience databases and CRM (client relationship management) systems.

Data culture appears to be a critical distinguishing factor in the ability of firms to proactively leverage data for actionable insights. Kathryn Whitaker, Chief Marketing Officer of Burr Forman, underscored that her firm is “trying to very much instill a culture where data quality is everybody’s job.” Adam Severson, Chief Marketing & Business Development Officer of Baker Donelson, also shared that “Gathering any data that is available to us is a key part of getting smarter about our clients.” From Severson’s vantage point, “As an officer in this firm, if I’m not trying to improve our data practices, then I don’t deserve to be in this chair.”

The Law Firm Business Development Data Maturity Model

In analyzing the results of our research, one important outcome was the recognition that an industry-standard for law firm business development maturity in connection with leveraging data would be a powerful tool to help CMOs understand and level up their firms’ data maturity.

From Baretz+Brunelle’s collective work with many leading law firms over the years and UniCourt’s legal industry experts, we developed The Law Firm Business Development Data Maturity Model, which includes five varying levels of data maturity across five different areas. 

5 Levels of Data Maturity

- Data Blind
- Data Aware
- Data Proficient
- Data Savvy
- Data Driven
5 Areas of Data Maturity

- Data Infrastructure
- Business Readiness
- External Data Usage
- Data Culture
- Team Development
To help Am Law CMOs better understand the findings of the report, UniCourt and Baretz+Brunelle are hosting a webinar on October 3, 2023 from 2-3pm EST, where we’ll be releasing an expanded version of The Law Firm Business Development Data Maturity Model that outlines the pivotal steps firms can take to advance their data maturity and further professionalize their BD and marketing functions.

The webinar will also feature industry insights and strategies for more data-driven business development from Nancy Kostakos, Amy Shepherd, and Brad Blickstein.

# Jones Day's $225,000 Starting Salary For Associates Is Not Actually Above Market
## Don't be wowed by the $225,000.

Black box compensation systems are the worst. They hide behind a bootstraps mentality thumbing their nose at transparency efforts designed to give associates (or potential associates) the information they need to make intelligent decisions about the best place for them to work. But, while they’re thankfully in the minority in Biglaw, they persist. And no Biglaw firm is more committed to the secretive model than Jones Day.

Jones Day [recently announced](https://www.jonesday.com/en/careers/locations/united-states?tab=compensationandbenefits) “above”-market salaries for first-year associates — of $225,000. That’s $10K above the first-year starting salary at Milbank/Davis Polk/Cravath and all the firm’s that’ve followed. Hopeful associates at rival firms may even wonder if this might signal another round of Biglaw raises. But, unfortunately for Jones Day associates (and others hoping for an even bigger raise), that’s not at all what it means.

See, other firms are ahead in overall compensation — by a lot. Jones Day doesn’t do bonuses, so that “above”-market number includes all bonuses given out at other firms. Year-end bonuses typically clock in at $15,000, which already puts market compensation at lock step firms ahead of first-years at Jones Day. Plus last year was a special bonus bonanza (valued at $12,000+ for first-year associates), so the overall comp numbers may dwarf the Jones Day salaries by even more.

Then the issue of the “black box” sets in. With only intel on starting compensation, and with comp individualized after that first year, midlevel and senior associates may find they’re even further behind the market compensation. With only the first-year number out there, they’re hoping that’s the only nugget of intel prospective first-year associates will note, and then once they’re ensconced at the firm is when they’ll notice how far behind their peers they are. But we see you.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important salary updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# 16 Colleges Decide To Share A Law Firm To Cut Costs, But Will Other Schools Follow?

The law school tuition bubble gets the most attention because this is a legal audience and there are also real access to justice issues involved in pricing students out of pursuing public interest and other lower paying roles. But we’ve all gone to college too and the undergraduate tuition bubble is just as real and carries devastating impacts of its own into the world by putting a generation of Americans on the stoop of credit ruin before they even start their first job.

As Paul Campos has pointed out, one of the primary factors driving of tuition increases is [administrative bloat](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/opinion/sunday/the-real-reason-college-tuition-costs-so-much.html). Public institutions may see some drop in government support and many schools may splurge on luxury facilities, but the growth in the non-faculty staff has had the biggest impact in rising tuition since the 1960s.

So go ahead and blame your associate dean of intramural sports. And his or her assistant. And the assistant’s secretary. And the secretary’s intern.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
While there are a number of dubious administrative posts in academia, at least a share of this spike in headcount is an organic results of higher administrative challenges. For example, more legal headaches from litigation risks to new construction deals to dealing with Trump’s immigration shenanigans — remember it was the impact on university students that formed the basis of the Washington AG’s challenge to the Muslim Ban — and in-house legal budgets have gone up as a result.

The 16-member Associated Colleges of the South is looking outside the box to put some brakes on rising legal costs by signing one firm to handle the legal work of all its independent member institutions. Congratulations to [Steptoe & Johnson PLLC](http://www.steptoe-johnson.com) (the West Virginia Steptoe & Johnson, not the [D.C.-Steptoe & Johnson](http://www.steptoe.com) that tried to [ruin a fried chicken restaurant](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/05/will-biglaw-sue-this-restaurant-out-of-existence/)). Per [Inside Higher Ed](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/08/31/unusual-collaboration-16-southern-liberal-arts-colleges-share-law-firm):

Steptoe will offer both preventative educational advice designed to help keep the 16 colleges out of legal trouble, by better navigating the increasingly complex regulatory environment they face, and project-based legal services at a sharply reduced rate on issues such as federal regulatory compliance, academic freedom, domestic and international admissions, and nonprofit governance.

That sounds like a great idea on paper. Can the group get institutional buy-in? Many schools have tight relationships with their existing outside counsel — some of whom may be perennial donors and boosters — and it may be hard to make a clean break. But to the extent the schools can get on board, the common legal challenges they face could yield benefits when the firm doesn’t have to reinvent the wheel after helping a sister institution with an identical problem a few months earlier. The arrangement also contemplates Steptoe being able to share legal insights gained from one matter with other institutions as the group’s head R. Owen Williams put it:

“As soon as any one of our colleges encounters some sort of quagmire or quicksand,” Williams says, “we’re going to be able to save them and then pass the message to the others — ‘here’s the quicksand,’ creating a feedback loop of sorts.”

Hopefully every school is cool with laying everything out there for their fellow ACS members. This is a proposal that’s only as strong as the support it gets from the schools. As Williams put it to Inside Higher Ed when discussing how this unconventional arrangement came to be:

“The point we tried to make with our members is that we have more in common with each other than not, and we need to recognize that we’re competing against others,” Williams says, citing honors colleges at public universities and online providers as examples. “We have to get people over this sense of competitiveness.”

Whether Williams successfully squelched that sense of competitiveness remains to be seen. Let’s check in on the tuition ACS member schools are charging in a couple of years to see how it all worked out.

It’s sure starting to feel like, eventually, COVID-19 austerity measures are coming to all law firms. For the last few weeks, Above the Law has been filled with  news of Biglaw [salary cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/k-l-gates-cuts/), [furloughs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-announces-attorney-layoffs-and-furloughs/), and [layoffs ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/norton-rose-fulbright-lays-off-associates-cuts-salaries-amid-covid-19-upheaval/)as the legal industry struggles to deal with the new economic realities.

The latest firm to announce a new normal is Baker Botts, ranked[ 58th on the latest Am Law 100](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/04/21/the-2020-am-law-100-ranked-by-gross-revenue/#). Just this morning, the firm announced salary cuts that “proceeded under the principle of ‘collective sacrifice.'”

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In a firmwide email ([available in full on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/baker-botts-cuts/2/)), Baker Botts Managing Partner John Martin laid out the specifics of the salary cuts — effective May 1 — that are designed to “avoid layoffs and preserve the income of our most vulnerable employees”:

To do this, our partners have agreed to compensation reductions to absorb the bulk of the financial impact expected from the pandemic. In addition, we have made the difficult but necessary decision to reduce salaries temporarily. Effective May 1, salaries for lawyers and staff will be reduced by the following amounts:

·         Counsel: 20 to 30% (based on salary level)

·         Associates: 20%

·         Staff: 0 to 25% (based on salary level)

Staff making under $70,000 will be spared from the cuts.

The firm did leave open the possibility of interim bonuses for high performers:

In the meantime, the Firm will evaluate and potentially award interim bonuses to exceptional contributors, based on both individual performance and economic and Firm conditions. Associate and counsel eligibility will be determined based on contributions to our clients and Firm, including both utilization and exemplary client service.

When reached for comment, Martin had this to say about the austerity measures:

“The unprecedented financial stress on clients and the global economy due to the pandemic has prompted us to make the difficult but necessary decision to reduce salaries temporarily, with greater reductions at higher levels, to protect our firm, retain our extraordinarily talented team, and preserve the income of our most vulnerable employees.”

Additionally, the new incoming class of associates will be delayed until 2021.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

Today, one Biglaw firm has turned its lunch hour into a winter wonderland, but instead of snow drifts, associates who have been pulling all-nighters are jumping onto mountains of cash.

Schulte Roth & Zabel has announced Cravath-match market bonuses — from the class of 2016 ($15,000 pro-rated) straight through to the class of 2007 ($100,000) — but there’s something very special in store for those who have billed their behinds off. Associates who recorded 2300 eligible hours will receive an extra $10,000, while associates who recorded 2500 eligible hours will receive an additional $10,000 more. Associates who satisfy both thresholds will receive $20,000 total on top of the standard bonuses for their class years.

After the firm [raised base salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/no-really-everyone-in-biglaw-is-raising-associate-salaries/) to the $180,000 scale this summer, associates must be pretty pleased with their holiday bonus bounty. That extra money will come in a single check payable on January 20, 2017. Congratulations to all SRZ associates.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
That’s our take on associate bonuses from Schulte Roth & Zabel. If you’re a lawyer at the firm, what do you think? Feel free to let us know how you feel [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Staff%20Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks for your help.

Don’t forget, if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please enter your email address in the box below. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Cheers to a happy bonus season, everyone!

# Latham Finally Announces Its Bonuses, With Median Bonuses That Beat The Market
## Waiting to get a bonus doesn't seem so bad when the firm is dumping money on associates.

Biglaw is buzzing with excitement over the new market salary scale that was [announced by Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/) just yesterday, but let’s not forget that some firms still haven’t announced their bonuses yet.

Latham & Watkins — a firm that brought in $4,333,763,000 gross revenue in 2020, placing it at No. 2 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — is known for announcing its year-end bonuses in January (and they usually beat the going market rate). Today, the firm finally announced its bonuses, and even though associates had to wait for the cash, they’re probably pretty happy about what’s getting deposited into their bank accounts.

Bonuses at Latham come with a billable requirement of 1900 hours, but they also give extra money for those who are billing above that threshold. And, from the looks of it, Latham associates have been pretty busy. The base bonuses are at market levels, but the median bonuses for every class year beat the market rate. And the top bonuses are way, way over what the market gives out.

The firm circulated the below chart internally, and you can get a sense of just how generous bonuses are at Latham (full memo on the next page):



(It’s worth mentioning that while Latham handed out [special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/latham-special-bonuses-2021/) to its stub year associates in the Class of 2021, year-end bonuses for stub years are nowhere to be found in this memo, and that’s off-market.)

Bonus-eligible associates at the firm will receive their payouts on January 31. Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Best Practices For In-House Professionals Navigating The Corporate Transparency Act
## In-house professionals have a crucial role in ensuring that their organizations navigate the complexities of the CTA effectively.

The Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) has been a significant development for businesses in the United States, especially for in-house legal professionals tasked with ensuring compliance. This legislation aims to enhance transparency and combat financial crimes by requiring certain entities to report beneficial ownership information to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Here are some best practices and insights for in-house professionals to navigate the [CTA effectively](https://meetcta.com/?via=olga):

Understand The Scope And Requirements

First and foremost, in-house professionals must thoroughly understand which entities fall under the CTA’s reporting requirements. This involves identifying if your entity is considered a “reporting company” and, if so, what information needs to be reported. Remember, certain exemptions exist, and it’s crucial to determine if your entity qualifies for any to avoid unnecessary reporting.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Timeline Awareness

Be cognizant of the key deadlines imposed by the CTA. Entities formed before January 1, 2024, have until January 1, 2025, to comply with the initial reporting requirements. For new entities formed or registered in 2024 and onward, specific deadlines apply based on the date of formation or registration. Missing these deadlines could result in penalties, making timeline awareness essential.

Maintain Accurate And Up-to-Date Records

In-house professionals should ensure the accuracy of beneficial ownership information and company details. This includes maintaining up-to-date records of beneficial owners and reporting any changes within the stipulated 30-day period. Accuracy in reporting not only complies with the CTA but also aids in the broader fight against financial crimes.

Leverage Technology

Utilize technological solutions for efficient reporting and management of beneficial ownership information. The FinCEN’s Beneficial Ownership Secure System (BOSS) is the designated electronic platform for CTA reporting. Familiarize yourself with this system and consider implementing internal systems or software that can streamline the collection and reporting of necessary data.

Educate And Train Relevant Personnel

Ensure that your team, especially those involved in the formation, registration, or management of reporting companies, understands the CTA requirements. Training sessions and regular updates on regulatory changes can help keep everyone informed and ensure compliance.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
If you’re dealing with a nonprofit or a new entity awaiting tax-exempt status, plan accordingly. These entities must report beneficial ownership information unless they receive tax-exempt status within 90 days of formation. Monitor the IRS response times and ensure compliance if the tax-exempt status is delayed.

Be Wary Of Scams

With the introduction of new regulatory requirements comes the risk of scams. Ensure that your reports are submitted through the official FinCEN BOSS website and educate your team about the potential for scam websites attempting to collect sensitive information.

Use FinCEN Identifiers Wisely

Consider obtaining a FinCEN identifier for individuals or entities that are repeatedly identified as beneficial owners. This can simplify reporting processes and enhance data security by limiting the amount of personal information that needs to be repeatedly disclosed.

Regularly Review Exemptions And Updates

Keep abreast of any changes to the CTA and its exemptions. Regulatory landscapes are dynamic, and staying informed will help your entity adapt to any new requirements or opportunities to streamline reporting processes.

Foster A Culture Of Compliance

Lastly, foster a culture of compliance and transparency within your organization. This not only includes adhering to the CTA but also embracing the spirit of the legislation, which is to combat illicit financial activities and enhance corporate transparency.

In-house professionals have a crucial role in ensuring that their organizations navigate the complexities of the [CTA effectively](https://meetcta.com/?via=olga). By staying informed, planning, and leveraging technology, you can ensure compliance, avoid penalties, and contribute to the broader fight against financial crimes.

# There Should Be A Set Definition Of Biglaw
## A law firm should possess various characteristics to be described as a Biglaw shop.

Over the past several weeks, I read numerous articles about a well-known law firm that was having some troubles with attorney defections and other issues. People kept describing the firm as a “Biglaw” shop, probably in order to increase the drama that was generated by describing the problems at this law firm. Although this law firm is big, it would never be considered comparable to some of the large, prestigious law firms that most people typically associate with Biglaw. This got me thinking about the definition of Biglaw and if it was possible to establish a set definition for this term.

From my perspective, there are various characteristics that a law firm should have to be described as a “Biglaw” shop. As is illustrative in the term itself, Biglaw shops should be, well, big. Although most attorneys work at smaller shops, there are some shops that have large amounts of lawyers. These bigger law firms naturally make more of a splash in legal circles, and they are worthy of having a distinguished title be ascribed to them.

Of course, “big” is a relative term. Some larger shops might only crack a few hundred attorneys while the largest shops might have several thousand attorneys. In order to be distinguished in the legal industry, I feel that shops need to have at least several hundred attorneys in order to earn the prestige of being a “Biglaw” firm. This is important in order to distinguish Biglaw shops from boutiques that might be prestigious but in a different class from these firms and ensures that Biglaw firms have a substantial influence in the legal industry.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Another factor that distinguishes Biglaw shops from other firms is the amount of money that attorneys earn at a firm. We all know large law firms that pay associates lower salaries that might not even be paid to professionals with far less training than attorneys. Surely, these firms should not be in the same class of law firms as Biglaw shops who are paying associates at or near the Cravath scale, which if memories serves me well, includes a $215,000 starting salary right now.

Some law firms like to enjoy the benefits of being large without passing on the rewards of their size to associates. They should not be able to claim Biglaw status since these firms cannot compare with the prestige and influence of other law firms. As a result, a law firm should pay attorneys at or near the Cravath scale to be classified as a Biglaw shop. Some might think that this classification is too restrictive, but there are dozens of law firms that pay attorneys this amount so a sizable number of shops would still be considered Biglaw.

Biglaw shops should also have a wide geographic scope in order to earn the distinction of being a Biglaw firm. Some large law firms that pay high salaries only operate in one city or in one region of the country. As such, these law firms might not be known too well outside of the limited geographic scope in which they operate. However, more prestigious law firms have offices across the country and across the globe. This helps these shops serve all kinds of clients and leverage their connections in different regions to complete more tasks for clients.

It is difficult to determine how many offices a law firm should have, or how many regions in which a law firm should operate so that they are considered a Biglaw shop. From my perspective, a Biglaw shop should have at least a handful of offices that spread from coast to coast across the United States, and these shops should ideally also have at least a few international offices as well. This gives a Biglaw shop the national and possibly international reach that helps serve clients and gives them the prestige associated with the Biglaw title.

In order to avoid lumping in all large law firms with those bigger shops that meet the above requirements, perhaps commentators can use different terms when describing law firms. Maybe the term Biglaw can be associated with law firms that meet the requirements discussed above, and commentators can use the word Largelaw or another term to describe large law firms that do not satisfy the requirements discussed above. However, in order to be more precise when describing different law firms within the legal profession, legal news outlets and commentators on the legal industry should reserve the Biglaw term for only shops that meet certain requirements.

# Another Major Law Firm Goes Full Big Brother To Enforce Office Attendance Policy
## You'd best get your butt to the office.

The impact of the Covid pandemic can still be seen in Biglaw. The presumption that attorneys at the biggest law firms in the world need to be chained to their physical desks eight days a week is gone — though the billable hours expectations haven’t changed. But navigating the balance of in-office and work-from-home time continues to be a challenge.

At Magic Circle firm Slaughter and May, they’ve settled into a three in-office days requirement, but not everyone is living up to that standard. And though they admit it is only a minority who have shirked this obligation, they’re putting technology to use to make sure EVERYONE is on board.

RollOnFriday [reports](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-slaughter-and-may-clamps-down-office-dodging-solicitors) on an email that was sent out earlier this week by Deborah Finkler, the Magic Circle firm’s Managing Partner:

In an email to the firm on Wednesday, Finkler explained that “While we have all experienced benefits from having some flexibility in our working week, this has to be balanced against the very clear benefits in terms of culture, collaboration and well-being of working together in the office”.

For those reasons the hybrid arrangement is now common to many UK firms, and, said Finkler, “That is why we require everyone” – except trainees and new joiners where the requirement is higher – “to spend a rolling average of at least three full days per week (or the pro rata equivalent) in the office, or at a client, in court etc., and of course more if client or business need requires it”.

But a minority of the firm’s solicitors have decided to swerve the commute, the Pret and IRL collaboration in favour of a stroll to their home office with a garden view. “While most people have been adhering to this requirement; it is clear that some have not”, wrote Finkler.

The email continues, “Gate data (showing when people come into and leave the office) will be shared on a monthly basis with Group heads, Business Services directors and HR managers,” and the firm isn’t afraid to use it, “so you should assume that if you are not in the office (or at a client, in court etc.) in line with the policy, this will be raised with you and you will be asked to comply.”

Given this not-so-veiled threat, my guess is a lot more people will suddenly be complying with the in-office standard.

# Biglaw Firm Decides To Give Office Etiquette Lesson
## So what tips are so urgent and not obvious to professionals working in a shared space they had to be sent to the whole office?

Looks like the folks in the Los Angeles office of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy need a lesson in manners — at least that’s what some at the top think. Yesterday an internal email was sent out from “LA Management” to the whole office advising them of the proper way to behave in the office. A tipster writes:

Seemingly, the office wasn’t working in a “respectful and courteous manner,” so we needed a few reminders of how to “help everyone have a great experience” in the new office space (please see screengrab for details). [Full email is on the next page.] Urging us to adapt to a “new way of working,” because “we have a lot of glass” was one of the most laughable highlights of the memo.

So what tips are so urgent and not obvious to professionals working in a shared space that they had to be sent to the whole office?

Keep noise and distractions to a minimum

Close door if on speaker phone or talking with others
Use headset or handset as an option
Keep cell phones on silent or vibrate
Music or other sounds should not be heard by others in your area

I wonder if this applies to partners who feel the need to scream at underlings at regular intervals? We [know those people](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/the-bullying-in-biglaw-is-off-the-charts-and-managing-partners-are-too-scared-to-stop-it/) are usually above the rules.

I also hope associates ignore the low-music mandate when they’re working late nights. When you’re stuck working into the wee hours of the morning, the faint sounds of music from an office all the way down the hall can be comforting; after all, it’s proof you aren’t the only one wasting your youth in service to Biglaw.

Be tidy and keep work area clean and organized

Do not remove furniture, chairs, plants, etc., from other offices/conference rooms

Unisex Restrooms are used by everyone. Please clean up after yourself so everyone can enjoy a clean restroom

Yes, don’t be slobs. Does this need to be said? How bad do the restrooms at Milbank Los Angeles look? I’d love to see the pictures of the dirty space that necessitated an office-wide email. Or, maybe someone is just overreacting…

So Milbank associates, what’s the deal? Was this email necessary? Are you all a bunch of pigs? Drop us an [email](mailto:kathryn@abovethelaw.com?subject=Your%20Column) and let us know.

It’s about managing people and treating people with respect, and taking your other partners’ and lawyers’ advice in terms of what they want to see and with business development internally. After the merger at Squire, the abundance of increased bureaucracy and the decrease in human interaction among the partners was one of the main reasons I left. It’s still a people business at the end of the day.

— [Douglas Boggs](https://www.manatt.com/Douglas-C-Boggs), son of the late Thomas Hale Boggs Jr. (a name partner of Patton Boggs), offering his [thoughts about law firm management](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/home/id=1202767768185/Doug-Boggs-to-Fill-Void-Left-By-Manatts-Departing-DC-Leader?mcode=1202617074964&curindex=3&slreturn=20160821111707) thanks to his pre- and post-merger experiences at Squire Patton Boggs. Boggs led the Tysons Corner, Virginia, office of Patton Boggs from 2005 to 2012, but left the firm to join Manatt Phelps & Phillips less than a year after Patton Boggs merged with Squire Sanders. Boggs now leads Manatt’s Washington, D.C., office.

# After Being Threatened With Litigation, These Biglaw Firms Are Ready To Fight For Their Diversity Programs
## They're going to the mattresses for diversity.

Biglaw firms are not going to cower in fear when it comes to their diversity fellowships.

Last week, Edward Blum, leader of the American Alliance for Equal Rights, sent letters to Winston & Strawn, Hunton Andrews & Kurth, and Adams and Reese, instructing them to answer questions about their diversity fellowship programs. Specifically, the conservative legal activist asked the firms whether those programs would continue, whether they would use race as a factor in the application process, and what role race would play in their selection process.

Blum gave the firms a deadline of October 13 to respond, holding the [threat of additional lawsuits](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/blum-group-threatens-to-sue-more-biglaw-firms-over-their-diversity-fellowships/) over their heads. “To avoid litigation, the Alliance hopes these law firms will immediately modify their programs to bring them into compliance with our nation’s civil rights laws,” he said. “No student should be treated differently because of their race or ethnicity.” Although Adams and Reese scrapped its program in response, Winston and Hunton aren’t playing along, and have actively refused to respond to Blum’s questions. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/10/16/winston-strawn-hunton-decline-blums-questions-about-diversity-programs/) has the scoop on Winston’s full-throated response in defense of its diversity fellowship:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“We are proud of the program and note that your statement that it ‘excludes certain applicants based on race’ is simply false,” Winston Chicago managing partner Cardelle Spangler told Blum’s lawyer, Thomas McCarthy, of litigation boutique Consovoy McCarthy. “Applicants of all races, ethnicities, socio-economic orientations and all other backgrounds are eligible and encouraged to apply.”

“Note that your implication that the terms “disadvantaged” and “historically underrepresented” necessarily refer to race is baseless,” Spangler added. “Winston & Strawn does not make employment decisions on the basis of race or ethnicity.”

“Our program is appropriate, legal and compliant and it will continue,” the Winston letter added.

Hunton kept its response short and sweet, with its general counsel Greg Walker simply telling Blum that the firm “is not able to answer your questions at this time” and that the firm may update its programs based on “changing legal considerations or otherwise.” Walker concluded by noting that “as those decisions remain in process, the Firm cannot and will not make any pronouncements about the program now.”

Blum’s Alliance has already [filed suit](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/two-biglaw-firms-sued-over-diversity-initiatives/) against Morrison Foerster and Perkins Coie, which both[ revised their diversity fellowships](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/biglaw-caves-morrison-foerster-changes-diversity-fellowship-criteria-following-lawsuit/) to [remove race as a factor](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/perkins-coie-diversity-fellowship/), leading to the lawsuits being dropped.

We suppose we’ll have to wait and see what happens here, but we’re going to go ahead and guess that both firms will be facing lawsuits sometime soon — and they’ll both be ready.

# Willkie Farr Nabs Former White House Lawyer To Lead Crisis Management Practice
## Michael Gottlieb joins Willkie Farr.

A couple years ago, we were pointing to Michael Gottlieb as the vanguard of [a new generation of Boies Schiller leadership](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/on-the-future-of-boies-schiller/). But as the firm moves on to [the next phase in its evolution](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/david-boies-dishes-on-firms-transition-strategy/), it will have to do it without Gottlieb, who has left the firm for Willkie Farr where he’ll pursue his general litigation practice along with his role as a leader of the crisis management practice.

Gottlieb, a former John Paul Stevens clerk, has worked as Special Assistant to President Obama, Associate White House Counsel, and as a staffer on the Senate Judiciary Committee. In private practice, Gottlieb has done it all, representing corporations and foreign governments in matters large and small. Along the way, he picked up a unanimous Supreme Court victory in last Term’s Animal Science case.

But this move got me thinking… what’s a crisis management practice really like?

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
A crisis management practice in Washington may trigger thoughts of Olivia Pope, but in describing the practice, Gottlieb’s job may more fairly be described as a three-dimensional chess player. “Many enterprise-threatening matters are no longer confined to a single courtroom. A large problem occurs that triggers media scrutiny, then Congress may get involved, a regulator may become interested, and inevitably there’s civil litigation…. It’s a multi-dimensional problem and you bring together different strands of legal practice to build a nimble team that’s more forward-looking to the challenges 5 or 6 steps down the road.”

Ultimately, it’s the deep bench of expertise in diverse practice areas that drew Gottlieb to Willkie. With strong experience in areas from private equity to restructuring to white-collar, Willkie offers a lot of talent to join the nimble crisis teams Gottlieb looks to build. With crises cropping up every day in Washington ranging from data breaches to whistleblowers, there are a lot of intersecting and overlapping practices that can be drawn into any given event. The practice sounds like a constant, high-stakes issue spotter requiring as much creativity and foresight as it does legal acumen.

And maybe a little bit of Olivia Pope.

Ciera (Locklair) Breland, an associate in the Indianapolis office of Gordon Rees, has been missing for two weeks and now the FBI has gotten involved in the case. As [reported by](https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/ciera-breland-missing-indiana-mother-lawyer-georiga) Fox 5 Atlanta, Breland has been missing for more than 10 days, and authorities have named her husband, Xavier Breland Jr., a person of interest in her disappearance.

Ciera Breland was reported missing by her husband. He told authorities he last saw her leave their house on February 25th around 10 p.m. — possibly headed to a local CVS — wearing a black top and purple shorts. Temperatures were reportedly in the mid- to upper-20s that night. Family members say she never reached her destination. She also left the house without her cell phones, credit cards, or her infant son.

“For a mom, especially with a young child, to go missing, it causes great concern and obviously, the police department there and us take it very seriously, and we’re doing everything we can to find her,” said Johns Creek Police Lt. Deb Kalish.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Breland, a graduate of Florida State University College of Law and the University of Tennessee, moved to Carmel, Indiana, from Georgia less than a year ago with her husband. They recently visited family in Georgia, and February 20th is the last time her family says they saw her.

Xavier Breland Jr. was arrested last week on an unrelated warrant. Though he is not currently facing any criminal charges in relation to Ciera’s disappearance, he has had other brushes with the law:

[Xavier Breland Jr.] was being held in the Hamilton County jail in Indiana awaiting extradition to Georgia. He was arrested back in June by the Newnan Police Department on charges of aggravated stalking. It was not clear if the current warrant hold was related to the previous charge. A grand jury indicted him on those aggravated stalking charges in December.

This is not the first legal trouble he has been in. Source told FOX 5 News he was had warrants associated with harassing phone calls and violating a family violence order. In 2007, court records indicate he was arrested in Florida and extradited to Indiana on a fugitive warrant.

The firm issued the follow statement:

“Speaking for the entire Gordon Rees Scully Mansukhani family, I can express that we have been deeply concerned about Ciera’s wellbeing over the past week and have been doing our utmost to assist both the local and federal authorities as well as Ciera’s family in determining her whereabouts and helping in any other ways we can. We all pray for Ciera’s safe return and remain at the highest level of vigilance pending resolution of this extremely troubling situation. Anyone with any possible information about Ciera’s whereabouts is urged to contact the authorities immediately.”

Authorities have asked anyone who sees Ciera Breland to call 911 or Corporal Rozier with the Johns Creek Police Department at 678-372-8046, the Carmel Police Department at (317) 571-2580, or the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI (225-5324).

# Partial Settlement In MoFo 'Mommy Track' Lawsuit
## The lawsuit lives on -- at least for the moment -- with two plaintiffs.

The $100 million [gender discrimination](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/mofo-hit-with-100-million-pregnancy-discrimination-lawsuit/) case against Morrison & Foerster has been pared down. As you may recall, a total of [seven plaintiffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/pregnancy-discrimination-lawsuit-against-mofo-spirals-and-gets-yet-another-plaintiff/) have come forward alleging there’s a “mommy track” at the firm that hurt their career advancement after they took maternity leave. Now comes word that five of the seven plaintiffs have reached a settlement with the firm, after a September mediation session.

According to a[ joint case management statement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14UeL5vOhpw7ETzhWS3Jl4oD8Dixka1xL/view) filed with the court on November 27th, the claims of Jane Does 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 against MoFo have been resolved. According to [reporting by Law.com](https://www.law.com/2019/12/02/in-mommy-track-lawsuit-against-mofo-five-jane-doe-plaintiffs-settle/), neither side of the dispute would offer further comment on the particulars of the settlement.

For the remaining plaintiffs, Jane Doe 1, a MoFo associate in a California office, and Jane Doe 6, of counsel in the firm’s New York office, a  new amended complaint is expected soon. According to the joint statement, plaintiffs will file their amended complaint December 10th, where the pseudonyms of the remaining name plaintiffs will be lifted. The filing also indicates “further discovery is necessary to negotiate a resolution, if any, to the claims of Jane Does 1 and 6.” Something we’ll be sure to track closely.

# Practice Areas Most Impacted By COVID-19
## If attorneys have a good sense of the practice areas that are expanding and contracting in the current environment, they can best weather the storm of COVID-19.

As mentioned in previous articles, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has substantially impacted the legal profession. Economic issues have affected the need for legal services, which has forced law firms to reduce headcount, lower salaries, and take other efforts to weather the storm. However, [based on my own experience](http://www.rothmanlawyer.com), some practice areas seem to be expanding in the current environment, and other practice areas are struggling because of COVID-19.

Wills And Estates

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
It might sound macabre, but the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has compelled numerous people to consider wills and estate planning. Indeed, my firm does not focus on wills and related issues, and we usually only handle a few wills a month. However, we received five inquiries for wills over a 48-hour period recently, which is very unusual for our firm. Wills are the classic thing that people put off. No one wants to think about their own demise, and it requires some effort to get the witnesses together to execute a will. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced all of us to think deeply about end-of-life issues, and this is compelling people to seek wills and estate planning advice. Of course, it has been tricky to organize will executions due to social distancing guidelines, but many clients have been approaching lawyers about estate issues due to the present environment.

Litigation

As many people might surmise, litigation is one of the practice areas that has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The traditional wisdom is that litigation is somewhat recession-proof, since economic downturns usually spur the types of disputes that need to be litigated. However, many litigators have substantially less work now due to so many court closures, and numerous court conferences have either been adjourned or are being conducted through remote means. Furthermore, some states have even prohibited most nonessential filings. A few weeks ago, I needed to file some documents by a certain date, but was prevented from doing so because of filing restrictions. I was forced to just email the documents to counsel with the understanding that it would be filed when prohibitions were restricted, and everyone understood the situation. However, the lack of filing capacity has reduced litigation work on all but the most essential matters, and depending on their clients, many litigators are being hit hard because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
A practice area that is expanding (at least in the short term) because of COVID-19 is transactional work. [As mentioned in a prior article](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/how-small-firms-are-dealing-with-covid-19/), many clients are seeking advice on canceling contracts for gatherings that were set to occur in the next several months. Some of these contracts include impossibility or force majeure clauses, and a variety of common law defenses can be used to cancel such agreements even if the explicit terms of a contract don’t relate to the ongoing pandemic. Nevertheless, there are issues about how much deposit money should be paid back that was advanced for these events and whether gatherings can be postponed rather than canceled. Furthermore, a number of tenants and landlords are negotiating agreements to defer or reduce rent for a time because of COVID-19, and this requires careful negotiation by an attorney.

Furthermore, some demand for legal work on completely new deals is occurring despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Some clients understand that they can get huge concessions and very favorable terms due to the crisis, and this is compelling some to pursue completely new deals. Of course, only a focused set of clients who have a strong economic base can pursue such a strategy, but discussing new deals may be desirable to many clients in this environment. Even though transactional work typically suffers during economic downturns because of the lack of business activity, it seems that at least temporarily, many clients have a substantial need for transactional legal work.

Personal Injury

Plaintiffs’ personal injury lawyers have also been negatively impacted by COVID-19. Since many court conferences have been adjourned, and numerous lawsuits are essentially frozen in place, many personal injury cases will not be resolved anytime soon. In addition, many insurance companies have slowed settlement talks, and some may even be delaying payments of settlements that were previously negotiated. This is likely because many companies want to hold onto their money for as long as possible in the current environment. It is also difficult, if not impossible, to put new personal injury cases into suit in many states due to filing prohibitions and other limitations. Since it often takes years for a personal injury cases to settle, plaintiffs’ personal injury lawyers may not only experience a shortfall in the near term due to COVID-19, but may also see income interruptions in the future as well.

Of course, a number of other practice areas are being impacted by COVID-19. For instance, I have heard that matrimonial lawyers are anticipating more business because of the stress involved in the current situation and because spouses are cooped up at home. In addition, the traditional countercyclical practice areas, including bankruptcy law, are expanding because of the current situation. If attorneys have a good sense of the expanding and contracting practice areas in the current environment, they can best weather the storm of COVID-19.

# Deposition Reveals Donald Trump's Less Than Truthful Side
## This deposition is worth a read -- both for it's political value and for the practice pointers.

A very clear and visible side effect of my lawyers’ questioning of Trump is that he [was revealed as] a routine and habitual fabulist.

— [Timothy L. O’Brien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_L._O%27Brien), reporter and author of “Trump Nation: The Art of Being the Donald,” whom Donald Trump sued over claims in the book that Trump’s net worth was significantly smaller than the $5 billion he boasted. Over the course of a two-day deposition in 2007, members of O’Brien’s legal team — which included [Mary Jo White](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/mary-jo-white/) and [Andrew Ceresney](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/andrew-j-ceresney/) — revealed a series of lies, misstatements, and untruths told by Trump. At one point, Trump blamed some of his less than truthful statements on [Meredith McIver](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/trump-campaigns-plagiarism-sacrificial-lamb-opens-up-questions-of-election-law-violations/), the sacrificial lamb who took the fall for Melania Trump’s RNC plagiarism. The [Washington Post’s piece](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/trump-lies/) detailing the best lawyering moments from the deposition is well worth a read, both for it’s political value and for the practice pointers. Trump’s suit against O’Brien was dismissed in 2009.

# Retaining Knowledge During Today’s Great Talent Migration
## In a world that’s on fire, it’s important to have the right partners.

There’s a bit of geopolitically triggered whiplash going on in the market for legal talent. After more than a decade of easy money and fiscal stimulus, the global economy was dealt a COVID-19 curve-ball. As the virus took hold across the world in 2020, governments pumped untold amounts of money into their countries to keep their economies alive amid lockdown after lockdown. Vaccines were developed faster than these bailout packages anticipated and suddenly economic activity rebounded as optimism turned to opportunism, and free money enabled a boom of economic activity.

Professionals who had spent two years at home — with shorter commutes, more time with kids, fewer workday distractions and better coffee — decided they didn’t want to go back to the office. The “Great Resignation” hit law firms as many witnessed a wave of lawyers departing — to other firms, to in-house, to government, and, frankly, to less inflexible and time-intensive jobs. Law firms scrambled to hire top talent — and even some mediocre talent, too — to keep up with demand. They passed on the cost of this through rising bill rates.

That feels like a long time ago, even though it has only been a few months. Too much money in the economy and supply chain shocks have stoked inflation. A war between Russia and Ukraine has compounded issues and carved a major country out of the global economy.

The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank is aggressively raising interest rates to cool off the economy. Now there are arguments in the U.K. parliament about whether a technical recession (which is underway) is actually a recession. IPOs are being abandoned and merger and acquisition activity is slowing down.

Law firms that had bulked up on expensive talent are letting go of employees. Some are doing it through real layoffs, others are doing it through layoffs disguised as performance-related firings.

Corporate legal departments bear the brunt of this downside. While law firms have been moving to hire and fire quickly, corporate teams have moved a bit slower. Their staffs have been flat out, under immense pressure, navigating their enterprise around the unprecedented impacts that the pandemic, as well as ongoing geopolitical and economic activity, are exerting on their businesses.

As these lawyers left or changed law firms, in-house legal departments had to also contend with knowledge and intellectual capital leakage that has and will occur from their enterprise and across their respective legal services supply chains. In-house teams have become increasingly reliant on external legal specialist advice amid such turmoil because they can’t hire fast enough and because the world is changing. In a volatile macroeconomy such as today’s, national, regional and global regulatory frameworks across all industries evolve in response to prevailing conditions. This presents real challenges for corporate legal departments as they seek to fulfill their duty to guide enterprises through the ever-growing legal and commercial complexities.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
At the same time, law firms have been unsteady partners. Recent data from the Thomson Reuters’ [2022 State of Corporate Law Departments](https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/insights/reports/2022-state-of-corporate-law-departments-report/form) report shows that turnover at law firms is high and increasing with, for example, the annual associate turnover rate at the most elite law firms in America today standing at 23.7%. With a new batch of layoffs underway in an inflationary environment, it’s hard not to anticipate a thorny mix of rising bill rates and a reduction of external talent available. Companies will compete to maintain relationships with the best external counsel as they vie for their time while realizing that the long tail of support on which they have relied may be turning over, along with the knowledge that has come from working together.

If outside counsel is increasingly on the move, then it’s imperative, arguably now more than ever, for in-house legal teams to act and embed effective systems that help their enterprise retain the knowledge it buys in from external law firms and lawyers as well as make it readily accessible for decision-making within the organization now and into the future. However, proprietary research we at Hence Technologies, in collaboration with research agency Coleman Parkes, have conducted with more than 150 general counsels, chief legal officers, and heads of legal operations, indicates that only 18% of legal departments have a clear process for collecting internal feedback on external law firms.

This means that, when external lawyers move between firms, the enterprise often loses the opportunity to capture the experiences it has about working with those individuals. Also, new hires in the legal department don’t get to benefit from their own company’s historical knowledge base about its external lawyers. In losing visibility of any past value personally created by individual outside lawyers, in-house legal teams’ time and budget-consuming efforts in the selection and management of law firms and lawyers becomes less evidence-based on performance and easily defaults to appointment decisions actually, or perceived to be, driven by biases unrelated to proven or relevant value.

When we speak directly to in-house teams, few feel confident they have solved the challenge of capturing and acting on feedback from their relationships with external counsel. Yet, many cite this as a lower priority than process-driven tech efforts like implementing e-billing or spend-management software.

Yes, money can be saved by knowing what you are being billed and for what. However, in a world that’s on fire, it’s more important to have the right partners. Knowing which external lawyers make the difference for your business allows you to invest in those relationships, which can keep you at the top of the list for support as needs arise. Being able to track which individual lawyers know what also enables you to follow them as they move from firm to firm. While we at [Hence](http://www.hence.ai) have built a solution to this, many corporations also rely on in-house systems for elements of this tracking.

However you keep tabs on your lawyers, one thing is for sure: the law firms that corporate in-house teams have leaned on in the past are responding to the same volatile economic and political conditions as the corporations themselves. Failure to build intelligent systems to keep pace with change will put corporate legal departments on the back foot when it comes time for support.

In just two short years, the national injunction went from rare to routine."" The Trump presidency has ushered in the era of nationwide injunctions, and not everyone seems to be a fan of this type of one-size-fits-all jurisprudence. [[CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/17/politics/judges-trump-administration/index.html)] * In case you missed it, come 2019, there will be three legal genders in California: male, female, and non-binary.

* “Democratic attorneys general are getting national injunctions to stop the Trump administration. In just two short years, the national injunction went from rare to routine.” The Trump presidency has ushered in the era of nationwide injunctions, and not everyone seems to be a fan of this type of one-size-fits-all jurisprudence. [[CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/17/politics/judges-trump-administration/index.html)]

* In case you missed it, come 2019, there will be three legal genders in California: male, female, and non-binary. Under the Gender Recognition Act, citizens of the Golden State may select non-binary as an option on state-issued IDs, driver’s licenses, and birth certificates. Congratulations on this landmark legislation. [[Esquire](http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a13029632/california-recognizes-third-gender/)]

* The number of this year’s law firm mergers is set to break records, but you better get ready for MOAR MERGERS. Per Janet Stanton of Adam Smith Esq., deals are happening behind the scenes, and partner defections may serve as an indication of merger talks. Can you think of a firm that’s been losing partners?

# Thinking Like A Person, And A Lawyer, About The Trump Search Warrant
## If Trump takes no position on whether the affidavit should be released, he arguably avoids waiving his rights to challenge whatever action the court takes.

About a week ago, Donald Trump reportedly tried to contact Merrick Garland to ask how Trump could “[reduce the heat](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/875335245021678251#)” caused by the execution of a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago.

Gee, let me think about this for a minute.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Oh! I’ve got it: If Trump wanted to “reduce the heat” related to the search warrant, Trump could have issued a statement such as this:

Everyone should calm down about the search warrant. I didn’t actually have any classified documents on the premises at Mar-a-Lago. The search warrant was thus issued by mistake. I have complete confidence in the American judicial system. I won’t be indicted; if indicted, I trust that a plainly nonpolitical jury will find me not guilty. There’s no reason to get worked up about this. Calm down; trust the process. I do.

Of course, for Trump to issue that statement, he would have to actually want to reduce the heat. If Trump had no intention of reducing the heat, and Trump actually thinks it works to his advantage to have FBI agents, and prosecutors, and judges fearing for their lives if they take any action against him, then Trump would continue stirring the pot.

It’s January 6 all over again: If Trump wanted the rioters to leave the Capitol Building, he could have tweeted promptly upon the start of the insurrection:

Stop! I don’t know whether you’re my supporters who are invading the Capitol, but if you are, then you’ve completely misunderstood me. I never intended for today to turn violent. Leave the Capitol Building immediately, and go home. This is not at all what I had in mind!

Trump didn’t do that, because he wanted the violence. Trump likes people who oppose him to worry about the wrath of Trump’s mob.

That’s thinking like a person; allow me now to think like a lawyer: Last week, various media outlets filed a motion for the court to make public the affidavit justifying the Mar-a-Lago search warrant. Trump filed no papers on that issue, took no position in court, and simply acted as a bystander to the proceedings.  Why?

Here’s my guess: On the one hand, Trump’s lawyers are intensely curious about the contents of the affidavit. They’d love to see the affidavit, start analyzing it, and start considering whether there are any flaws in the affidavit that would later justify challenging the propriety of the search.

On the other hand, the affidavit presumably contains many pages of material that crap all over Trump. The affidavit presumably describes in detail how the Department of Justice knows that Trump retained government property (or classified government property), the preliminary conversations in which the Department of Justice tried to convince Trump to turn over that property (and Trump’s response to those communications), and which crimes the government is investigating. As a political matter, it probably wouldn’t look very good to have that information made public.

So Trump says that he wants the affidavit to be made public, but he does not actually want that result.

Lastly, if Trump takes no position on whether the affidavit should be released, he arguably avoids waiving his rights to challenge whatever action the court takes. If Trump affirmatively argued that the affidavit should be made public, he couldn’t later object to the harm inflicted on his defense by the affidavit having been made public. If Trump takes no position in court on this issue, Trump can later complain about whatever decision the court makes.

Ultimately, I suspect that the court will release a version of the affidavit redacted almost entirely, so the folks arguing that the affidavit should be made public will be left unsatisfied. And Trump can again complain — but not on the record, in court — that the Department of Justice is hiding something.

As always, time will tell.

# Biglaw Firm Announces Generous Expansion Of Parental Leave Benefits For Lawyers
## Another improvement for the family friendly firm.

By now [it is pretty clear](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/parental-leave/), if you want to be considered an elite law firm — and be able to compete for the best legal talent — you have to pony up with a generous parental leave policy. We are seeing more and more firms offering their attorneys generous paid leave, and the programs are increasingly gender neutral and offered without a primary caregiver stipulation.

The latest firm to offer improved parental leave is Dorsey & Whitney. Their newly expanded program, effective January 1, 2020, provides attorneys with 15 weeks paid leave — up from 10 — as well as a 4 week ramp up/down periods surrounding leave (for anyone that takes at least 12 continuous weeks of parental leave) which consists of a 50 percent billable hours expectation. The firm is also doubling their adoption assistance program, increasing the reimbursable expenses from $5,000 to $10,000 for qualified adoption expenses.

Bill Stoeri, Managing Partner, said the program’s expansion is part of the firm’s commitment to helping employees have a real work/life balance:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“We are committed to being a family-friendly workplace and to having the policies and benefits in place that enable our attorneys and staff to manage their professional and personal lives in the way that works best for them. We believe this benefits our lawyers, the Firm as a whole, and most importantly, our clients.”

Staff at the firm also receive paid leave, but it is only 8 weeks (plus any applicable disability).

Dorsey has been recognized in the past for their family friendly benefits, including being named a Best Law Firm for Women by Working Mother magazine, an Adoption Advocate by the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption, and Gold Standard Certification from the Women in Law Empowerment Forum.

You can read the firm’s full announcement of the new program on [the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/01/dorsey-parental-leave/2/)

# Morning Docket: 12.27.16
## * According to CBS News chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford, sources have said that President-elect Trump has narrowed his list of potential Supreme Court nominees down to five candidates: Bill Pryor (Eleventh Circuit), Thomas Hardiman (Third Circuit), Steve Colloton (Eighth Circuit), Diane Sykes (Seventh Circuit), and Joan Larsen (Michigan Supreme Court). Which judge do you think the PEOTUS will choose? [[Face the Nation / CBS News](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/face-the-nation-transcript-december-25-2016-colbert-correspondents-panel/)] * President-elect Trump isn't just inheriting a Supreme Court vacancy -- he's inheriting much, much more. Thanks to an ""unprecedented level of obstruction"" on the part of Republican senators when it came to President Obama's federal judicial nominees, there are more than 100 judicial vacancies, which will give the Trump administration the leeway to reshape the judiciary through lifetime appointments. [[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-to-inherit-more-than-100-court-vacancies-plans-to-reshape-judiciary/2016/12/25/d190dd18-c928-11e6-85b5-76616a33048d_story.html?wpisrc=nl_most-draw6&wpmm=1)] * Is the end near for the European and Middle Eastern branch of King & Wood Mallesons? As other Biglaw firms poach partners, the firm has filed a notice to appoint administrators, and according to a spokesperson, this legal move was ""designed to protect the firm from its creditors ... as it continues to explore all available options."" The firm is not expected to file for pre-pack administration until January. [[Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/home/id=1202775424541?__nored=2&LikelyCookieIssue=true)] * There is a dire shortage of rural lawyers in flyover country, and it's causing the justice gap to become even wider in some states. For example, Nebraska has 93 counties, and 11 of them are without a single lawyer. This is a problem that's left other lawyers traveling far and wide to see clients and potential clients attempting to handle their legal matters themselves -- which has caused errors in business matters, divorces, and wills. [[NPR](http://www.npr.org/2016/12/26/506971630/nebraska-and-other-states-combat-rural-lawyer-shortage)] * If you've applied to law school, you may be wondering how you can best prepare for a recorded video interview. You may think it's tough to impress an admissions committee through such impersonal means, but if you prepare for this as if it were a live interview, keep your answers short and sweet (think one minute or less), and be yourself, you'll have this one in the bag. You can review some of these practice questions.

You may think it’s tough to impress an admissions committee through such impersonal means, but if you prepare for this as if it were a live interview, keep your answers short and sweet (think one minute or less), and be yourself, you’ll have this one in the bag. You can review some of these practice questions.

# 3 Tips For First-Year IP Associates
## The first year of practice is both exhilarating and challenging for IP associates.

It was just weeks after 9/11 that I started my first gig as a lawyer, at a now-defunct but then prominent intellectual property boutique firm in New York City. Because I had not yet taken the patent bar, I was technically treated as a contract attorney and not an associate, even though I spent my time at that firm performing first-year associate tasks on a sizable patent case. By the following summer, I had joined another firm as a full associate, but the experience of working at two law firms in my first year of practice imparted some lessons that I think are worthwhile for first-year associates today.

What follows is an idiosyncratic set of tips, ideally considered in conjunction with the usual platitudes about making a good first impression, acting professionally, and billing as many hours as you can. Part of the sensibility behind these ideas is the sense that the first year of practice — particularly in a challenging field like IP — is fraught with anxiety for new lawyers. On top of the unfamiliar work environment, first-years must learn to handle their dread at making an error; those can be of a professional or cultural kind. At the same time, the first year of practice is the best time to cultivate one’s professional curiosity, and learn to enjoy the intellectual challenge of lP law.

So the first tip is to do what you can to avoid being pigeonholed into a narrow field of practice early on. The time for hyper-specialization is later. With that in mind, first-year IP associates must realize that while you are at your most fragile from the point of view of professional autonomy, you also may never be as free to discover what aspects of IP law actually appeal to you. Even if you are stuck on various matters of the same type, there will inevitably be opportunity to investigate (on your own time) other areas of IP law, or even different aspects of the IP field (patent, trademark, etc.) you are primarily working in to start. If you are assigned to assist on the invalidity analysis in a patent case, you can use your spare time to start educating yourself about damages law in patent cases, as an example.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The goal of course is to achieve a wide-ranging familiarity with all aspects of IP law, so that even if you don’t have an actual assignment in a particular area, you will be ready when and if an assignment does come along. But a first-year’s curiosity should not be limited to IP law issues. One of the most exciting parts about starting a law firm career is the opportunity to actually work on client matters. Clients are often an abstraction during a summer associateship or during the recruiting process. Now that a firm has actually brought you on to work, however, you have an opportunity to see precisely which clients are giving the firm IP business.

As a second tip, it is imperative that even if you will never even sniff a call with the client directly, you take the opportunity to learn about the breadth and depth of your firm’s IP client roster. Try to understand what kind of IP work different clients are giving the firm, and analyze whether that work is centered on a particular industry or area of IP law. Perhaps most important, for clients whose matters you are staffed on, do as much background research on the client and its business as you can. Learn about the client’s industry, why IP issues are important to the client, and try and determine how the client interacts with competitors on IP issues. Make sure you understand the value of the matters you are working on for the client, and where your matters fit into the client’s IP strategy. On top of making you a better lawyer and motivating you to work harder for the client, engaging in this type of study is good practice for when you become more senior, and need to prepare for beauty contests and the like.

Third, remember that as important as it is to build your network within the IP department at your firm, and with other IP-focused colleagues at other firms, it is just as important to build your network of lawyers practicing in other disciplines. If you work at a larger firm with other practice groups, take advantage of the associate mixers and training programs offered to get to know your colleagues toiling away in corporate or real estate. At the same time, make sure you are at least passingly familiar with your IP colleagues, including associates and partners in other offices. If you work in a smaller firm, perhaps one focused on IP issues only, then try and get to know the patent associates if you are mostly focused on trademark/copyright and vice versa. Considering as well how most, if not all, states put a premium on live CLE for junior lawyers, use the opportunity of attending those CLEs to get to know other juniors at different firms and companies. Finally, be a good friend to your law school classmates, who are probably going through the same intensive adjustment as you are to work life. Be a sympathetic ear and source of support, and make clear that you are interested in maintaining your relationship even after law school.

Ultimately, the first year of practice is both exhilarating and challenging for IP associates. That said, there are concrete steps any associate can take to develop good work habits, expose themselves to as wide a variety of IP issues as possible, and start to grow their professional networks. It may not seem like it, but these steps are the foundation for an interesting and opportunity-filled career as an IP lawyer. Yes, it all starts with a professional attitude and doing great work. But don’t forget that the key to lasting success is often in the extra effort you make. Whether you practice for one year or fifty, it is that extra effort that will sustain and enrich life as an IP lawyer.

# Biglaw Firm Set To Slim Down For Summer By Conducting Layoffs
## How many people will be let go?

April showers bring May flowers, but the only thing that’s budding up at this Biglaw firm is layoffs. Which firm may be slimming down for summer by kicking up to 80 percent of its secretarial staff to the curb?

That would be Ashurst, which recently launched a redundancy consultation which may result in the loss of 80 of the firm’s London-based secretarial roles, plus a few jobs in the firm’s Middle East offices. Legal Week has details on Ashurst’s plans:

As part of plans to restructure the function, the firm is creating three new roles, with the downsized new team set to be split across the London and Glasgow offices.

Thirty-five practice executives will be responsible for practice management and client communications, while 31 team executives and 12 team assistants will undertake more traditional secretarial tasks.

All of Ashurst’s existing secretarial staff will be able to apply for the new positions, which will primarily be in London, with nine of the team executive and assistant roles moving to Glasgow. …

The consultation is due to end in June.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
According to Jan Gooze Zijl, the firm’s financial and operations officer, “Responding to changing client needs, evolving technology, market efficiency drives and embracing new ways of working are strategic priorities for Ashurst. The way legal work is undertaken has changed considerably and we need an approach to service delivery that most effectively supports the practices and our business.” Once again, technological advances are taking jobs from law firm staff members. In the future, we may be forced to write about attorney layoffs that are due to “evolving technology.” Like it or not, the robots are coming, and they may be coming for your jobs.

We wish all of the individuals who may be affected at Ashurst the best of luck while they seek new job opportunities in the legal industry and beyond.

If your firm or organization is closing its doors or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive — we’ll never ignore you. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs) or text us (646-820-8477).

# Dallas Cowboys Fans See Judicial Conspiracy In Elliott Ruling
## They've kind of got a point, too.

Dallas Cowboys fans are pretty sure the world is always out to get “America’s Team.” How is a fanbase simultaneously convinced that most of the country loves them and that everyone’s a hater? I’m not sure, but it probably has to do with the Electoral College. In any event, with the team’s star running back’s 6-game suspension back on, they’ve discovered a new conspiracy theory to kvetch about in their tin-foil Tom Landry hats: the judge was compromised by the NFL league office!

As the theory goes, Judge Katherine Polk Failla is married to one [John E. Failla](http://www.proskauer.com/professionals/john-e-failla/), a partner at [Proskauer](http://www.proskauer.com), the very firm that represented the NFL in negotiating the collective bargaining agreement whose terms gave the commissioner the broad disciplinary powers that are now dropping like a hammer on Zeke Elliott’s bare midriff. The fix has been in from the beginning!

Welcome to the Judiciary-Biglaw complex. These are the sorts of coincidences that start to pile up when you practice within the Southern District of New York for awhile. Proskauer’s Failla is an insurance lawyer, making it fairly unlikely he has much to do with lobbying his wife to protect Roger Goodell’s honor. Still, given the relatively paltry salaries of federal judges, the lion’s share of the Failla household income is coming from a firm deeply intertwined with this CBA. It’s a conflict that probably deserved flagging, if not recusal, just to avoid the appearance of impropriety, and oh my God I’m finding agreement with Cowboys fans.

But the denizens of Baja Oklahoma shouldn’t get too cocky over this. Even if Failla departs the case, the fact that [the CBA continues to afford Goodell nearly godlike powers](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/nflpa-continues-to-ignore-the-awful-cba-it-agreed-to/) means Zeke would just lose in front of another judge. It doesn’t really matter who pulls the trigger on this suspension — the NFLPA already loaded the gun when it signed on to this monstrosity.

If it’s any consolation, the Cowboys were going to go 2-4 over this stretch with or without Elliott.

# Biglaw Firm Facing Racial Discrimination Lawsuit From Former Senior Associate
## WilmerHale hasn't commented on the allegations.

On Friday, a lawsuit was filed in New York state court against Biglaw firm WilmerHale. Last year, the firm made $1,344,519,000 in total revenue, making it 34th on the Am Law 100. The complaint was filed pro se by Jean E. Dassie, a former senior associate in the IP practice group.

As [reported by](https://www.law360.com/articles/1735194) Law360, Dassie, a naturalized citizen of Cameroonian origin, traces much of his alleged discrimination at the firm to his issues with counsel Anh-Khoa Tran. Tran is also a named defendant in the suit.

Much of Dassie’s complaint stems from a conflict he says he had with Tran in 2022 over the protocol for making changes to slideshows to be used in trials. After Dassie maintained that Tran’s proposal for doing that task did not make sense but that he would consider it, Tran “scream[ed] at plaintiff that he is a counsel and that if he wants something done one way, that’s how it should be done,” the suit says.

Tran’s account of the conflict went on to form the basis of a negative year-end evaluation, delivered in September 2022, in which Dassie was put on an interim review plan, he says.

WilmerHale’s evaluation said that Dassie “continued not to follow the instruction, which led to an altercation that is inconsistent with WilmerHale culture and values.”

The complaint alleges the statements in the evaluation are defamatory, saying, “Blinded by its prejudice, WilmerHale accepted Tran’s version of events uncritically and published the falsehoods in plaintiff’s year-end evaluation.”

Dassie says he received above average evaluations in the remainder of 2022 and in 2023, but that negative review was used as a “pretext” to fire him.

The complaint also contains allegations he was given menial tasks below his position, and he was blamed for mistakes that weren’t his.

WilmerHale hasn’t commented on the lawsuit.

It sure feels like 2022 wasn’t a big winner for most people. Perhaps the not-so-great year can be salvaged by a nice bonus check from your Biglaw firm.

Winston & Strawn, a firm with $1,153,207,000 in gross revenue in 2021, making it 43rd on the Am Law 100, announced its year-end bonuses for associates. Of course, they matched the prevailing market rate — set by Baker McKenzie last month. But the firm is also offering a little something special for those who billed more.

The bonus scale at the firm is as follows:



Plus starting at 2,100 hours, associates are eligible for additional cash, as per the below grid:



You can read the full memo from the firm [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/winston-bonus-22/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

# 9 Silly Interview Mistakes To Avoid
## Employers are paying attention, and you only get one chance to make a good first impression. Keep these tips in mind if you want to land your dream legal job.

As a legal recruiter, I help attorneys prepare for interviews all the time.  I also speak with employers after each interview, and hear firsthand why a candidate did (or in some cases, did not) make a good impression.  While I always cover the basics of interview preparation with attorneys (see [12 Lateral Interview Tips from a Legal Recruiter](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/12-lateral-interview-tips-from-a-legal-recruiter/)), I also cover the aspects of interview preparation which some may find obvious, but others often overlook.  Having been in the legal recruiting profession for several years, I’ve learned that even the most basic tenets of interview etiquette are often forgotten.  But employers are paying attention, and you only get one chance to make a good first impression. Below are helpful interview tips you must keep in mind if you want to land your dream legal job:


(Image via Shutterstock)

1)  Dress the Part. For a legal interview, you must wear a suit.  I have had employers complain to me after an interview when candidates do not dress professionally.  Even if the firm is casual and everyone else is in jeans and flip flops, you must wear a suit.  YOU MUST WEAR A SUIT.  Did I mention that you have to wear a suit?  While you’re at it, a good shoe shine can go a long way.  Like it or not, our physical appearance is the biggest factor that influences others’ first impressions of us, so every little detail counts.  In addition, studies also show that how you dress can change the way you see yourself.  The clothes you wear can affect your confidence, so if you look the part, then you’ll be more likely to feel the part and ultimately be perceived in a better light.  I often get asked by female attorneys if they should wear a pant or skirt suit, and my answer is to wear whatever makes you feel the most comfortable and confident.  You don’t want to feel self-conscious during an interview, so you have to feel good about whatever you wear.  Along those lines, women should keep hair and makeup simple, and accessories to a minimum so the interviewer can make an assessment of you based on your words and skills.  Men should wear a tie and either be clean-shaven or if you have facial hair, keep it trimmed and clean.  An unprofessional look can distract the interviewer from your qualifications, so be sure to take the time to pull your look together in advance.

2) Watch Your Language.  While you may have a great rapport with your interviewer and feel very comfortable, you have to keep a professional tone — no matter what.  This includes refraining from using profanity or other inappropriate language.  While dropping F-bombs may be a part of your regular vernacular, you need to rein it in during an interview.  Remember, this is an interview for a job in a client-services industry.  If a firm does not feel comfortable putting you in front of a client, they won’t hire you.  You must also keep in mind that a job interview is not a casual conversation between friends in a bar.  It’s a highly formal exchange where the interviewer is assessing your professionalism, among other things.  Even if your interviewer uses profanity, don’t get too comfortable and start following suit.  As a lawyer, there will be plenty of opportunities to swear after you land the job.

3) Less Is More.  Do not feel the need to overshare about your personal life or extracurricular activities.  While you may love partying and getting toasted with your friends on the weekends, it’s best at this stage to keep your personal life just that — personal.  An interview is not an appropriate place to discuss your partying ways or your recent divorce woes.  While it may be appropriate in some instances to talk about your hobbies or interests outside of work, you have to remember to keep it PG and keep it positive, as you don’t want it to overshadow the entire interview.  If you do share personal details, make sure they are relevant to the question.  The risk of making the conversation too personal is that you may lose focus and start sharing too many irrelevant details, which will oftentimes do more harm than good.  If you are asked to share personal information about yourself, It’s important to keep it light, make it interesting, and show an equal interest in the person interviewing you.

4) Lose the Gum.  While it’s great to have fresh breath before an interview, nothing will be more distracting than chomping away at a Juicy Fruit during an interview.  So ditch the gum altogether and pop a breath mint instead, finishing it before you even get to the reception desk.  If you find yourself at the interview and you’ve forgotten to lose the gum, be sure to visit the restroom before an interview and throw it out.  You need to be able to speak clearly during an interview when answering questions, and gum won’t do you any favors.

5) Unplug.  Turn your phone off or on silent — not on vibrate — during an interview.  Many of us are addicted to our smartphones, but the emails, voicemails, and texts will still be there after the interview.  Avoid the temptation to be distracted by the quiet buzz of a vibrating phone and allow yourself to be present in the moment and focus on the interview.  While it may not be an immediate dealbreaker if your phone goes off during the interview, it can raise a red flag to the interviewer.  It can also distract you and cause you to lose your train of thought, so don’t risk it.

6) Timing is Everything. Be sure to show up on time, and ideally 10 minutes before your interview. You’ll want to give yourself enough time to check-in, use the restroom, and have a few moments to compose yourself and collect your thoughts before diving into the interview.  But be careful not to show up too early.  There’s a fine line between being eager and looking desperate, and you don’t want to send the wrong message.  Arriving more than 15 minutes early can also be frustrating for a hiring manager, so try to stick to the scheduled time.   On the flip side, you don’t want to show up late, as that can signal poor attention to detail or poor time management skills, and worse, a disregard for other people’s time. If it’s raining or the area is prone to traffic or unpredictable travel times, then be sure to give yourself extra time to get to the interview.  Of course snafus can happen beyond our control, so if you are running late don’t panic.  Call your recruiter or interviewer and let them know your ETA, asking if that time will still work and if not, offering to reschedule.

7) Don’t Watch the Clock. Sure, we’re all super busy and taking time away from our current jobs to interview elsewhere is always difficult, but it’s part of the process that you’ve committed to in order to land a great job.  So forget about how long you’re away from the office and the work that’s waiting for you, and keep your gaze on the interviewer, not on a clock or your watch.  Looking at your watch during an interview gives negative signals about your ability to focus, your respect for the interviewer, and your desire to get the job.  If you can’t avoid the temptation to glance down at your wrist every two minutes, then leave your watch at home.

8) Mind Your Manners. Many job seekers forget the importance of being polite (or perhaps let their nerves get the better of them).  But to give yourself the edge during an interview, you’ve got to mind your Ps and Qs.  So shake the hand of everyone you meet, maintain good eye contact, listen well, don’t talk over someone, and say “please” and “thank you” when appropriate.  If a meal is part of the interview process, then good table manners are mandatory.  Interviewers are assessing the overall package, not just your skills and experience.  Make sure you’re on your best behavior, and if you need an etiquette refresher course, [Emily Post](https://emilypost.com/) is just a click away.

9) Send Thank You Notes. Job search etiquette is very clear on this point:  Every interview must be followed by a thank you note/email, ideally within 24 hours.  I’m always surprised by the number of job applicants who want to skip this simple yet important step.  Employers pay close attention to the thank you note, so take this opportunity to remind your interviewers what a great applicant you are, and show them how much you want the job.  Employers find it rude when applicants don’t send thank you notes, and may question your interest in the position.  If you want the job, then there shouldn’t be any question in the employer’s mind about that.  The thank you note is the perfect ending to an interview process where you’ll get the final word and stay on the forefront of the employer’s mind, so don’t miss out on that opportunity.
