# Jones Day To Gender Discrimination Plaintiffs: You Don't Deserve To Be Paid On The Cravath Scale
## Plus they say their compensation system isn't a black box.

The gender discrimination lawsuit brought by seven former associates against Jones Day is really heating up. You may recall a [complaint, now amended,](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/amended-gender-discrimination-case-brings-the-real-scoop-on-jones-day-compensation/) alleging a “fraternity culture” at the firm and unequal pay behind the firm’s notorious “[black box](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/)” compensation system. Now the firm has filed a [115-page answer](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6223663-b4f64e74-fd28-41e7-84da-ce6513c03388.html), and they sure don’t pull any punches.

In the amended complaint, the seven named plaintiffs alleged they were paid less than similarly situated male associates and used charts comparing their compensation to the industry standard or “Cravath scale” to demonstrate that they were underpaid. In response, Jones Day alleges not everyone deserves to be paid on the Cravath scale, and that geography and merit played a role in plaintiffs’ compensation:

“Plaintiffs’ pay discrimination claims are based on the misconceived and legally baseless notion that all lawyers in all geographic markets have, at all times over the past decade, been entitled to so-called ‘Cravath scale’ regardless of the quality of their performance or their productivity.”

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
To further this argument, the answer singles out plaintiffs Nilab Rahyar Tolton and Katrina Henderson as being undeserving of market compensation. As[ reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/07/29/jones-day-attacks-warped-portrayal-in-200m-gender-bias-class-action/) Law.com:

Henderson, according to the response, never cracked 1,100 hours of client billable work in any year and “struggled with basic tasks.” Tolton “received below-average reviews in four of her last five years” and saw her hourly billings plunge in two years after she took leaves.

“While that is consistent with Ms. Tolton’s allegation that she joined Jones Day because she thought she could ‘do the minimum’ and protect her social life, it is not the type of performance that would have qualified her for ‘Cravath pay’ at any firm,” Jones Day said.

Additionally, Jones Day tries to turn the allegations of a fraternity culture against the plaintiffs, saying their perceptions of a hostile work environment were “entirely built on stereotypical tropes.”

“This warped portrayal of women as weak, powerless, and incapable of making their own choices or taking responsibility for their own actions is as offensive as it is wrong and certainly does not accurately describe the women lawyers at Jones Day,” the firm said.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But by far my favorite argument is the one where Jones Day says their compensation system isn’t a black box:

[T]he firm disputed that its compensation system could be characterized as a “black box,” noting that it publishes detailed information on its evaluation and compensation processes on its website and details them internally within the firm. Furthermore, midlevel and senior-level associates participate as evaluators of more junior associates, observing elements of the process from both sides.

Now, I’m not commenting on the truthfulness of the allegations in the complaint, nor am I opining on the legal arguments in either side’s filings. But. But… as someone who has personally spent a lot of time [trying to ascertain](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/) the compensation landscape at the firm, I was pretty incredulous reading that.

Just for fun, I asked my fellow Above the Law editors their initial reactions upon hearing this, and (following the laughter) they delivered.

There are plane crashes where the black box wasn’t as impenetrable as Jones Day’s comp.
Staci Zaretsky answered in picture form, which I quite appreciated:




Elie Mystal:

Jones day is so used to gaslighting for the president they think we’re as dumb as Trump voters.

For my part, I went back to this classic over-lawyerly response from Bill Clinton:

Is Jones Day’s compensation system a black box?


We’ll continue to follow the ups and downs of this case as they develop.

# Biglaw Firm Casts Magic Spell And Summons More Cash Compensation For Associates
## No hocus-pocus here, just more money!

Abracadabra! We know this firm is trying to escape its Magic Circle designation, but this money ring is the only magic circle its associates care about right now. Freshfields just announced a salary increase for its U.S. associates, and they’re thrilled.

Now that Linklaters and Freshfields have entered the arena, it’s time for other firms like Allen & Overy and Clifford Chance to step up to the plate with bigger, better associate salaries.

Here’s what the new salary scale looks like at Freshfields, thanks to Davis Polk:

- Class of 2021: $215,000
- Class of 2020: $225,000
- Class of 2019: $250,000
- Class of 2018: $293,500
- Class of 2017: $335,000
- Class of 2016: $360,500
- Class of 2015: $381,000
- Class of 2014+: $396,500
Like its peer firms, associates at Freshfields will see their new salaries in their March 15th paychecks, retroactive to January 1. Congratulations!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Freshfields.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Biglaw Titans Locked In Legal Battle Over What It Means To 'Believe Women'
## What's going on over there, Wachtell?

When has a law firm simply gone too far in light of the times we’re living in? One Biglaw firm may be ready to teach a masterclass on just that.

For the past three years, Tinder’s cofounder and a group of its early employees have been locked in litigation with IAC/InterActiveCorp. and Match Group Inc. over the dating app’s valuation. But this is not your average corporate suit: it centers on the alleged cover-up of a sexual assault investigation against a former CEO to keep him in power long enough to manipulate and suppress the company’s valuation.

Wachtell Lipton — a firm that came in 41st place in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking, with a 2020 gross revenue of $1,010,664,000 — has represented Match on the reportedly faulty Tinder valuation, on the alleged “sham” sexual assault investigation, on the company’s spin from IAC, and now on this suit. The firm recently attempted to seal documents related to the sexual assault allegations against former CEO Greg Blatt, a former Wachtell associate himself. But the Wachtell ties don’t end there. The company’s CFO is a Wachtell alumnus, as is one of its board members, who worked there for decades as a former partner. Wachtell now seems to be trying its hardest to conceal information in this suit, but why?

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Rosette Pambakian, a former Tinder vice president, accused Blatt of “forcibly groping [her] breasts and upper thighs” during a 2016 holiday party. Two others were present in the hotel room where this happened, and according to court documents, what one of them saw occur between Pambakian and Blatt was “not consensual.” Blatt has since filed a defamation case against Pambakian, claiming that the incident in question was indeed consensual. The instant suit alleges that Match whitewashed the sexual assault investigation to keep Blatt at the head of the table while working on the valuation.

As noted in a recent filing from Gibson Dunn, the firm that is representing the plaintiffs in this $2 billion suit, not only is access to court documents a First Amendment issue, but transparency is even more important when matters involving allegations of sexual assault are at play.

“There is simply no valid basis for denying public access to these court records, particularly in light of the substantial public interest this case has already generated. Sealing is an extraordinary act in derogation of the statutory and common-law rights of public access to court proceedings. It is not a weapon to be wielded as a means of seizing a strategic advantage through selective disclosures aimed at winning a public relations campaign. Defendants should not be allowed to sweep under the rug evidence that they swept Blatt’s misconduct under the rug. The #metoo era has highlighted the importance of transparency and the need to expose, rather than conceal, credible allegations of sexual assault. This is especially so in this case, where the jury can find that the investigation cover-up was designed to facilitate the corruption of the Tinder valuation that Blatt was leading in parallel with the Blatt investigation. This Court should reject Defendants’ effort to enlist its help in perpetuating their cover-up by keeping the filings in its own docket shielded from public scrutiny.”

Not only is Match willing to take a huge #MeToo bullet here, but Wachtell is as well for its aggressive defense of the company. By insinuating that Pambakian is a liar, and then by attempting to conceal almost all of the documents concerning the sexual assault investigation, they are failing women entirely. Whatever happened to “believe women”? We reached out to Wachtell for comment, but the firm did not immediately respond.

Gibson Dunn partner [Greta B. Williams](https://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyer/williams-greta-b/), who is representing the plaintiffs alongside partner [Orin Snyder](https://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyer/snyder-orin/), said, “It is unfortunate in 2021 that a public company would stoop so low in attacking the victim. Now they are trying to cover up their cover up by keeping evidence about it hidden from the public.”

With law student activism on the rise — for example, against law firms that use mandatory arbitration agreements in employment and against law firms that represent fossil fuel companies — it wouldn’t be terribly surprising if these student groups turned an eye toward firms that are willing to represent companies that show such disdain to victims of sexual assault.

No, I am not going to write a “2019 year in review” although there were some very memorable moments in our profession this year. As [Satchel Paige](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satchel_Paige) said, “[Don’t look back. Something might be gaining on you.](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/satchel_paige_125248)”

Many others are far more conversant in the memorable moments of 2019, so I will leave it to them to highlight this past year, and in fact, [this past decade](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/the-top-above-the-law-stories-of-the-last-decade-sort-of/).

But there’s no one better than [humorist Dave Barry](https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2019/12/29/dave-barrys-year-review/?arc404=true) to put 2019 in the trash can where it belongs.

Avid readers of ATL will agree that that notorious “bowl of dicks” should also be trashed.

I have been heartened this year by the “progress” — although that may be too strong a word — or at least about the discussion that we lawyers are starting to have about mental health issues and how they affect us to a greater or lesser degree. It’s a really hard thing to out oneself as some lawyers have done in 2019 about their struggles with various forms of mental illness, be it anxiety, depression, OCD, or whatever we lawyers do battle with.

Practicing law is a lonely profession (attorney-client privilege is just one example), and I think it takes tremendous courage to stand up and be counted in that way. I am in awe of every single lawyer who [has done so](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/biglaw-depression-story/) to date and those who will do so in the future.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Perhaps by reducing the stigma that is still associated with mental health problems, (no, they are not contagious and are not cooties), we can also reduce the number of deaths by suicide we have seen among us in the past few years. The less we are afraid to confront our fears of failure, of not making partner, or not being promoted to general counsel, or not getting that judicial appointment we crave, the better our mental health will be. I don’t think you can “have it all,” at least not all at once. Perhaps seriatim, but not all at once. The sooner we understand that, I think we will be healthier for that understanding. It’s called the “practice of law” for a reason.

Rather than writing New Year’s resolutions, which I think are a crock, I love the idea of a [failure resume](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/smarter-living/failure-resume.html?te=1&nl=smarter-living&emc=edit_sl_20191230?campaign_id=33&instance_id=14849&segment_id=19936&user_id=0d22f8d038b2fef3184a5c3bba481c1c&regi_id=7806199520191230). Do  you have one? I don’t yet, but I think writing one is a good idea (no, I’m not going to share it with you). I’ll write one just as soon as I finish my mandatory CLE hours.

A failure resume keeps us both grounded and humble (the latter not an adjective usually associated with lawyers). I will need a scroll to write down all my failures, both professional and personal. I wonder if I can pay someone to follow behind me and make sure the scroll stays unwound. My motto has always been “cheerful paid staff.”

Having a failure resume does not mean being a failure. We are human, we make mistakes, we screw up on a more or less regular basis, and we get depressed when we don’t succeed on our terms. But success on our terms doesn’t mean it’s not success. It may just be in a different form than expected. It doesn’t make it worse, it just makes it different.

I am less heartened by the seemingly glacial pace of diversity and inclusion in our ranks. Describing the progress as “at a snail’s pace” is too complimentary for what I have seen and what I will continue to see, absent some overnight wholesale changes in the mindset of the decision makers: who gets to be a partner, let alone an equity partner, who makes the promotional decision for advancement in house (and that doesn’t mean hiring another white male to be general counsel when there are plenty of diverse in-house candidates chomping for the opportunity). There’s nothing more disheartening than to know that all your blood, sweat, tears, and years have, in the end, meant nothing.

January is also a time to consider where you are, career-wise, and where you might want to be. I’m not saying that twelve months from now you will want to switch jobs or will do so, but you might want to consider whether what you are [doing is satisfying](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/01/smarter-living/thinking-about-a-job-or-career-change-read-this.html?te=1&nl=smarter-living&emc=edit_sl_20191230?campaign_id=33&instance_id=14849&segment_id=19936&user_id=0d22f8d038b2fef3184a5c3bba481c1c&regi_id=7806199520191230) in a non-soul-sucking way.

As for life here in the Golden State, which some are claiming is now tarnished, given homelessness, traffic, weather (yes, we have it), and the high cost of living, litigation is already underway on various [employment law legislation](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-12-30/california-forced-arbitration-law-blocked) set to take effect on January 1.

But wait, there’s more! The lawyers’ full employment act for the new year:

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

Biglaw associates, how should you spend your bountiful bonuses? Perhaps you’re planning to score some Hamilton tickets, which have been selling on StubHub for up to $1,000 apiece. Perhaps you’re planning to purchase your own Lawyerly Lair to someday be featured here on Above the Law. Or perhaps you’re planning to completely pay off your law school loans.

If you’re feeling more altruistic, how about making a charitable donation to support a good cause? Today is [Giving Tuesday](https://www.givingtuesday.org/), and it’s a time to give back to your community, whether through donations of your time or your money. Don’t forget that your law firm may be willing to match any of your charitable contributions. Here are a few ideas:

To make this a little more competitive, we’ll be keeping a running tally of the firms with the most associates who have donated the most to certain charities. If you’d like to represent your firm in this giving challenge, please contact us [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%Charity%Challenge) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Charity Challenge”), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)) with the name of the charity to which you’ve donated a portion of your bonus. We will keep you completely anonymous. Help make sure your firm is known as the most charitable by donating as soon as you can.

Regardless of whether you go with any of these charities, please consider using some of your newfound money to support a worthy cause. With partners sharing the wealth with associates, associates should share the wealth with those who are less fortunate.

A mistrial in a federal case isn’t usually news, I mean, maybe if it’s in some notorious crime family case like in the movies, but in the majority of civil cases, these things happen without too much fanfare. But, well, when COVID-19 shuts down your case well, that’s news.

An Eastern District of Texas breach of contract case between plaintiff ResMan LLC and defendant Karya Property Management LLC and presided over by Amos L. Mazzant II has been sidelined by an outbreak of the novel coronavirus, as [reported by](https://www.law360.com/articles/1329617/covid-19-outbreak-leads-to-mistrial-in-edtx) Law360. How bad is the outbreak? Well, at most recent count 13 people. Yikes:

David O’Toole, clerk for the Eastern District of Texas, told Law360 on Tuesday that the number of trial participants who tested positive for coronavirus had increased from at least seven on Friday to 13 confirmed positives Tuesday. The positive cases include two jurors, at least three members of the defense team, a “handful of folks” on the plaintiff’s team, and three or four court staffers.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

The outbreak occurred after testimony in the trial had begun:

Jury selection was held on Nov. 2 and the trial was scheduled to last for two weeks. Jurors heard testimony every day last week and on Nov. 9, according to court records.

After lunch on Nov. 9, the judge advised the jurors and attorneys that a juror who had recently been excused tested positive for the coronavirus.

The judge then suspended the trial and asked participants to get tested and provide the court with results as soon as they were received. The judge advised participants to consult with their physicians about self-quarantining.

As a result there are only five jurors currently willing to continue with the trial, and the defendants aren’t willing to move forward with less than six jurors, so… yeah, Judge Mazzant declared a mistrial.

Judge Mazzant noted that this particular case seems to be an outlier — though that’s the thing about COVID: it doesn’t care how many times you did a thing in the past, getting folks together inside is a risk, every, single time:

“I apologize for all this happening,” the judge said. “We’ve done, again, seven trials without any incident, and the district, I think, has done about 20 trials without any incident, and we had issues this time.”

In announcing the mistrial, Mazzant also said that no trials will start in the remaining part of 2020:

“I’m not doing any more jury trials between now and December,” he said. “We are planning on resuming, assuming what the numbers look like, in January.”

Hopefully by then Texas will have the virus (slightly) more under control. Our best wishes to everyone impacted on their COVID recovery.

— An anonymous [NYU Law](https://abovethelaw.com/schools/new-york-university-law-school/) student waiting outside of the [Skadden](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/skadden-arps-slate-meagher-flom/) interview rooms in the DoubleTree Suites in Times Square on day two of the school’s early interview program, citing the law school’s [employment statistics](http://www.law.nyu.edu/careerservices/employmentstatistics) and [explaining why he wasn’t worried](https://bol.bna.com/dispatches-from-law-firm-interviews-at-nyu/) about his classmates finding jobs. About 150 Biglaw firms held 8,500 interviews with second-year NYU Law students this year.

There’s no time more dangerous for a law firm than when business is booming.

The problem is complacency. Most of us spend the first decade or more of our careers scrabbling and scraping, trying to keep our businesses running and building our books of business. But there comes a point where many of us start to feel at ease, like we’ve reached the mountaintop and everything is suddenly running along smoothly and profitably. After so many years of hard work to get there, we have every reason to want to take a break and ease our foot off the gas.

I’m 100% in favor of attorneys taking time to recharge their batteries, reduce their daily grind, and connect more with their families and hobbies. But if you think you can ever stop the large-scale strategic work of expanding your practice, think again, because a practice that isn’t growing is a practice that’s dying. The next hungry attorney at the firm across the street will be happy to take your book if you’re not tending to it and growing it. Attorneys and firms that think they have it made are the ones most at risk for losing everything they worked so hard to build up.

It’s A Trap

If you agree with the premise that business booms are prone to create complacency traps for the unwary, your spidey-sense should be tingling in today’s market. The economy is booming, and law firms have been reaping the rewards of all that pent-up legal demand. Many firms are struggling to keep up, and attorneys on the lateral market are having gobs of money thrown at them to help bring in new work or manage the work already onboard. Want proof? Some firms are now offering associates up to [$500K signing bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/biglaws-throwing-around-500000-signing-bonuses-in-red-hot-lateral-market/) to make a move. (As an aside, if you believe that cash doesn’t come with a steep price for your life, [think again](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/mo-money-mo-problems-again/).)

The problem with that kind of economy is that it becomes easy to cover up or ignore major deficiencies in how a firm operates. It’s easy to be inefficient and out-of-step with modern practices when there’s plenty of work to go around. But everything’s only good until it’s not. Economic cycles come and go, and all booms eventually bust. When the party stops, who’s going to still get the new matters assigned to them: the firm that innovated and found better and cheaper ways to accomplish their clients’ goals, or the firm that was content to keep on keepin’ on?

It’s at this time, when everything seems peachy, that we as law firm leaders need to be focused the most on expanding our firms’ footprints, preparing for the next inevitable downcycle, and finding our next great opportunities.

Things We’re Bad At That We Still Need To Do

I’ve had the privilege of spending the last year studying at the University of Cambridge Judge Business School. I’ve finished up my course work and am now writing my thesis on, what else, how established law firms and businesses can use entrepreneurial strategies to drive innovation.

In my studies at Cambridge, I’ve learned from my professors, classmates, and course materials that there’s one mantra which repeatedly comes up with the world’s most successful businesses: sense, seek, seize. Industry-leading businesses are skilled at sensing that new trends and needs are out there, seeking out ways to improve their processes, and seizing opportunities the moment they arise.

Unfortunately, these are all things that law firms tend to be terrible at.

Sense. Law firms don’t generally have their fingers on the pulse of the latest trends and developments in their own industries, much less the larger business world. Even basic technological advances still elude many lawyers and firms. We’re a year and a half into the pandemic, yet I still see lawyers regularly struggle even understanding the concept of the now-ubiquitous Microsoft Teams. Larger trends like [the regulatory reforms that are increasingly allowing ALSPs to compete directly with law firms](https://www.lawsitesblog.com/2021/05/arizona-licenses-first-three-alternative-business-structures-for-delivering-legal-services.html) are off most attorneys’ radars altogether. I know plenty of attorneys who will gladly spend hours discussing the finer procedural details of obscure case law, but haven’t devoted even a minute to figuring out how looming competitive behemoths like [UnitedLex](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/unitedlex-luthor/), [Elevate](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/peering-into-biglaws-crystal-ball/), and [LegalZoom ](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/legalzoom-is-coming-for-your-lunch/)might impact their very livelihood. ALSPs took in [$12 billion last year](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/can-law-firms-compete-effectively-alsp-services-2021-07-09/) that could otherwise have gone into the pockets of savvy, forward-thinking law firms.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Our industry enjoyed a relative lack of competition for decades, but a rude awakening is in store for many.

Seek. If you think we’re bad at sensing market trends, which just requires keeping our ears and eyes open, we’re even worse at seeking out ways to improve our businesses. Improvement generally requires getting formal systems in place to test new ideas and run novel experiments. Lawyers hate experimenting, because experiments often end up being unsuccessful, and we tend to loathe anything that isn’t a win. If we can’t handle the thought of a bit of failure in pursuit of a larger sustained success, we’re going to keep plodding along doing the same old thing until our competitors have left us in the dust.

Firms looking to avoid that trap will need to build a [culture of experimentation](https://hbr.org/2020/03/building-a-culture-of-experimentation) within them. For a positive example, take a look at [this article](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/07/12/how-innovative-firms-are-harnessing-young-lawyers-ideas-to-gain-a-competitive-edge/) about the new legal startup 10BE5. Two associates working at Cleary Gottlieb developed an idea to automate away some of their busywork. Instead of developing it in secret, they brought it to their firm, which encouraged them to launch their own company. One founder now runs 10BE5 full time while the other founder has remained at Cleary Gottlieb on a partnership track, and the firm itself is a stakeholder in the new enterprise. Rather than discourage its attorneys from experimenting and innovating, Cleary Gottlieb positioned itself to participate in the upside a new venture like that entails.

Seize. Law firms also tend to struggle with making bold, original decisions. Consider the annual dance of the associate salaries that plays out every year in this publication. The entire legal world tunes into[ Above The Law](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/salary-wars-scorecard-tracker-2021/) and refreshes until one firm tiptoes out in front with the new associate salary and bonus structure. A flood of firms quickly publish their own schedules tracking whatever changes they’ve already seen take place. The copycats certainly can’t be accused of being bold. Even the firm that makes the first move only gets partial credit, given how easily the rest of the market is willing to follow along. Is it really that bold to make a move that everyone else is willing to make, if only someone else would move first? If you’re looking to seize new, untapped opportunities, by definition you have to be willing to do things that others aren’t. That characteristic remains in short supply in the risk-averse legal world.

Seize The Day

Hard as our children will find it to believe, there used to be really good money in mailing around rental DVDs. Netflix was the undisputed leader of its market segment, and it had a great thing going. Nothing was compelling it to dip a toe into streaming video, but it saw an opportunity that no one else did, so it made a move, which by all accounts has paid off.

Things are good right now, which means we owe it to ourselves and our partners to be pushing outward and growing our firms before the next inevitable downcycle. Our industry will probably remain gun-shy and blinkered for the foreseeable future, but that doesn’t mean your firm in particular has to be that way. Those firms willing to embrace and implement the mantra of sense, seek, seize have a chance to break out of the industry’s economic cycle and thrive every day.

Find your opportunities and seize them. If you don’t, someone else will.

# Associate Bonus Watch: Candy Is Dandy, But Bonuses Are Better
## For Biglaw associates, money makes everything more fun.

It’s bonus season in Biglaw, and associates are gleefully running around like kids in a candy store — only instead of grasping handfuls of sticky treats, their hands are full of cold, hard cash. Less than 30 minutes after this morning’s [~10:30 a.m. Cravath match from Simpson Thacher](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/simpson-thacher-announces-bonuses/), Debevoise & Plimpton decided to issue a Cravath bonus match as well. (If you recall, this is the exact same order these firms issued their bonus announcements last year on the second day of bonus season.)

The Debevoise bonus memo is available on the next page, and we’ll mention here that just like last year, no specific payout date is listed; the memo merely states that bonuses are “payable at year-end.” If you know what that means, reach out to us.

For what it’s worth, we will be creating a chart listing each firm that has matched, beaten, or come in lower than the Cravath bonus scale, and when each firm intends to pay its associates. In a year when we believe that most, if not all, firms will match Cravath, the difference will be the date on which payouts are made. We hope your firm pays your bonus dollars in 2017, because your tax situation may be different in 2018.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
That’s our take on the Debevoise & Plimpton bonuses. If you’re a Debevoise lawyer, what do you think? Feel free to let us know how you feel [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. Remember: as soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. You can also text us at 646-820-8477. We look forward to hearing from you.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

For the most profitable and biggest in Biglaw it is only a matter of time until they raise associate salaries. Once [Cravath showed their hand](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-930725518-912x912.jpg) earlier this week, if you want to recruit and retain elite legal talent, you have to respond to the new market standard on compensation.

With $2,150,365,000 in gross revenue last year making it #15 on the Am Law 100 ranking, Simpson Thacher is definitely elite. And now they’re paying associates like it.

New compensation grid at Simpson is as follows, effective January 1:

Class Year	2024 Annual Salary
Class of 2023  	$225,000
Class of 2022	$235,000
Class of 2021	$260,000
Class of 2020	$310,000
Class of 2019	$365,000
Class of 2018	$390,000
Class of 2017	$420,000
Class of 2016	$435,000
Plus bonuses news, also up to the market standard.

Class Year	Year-End Bonus
Class of 2023	$15,000 (prorated)
Class of 2022	$20,000
Class of 2021	$30,000
Class of 2020	$57,500
Class of 2019	$75,000
Class of 2018	$90,000
Class of 2017	$105,000
Class of 2016 	$115,000
Bonuses will be paid on December 29th.

You can read the full memo on [the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/simpson-raises-23/2/)

# Nationwide Layoff Watch: Left Longing For A Paycheck After A Long Weekend
## Which firm decided to conduct layoffs the day after Memorial Day?

Did you enjoy your long weekend? If you’re like most lawyers and legal professionals, we’re sure you tried your very best to have a good time, but work was always on your mind. Now, imagine returning to work on Tuesday — after you spent what was supposed to be a relaxing weekend thinking about your job — only to find out that you no longer had a job.

Sources tell us that Sedgwick initiated layoffs on Tuesday, May 31. These layoffs affected staff members ranging from legal secretaries to paralegals to clerks. While some tipsters say that the layoffs were centralized in the firm’s Los Angeles office, others say that they’ve heard layoffs were conducted at additional Sedgwick offices.

We reached out to the firm for confirmation, and a spokesperson had this to say:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Like any well-run business, we must evaluate our needs to ensure we are delivering outstanding service and value to our clients. We strive to maintain efficient staff ratios and are making necessary adjustments consistent with the current trend across the legal profession. Technological enhancements continue to allow for leaner staff ratios. Sedgwick’s decision to eliminate less than 10 staff positions across a firm of 600+ people was not taken lightly. Severance, outsourcing services and extended benefit periods were provided to the affected individuals.

We wish all of the legal professionals and affected individuals at Sedgwick the best of luck while they seek new job opportunities in the legal industry and beyond.

If your firm or organization is closing its doors or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive — we’ll never ignore you. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs) or text us (646-820-8477). Thank you!

# Am Law 100 Firm Is Conducting Layoffs And Still Rolling Back Pay Cuts
## Great economic recovery, but not enough to keep everyone employed.

It’s a mixed bag of good and bad news at Venable, and your perspective on the moves likely depends on whether you have a J.D. The Am Law 100 firm announced that due to their “prudent” financial moves — in April, the firm announced pay cuts across the board and furloughs for some staff members — they are rolling back those pay cuts. Good news! But though some furloughed staffers are returning to work, others, along with “other professional staff,” are being laid off. Bad news.

A spokesperson for the firm provided the following statement:

Venable continues to perform well during these challenging times. The firm is taking actions that will contribute to long-term success while maintaining a prudent approach to financial management in light of ongoing uncertainty related to COVID-19.

To reflect the firm’s performance and financial position, Venable announced it is increasing the compensation of salaried attorneys and staff from previously reduced levels. We are also aligning our staffing to meet our current and future needs. This includes returning some furloughed employees to work while separating with others who have been previously furloughed and some other professional staff.

# Biglaw Firms To Merge, Miss ULTIMATE In Branding Opportunity
## The mega firm will come into existence later this summer.

The Biglaw merger [teased back in April](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/biglaw-firms-in-talks-for-merger-that-could-create-one-of-the-largest-firms-in-america/) between Holland & Knight and Thompson & Knight has been agreed upon by both firms. The tie-up is scheduled for August 1st. The new firm even has a name all picked out — Holland & Knight.

Welp, there go hopes that the new mega firm will go by the catchy Knight & Knight. Or even Knight Law. It was always a long shot that each of the second named partners would somehow emerge on the top of the masthead by a quirk of the merger partner, but those who imagine new and fun branding opportunities can still dream.

The joint statement from the firms on the merger:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Holland & Knight and Thompson & Knight have agreed to combine on or about August 1, 2021. The combined firm will operate under the Holland & Knight name. It will have approximately 1,600 lawyers and other professionals in 30 offices around the globe. The announcement follows favorable votes by the Holland & Knight Directors Committee and Thompson & Knight partnership, and the execution of a definitive merger agreement by both firms. Further information concerning the combined firm will be released upon completion of the merger.

And another upside to the merger: rising 2Ls will no longer embarrassingly confuse the two & Knight firms.

Nicely done.

Paul Weiss has just released their bonus payouts. And, considering that they are a top Biglaw firm with [an obscene $1,850,437,000 gross revenue in 2021](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=233&name=Paul-Weiss), it is no surprise that the dollars promised are looking very nice. Here’s the breakdown:

- Class of 2022: $15,000 (pro-rated)
- Class of 2021: $20,000
- Class of 2020: $30,000
- Class of 2019: $57,500
- Class of 2018: $75,000
- Class of 2017: $90,000
- Class of 2016: $105,000
- Class of 2015+: $115,000
Congratulations to everyone at Paul Weiss! Maybe avoid spending that new money on cryptocurrency? I hear it’s a little volatile at the moment.

(Turn to the next page to see the Paul Weiss memo.)

We like hearing about bonuses almost as much as you enjoy spending them. As soon as your firm’s memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Biglaw Firm Succumbs To Pressure, Gives First-Year Associates A Bonus
## Sometimes complaining pays off.

Last we [heard about bonuses at Akin Gump](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/no-bonuses-for-first-year-associates-at-this-biglaw-firm/), first-year associates were pissed.

While the rest of the firm was getting hefty market bonuses, the Class of 2017 was left out in the cold with no bonuses — not even of the pro-rated variety — to speak of. As a tipster noted at the time:

No bonus for first-years with crushing student loan debt.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

But it now seems as though the firm has had a change of heart. Yesterday, we heard from sources at the firm who revealed Akin Gump would pony up the money for first-years:

Akin Gump had a bonus town hall today and announced that class of 2017 will in fact be paid a pro-rated bonus.

It seems keeping the pressure on the firm and pointing out the inconsistencies with market practices actually succeeded in changing the firm’s position. We reached out to the firm and an Akin Gump spokesperson confirmed the policy change:

Akin Gump maintains a strong commitment to offering its associates and counsel bonuses that meet or exceed the market rate. Consistent with that approach, we were pleased to announce prorated bonuses to our first-year associate class.

# Elite Firm Announces Associate Salary Increases On Top Of Year-End Bonuses
## Baker McKenzie, one of the world's leading law firms, is spreading the wealth to its associates through salary bumps and bonuses.

Biglaw firms are quickly rushing to match the new market compensation and bonuses [set by Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/cravath-announces-raises-comes-over-the-top-of-milbank-scale-for-some-associates/) yesterday afternoon. Which firm will be the next to step up to the plate to increase its associates’ salaries?

That would be Baker McKenzie, a firm that’s twice now (in [2020](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/) and [2022](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/biglaw-bonus-season-begins/)) been the first firm to announce bonuses ahead of Cravath. The leading law firm — which brought in $3,300,189,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it in 4th place the most recent Am Law 100 — has chosen to use the Cravath scale for its compensation increases, meaning these are the salaries associates at the firm will see, as of February 9, retroactive to January 1:

- Class of 2024 – $225,000
- Class of 2023 – $225,000
- Class of 2022 – $235,000
- Class of 2021 – $260,000
- Class of 2020 – $310,000
- Class of 2019 – $365,000
- Class of 2018 – $390,000
- Class of 2017 – $420,000
- Class of 2016+ – $435,000
Baker McKenzie is also matching the Cravath bonus scale, and this is what year-end bonuses will look like at the firm for eligible associates, to be paid on February 9:

- Class of 2022 – $20,000
- Class of 2021 – $30,000
- Class of 2020 – $57,500
- Class of 2019 – $75,000
- Class of 2018 – $90,000
- Class of 2017 – $105,000
- Class of 2016+ – $115,000
The firm will also be offering a “premium bonus” for those who have “materially exceeded” their billables for the year. Congratulations to everyone at Baker McKenzie!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from the firm.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of compensation updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus/Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus/Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Associate Bonus Watch: A Biglaw Firm That May Sweeten The Bonus Pot
## Congratulations to you if you’re an associate who managed to squeeze some more money out of the firm.

Another day, another hour, another Cravath match. Biglaw firms continue to fall all over themselves to match this year’s bonus scale. Won’t anyone hand out a little more money to these hard-working associates?

It looks like at least one law firm is willing to dig deeper into its pockets to compensate those who worked a bit harder than their peers. Ropes & Gray announced its bonuses this morning for the classes of 2016, 2015, and 2014, of $15,000 (prorated), $15,000, and $25,000, respectively. Bonuses will be paid on December 23, 2016. In the firm’s memo, however, chairman R. Bradford Malt and managing partner David C. Chapin explained that bonus amounts would be increased for some associates who billed their butts off.

Here’s the relevant passage (the full memo is on the next page):

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
As you know, we have an activity target of at least 1,900 billable and pro bono hours to be eligible for a bonus. This year, we have again increased bonuses from the above scale for associates who worked substantially more than the targeted amount, maintained bonuses for some associates who worked less than the target, and decreased rather than eliminated bonuses for many other associates who worked less than the target. We have also adjusted bonuses in unusual circumstances where an associate’s performance review is substantially above or below our expectations. Our career associates and London associates are compensated in accordance with their respective markets, so their compensation will be different.

Congratulations to you if you’re an associate who managed to squeeze some more money out of Ropes & Gray. But how much more is the firm actually willing to pay out? We’re not sure yet, but last year, a source we spoke to told us that the firm’s increased bonus amounts were such “a joke” that it almost made doing the extra work a waste of time.

What about more-senior associates? For that group, the R&G memo says, “For more senior associates, bonuses will, as always, be determined and communicated individually. These bonuses will reflect personal contributions, assessed on both qualitative and quantitative bases, as well as prevailing market compensation.” What is the firm actually paying its more-senior classes? If you can enlighten us as to what older associates will receive, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) or text us (646-820-8477).

That’s the word on the Ropes & Gray bonuses. If you’re a Ropes lawyer, what do you think? Feel free to let us know how you feel [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks for your help.

Don’t forget, if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please enter your email address in the box below. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything.

# The Biglaw Firm That Keeps Losing Partners Is Revamping Their Leadership Structure
## The firm has created a new role to support ""law firm 2.0.""

Elizabeth Acee

We’ve [been talking about](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/biglaw-firm-loses-over-a-dozen-partners-as-more-firms-spread-to-boston/) LeClairRyan an[ awful lot](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/biglaw-firm-that-just-lost-over-a-dozen-partner-loses-even-more/) in 2019.

And it’s with good reason: the Biglaw firm lost 20 partners to the bustling lateral market in [January alone](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/the-partner-departures-at-this-biglaw-firm-are-really-piling-up/). Plus there are the 42 partners who departed the firm in 2018, and, as [Law.com reports](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/02/04/leclairryan-creates-new-leadership-role-as-declines-continue/), the firm’s revenue has been on the downswing in recent years:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The changes come at a time of continuing lateral departures at LeClairRyan, and amid sustained revenue decreases at the firm in recent years. The firm’s gross revenue fell from $163 million in 2015 to $142 million in 2017, according to Am Law 200 figures, with declines continuing into 2018.

Despite these… challenges, the firm has put on a brave face, claiming they are creating “law firm 2.0” because of a partnership with alternative legal service provider, UnitedLex. Together they’re launching ULX Partners LLC, to provide nonlegal operations for law firms. To further support these changes, the firm has created the leadership role of president, which will share executive duties with the firm CEO.

Yesterday, the firm announced litigation head [Elizabeth K. Acee](https://www.leclairryan.com/elizabeth-k-acee/) is the firm’s new President, and she’ll be working with Chief Executive Officer C. Erik Gustafson in leading the firm forward:

“Lizz has been an essential partner and leader in helping address the changes being driven by shifts in the legal marketplace, particularly as we move toward a next-generation law firm model,” Gustafson said. “Our Board of Members shared in my enthusiasm in elevating her to the President role. This signals not only the firm’s commitment to that vision, but also confidence in her ability to lead us forward.”

January may be drawing to a close, but that doesn’t mean Biglaw bonus season is over. Just on Friday, California Biglaw firm of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati announced their bonus scale.

As expected, WSGR matched [the scale set by Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/breaking-cravath-announces-annual-bonuses/) way back in November, assuming they’ve hit their billable hours threshold of 1,950 bonus-eligible hours. The bonuses will be paid to associates on January 31st, and the very next day they’ll get their raises, commensurate with class year.

For those that may have forgotten the market bonus schedule here ya go:

# Is A Silent Retreat The Answer To The Stresses Of Motherhood And A Legal Career?
## Compassion for yourself and others is always important. The legal world could use a little more of that.

Can you imagine leaving your family and job for four nights to spend your days in silence and meditation? If you had asked me a year and a half ago, I would have laughed and said no way. But things change. I’m a mother of two small children, an owner of a busy divorce law practice, and someone who has been meditating with the help of a popular meditation app for about a year. My job is stressful, and I never feel like I have enough time for my children. When I recently received a disheartening health diagnosis, my husband encouraged me to find a silent retreat to deepen my meditation practice. The thinking was that some things in life (like my health diagnosis) are outside of my control, and meditation and mindfulness is one way to cope with those things that we cannot change. So, with some trepidation, I booked a silent retreat in the mountains of Boone, North Carolina.

Before leaving for my retreat, I had a lot of concerns. Would I be able to be in silence for that long? How would I sit and meditate for hours on end if I could barely do 10 minutes a day of meditation on my app? Part of my health problems involve physical pain. Would hours of sitting still in meditation exacerbate this pain? Would the other participants be weird? Would the instruction be so bizarre that I would want to leave? Was I wasting precious time that I did not have to spare by going on this retreat? And most importantly, since I had never left my children for that long, would they be alright? Would I be alright away from them?

Upon arriving at the facility, I was struck by the complete beauty of the location.  The Blue Ridge Mountains lived up to their name in various shades of blue, making a gorgeous backdrop for sunsets and sunrises.

The program was highly structured, with 18 other people ranging in ages from their late 20s to well past 60, two-thirds were women. Our instructor was a charming woman, originally from India, who was both firm and motherly. The first rule she gave us was that we were not to consume caffeine for the duration of the retreat. Bummer for this mom, who definitely had daily withdrawal headaches from the lack of her daily cup of coffee. (I actually cheated on the last day just so I didn’t have to drive with a headache).

The first 24 hours were actually not spent in silence. We were led through a lot of group bonding activities that irked me since I had not counted on being forced to share personal details about myself with strangers at a retreat that was supposed to be silent. Several people were either going through a divorce or contemplating divorce, and it was hard to be thrust back around people who reminded me so much of my clients back home. Other people had experienced such tragedy and hardship in their lives that it made my own reasons for coming on this retreat pale in comparison. Some participants were truly inspiring, and I had to admit that I was glad that I had been forced to talk to them, because I cannot imagine how else I would have met such interesting people had I not been at something like this.

When we finally went into silence on day two, I felt my body relax. The rules were simple. Do nothing. That meant, no moving your lips to make a sound. No communicating with anyone. No texting. No checking email. No checking the news or looking at your phone. No watching TV. No writing or journaling. No reading. No normal obligations of social politeness. If you felt struck by inspiration you could make a quick sketch or jot down a poem, but otherwise no activities, except for sessions and meals.

Despite my trepidation, I loved the silence and the mandate to do nothing. My mind slowed down. And my body seemed to love it as I slept like I haven’t slept since I was a teenager. I am someone who wakes up early regardless of when I fall asleep, but at this retreat I went to sleep early, woke up early, then fell back asleep for an additional several hours. Then in between lunch and session in the afternoon, I would take another nap. I actually ended up missing several yoga classes as I slept in my room. Granted, that was just my experience, and another participant at the end said she loved the program but hadn’t slept in four days.

However, if I had thought that I was going to be around silence, I was wrong. The retreat center was filled with over 100 other people who were there for various other programs, and they were loud, filling the dining hall with laughter. More disconcerting, these participants, and even some staff members, would frequently approach me trying enthusiastically to make small talk. I would then awkwardly point at my lips or my small sign that said I was in silence and they would then back away. I so craved silence that I would often go back to our session building when it was empty and lie on my yoga mat to just get away from the noise.

This was a deep dive into a different style of meditation, and I loved how it broadened my perspective and deepened my understanding of my mind. One of the meditations made me feel like I was in a trance. Several of the other participants sobbed through parts of it. Other participants fell asleep, and their snores echoed in the room. All of this was alright. As our instructor said, “We will never control the mind at the level of the mind. We have to dig deeper.”

On the last day of the retreat our instructor pulled together the different meditation techniques she had taught us into a meditation schedule that she said we absolutely had to do every day going forward after morning yoga or a workout of our choice. I’m sure that I would feel fantastic if I worked out and then did the 40 or so minutes of mediation that she recommended, but it is also not practical for my frantically busy life with small children, work, homework, and housework.  On my first day back, I shortened the meditation practice to something more manageable. I’m sure my instructor would be horrified, but I still felt calm and less reactive after completing it.

Was this retreat life-changing? Most of the participants said they felt it was. They tearfully gave testimonials on the last session about how this had changed their lives. I definitely felt like I had learned something new and broadened my perspective on the world, but I didn’t feel moved to tears. Perhaps this was a testament to the fact that my life is actually very good. Yes, I have stresses, hardships and obstacles, but I also appreciate all the blessings I have in my life.

And what about my fears prior to going on this retreat? Well, I loved the silence and found that easy, but I fiercely missed my children. If I had been given the opportunity to cheat and talk to them, I definitely would have FaceTimed them.  And what about my fear of being in pain? Well, there is a certain irony in going on a meditation retreat to accept pain in your body, only to find that sitting still for hours on end only exacerbates the pain. My body definitely hurt a lot, despite the center doing everything possible to make us all as comfortable as possible with different types of chairs, cushions and blankets. There were also a lot of stairs at this retreat center, and I know for some people, that would pose a problem.

Returning to the real world felt strange, but hugging my children felt so right.  Back home, as I washed the patchouli scent from my hair (and every single item of clothing I brought with me), I realized that all the stresses of my client’s cases and the aggravation of dealing with opposing counsel seemed insignificant. And in some ways, I wish that everyone had the opportunity to do something like this.  To take a break. To rest the mind and the body. To learn that we are not in control of our thoughts and feelings. To step outside our comfort zone. And to be reminded of the ways in which we are all humans in this world together, and that compassion for yourself and others is always important. The legal world could use a little more of that. The whole world could.

It’s an unfortunate situation to be in. I think it’s important for these attorneys to learn from this experience such that the next opportunity they look for, stability should be part of that conversation.

— Katherine Loanzon, managing director at Kinney Recruiting, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/12/07/cooley-skirts-warn-act-offers-severance-packages-benefitting-junior-associates-over-seniors-and-staff/), on the place where nearly 80 Cooley associates now find themselves in the wake of being laid off. Those associates’ profiles were removed from the firm’s website almost immediately and given three months’ of severance. “Before the pandemic, [associate] severance would be between three and six months,” Loanzon said. “Some firms can be more generous, especially if it’s an associate who has put more time into a firm and created more value for the firm.”

I realized that if I can do it, a lot of people can do it. Most lawyers can [donate] because lawyers can work remotely. I wish I had done it sooner. I would just encourage people to get tested. If more people get tested, then sharing my story would have been worth it.

— [John Worden](https://www.schiffhardin.com/professionals/attorneys/s-z/worden-john-s), a partner at Schiff Hardin, commenting on his recent decision to [donate a kidney to a complete stranger](https://www.law.com/2018/12/21/a-san-francisco-trial-lawyer-gives-a-life-saving-gift/) in California after his wife donated one of her kidneys to their daughter’s friend.

# Amazon, Etsy, And Biglaw
## How a website for selling homemade doodads may hold the key to Biglaw’s salvation.

Amazon was one of the first companies to recognize the importance of having a best-in-class supply chain.  It spent years building up its systems rather than turning a profit.  Today, its logistical advantage has given it an unassailable position in the online retail market.  No one beats Amazon — at shipping, on price, or on most any metric you can think of.

Amazon keeps expanding into new markets and devouring them, with nearly every dollar of revenue being pumped into further expansion.  The more Amazon’s competitors struggle, the bigger Amazon’s lead gets.  It will keep accruing new advantages while its competitors lose what edge they had.   It may be just a matter of time before it truly becomes “[the everything store](https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Store-Jeff-Bezos-Amazon-ebook/dp/B00BWQW73E).”

Amazon was on my mind while reading [a new report](http://legalexecutiveinstitute.com/2018-legal-market-report/) on legal market trends issued earlier this month by Georgetown University and Thomson Reuters.  The report, which tracks performance metrics for law firms from the top of the market on to the midsize, was full of the same kinds of dispiriting data that have plagued much of the industry since the Great Recession.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Growth remains flat overall across the profession, with the Am Law 200 firms’ revenue dropping again for the third year running.  The number of attorneys in the legal world continues to rise, this year up 1.3%, while demand for legal services remains flat, meaning more lawyers dividing up the same amount of work.  Rates charged for legal work modestly increased, but the actual price ultimately charged and collected for that work remains about the same.  Translation: firms are raising their rack rates, but raising discounts almost in lockstep, which gives the appearance of growth without an actual effect.

Despite the overall growth of the economy over the last year, and the Dow continuing to climb to record heights, the legal industry has had trouble capturing that growth.  The reasons cited in the report are some of the same problems we’ve been talking about in this column over the past months.  Increasing competition from [non-traditional legal providers](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/king-kong-is-coming-to-crush-your-practice-with-a-calculator/).  Continued client pressure to [decrease rates and commoditize practices](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/sedgwick-death-by-billable-hours/).  A continuing swing of the pendulum toward in-house legal spend and away from traditional law firms.  The market for legal services is getting harder and harder for midsize and many large law firms to crack.

One segment of the legal market continued to outpace the rest in growth, though.  While midsized firms stayed stagnant and the Am Law 101-200 declined, the Am Law 100 grew by 2% last year.  In fact, wherever there were gains reported in the market, they were typically concentrated in the top 100 firms.

Interestingly, the gains weren’t spread over the top 100 firms evenly.  Per the report, most of the benefits accrued at the top of the heap.  The top three firms in the Am Law 100 accounted for 10% of the group’s total revenue, more than the bottom 20 firms combined.  In fact, fully 2/3 of the increases in revenues last year were concentrated in just the top 20 firms.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

In short, the power players at the top of the market are consolidating their power and growing, while their competitors are jogging in place or falling behind.  And if these market conditions hold, that spells additional challenges for the rest of the best, the “[hollow middle](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/saving-biglaw/)” just outside the Am Law 100, that is struggling to find an identity following the market shakeups of the last decade.

When strength begets strength, it gets harder and harder to displace the entrenched powers that be.  We see it all the time in the sports world.  Of the 113 World Series that have been played, the Yankees have won 27, nearly a full quarter.  In the NFL, which has the strictest salary cap of any major American sport, we see Tom Brady and the New England Patriots heading to their eighth Super Bowl in 16 years.  Over in Europe, where salary caps are basically nonexistent, Spain’s top soccer league has played for 86 seasons.  Two teams, Reál Madrid and Barcelona, have won 57 of those championships, including 17 of the last 20.  It’s a self-reinforcing cycle where the champions get the fans, the fans bring in the money, the money brings in the best players, and the best players end up the champions.

It’s the same in business as it is in sports.  Getting a lead on the competition can lead to ever-accruing advantages.  Amazon played its supply chain advantage to the hilt, and its owner is now possibly [the wealthiest person in history](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/09/jeff-bezos-is-now-the-richest-of-all-time--sort-of.html).  And now the world’s biggest law firms are getting stronger while the rest of the pack flounders.  When the next economic downturn comes around, the gap between the haves and have-lesses may spread even further.  What’s to stop one of those firms from making a play to become Biglaw’s Amazon, “the everything firm” that can’t be beat on price, services, resources, or name?

Here’s where I finally have some good news.  First, there are structural barriers that would prevent any firm from having a true monopoly.  As a profession, we thankfully take that whole “conflict of interest” thing pretty seriously, which means as long as there are cases being filed and deals being cut, there will always have to be different law firms on both sides.  There’s also the issue of rate disparity between regions.  Lawyers tend to cost more in Manhattan than in Milwaukee, which makes partnering across those regions difficult.

But the real reason I have hope is Etsy, the website where you can buy handmade [Nicolas Cage stamps](https://www.etsy.com/listing/189929766/nicolas-cage-face-stamp-nic-cage-stamp?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=weird%20gifts&ref=sr_gallery-1-24), [sushi print socks](https://www.etsy.com/listing/250720065/sushi-socks-4-sizes-hand-printed-in-usa?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=weird%20gifts&ref=sc_gallery-1-8&plkey=e66ea96632e37eabc801cd7fd51ac2fed6145f03:250720065), and other items that scream “[why?](https://www.etsy.com/listing/550440313/porcelain-doll-head-planter?ref=sold_out-2)”  This online retailer has survived the Amazon stranglehold by being the living embodiment of the long tail.  Its founders recognized that there was a vast supply of creators out there looking for a place to sell their work.  Etsy tapped into that unused supply and gave it a platform.  Creators that were too small for Amazon’s store suddenly had a market of their own.  Even the everything store isn’t going to carry too many [knitted cross-sections of the human eye](https://www.etsy.com/listing/449581984/anatomical-illustration-of-the-human-eye?ref=shop_home_active_21).

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The gap between Etsy and a law firm is [narrower than you might expect](https://www.etsy.com/listing/196275400/sarcastic-lawyer-i-love-document-review?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=lawyer%20cross%20stitch&ref=sr_gallery-1-5).  As long as the supply of attorneys in the world remains abundant, some of those attorneys will choose to pool their resources and try to help each other connect with clients.  No firm will likely ever so dominate the market that a smart, dedicated group of JDs can’t try to break into that market.  With apologies to Jeff Goldblum: law finds a way.

# 3 Strategies To Ramp Up Your Job Search If You’re Facing A Layoff
## How do you stand out in an overcrowded and highly competitive job market? Consider the following tactical processes.

Layoffs have been increasing by the day since Q4 began. With tech companies laying off employees in record numbers ([more than 120,000 in 2022](https://fortune.com/2022/11/22/some-tech-employees-fare-better-than-others-on-severance-packages/)), even in-house legal departments are not immune. In fact, we’ve seen an upward trend in [layoffs in Biglaw](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/cooley-layoffs-2022/) and boutique firms over the past few weeks. This means the job search market is even more competitive now than it was six months ago, and lag times for interviews and job offers are also part of that process.

Most people facing a layoff rush to update their resume and merely dump that same content into their LinkedIn profile so they can head into job search boards and mass apply for as many roles as possible.

Understand that job searching today is a strategic and targeted process, not one of a “spray and pray” methodology. There are hundreds of applicants vying for the same role. So, how do you stand out in an overcrowded and highly competitive job market in a “Where’s Waldo” scenario? Consider the following tactical processes I’ve outlined below.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Get Clear On Your Elevator Pitch And Personal Brand

Before you ever step into a job search or a subsequent job interview, you must convey your unique value and [personal brand](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/the-three-cs-of-building-a-personal-brand-in-the-digital-age/) to an employer. I always suggest that clients first identify their defining characteristics and leadership assets in each role across their career and showcase those best ones in their resume and LinkedIn profile.

It’s often helpful to read through a series of job postings, highlight the required key qualifications, and then match up your top qualifications to the job posting. By reviewing job postings, you’ll see a pattern form. For example, lots of in-house roles require prior in-house experience or Am Law 100 experience. If you have that experience, state so in the top of your resume and LinkedIn summary for quick visibility. You may have industry-specific experience that a company is seeking (e.g., healthcare, digital health, SaaS, fintech, or oil/gas), and you’ll want to front-load that skill set as well.

Remember, a resume and a LinkedIn profile are not just a laundry list of your experience. Instead, they must convey a concrete and valuable story about the best skills you bring to the table that align with the company or firm’s needs.

Craft a 30-second elevator pitch by writing out a short paragraph of who you are, the value you bring to the table (or boardroom), and your best-selling soft and hard skills. Memorize that pitch and have it ready for when you an informational interview presents itself.

Streamline Your Resume And Make It Digestible

The average reader spends less than 10 seconds on your resume. That means the reader needs to digest and understand information quickly. Large, chunky paragraphs and 10 to 20 bullet points for a position do not work for a digital-age reader. I’ve written a number of past articles in my [ATL column](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/the-three-cs-of-building-a-personal-brand-in-the-digital-age/) on the specifics of a legal resume, but the key takeaway is ensuring your content is understandable, highly valuable, and relevant to the job search target. It’s also imperative that you understand the competencies for your specific role — [a resume for an in-house counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/how-to-write-a-general-counsel-resume-and-market-yourself-strategically/) is going to be vastly different in terms of core competencies than a resume for a law firm lawyer.

Also keep in mind that a reader is looking at your resume from an objective viewpoint, whereas you’re looking at it subjectively and have an emotional connection to your career. It’s challenging to write about yourself and balance too much information against not enough information. Throw a layoff into that mix and it’s a recipe for panic, distress, and fear.

If you’re an executive-level candidate, understand the market is even more competitive, and expectations are higher. It’s why I often suggest that when it comes to writing your legal resume, hiring a legal resume writer is a wise decision, especially one who is certified and trained in resume writing and understands the legal profession in depth (presumably a former lawyer with a legal career that spans at least over a decade-plus in different legal environments, i.e., traditional law firm and in-house).

Put Effort Into Your LinkedIn Profile

Your LinkedIn profile is a valuable piece of real estate, and one that shouldn’t be overlooked or cast aside. LinkedIn also offers you wide access to professionals that play a key role in your job search. Legal recruiters, managing partners and talent officers at law firms, and senior executives are using LinkedIn to proactively seek out candidates. If your LinkedIn profile is a blank slate or doesn’t contain enough insights, you’re missing out on career opportunities finding you. Therefore, having an [optimized LinkedIn profile](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/quick-ways-to-refresh-and-optimize-your-linkedin-profile/) matters more than ever.

Take the time to complete these highly searchable sections of LinkedIn profile: headline, about/summary section, education (don’t leave your degrees blank), skills, and your geographic location. These specific five sections rank you higher in search results, and lead to increased profile views. Those increased profile views can lead to a more robust network and more lucrative career opportunities.

Don’t allow a layoff to bring you down — know that when one door closes, a new one opens. Make it your mission to be strategic, methodical, and tactical about your next job search.

# Associates Apparently Won't Have Jobs For Long If They Don't Return To The Office
## Maybe if we withhold their billable hours they'll come back to the office...

Many Biglaw firms are now officially sounding the alarm: associates must get back to the office or risk losing their jobs. That’s right, according to the American Lawyer, the latest partner ploy to lure associates back to the office is to deny billable hours to associates who are working remotely and aren’t showing their faces enough in real time.

In a recent [Am Law survey](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/05/30/in-battle-for-billable-hours-not-coming-in-will-cost-some-associates-their-jobs/), Biglaw partners said that they’d be willing to “abandon” associates who “deserted” their firms in their “pushing back” on the return to the office. Here’s more:

“Frankly, I do not give assignments to associates and junior partners who are not in the office at least 3 days a week although most of my colleagues are now working 4 days a week. I also will not support associates seeking partnership if they have abandoned the office,” wrote one Am Law 100 practice leader, adding that he felt far more relaxed upon returning to the office 18 months ago.

Another Am Law 100 partner emphasized the need for lawyers to give up their personal lives in service of clients, framing associates’ hopes to change that expectation as youthful naivety that ultimately burdens the lawyers above them.

“To succeed, your life simply cannot be your own,” the partner wrote. “Young associates do not want to live like this—and they are pushing back against the business model, but what they do not understand is that the work is still getting done. It’s just getting done by those above them, to the detriment of the physical and mental well being of those who don’t have the option of dropping the ball.”

This is what many associates are up against in their quest for a hybrid workplace. There are partners out there who are willing to gatekeep the assignment of billable hours that may help keep associates employed. Meanwhile, let’s not forget that during peak pandemic times, associates billed more hours than ever before while helping their firms break financial records. And now, those associates who’d like to keep working remotely suddenly aren’t “fully committed” to their firms? Yeah, okay.

Some firms — like Husch Blackwell, DLA Piper, and Gordon Rees — aren’t twisting associates’ arms about returning to the office, and are even allowing them to choose their own in-office attendance frequencies. “There is no reason why someone has to get dressed and commute an hour each way to go to an office, turn on a computer, work on it, and go home,” Gordon Rees managing partner Dion Cominos told Am Law. “When you come in, you should be advancing business objectives of the organization or your own career in some way. Let’s have an attendance policy based on that rather than a number of days.”

Maybe associates who are being threatened with unemployment will find their way to firms that aren’t making threats like these and are instead willing to work with the realities of the post-COVID hybrid workplace.

# Repeat After Me, 'Partnership Without Equity Is Not A Partnership'
## Non-equity partnerships can be great jobs. But they are not partnerships.

Before we get much further, let’s be clear that senior attorneys are still valuable even if they aren’t equity partners. They bring expertise and seasoned judgment to the firm’s matters and a healthy paycheck is nothing to sneeze at. But a few years ago, some firms pulled a dirty trick on their clients and senior lawyers alike. The “Special Counsel” or “Counsel” or “Of Counsel” received a rebranding as “Partner,” complete with a footnote indicating — solely for internal bookkeeping — that this “partnership” was just a paycheck by another name.

In a stellar article charting the [death of the collegial partnership in an era of hired gun profit engines](https://www.wsj.com/articles/being-a-law-firm-partner-was-once-a-job-for-life-that-culture-is-all-but-dead-11565362437), Sara Randazzo covers a lot of ground from the widening spread between earnings going to highest- and lowest-paid partners to the concentration of leadership in a smaller and smaller professional management group. But it’s the increasing deequitization that hovers behind everything in modern Biglaw.

Over the past decade, Kirkland has become known for making high-price offers to rising stars at competitors, for $10 million a year or more in some cases. It has embraced the two-tiered partner system, made up of a junior class paid a set salary and an inner circle of equity partners, who split the firm’s profits.

The system is meant to reward ambitious young lawyers faster, before they weary of the entry-level title of associate. Left unsaid: The promotion often justifies a bump in their hourly rate to around $1,000, which enriches senior partners who share in the firm’s profits.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Except there was already a mechanism to reward young lawyers “weary of the entry-level title of associate” and it was a counsel role. Changing the name to partner is just a gimmick designed, as Randazzo points out, to allow the partners who are sharing in the equity to bill out their juniors at a higher rate. Pulling a little wool over the eyes of the clients for fun and profit.

But it’s a raw deal for the young lawyers too. While Randazzo’s piece correctly notes that the law firm landscape is an increasingly fluid job market with partners moving their practices between firms, the whole non-equity partnership position just locks up young attorneys with titles that mislead the market about where a lawyer is in their career. An entrepreneurial firm might have reached out to the Kirkland Special Counsel to see if the lawyer may be ready to take the next step — but a Kirkland “Partner” may not be the sort of person they’re looking for. The term “golden handcuffs” would be appropriate if the stumbling block involved money instead of an ultimately empty title.

Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, a 131-year old firm that was home to a future U.S. Supreme Court Justice and two New York governors, made a similar announcement this spring when it rolled out a two-tiered partnership. Its leaders said the move is intended to reward promising young lawyers earlier and make the firm more competitive in recruiting.

“It was getting harder to tell associates, ‘stick around for 10 years and see what happens then,’ ” said Willkie’s chairman, Steven Gartner. “They wanted more certainty and wanted it sooner.”

But there is no certainty, just a new title. A title that implies a terminal position when in reality it’s just a raise, often without the same perks — and by that, we mean bonuses — afforded to senior associates.

Can’t we all just go back to a reality-based vernacular? If the attorney is not a partner in the enterprise, they are not a “partner.” If attorneys want more recognition for career advancement, then do a better job of branding the importance of the firm’s counsel. This whole thing has gotten out of hand.

If the firms aren’t going to reverse course on this deequitization madness, then the only thing lawyers can do is market themselves. The market is flattening as barriers to relocating practices decline — non-equity partners need to be upfront about their status and avail themselves of firms willing to invest in their long-term career. Let the world know that you’re not an equity partner but that you want to be and seek out firms looking for go-getters tired of languishing in a limbo state.

Amid the crush of client work, is your firm [driving impactful content marketing](https://strategiesandvoices.org/Article-Details/driving-successful-and-impactful-content-marketing-an-lma23-recap)? (Partial credit if you know what “content marketing” is.)

Are you joining the [trend of the strategic sales initiative](https://strategiesandvoices.org/Article-Details/the-intersection-of-sales-and-law-innovative-firms-lead-the-way)? [Leveraging AI in creating new associate bios](https://strategiesandvoices.org/Article-Details/enhancing-efficiency-leveraging-the-power-of-ai-for-writing-associate-bios)?

To kick it off this week, we’ll be sharing insights from the Legal Marketing Association’s flagship annual conference in San Diego.

Then, in partnership with the LMA, we’ll be bringing you guidance from the top voices in legal business development and marketing throughout the year.

In this episode, I welcome Jennifer Henderson, a Partner with the legal recruiting firm, Major, Lindsey & Africa (MLA), to discuss why she decided to go to law school and how she ended up becoming a legal recruiter. She also talks about the current lateral market and provides advice for those looking to make a move. Additionally, she shares some tips on how to effectively negotiate with the candidate and the legal world’s stand on hiring people who are working remotely.



The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!


Kathryn Rubino is a Senior Editor at Above the Law, host of [The Jabot podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/1XC11QhFCWxWr4NQrk2sEA), and co-host of [Thinking Like A Lawyer](https://legaltalknetwork.com/podcasts/thinking-like-a-lawyer/).

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

[](http://atlbookofbusiness.libsyn.com/opening-a-new-legal-firm-episode-005)Welcome to the dog days of summer. The weather is hot, and the work is slow. So why not escape the office and hit the road?

In the latest episode of [Book of Business](http://atlbookofbusiness.libsyn.com/), the Biglaw-centric podcast that I host with veteran legal recruiter Robert Kinney, Founder and President of [Kinney Recruiting](http://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/), we do exactly that. First we stop by Philadelphia, where we break down the recent [departure of 12 lawyers from Reed Smith](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/12-lawyers-defect-from-reed-smith-as-holland-knight-opens-new-office-to-accommodate-them/?rf=1) to start the Philly office of Holland & Knight. Then we jet off to Asia, for a look at the Seoul and Hong Kong legal markets. Finally, we share our favorite travel tips, everything from getting over jet lag to getting wrinkles out of suits.

As much as Robert and I enjoy arguing chatting with each other, we welcome guests on the podcast as well (like Simpson Thacher partner Robert René Rabalais, who joined us for our [fourth episode](http://atlbookofbusiness.libsyn.com/robert-rabalais-from-simpson-thacher-bartlett-episode-4)). If you’re a partner at a leading law firm who might be interested in joining us on Book of Business, please feel free to email me and Robert Kinney, subject line “Book of Business.” I can be reached at [dlat@abovethelaw.com](mailto:dlat@abovethelaw.com?subject=Book%20of%20Business), and Robert Kinney can be reached at [robert@kinneyrecruiting.com](mailto:robert@kinneyrecruiting.com?subject=Book%20of%20Business).

# Biglaw Partner Leaves Firm To Represent Donald Trump In Criminal Case
## Bye-bye Biglaw, hello Trumpland.

Todd Blanche via Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft

Todd Blanche is no longer a partner at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. The reason appears to be fairly straightforward — the former assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York is headed for a new “opportunity,” representing Donald Trump[ in criminal court.](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/donald-trump-new-york-indictment-grand-jury/)

As [reported by](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/03/trump-todd-blanche-indictment-attorney-00090157) Politico, in an internal email, Blanche said he could not continue his work in Biglaw and represent the former president. “I have been asked to represent Trump in the recently charged DA case, and after much thought/consideration, I have decided it is the best thing for me to do and an opportunity I should not pass up.” He continued, “Obviously, doing this as a partner at Cadwalader was not an option, so I have had to make the difficult choice to leave the firm.” Cadwalader confirmed Blanche departed the firm.

Blanche joins Susan Necheles and Joe Tacopina in representing Trump. However, this isn’t Blanche’s first foray into the legal troubles in Trumpland. As [reported by](http://) Law360:

Blanche successfully defeated the Manhattan district attorney’s attempt to prosecute [Paul] Manafort for residential mortgage fraud on double jeopardy grounds, with both trial and appellate courts ruling that the onetime Trump campaign chief could not face state charges after his federal prosecution for the same conduct.

Blanche also represented former Rudy Giuliani associate Igor Fruman, who pled guilty to federal charges of soliciting illegal foreign political donations to boost a cannabis business. At a trial for Fruman’s co-defendants, Lev Parnas and Andrey Kukushkin, jurors saw photos of Fruman and Parnas posing with Trump, Giuliani, Donald Trump Jr., Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner.

The criminal charges against the former president are currently under seal, however, Trump is expected to be formally arraigned later today. At that time, he’ll be charged, finger-printed, potentially have his mugshot taken, and the indictment will [finally be unsealed](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/whats-an-arraignment-and-other-questions-answered-about-trumps-new-york-charges).

# Biglaw Firm Restores All Partner Pay After 5 Months Of COVID Cuts
## They carried the pandemic's burdens without cutting anyone else's pay.

Another day, another Biglaw firm that’s reversing its COVID-19 austerity measures.

This time, the good news is coming from Taft Law (formerly known as Taft Stettinius & Hollister). If you recall, back in April, the firm decided to [reduce partner draws](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/newly-merged-biglaw-firm-lays-off-attorneys-amid-covid-19-upheaval/) by 25 percent, leaving compensation for staff, associates, and of counsel attorneys intact. At the same time, the firm laid off 1.4 percent of its attorneys and 3.5 percent of its staff. We’ve been told that the firm’s partners received a treat for Halloween instead of a trick, because all of their pay was restored in full in October.

Here’s a statement that we received from the firm:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As a result of Taft’s performance, the firm reinstated 100% of its partner pay and made a one-time lump-sum repayment to all partners of the 25% partner pay reduction amounts which were previously announced. The reduced pay program remained in effect from April through August, a period of only five months, and then all previously reduced partner pay amounts were distributed to partners in October.

The partners must be thrilled after shouldering this financial burden. Congrats to all.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries or restoring previous cuts, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs/Salary%20Cuts) or text us (646-820-8477).

The firm of [Chadbourne & Parke](http://www.chadbourne.com/), founded [more than a century ago](http://www.chadbourne.com/about-us) (in 1902), is known for many things. It has an international bent, with 11 offices serving clients all over the world, and it boasts special strength in energy-related project finance. It’s ranked #76 in the [2017 Vault rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/move-over-wachtell-theres-a-new-firm-at-the-top-vault-top-100-firms-2017/) and #124 in the [Am Law 200](http://www.americanlawyer.com/law-firm-profiles-result?firmname=Chadbourne+%26+Parke).

And now it can be known for paying market-rate salaries, as you’d expect from a firm with these credentials. As a delighted tipster reported:

Chadbourne & Parke just matched the Cravath scale! Managing partner [Andy Giaccia](http://www.chadbourne.com/agiaccia) announced it at a firm-wide lunch meeting this afternoon, thunderous applause all around.

From a second source:

Chadbourne just matched Cravath scale effective July 1 at its all-attorney meeting today, and gave everyone what sounds like two work-from-home days each month as part of some new program in addition to new laptops. Very happy about all of this.

Chadbourne is matching in all U.S. offices — New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C. — up through the class of 2008 getting $315K. No word on [counsel salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/whats-up-with-counsel-salaries/).

Memo on the next page. We understand that summers are getting raises as well — they were present at the firm-wide meeting — but they’re not mentioned in the memo.

They are terrified of the unknown. The one thing law firms don’t like is unknown. We don’t know what is going to happen, and all indications are there are still significant headwinds in transactions. Nobody wants to give out wild bonuses and at the same time pulling a Cooley.

Giving extraordinary bonuses right now is fraught with peril. They are scared shitless.

— The leader of an Am Law 25 Biglaw firm, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/12/01/terrified-of-the-unkown-whats-behind-the-delay-in-announcing-associate-bonuses/) on why the Am Law 200 has been so slow to match year-end bonuses this year. Bonus season is usually a whirlwind of activity, but thus far, not as many firms as usual have decided to enter the bonus fray yet. Click [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/biglaw-bonus-tracker-2022/) to track which firms have announced their 2022 bonuses.

# Prosecutor Rips Biglaw Billing Practices While Downgrading Manslaughter Charges Against Alec Baldwin

In order to avoid further litigious distractions by Mr. Baldwin and his attorneys, the District Attorney and the special prosecutor have removed the firearm enhancement to the involuntary manslaughter charges in the death of Halyna Hutchins on the “Rust” film set.

The prosecution’s priority is securing justice, not securing billable hours for big-city attorneys.

— Sante Fe District Attorney [Mary Carmack-Altwies](https://www.1stjda.com/), in a statement made after [dropping a gun enhancement charge](https://abc7chicago.com/charge-against-baldwin-in-shooting-dropped-to-avoid-further-litigi/12852448/) against [Alec Baldwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin) for his involvement in the [shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/alec-baldwin-charged-with-involuntary-manslaughter-in-shooting-death-of-cinematographer/). Baldwin’s lawyer, Quinn Emanuel partner [Luke Nikas](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/nikas-luke/), had earlier [argued in a fiery motion](https://lawandcrime.com/live-trials/alec-baldwin/alec-baldwin-rips-prosecutors-over-elementary-legal-error-says-hes-ineligible-for-5-year-sentence-enhancement/) that prosecutors in the case had “committed an unconstitutional and elementary legal error” by charging Baldwin under a statute that didn’t exist at the time of the shooting. Now that the enhancement charge, which carried with it a mandatory five-year sentence, has been dropped, Baldwin faces a lesser sentence of 18 months if convicted of involuntary manslaughter.

# Biglaw Is Paying 'Almost 50% Above' Magic Circle Peers

Biglaw associates in the United States are well familiar with thanking Cravath (and Milbank and Davis Polk) for doing the lord’s work in bumping up salaries, but U.K. attorneys are also learning that fact. New research reveals that U.K. firms that have their salaries pegged to the U.S. dollar are paying associates “almost 50% above” what Magic Circle firms are paying. Wow.

According to [reporting by ](https://www.legalcheek.com/2022/08/us-firm-salaries-almost-50-above-magic-circle-rivals-thanks-to-favourable-exchange-rates/)Legal Cheek, the difference all comes down to exchange rates:

This comes after favourable exchange rates saw [Akin Gump](https://www.legalcheek.com/firm/akin-gump/)‘s NQ salary [rise in its GBP value to £179,000](https://www.legalcheek.com/2022/07/akin-gump-nq-lawyer-salaries-hit-record-179000/). At present, [Clifford Chance](https://www.legalcheek.com/firm/clifford-chance/) and [Freshfields](https://www.legalcheek.com/firm/freshfields/) offer £125k NQ rates, whilst [Linklaters](https://www.legalcheek.com/firm/linklaters/) and [Allen & Overy](https://www.legalcheek.com/firm/allen-overy/) pay £107,500. [Slaughter and May](https://www.legalcheek.com/firm/slaughter-and-may/)‘s NQ pay sits in between these duos at £115k.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Dan Harris, director at consulting firm Robert Walter that did the salary research, said, “It truly has been the perfect storm. A combination of Brexit, a delayed start in degrees, and a pause in junior hires in 2020 has left many law firms scrambling to fill the gaping hole in their talent pipeline.”

# The Many, Many Obstacles To Biglaw Diversity

Kathryn Rubino joins Joe for a discussion of the latest Mansfield Rule efforts and the problem of lagging Biglaw diversity generally.

This announcement marks a new era for A&O and the legal industry. Harvey AI is not just another platform, but a game-changer that will enable us to deliver unprecedented value, efficiency and innovation to our clients. We are proud to be the first law firm to partner with Harvey AI. We share their vision of using technology to enhance and transform legal services.

— [Wim Dejonghe](https://www.allenovery.com/en-gb/global/people/Wim-Dejonghe), a senior partner at Allen & Overy, in a statement concerning [the Biglaw firm’s integration of Harvey](https://www.allenovery.com/en-gb/global/news-and-insights/news/ao-announces-exclusive-launch-partnership-with-harvey), an innovative AI platform that uses the same model as ChatGPT, but has been enhanced for legal work. Harvey operates in “multiple languages” and can automate legal work with “unmatched efficiency, quality and intelligence.” According to a press release from A&O, “Whilst the output needs careful review by an A&O lawyer, Harvey can help generate insights, recommendations and predictions based on large volumes of data, enabling lawyers to deliver faster, smarter and more cost-effective solutions to their clients.”

# The 2020 Biglaw Diversity Scorecard
## There's been progress -- but not that much.

Year in and year out, we watch law firm after law firm pay lip service to their commitment to diversity in the legal profession, with promises to recruit, retain, and promote more minority attorneys. Despite these continued assurances, and despite the fact that a number of firms have made great efforts to improve the stature of their diverse hires in the law, there is still much more to be done. If there’s ever going to be any real change in the legal industry, diversity has to be more than just a buzzword — it must be a priority at every law firm.

According to the American Lawyer’s 2020 Diversity Scorecard — a ranking that tracks the average number of full-time-equivalent minority attorneys (both partners and nonpartners) at Am Law 200 and National Law Journal 250 law firms — there’s been [some progress](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/05/26/the-2020-diversity-scorecard-shows-progress-but-its-more-precarious-than-ever/) over the past year, but it’s been slight:

As in years past, the bulk of the minority representation at the top firms lies in their ranks of Asian and Hispanic attorneys. Black partners are vastly underrepresented among the top firms in the scorecard. …

Since 2010, the total share of minority attorneys included in the Diversity Scorecard grew by an average of 0.9 percent each year. This year did not buck the trend: The total share of minority attorneys grew by 0.9 percent, from 16.9 percent to 17.8 percent.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The firm that took top honors this year — Berry Appleman & Leiden — is a newcomer to the list, pushing Fragomen down to second place after a year as the nation’s most diverse firm. Overall, 71 firms had at least 20 percent minority attorneys (an improvement over last year’s numbers, which saw 55 firms meet that benchmark), and seven firms had at least 20 percent minority partners.

Half of Berry Appleman’s attorneys, 49.7 percent, identify as a racial minority, and 22.7 percent of the firm’s partnership are minority attorneys, according to ALM data. Berry Appleman did not respond to a request for comment.

The second-highest scoring firm—immigration shop Fragomen—reports that 35.1 percent of its head count is composed of minority attorneys. Fragomen did report a higher share of minority partners than Berry Appleman, 24.4 percent.

# Magic Circle Firm Suspends Partner Distributions And Freezes Attorney Pay
## Doing everything they can to avoid layoffs.

Magic Circle firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer is a giant international player with $1,967,034,000 in gross revenue in 2018 and more than 1,400 attorneys on the pay roll. And amid the COVID-19 economic downturn, the firm is doing everything possible to keep all those attorneys — and their legion of staff — gainfully employed.

In order to avoid any layoffs or furloughs the firm has instituted a series of austerity measures aimed at maintaining cash flow. As reported [by Law.com](https://www.law.com/2020/05/08/pay-cuts-layoffs-and-more-how-law-firms-are-managing-the-pandemic/), that includes suspending quarterly partner distributions. Plus lawyer pay globally has been frozen and bonus decisions — typically made in April — will be postponed until September. Freshfields is also considering optional reduced hours for employees that want that flexibility.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
A spokesperson at the firm provided the following statement on the move:

“We have historically matched the competitive NY/DC associate pay scale and expect to do so again this year. We remain bullish on our growth and expansion plans in the US. In fact, we have added 20 associates in the US in the past six months, including 10 lateral M&A associates in New York, and have continued recruiting and hiring in our key US practices throughout the pandemic.

For our people outside the US, salary and bonus decisions were to be made in late April coincident with our April 30 year-end—the equivalent of COVID-19 hitting the US market in November right as NYC firms are determining year-end bonuses. Many of our competitors in Europe had already announced they are skipping bonuses entirely. Although the firm just ended one of the best years in its more than 275-year history, a decision was made to postpone bonus decisions until September to have better visibility on how the pandemic would impact our business. In light of that postponement, partners offered to defer their year-end profit distribution until September. However, they continue to receive their quarterly distributions to cover tax payments and their regular monthly draws on the usual schedule.”

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

Last month, I wrote an article about how some law firms may [reopen their offices as soon as they are legally able to do so](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/will-some-law-firms-reopen-their-offices-too-soon/), even if it may be safer for people to stay home. Many law firm managers are likely upset that they have to pay high rents for offices that are not occupied and may also think that returning to the office may lead to greater collaboration among employees. However, perhaps the biggest reason why many law firms might be looking to reopen their offices as soon as possible is because productivity and billing are down at many firms due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some managers may think that employees will work more efficiently and bill more hours if they return to offices. Nevertheless, there are many reasons to believe that forcing employees back to offices too soon may not increase productivity, and managers should not rush to reopen workplaces for the sake of productivity.

One of the biggest reasons why returning to offices may not increase productivity is that employees need to waste time commuting to offices when they can log onto work almost instantly at home. In many metropolitan areas, it regularly takes an hour or more to commute to the office and to return home after the workday. In addition, many public transportation options have been curtailed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which can lead to even longer commutes and many headaches for people who do not have alternative transportation.

Although attorneys and staff can perform some work tasks while commuting, it is nearly impossible to conduct most legal tasks while in a car, train, or bus on the way to work or back home. As a result, by forcing employees to return to their offices, firms are likely eliminating several hours a day that attorneys are able to bill and be productive. As such, keeping people at home may actually increase the amount of billing opportunities available to employees and lead to a higher productivity level than can be achieved in the office.

Another reason why forcing employees back to the office may not improve productivity is because this might increase stress levels in an already difficult time for most people. It is safe to say that life has become much more complicated over the past several months than it was before the pandemic. For instance, many people need to arrange childcare and oversee schoolwork in ways they did not need to before schools and childcare programs were closed. In addition, it is much more difficult for people to obtain goods and services due to social distancing guidelines. Requiring attorneys to come to work in this environment may drive down productivity, since this may impose an additional burden on many employees. Allowing workers to stay at home may afford the flexibility people need to satisfy all of the responsibilities they must fulfill in their private lives and bill the most amount of hours possible.

In addition, forcing people back to offices may decrease productivity because morale may be impacted by this move. Individuals are justifiably concerned that returning to work puts them at a greater risk of being exposed to COVID-19 than if firms just continue stay-at-home procedures. Even if employees themselves are healthy and are unlikely to develop complications from COVID-19, it is possible that they live with people who may have issues or visit regularly with such individuals. No one wants to work hard for a firm that seems like it is putting productivity over the health and welfare of employees, and allowing attorneys and staff to work from home might boost morale and productivity. In addition, forcing employees back to offices most likely increases the chance that workers will be exposed to COVID-19, which could lead to substantial interruptions and may greatly affect the productivity of infected employees and anyone who might have been in contact with them.

Of course, there are situations in which reopening offices may increase productivity among attorneys and staff. For instance, some attorneys and staff may not have a good home office available and can be more efficient if they come to work to conduct tasks. In addition, some employees may want to come to the office in order to get away from kids that may distract them from conducting work at home. Still others genuinely like going to the office in order to see colleagues and be social, and this can increase their morale and productivity.

Many firms in the New York and New Jersey area (where I practice) have begun making a return to the office optional, which has been welcomed by numerous associates. So long as being in the office is truly a choice, and there is no pressure if employees stay home, this can allow associates to make informed decisions about how they can be most productive. However, forcing many attorneys and staff to work in an office full time right now might lower productivity, since it may increase stress and decrease the time employees have to work on matters.

When I first started practicing law, I worked at a large firm that had numerous practice areas. One of the partners stated that the size of the firm was one of its biggest assets since clients could rely on our firm for almost all of their needs. Of course, it can be convenient for clients to only have to deal with one law firm since there may be inefficiencies associated with communicating with multiple attorneys at different law firms. However, clients often benefit from relying on multiple different kinds of law firms to handle their legal work.

For instance, clients can often save money by relying on different law firms for different types of projects. For bet-the-company matters, clients may be best served by large “fancy” law firms that typically charge higher rates. Such firms can apply significant resources to a matter to ensure that a client has the best possibility of success, which is important if the stakes are high in a given case.

However, some law firms can charge several times more per hour than smaller law firms charge to clients. As a result, it often does not make sense for clients to use large and expensive law firms on smaller matters. Moreover, some types of legal work are best handled using a flat rate or alternative fee arrangement, which is usually harder for a larger law firm to charge. Accordingly, many clients, including big companies, may be able to protect their bottom lines by using smaller law firms for such matters.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Despite the cost savings of smaller shops, I have seen clients rely on large firms for all of their work. Perhaps the clients simply did not want to interact with new counsel in order to fulfil their legal needs, and maybe cost was not a factor. However, clients might be limited when it comes to settlement strategies if they use a large and expensive firm for a matter, and for this reason, most clients should have a bench of different law firms available to handle a given legal matter.

Sometimes, clients can benefit from using multiple law firms on a single matter. It is usually pretty rare for a client to hire to different teams of lawyers to handle a matter. The more lawyers a client hires, the more legal costs a client will eventually pay for legal services, and most clients are cost-conscious when they make choices about their legal representation. In addition, there may be inefficiencies in having multiple law firms handle a matter, since the law firms may not be on the same page and may have communication issues.

The only time I really saw a client hire two different law firms to handle a matter was in Biglaw. Our client was a massive company facing a nasty class action. In order to deal with the lawsuit, the client hired us and another major law firm. The client assigned certain tasks for our team to perform and asked the other firm to perform other tasks on the case.

We worked harder on that matter than on any other case I can remember. My bosses really wanted to get more work from that client, so we put our best foot forward and applied our top resources to provide excellent services for the client. There were some drawbacks to this arrangement that I might have to save for another article, but suffice it to say that the client got better representation (albeit perhaps at a greater financial cost) than if the client had only hired one firm to perform the work.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Another time when it pays to hire multiple law firms is if the case is entering a stage of the litigation in which a particular firm has expertise. For instance, appeals are a complicated and tricky process since appellate lawyers need to know the printing guidelines and deadlines associated with perfecting an appeal. As a result, it is not uncommon for some law firms to just specialize in appeals, and I know a few law firms that just handle appeals assigned by other firms. In addition, trial work is somewhat specialized since not too many cases go to trial and even fewer cases reach a verdict. As a result, many law firms specialize in trials, and if a case is entering this stage of the litigation, it may pay to hire a firm specializing in trials to ensure that a client gets the best representation possible.

All told, sometimes clients have strong connections to their counsel and they may not wish to use multiple law firms to handle their portfolio of legal work. However, clients can realize a number of benefits if they rely on a deep bench of law firms to handle their legal work, and in some instances, if they use multiple law firms on a single legal matter.

# New Biglaw Firm Alert: Troutman Pepper And Locke Lord In Merger Negotiations
## Mega firm in the making?

The big in Biglaw just [keep getting bigger](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-2024-am-law-100-ranking-is-here/). And if a firm can’t pull down the $7 billion in revenue that mega-firm Kirkland can, merging their way to mammoth status is a great option.

Towards that end, American Lawyer [confirms](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/04/18/troutman-pepper-and-locke-lord-in-merger-talks-to-create-new-am-law-50-law-firm/) that Troutman Pepper Hamilton Sanders and Locke Lord are currently in merger talks. The firms’ official statement on the matter reads as follows, “Troutman Pepper and Locke Lord can confirm they have entered into discussions about a possible combination. Our first priority is delivering exceptional legal services to our clients, and as such, we will have no further comments at this time.”

So… how would Troutman Locke stack up in the Biglaw? The combined firm would boast about 1.600 attorneys almost certainly rank in the Am Law 50. Based on 2023 numbers, the combo firm would have roughly $1.570 billion in revenue ($1.072 billion from Troutman and Locke Lord kicking in $497.6 million), placing it 28th overall. Not too shabby.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

Of course, there would also be redundancies — the firms each have offices in the following 7 cities: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. But some of the overlap between the firms could actually be a benefit:

Kent Zimmermann, a consultant at Zeughauser Group, said a merger will allow the firms to assume a more dominant market leader position in a number of industry sectors, which tends to build demand and result in more pricing power.

Zimmermann has for the last decade advised Troutman Pepper, and a predecessor firm, on strategy and growth and on the merger talks. He said the shared industry sector strengths attracted the firms to each other.

“It’s part of why they started talking,” he said.

The sectors are energy, insurance, health care and life sciences, private equity, financial services and real estate, he said.

That mutual focus on those sectors is important, he said, because two common threads in successful law firm combinations are shared strengths and shared market aspirations.

A combination would also allow both firms to grow geographically and achieve growth priorities.

While we don’t know precisely how advanced the merger talks are, they aren’t finalized. A combination would require partner votes at both firms, neither of which have yet been scheduled.

# EC/VC And The Biglaw Tech Firm -- An Overview By A Former Gunderson Associate
## Tech-focused firms have extremely cool work, clients, and cultures, and the sector in which they operate has been experiencing tremendous and consistent growth.

If you’re a corporate associate with top credentials, you probably accepted an offer through on-campus interviewing from a prestigious, Chambers-ranked practice. It’s equally likely that nobody told you to take a serious look at elite Emerging Companies/Venture Capital (“EC/VC”) practices at Gunderson, Cooley, Fenwick, Goodwin, and the other top “Tech” firms.

While you may not have heard all of these names or the term “EC/VC” during law school, you almost certainly have now, and there’s a reason why. These growing Tech shops have extremely cool work, clients, and cultures, and the sector in which they operate has been experiencing tremendous and consistent growth. Take it from someone who practiced in Gunderson’s Corporate group and is constantly working with folks trying to enter into or pivot within the EC/VC space. (For a bit more on my background, check out this [interview](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/introducing-stephen-damato/) I did with my colleague [David Lat](https://www.laterallink.com/team/david-lat/).)

For those who want more information on these practices and firms, I strongly encourage you to reach out to [me](https://www.laterallink.com/team/stephen-damato/) at sdamato@laterallink.com. In the interim, here is a high-level rundown on substance, clients, development, culture, and how/when to get in the door:

Substance

- The typical model of an EC/VC practice is to (1) serve as quasi-in-house counsel to startups and emerging companies throughout their life cycles and (2) advise top VC firms on their formation, operations, and investments.
- In practice and on the corporate side of the house, this means forming the company, managing the capitalization table (“cap table”), staying on top of governance matters, leading venture financings through which these companies receive funding from institutional and private investors, negotiating commercial agreements, and generally working hand-in-hand with the business principals to steer the company toward an exit (e.g., an IPO or sale).
Clients

- The client base ranges from a cool startup recently founded by young Harvard or Stanford grads to unicorns (i.e., privately held startups valued in excess of $1 billion) to public tech giants.
- Compared to their colleagues in other practice areas, associates in EC/VC practices can have meaningful business development opportunities. For example, after less than a year at Gunderson, I was able to bring on a friend of a friend’s LA-based startup as a client, then took the lead on their Series Seed financing.
Development

- These practices enable their associates to work directly with C-Suite executives and other major players on business teams.
- This often takes the form of explaining material terms of a venture financing to the board and existing stockholders so that they understand their respective rights and obligations.
- It also involves cluing in the founders on stuff they really care about, like the extent to which they’re being diluted by a financing or equity grants to new hires and highly-valued employees (remember the scene at the end of The Social Network when Eduardo Saverin smashes a laptop on Mark Zuckerberg’s desk?).
- One of the key and purposeful byproducts of the nature of the work and extremely lean staffing is that associates can get an intimate look under the hood of their clients’ businesses from day one – something that not only makes a lawyer’s role more rewarding, but yields the best quality of work. Associates can witness the bigger picture firsthand and understand the practical implications of changes they’re making in documents.
- Because EC/VC lawyers work closely with their clients and truly learn their clients’ businesses, they are often the first candidates the client will consider when starting or growing a legal department – so if you want to go in-house eventually, the EC/VC space is one of the best launching pads.
Culture

- Based on my experience, the best way to describe the culture at the top Tech firms is that the vibe feels more like a startup than a law firm.
- You’ll rarely see people in business formal attire, and both associates and partners actually use the common areas to hang out and have conversations that surpass “what are you working on?”
How/When to Get In

- These practices have been extremely busy, and many are hiring now with 2020 and 2021 start dates.
- At the same time, there is a ton of demand in the market for associate positions at the top Tech firms, so you’ll absolutely need to have a good firm and law school on your CV.
- On timing, if you’re in a corporate group (ideally a deal lawyer) and do not have EC/VC experience, you’ll want to start seriously considering a pivot in the middle or end of your second year – largely because it’s ideal to retool sooner rather than later.
- If you do have EC/VC experience, the main consideration is whether your firm is feeding you the right development opportunities and a wide enough range of work (e.g., make sure you’re getting some M&A and IPO experience and not just pure venture financings, and vice versa).
If you can’t already tell, I’m a huge advocate for the Tech industry and the top EC/VC practices. In a world where a lateral move on its face may seem like a riskier proposition than usual, it’s smart to think about whether staying the course is in reality a greater risk than pursuing a role in an extremely active and growing space.

If you’re a Biglaw corporate associate with superb credentials and an interest in EC/VC work, please drop me a line at [sdamato@laterallink.com](mailto:sdamato@laterallink.com). I’d be happy to expand on this overview and give you more specifics, provide you with a market overview and tell you which Tech firms are hiring, and explore specific opportunities with you if you’re interested. Thanks!

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Yet Another Firm To Move Back-Office Operations Offsite; Will There Be Layoffs?
## Which firm is hoping to get lucky in Kentucky?

Another day, another law firm that’s hopped on board the onshore outsourcing bandwagon. As we wondered back in [June 2014](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/06/another-law-firm-jumps-on-the-administrative-hub-bandwagon/), “Is having your back-office functions handled on-site — i.e., in the same location as the lawyers being serviced — now a luxury? More and more law firms are adopting the model of sending their administrative support functions to lower-cost locations.”

Two years have passed, and in the interim, several firms have searched for, and found, a money-saving solution to their back-office woes by shipping their support staffers far, far away. From Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Nashville, Tennessee, Biglaw firms have had success in shipping their operations hubs to distant, low-priced locales.

Today’s news brings us information on yet another law firm that’s decided to relocate its administrative services operations, and while this isn’t its first time at the rodeo when it comes to making such a bold move, it’s the first time that the firm will have the opportunity to do so in the United States.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The firm in question is Hogan Lovells, and although it already has a business services center that’s located in Johannesburg, South Africa, it’s now looking to open a similar business center in Louisville, Kentucky. Here’s a report from the [Courier-Journal](http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2016/02/25/law-firm-adding-up-250-high-paying-jobs/80924760/):

Hogan Lovells, a leading international law firm, has selected Louisville as home for its second global business services center, with an $8.9 million investment projected to create 250 high-quality jobs paying an average of more than $65,000 per year. …

The firm’s plans include hiring 100 people in the Louisville office within the first year, gradually building to around 250 in the eighth year.

The Hogan Lovells business center will be Louisville’s first of its kind. If you’re wondering why the firm chose this city instead of another one where Biglaw firms have already had success (like Kansas City, Missouri, which already houses the operations centers of Littler Mendelson and Sedgwick), it may be because Hogan Lovells will receive an incentive package worth up to $4 million to assist in its getting lucky in Kentucky.

According to the firm, operations in Louisville would include the following departments: finance, accounting, human resources, information technology, and legal support staff. Some paralegals and attorneys may eventually be moved to the Louisville location as well. The average hourly wage at this location will be $31.

Will there be layoffs? Time will tell. Here are [statements from two HoLove](http://www.hoganlovells.com/hogan-lovells-to-establish-global-business-services-center-in-louisville-kentucky-02-25-2016/) executives on why the move was made:

“We have concluded that a significant number of our business services need to remain close to our lawyers while others can be readily performed from a remote location with no impact to quality,” said Alice Valder Curran, Hogan Lovells’ Washington, DC Regional Managing Partner. “The key is to find a location with quality and readily available personnel in a time zone that can support our Americas offices.”

“We chose Louisville as it has an excellent supply of talented people, is well placed in terms of time zones and offers good opportunities for cost savings when compared to Washington, DC and a number of our other existing office locations,” said Cole Finegan, Hogan Lovells’ Regional Managing Partner for the Americas.

Congratulations to Hogan Lovells for finding a new way to pad partners’ pockets, and condolences to support staff who may be forced to choose between their locations and their livelihoods. If you have any additional information on the firm’s plans, please text us at 646-820-TIPS (646-820-8477) or email us at [tips@abovethelaw.com](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com).

# Top 25 Biglaw Firm Updates Bonus Policy: Special Bonuses For All, Plus Supplemental Bonuses!

It may be the middle of February 2021, but Biglaw’s 2020 bonus season is still rolling. Which top 25 Biglaw firm knew how to make its associates’ Valentine’s Day extra special this year?

That would be Paul Hastings, a firm that brought in $1,268,910,000 gross revenue in 2019, landing it in the 24th spot on the most recent Am Law 100 ranking. If you recall, back in December 2020, the firm [announced its year-end bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/paul-hastings-bonus-2020/), and of course included special bonuses. Here’s the scale:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
At the time, those special bonuses were only available for “qualifying associates”, i.e., those who had billed enough. Associates were understandably [very upset](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/paul-hastings-bonus-2020/).

This past Friday, the firm announced an update about its regular bonuses and special bonuses that was sure to please all associates.

As an expression of the Firm’s gratitude for the contribution of our associates to the success of our clients throughout the year, we are pleased to announce that associates who qualify for a Year-End Bonus but did not receive the Special Bonus in December will be awarded the Special Bonus in March in addition to their Year-End Bonus.

Supplemental bonuses may also be awarded to associates who have made exceptional contributions in the past year. An award that exceeds the baseline bonus is a significant achievement.

That’s right: Everyone who qualified for a regular bonus will now receive a special bonus, too. On top of that, supplemental bonuses are now on the table. Paul Hastings sure knows how to make its associates feel loved. Congratulations to all!

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Biglaw Firm Finally Raises Salaries, But Will Make Associates Wait Until Fall To See More Cash
## Hurry up and wait for your new salaries, associates.

Finally. That must be what associates at this Biglaw firm are saying to themselves today amid breathless sighs. Their firm finally decided it was time to raise salaries. After all, it’s been a month and a half since Cravath forced the rest of the Biglaw world to make moves on their compensation scales; their firm was the last salary holdout in their city. Day after day, week after week, we received countless emails from associates, begging — nay, pleading — for information as to whether their firm would ever make a move.

If you haven’t guessed by now, the firm we’re speaking about Mintz Levin. Here’s a small sampling of what we’ve heard from the understandably angry associates there:

• Has Mintz Levin raised salaries?

• …radio silence from Mintz Levin. Are we the only Boston based firm yet to say something one way or another?

• Has Mintz Levin raised salaries?

• Mintz Levin refuses to match the new salary scale after a record year of profits. Associates and summers are FURIOUS at the greediness.

• Has Mintz Levin raised salaries?

• Lots of frustrated associates here at Mintz Levin, which I believe is the last large firm in Boston to remain on the $160k scale. It’s a real slap in the face after the firm just had its most profitable year ever, especially since about a dozen firms with comparable PPP have raised.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Today, word came from on high (courtesy of managing member [Robert Bodian](https://www.mintz.com/professionals/detail/name/robert-i-bodian)) that associates would, in fact, be seeing a pay raise to nearly match the Cravath scale:



While senior associates at Mintz Levin will not see the $315K salary that Cravath has pledged to pay its more senior associates, that’s not where the bad news ends. Associates at Mintz Levin won’t be seeing their new salaries until October 1, making it one of the handful of firms that has decided to push off wage increases in an effort to keep paying their associates below-market salaries for a few months.

Congratulations on your prospective raises, Mintz Levin associates. We hope that you’ll be happier, less frustrated, and less furious in a few months.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

[Last month](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/alt-legal-the-stickiness-of-biglaw-prestige-and-the-disruptive-potential-of-technology-part-i-of-ii/?rf=1), we explored why Cravath is (and remains) Cravath — i.e., the best of the best.  Today, we explore how a company which [claims to](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/upsetting-the-applecart-of-legal-research/) have “mapped the legal genome” could one day help Biglaw upstarts prove that they deserve to shop for white shoes at Cravath’s bespoke cobbler.

First, a quick reminder of Part I:  Summarizing the findings of [Tomorrowland](https://www.amazon.com/Growth-Is-Dead-firms-brink/dp/1481896040) (the excellent book by legal economist [Bruce MacEwen](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/01/alt-legal-the-new-law-firm-taxonomy-and-one-thats-doin-it-well/)), we saw that in Biglaw, rankings of legal prestige remains rock solid (low volatility for those of you who watch the market), while the business world outside of law is in a state of unprecedented flux.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Bruce proposed the following fundamental paradox about the creation and maintenance of Biglaw prestige:

“The firms with the strongest brand names are those deemed to provide the highest quality – and the way you can be assured they’re of the exceptional quality is because they have strong brands.”

Put another way, “in the absence of facts, the best predictor of weather tomorrow is weather today.”  But what if there were “facts”?  What if a machine could actually tell us which firms produce the best legal work product? Would legal look more like retail, with a legal Amazon right around the corner?

For Part Two, I sat down with Columbia Law grad and former Google engineer, [Itai Gurari.](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/itai-gurari/) Itai is the founder of [Judicata](https://www.judicata.com/), and he believes his product can predict the weather tomorrow, based on facts today.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“a mystery. Its website teased visitors with the promise of a forthcoming legal research service that would be better than any other, and it had $8 million in financing from some big-name investors, including PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel and Box founders Aaron Levie and Dylan Smith.”

Well, today we sit down with Itai to unravel this mystery, solve The MacEwen Paradox and learn — which Biglaw firm is best!

Enjoy:

Joe Borstein: What I call Stickiness, you have compared to Newton’s first law of motion.  Can you walk our readers through that analogy?

Itai Gurari:  Newton’s first law of motion says that a body in motion will remain in motion unless it is acted upon by an external force.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Prestige in the law has historically followed the same behavior. The firms that were most prestigious last year will be the most prestigious this year. That’s because we haven’t had access to objective measures of lawyer quality. We’ve been forced to rely on subjective measures like reputation, and simple proxies like revenue-per-partner, both of which are incredibly self-reinforcing. The most prestigious law firms attract the wealthiest clients. Those clients are willing to pay the highest hourly rates. Those higher rates burnish the law firm’s reputation and increase the law firm’s revenue. This makes them all the more prestigious.

It takes a really big external force for a firm to slip (which Skadden’s Ukraine-related work and the van der Zwaan guilty plea may prove to be).

JB: But do you really believe there is a truly objective measure of law firm quality?

IG: I don’t believe there is a single truly objective measure of law firm quality that supersedes all other measures.

I do, however, believe there are multiple objective measures of law firm quality, and that law firms can be accurately evaluated upon them.

JB: How have you and Judicata sought to capture that reality?

IG: We’ve focused on one particular measure of law firm quality and that is motion drafting.

Just as there are best practices for persuasive writing, and there are best practices for legal writing, there are also best practices for drafting motions. We are taught to write clearly and persuasively for a reason — because it helps us tell our client’s story in a convincing and compelling way.

This includes basics like not having typos, and citing and quoting cases correctly. It also includes more sophisticated techniques like relying on cases that go your way, relying on cases that are less likely to be distinguished, and having a good balance of arguments. Briefs that do these things tend to win more.

At Judicata, we built a detailed map of California law and software that can read briefs to recognize when they are not following these best practices. Many lawyers at prestigious law firms think they’re doing a great job, but they’re making mistakes left and right — mistakes that their clients would be shocked to find out about (especially when these motions cost tens of thousands of dollars to research and write).

We recently evaluated briefs filed by the 20 largest law firms in California and 45% of those firms had misspelled the name of the judge in a brief they filed.

JB: Wow, ouch!  So other than that shocking outcome, how did the rest of the results come out?  How well do they match the old predictors of prestige?

IG: Our ability to objectively evaluate the motion drafting of these law firms allowed us to rank their litigation practices. The results did include some surprises:

- Morgan, Lewis & Bockius
- DLA Piper
- Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe
- Jones Day
- Lewis Brisbois
- Sidley Austin
- Morrison & Foerster
- Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher
- Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan
- Fenwick & West
- Paul Hastings
- Perkins Coie
- Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati
- Seyfarth Shaw
- Latham & Watkins
- Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman
- Littler Mendelson
- Cooley
- O’Melveny & Myers
- Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton
While all the firms are in the Am Law 100, it’s a largely different group than those at the top of the Vault prestige ranking, which skews heavily towards New York City law firms servicing Wall Street’s deal needs. But I have to admit that I was happy to see Jones Day landing quite high in our rankings, as I was previously an associate in their New York office and I still have good friends at the firm.

The thing about the ranking and our analysis is that there are consistent and significant differences between the law firms at the top and bottom of our ranking, which leads us to believe that the differences reflect firm-wide issues with training, technology utilization, and process. Much of the work falls on associates, and if they are not properly trained or given the right tools, then quality control problems crop up — just like at my local Five Guys restaurant that often overcooks and under-salts the french fries. Occasionally I have to ask for a new order of fries — which I get! — but a client can’t ask for a re-do if their lawyers underperformed and they lost their motion for summary judgment.

JB: So can new firms use this analysis to monitor their skill and improve their prestige in the long run?

IG: Yes. Clerk — our tool that performs this analysis — is being used by lawyers and courts and the reception has been excellent. It’s presently limited to litigation involving California state law, but it’s already having a big impact.

It’s also worth noting that the software is not just useful for evaluating your own briefs. Clerk is also great for identifying weaknesses and areas of attack in your opponent’s briefs. One of Clerk’s neater features is that it will identify when your opponent is modifying or misquoting the law, which happens a lot. For example, we recently came across a brief where the lawyers misrepresented the law by adding the word “reasonable” to a statement of a particular legal principle .

JB: Very interesting!  So, aside from Clerk, what makes Judicata special?  Where does it fit in the legal ecosystem, and how does it compare to the big guys (West and Lexis) and the other exciting upstarts (like [Casetext](https://casetext.com/))?

IG: We’re focused on building the most intelligent legal research and drafting platform for lawyers in California. That narrow jurisdictional focus has allowed us to produce smarter technology and more accurate data. Those are crucial to building an advanced tool like Clerk, which is unlike anything else on the market.

The result is that Judicata helps lawyers win. One of our first beta users worked at a non-profit and beat a major Am Law 100 law firm because of his access to Judicata. He and his opponents had one hour to research an issue and our user was able to find the only on point case in under 10 minutes on Judicata, while it took the other side the full hour. That gave him the time to craft the winning argument and beat the half dozen lawyers that were arrayed against him.

JB:  Thanks Itai, very interesting stuff.  Anything else you’d like to say to the budding legal entrepreneurs out there?

IG: Building a legal tech business is hard, but it’s a lot more fun than practicing law!

# Biglaw Firm Finally Finds Kanye West, Dumps Him As Client
## The firm has finally reached the long overdue end of this saga.

After months of searching high and low for their embattled client Kanye West, Greenberg Traurig has finally found the rapper — and dumped him.

The top Biglaw firm had long been trying to part ways with Ye in the wake of his antisemitic remarks. It wasn’t the first firm to do so; in fact, GT was going to be the fifth, but the troubled musical icon had apparently gone into hiding after praising Hitler, making the task all the more difficult.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The search to find the rap legend proved to be so difficult that GT asked a judge if the firm could serve West with notice of its withdrawal [via newspaper](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/kanye-west-greenberg-traurig-dump-client-newspapers/), but that request was later denied. Luckily, the firm was able to track him down at the end of January. [Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/kanye-west-lawyers-find-months-searching-quit-2023-2) has the scoop:

The rapper … had fled his other residences and his business addresses. He was found at a location “primarily used by persons and entities not affiliated with Ye or his businesses,” according to lawyers for Greenberg Traurig.

“The address at which Ye was personally served is not one that is publicly affiliated with Ye or his businesses, but one that Ye nonetheless frequents,” a Greenberg Traurig wrote in a court filing.

Greenberg Traurig put the address where Ye was served under seal to maintain their former client’s privacy and prevent “unwanted loitering and attempted access by third parties.” Now that’s a classy law firm.

# The Partner Departures At This Biglaw Firm Are Really Piling Up

2019 is shaping up to be the year of the partner exodus for LeClairRyan.

We’ve reported on some of the [lateral moves](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/biglaw-firm-loses-over-a-dozen-partners-as-more-firms-spread-to-boston/) that have [already happened](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/biglaw-firm-that-just-lost-over-a-dozen-partner-loses-even-more/?rf=1) this year, and now comes word that LeClairRyan’s Rochester, New York, and Williamsburg, Virginia, offices have been raided. A group of intellectual property attorneys — partners Michael Goldman, Gunnar Leinberg and Andrew Zappia and counsel  Edwin Merkel and Tate Tischner — are opening up a Rochester office for Pepper Hamilton. While the Virginia contingent of departing lawyers, including retail industry co-head Susan Childers North and estate and trust litigation practice group leader William Sleeth, is heading to Gordon Rees Scully Mansukhani.

January isn’t even over and the firm has already lost 20 partners in 2019.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But according to an [interview with Law.com](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/01/25/leclairryan-ip-group-bolts-for-pepper-hamilton-adding-to-losses/), Elizabeth Acee, head of LeClairRyan’s litigation department, the firm isn’t panicking. Indeed, they’re preparing for “law firm 2.0” (think less legal research and more technology) and understand that not all lawyers at the firm are on board with the new vision:

But, Acee said, “It is not accurate to say that we don’t expect the firm to be in existence in 2019 because we think we’re building law firm 2.0 and we’ll be stronger,” referring the firm’s newest venture with alternative legal services provider UnitedLex Corp.

In June, LeClairRyan partnered with UnitedLex to launch ULX Partners LLC, which outsources nonlegal operations for law firms for a minority equity stake in the venture. As a result, more than 300 LeClairRyan employees joined the new venture.

This type of venture creates a fairly significant level of change, and that level of change is difficult and uncomfortable for some lawyers, Acee said.

“That’s OK and we understand that but we are very, very committed to the vision and we’re very committed to changing the firm’s business model,” she said.

Given the seemingly radical nature of the shift, it isn’t a surprise that many lawyers are packing up their books of business and leaving. The real variable is just how many partners will decide to depart the Biglaw firm before their new vision is fully realized.

# Greg Craig Trial Should Have Been More Interesting Than It Is
## Former Skadden lawyer determines he's his own best witness.

The trial of [Greg Craig](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/greg-craig/), former White House Counsel in the Obama administration and [former Skadden attorney](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/amid-mueller-probe-prominent-skadden-counsel-disappears-from-website/), is a bit pointless, because all of the important matters have been decided. It doesn’t seem pointless because there’s a lot of shadiness and Eastern European names and secret Harvard Club meetings floating around. But the thing Craig is actually being charged with is easily the most boring facet of the entire fact pattern. So… for those who haven’t been following along, let’s talk about that fact pattern first:

In 2012, Paul Manafort, then working on behalf of pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor F. Yanukovych commissioned then-Skadden attorney Greg Craig to write a report. Yanukovych had launched a corruption trial against former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who was a political rival. Tymoshenko was convicted and imprisoned. Yanukovych wanted to burnish his image in the west, so they wanted to show that the trial against Tymoshenko was something legitimate and not, you know, the other thing. Craig and Skadden accepted. Craig wrote a memo to file calling the evidence against Tymoshenko “virtually non-existent.” But when the report came out, Skadden more or less backed Yanukovych’s version of events. Craig engaged in public relations campaign to support the report, including delivering a copy of it to the home of a New York Times reporter before the report was released publicly. Manafort was thrilled, sending an email to Craig “You are ‘THE MAN.’” A contract with the Ukrainian government initially indicated that Skadden was to be paid $12,000 for its work (which, LOL, a Skadden partner wouldn’t spend six minutes punching you in the face for $12,000), but in fact Skadden was paid roughly $4.6 million for the report, largely funneled through Ukrainian oligarchs. Craig did not register as a foreign agent for his production of the report or the media work he did on Yanukovych’s behalf.

See? Isn’t that a GREAT fact pattern? You’ve got corruption, political prisoners, Manafort’s stupid emails, the Foreign Agents Registration Act, and a memo-to-file somebody actually read!

Unfortunately, none of that is really at issue in this case. After these dealings were exposed through the Robert Mueller investigation, the Justice Department [went after Skadden](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/federal-prosecutors-are-thinking-about-going-after-skadden/). Skadden settled for the purely coincidental amount of… $4.6 million. Then Justice turned its[ eyes towards Craig](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/ex-skadden-counsel-has-honor-of-being-first-prominent-democrat-charged-in-mueller-probe/). But Craid wasn’t even charged with failure to register, because (pro-tip, Congress) FARA is a distressingly vague and poorly written statute. Judge Amy Berman Jackson already dismissed one charge about false statements. Manafort is in jail. Yanukovych is in exile. Tymoshenko is out of jail and hopefully living her best life. Nearly everything here has been solved.

The only lingering issue is whether Craig lied to or materially mislead the Justice Department when they were investigating whether he should have registered as a foreign agent. That’s the charge. That’s what Craig is on trial for. Did Craig get too cute with a Justice Department functionary?

Which, I’m sorry, but I hit the snooze button on that. The man is out here getting Skadden to whitewash the imprisonment of political enemies, getting Skadden paid by Russian oligarchs, and having bro-emails with someone we now know to be one of the shadiest men on the planet, and I’m supposed to get up because he maybe wasn’t fully forthcoming to a rando Justice Department official?

Whatever. The prosecution rested its case yesterday, after calling 15 witnesses, many of them Skadden or former-Sakdden attorneys, as well as Rick Gates, Manafort’s right-hand man. The prosecution closed with Heather Hunt, who was Justice’s investigator in the Craig matter. She testified that she was not made aware of the public relations strategy between Craig and Manafort. She said that had she been aware: “It would have been very relevant to my inquiry.” Whoever is writing this dialog needs to be fired before they start working on the movie.

Craig took the stand today in his own defense. Usually, that’s a terrible strategy. But Craig is an accomplished trial lawyer and, more importantly, who the f**k cares? [From Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/28/greg-craig-trial-1476656):

Within minutes of being sworn in Wednesday, Craig denied the core allegation in the case: that he lied to and misled the head of Justice’s Foreign Agent Registration Act unit, Heather Hunt.

“I did not lie to Ms. Hunt or the FARA unit,” Craig said, under questioning from defense attorney William Taylor. “I did not lie or conceal from the FARA unit.”

Craig contends he told Hunt what was relevant, didn’t tell her things that weren’t relevant, and conducted the public relations roll out to make sure that Skadden looked good, not Yanukovych.

I mean, I don’t believe that for a second but… it’s an argument. I’ve never known Skadden to be that desperate to get positive coverage in the New York Times. The Wall Street Journal, maybe. But not the NYT.

If convicted, the charge carries a five-year maximum, but Craig won’t get that. He’d get the lightest sentence or maybe just probation, since he’d be a first time offender. And, of course, Craig could easily be acquitted because his defense only sounds stupid if you are looking at the bigger fact pattern, and that might be hard for some jurors to follow.

Jury deliberations are expected to start after Labor Day. Skadden is so much more boring than Jones Day.

I’m not surprised that firms with less than stellar years are matching, because they think this will vault them into competitiveness. I’m also not surprised that firms with stellar years are matching, because they think they must do so to remain competitive.

— [Tim Corcoran](https://www.bringintim.com/about-tim), a legal compensation consultant, commenting on the [summer salary wars](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/salary-wars-scorecard-tracker-2021/) that have taken hold across the large law firm landscape, even at firms that are [coming off a down year in 2020](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/06/23/even-after-a-down-year-some-big-law-firms-are-raising-associate-salaries/). “You’re looking for rationality in an irrational market,” he continued. “There’s no shortage of capable associates.”

[Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/morning-docket/)
# Morning Docket: 02.04.19
## * During an interview on “Face the Nation,” President Donald Trump was wishy-washy as to whether he’d be comfortable with special counsel Robert Mueller’s full report being released to the public, saying, “I don’t know. It depends. I have no idea what it’s going to say.” He was really comfortable saying it was time to “get rid” of the probe, though. [[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/us/politics/trump-interview-mueller.html)] * Speaking of the special counsel’s Russia inquiry, a former federal prosecutor predicts that Mueller will indict Donald Trump Jr. to get leverage over his father. After all, “[w]e’ve seen Mueller use people’s kids to get to folks in the past.” Will his son’s actions be President Trump’s undoing? [[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-jr-will-be-indicted-mueller-former-prosecutor-says-and-will-help-1315865)] * Here’s a headline we bet you thought you’d never see: “Justice Alito Temporarily Blocks a Louisiana Abortion Law.” The sad part here is that this case may place a burden women’s abortion rights if the full Court hears it. [[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/us/politics/supreme-court-louisiana-abortion-law.html)] * “I can’t do this for the rest of my life. I can’t sit in a room and look at documents. I won’t get into what that is, but it’s deadly. Deadly. Document production.” Doc review might have been “deadly” in Michelle Obama’s day, but has it improved? [[American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/02/01/how-has-document-review-changed-since-michelle-obamas-day/)] * Remember Bruce Reilly, the [convicted murderer](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/09/new-tulane-1l-is-an-advocate-a-writer-and-a-murderer/) who went on to become a student at Tulane Law? He’s since graduated, and while he’d like to take the bar exam to practice as a lawyer, he doesn’t think he’ll be able to overcome his character and fitness issues. [[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/business/bruce-reilly-murder-conviction-lawyer.html)] * Earth’s finest lawsuit? The #FijiWaterGirl (aka Kelleth Cuthberg née Kelly Steinbach), the model who inadvertently photobombed celebrities on the red carpet during the Golden Globes, has filed suit against Fiji Water for allegedly using her likeness to promote its brand without her permission.

Your lecture at this point is at an end. Thank you very much, please sit down. That concludes this argument.

–Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Lyle Frank in [cutting off King & Spalding’s Randy Mastro](https://nypost.com/2023/06/26/msg-lawyer-reprimanded-by-judge-in-lawyer-ban-case/). The scolding came at the end of the latest in the ongoing challenge to Madison Square Garden’s childish practice of [banning girl scouts from events](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/lawyer-mom-on-girl-scout-trip-gets-kicked-out-of-rockettes-christmas-show-due-to-law-firm-affiliation/) when the parent attorney is involved in a case against the company. Mastro [previously compared his petulant client to the mafia for some reason](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/comparing-your-client-to-the-mafia-isnt-the-flex-biglaw-lawyer-thinks-it-is/), so maybe the judge was doing him a favor.

# COVID Bonus Promises And Caviar Dreams At Magic Circle Firm
## Some bonus news is better than no bonus news.

Bonus season is kinda, sorta upon us. I mean [Baker McKenzie made a move](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/), but it didn’t account for the COVID appreciation bonuses that [swept through Biglaw this fall](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-fall-special-bonus-tracker-which-biglaw-firms-are-handing-out-cash-for-associates-hard-work-during-the-pandemic/), so it was pretty anti-climactic.

Anyway, firms — and their associates — are in a holding pattern, with lots of questions. Like how much will year-end bonuses be, and if they will account for the COVID bonuses that some firms have already paid out? Because there’s a weird split in Biglaw bonuses this year (an industry noted for adherence to a market standard), with some firms already paying appreciation bonuses as a special thank you from the firm for their hard work during the pandemic in addition to year-end bonuses that are promised to be [at least as big as last year’s pool](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cooley-bonuses/). While others have been silent, and left their associates wondering.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Clifford Chance has answered at least some of those questions for associates. While there is no formal bonus announcement yet, at an Associates’ Meeting call last week, U.S.-based associates were told there will be COVID appreciation bonuses in addition to the standard year-end ones that will be paid in mid-January. While the exact dollar amounts were not hashed out, given that [another Magic Circle firm, Freshfields, previously announced (and paid out) appreciation bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/freshfields-bonuses/) ranging between $7,500 and $40,000, depending on class year, there’s a very good chance they’ll be on that scale. As a spokesperson for the firm noted, “as in prior years, our bonus determination will be based on the market, which for 2020 will also take into consideration the fall bonuses paid by our peer firms.”

With so many elite Biglaw firms waiting until the end of the year to make bonus decisions, keeping track of what peer firms are doing is a little trickier this year. But fear not, Above the Law will continue to monitor exactly what’s going on across the industry.

As always, we depend on you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

Guess what time it is, associates? It’s time for some money — and lots of it!

Yet another firm has decided to hand out its year-end bonuses on the Cravath scale, and this time, it’s none other than Simpson Thacher, a firm that raked in $1,618,633,000 gross revenue in 2019, placing it at No. 15 in the latest Am Law 100 rankings.

Simpson was one of the few elite firms to enter the special bonus wars earlier this fall, [offering associates up to $40,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/simpson-covid-bonus/) based on class year for their “hard work and perseverance” during the pandemic, and now the firm is opening its coffers once more to reward associates for their “continued commitment and adaptability” in 2020.

Over the course of this month, Vault has rolled out a variety of law firm rankings — from the firms that are the [most prestigious](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/vault-100-rankings-the-most-prestigious-law-firms-in-america-2022/) to the firms that offer the [best quality of life](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/vault-quality-of-life-rankings-the-best-law-firms-to-work-for-in-america-2022/) to the firms with the [top-ranked practice areas in their region](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/vaults-top-law-firms-by-practice-area-and-region-2022/) — and there’s yet another important one that we’ll dive into today.

Money can buy prestige and can certainly improve your quality of life, but the diversity of your colleagues is worth more than what any salary scale can pay.

In a companion ranking to the Vault 100, associates were asked to rank their own law firms based on categories most relevant to how the firm does at creating, maintaining, and fostering a diverse workforce, including racial and ethnic diversity, as well as diversity related to women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and individuals with disabilities. To create the overall Best 30 Firms for Diversity ranking, Vault averages the scores from all four ratings.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
There was a huge amount of movement in the Top 10 this year. Which firms made the cut? Without any further ado, here are the [Top 10 Best Law Firms for Diversity](https://www.vault.com/best-companies-to-work-for/law/best-law-firms-for-diversity) based on Vault’s Annual Associate Survey for 2022:

- McDermott Will & Emery
- O’Melveny & Myers
- Morgan, Lewis & Bockius
- Ropes & Gray
- Orrick
- Robinson & Cole
- BakerHostetler
- Clifford Chance US
- Goodwin
- Finnegan Henderson
It’s worth noting that like almost all the Best Firms to Work For categories, McDermott swept Vault’s diversity rankings, with O’Melveny holding strong in second place. but there are other firms worth acknowledging here. Here’s some additional commentary on them, plus kind words from associates on McDermott’s and O’Melveny’s work to improve diversity, inside and outside of their firms:

In this year’s diversity rankings, eight firms appeared in the top 10 of all five categories: BakerHostetler, Clifford Chance, McDermott, Morgan Lewis, O’Melveny, Orrick, Robinson & Cole, and Ropes & Gray. …

Associates at McDermott and O’Melveny praise the firms for their DEI efforts. One McDermott associate shared, “The firm promotes diversity on all fronts and has regular programming to bring awareness as to how we can increase our efforts in terms of D&I,” while an associate from O’Melveny noted, “Diversity is extremely important at O’Melveny, and the firm shows it through its internal initiatives, sponsorship of external events, and pro bono opportunities.”

# No License To Try
## A full review of the the ongoing dispute between VLSI and Intel and its twists and turns in the past six years would take at least a month of columns -- so we'll start from the end.

I have always been a fan of long-running patent battles, especially when they involve two combatants with the resources and stamina to push the patent system to its limits. One group of cases that meets those criteria is the ongoing dispute between VLSI and Intel, which I addressed on these[ pages ](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/the-billions-boost-into-reverse/)just over a month ago. In that column, I addressed the latest federal circuit decision remanding the parties back to West Texas for a do-over damages trial. While we can expect more headlines in the future arising out of the Texas escapades between the parties, significant activity has also occurred in other jurisdictions where the parties have been embroiled in no-holds-barred patent litigation. In fact, there was a recent ruling out of the Northern District of California in VLSI’s first-filed case against Intel, which dates back to 2017. That date serves as a potent reminder that these parties have been at this for quite a while now.

A full review of the docket and its twists and turns in the past six years would take at least a month of columns. For purposes of this column, however, it is fine to start from the end, with a look at the state of play between the parties as the calendar started to read 2024. By the turn of this year, Intel had secured summary judgment in its favor on two of the four VLSI patents still active in the case. And VLSI decided to grant Intel “an unconditional covenant not to sue Intel for infringement of the remaining two Asserted Patents.” A trial in the case had been scheduled for March 2024, but after summary judgment and VLSI’s dismissal of its claims as to the two patents that survived, all that was left for trial was Intel’s affirmative defense that it already is licensed to all of VLSI’s patents.

That defense centers on a license that Intel had entered into with a well-known patent plaintiff called Finjan, which was subsequently acquired by Fortress, the owner of VLSI. (I am simplifying the complicated web of entities for comprehension here — the main point is that Intel thinks its Finjan license runs to VLSI.) Intel pressed that defense on summary judgment in the NDCA action, but was unsuccessful, partly because the court found questions of fact for a jury to decide with respect to the actual corporate relationships between Finjan, Fortress, and VLSI. Unsurprisingly, Intel wanted to try the issue to the jury in the upcoming March 2024 trial, which would represent its earliest opportunity to do so across the web of pending VLSI cases it is defending.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Intel’s attempt to move forward with its license defense at the March trial was rebuffed by the court, however, in a decision released on January 24, 2024. Critical to the court’s decision was the fact that Intel’s license defense was only in the case as an affirmative defense and not as a counterclaim. As a result, the court analyzed whether it still retained jurisdiction over Intel’s affirmative defense, where there were no pending VLSI infringement claims still at issue. It concluded that it did not, as Intel failed to “identify a single case in which any court has followed its proposed course of action: to proceed to a jury trial on an affirmative defense to claims that are no longer live.” This was true even though VLSI intended to appeal the summary judgment finding of no infringement as to two of the asserted patents. Or that Intel intended to press a motion for attorney’s fees if it was able to secure its win on appeal. Accordingly, the court found Intel’s license defense moot and denied Intel’s motion to have that defense tried to a jury in the case’s current procedural posture.

Despite the finding that its affirmative defense was moot, there was some saving grace in the court’s order for Intel, with the court denying VLSI’s request that “Intel may not now seek to amend its answer to assert a new counterclaim long after the deadline has run[.]” In other words, the court indicated that it would entertain a motion from Intel to amend its answer and counterclaims, ostensibly to add its license defense as a full counterclaim, as opposed to just an affirmative defense. And Intel filed that motion just two days after the court’s ruling on the trial, along with a request for expedited handling of its motion — a request aimed at trying to maintain the March 2024 date as a viable trial date for consideration of Intel’s license counterclaim, assuming it was allowed into the case by the court. In response, the court ordered VLSI to respond to Intel’s request for expedited briefing by the date that this column will run.

Ultimately, a material chance remains that Intel’s license defense will be placed in front of a Northern California jury after all, even though Intel faces some procedural hurdles to earn a ticket to that event. If Intel is able to get permission to add its license defense as a counterclaim, then the door could be opened to the court allowing it to go to trial in short order — perhaps even under the current March 2024 trial setting. We can assume that Intel much prefers its license defense considered by a NDCA jury over a West Texas jury, so it is easy to understand why Intel continues to try to keep the NDCA case alive until that happens. It will be very interesting to see whether Intel will be successful in getting its license counterclaim into the case, six years after the case was first filed. For now, the court has told Intel it has no license to try, but that might change very soon.

# Revolutionizing Law Firm Strategies With AI And SEO
## Explore how AI and SEO are transforming law firm strategies, from automated keyword research to predictive SEO and voice recognition technology.

AI and SEO are two powerful technologies transforming the digital world for legal offices. AI can enhance SEO strategies, offering a competitive edge in search engine rankings. AI can streamline your content creation process. Learn about machine learning’s role in enhancing content optimization, contributing to more targeted and effective marketing efforts.

##The Role of AI in SEO for Law Firms
AI is changing SEO for law firms. It can automate keyword research, content optimization, and other on-page elements. But remember, AI can’t replace human-generated content because at the end of the day, it isn’t perfect and Google still really wants the BEST content at the top of their search engine – not just repetitive content created by AI.

However, with AI-powered platforms, you can find relevant keywords based on audience goals and uncover competitor targets. Additionally, machine learning algorithms go beyond keywords. They can generate long-form optimized articles with bullet points, highlights, quotes, and different heading styles.

##Biglaw Leveraging AI for Improved SEO
In the world of digital marketing, major law firms are already using artificial intelligence to boost their search engine optimization. They’re smart enough to know that AI can automate and optimize tasks that can help them grow their law firms line.

Using AI not only makes things easier but also gives valuable insights to refine marketing strategies. For law firms trying to up their online game and attract clients, this could be a total game-changer.

##Client Engagement with Chatbots
The rise of chatbots powered by Artificial Intelligence is transforming customer service. For lawyers and law firms, this means instant support, boosting real-time engagement with clients.

#####24/7 Support with Chatbots
AI-powered chatbots offer round-the-clock assistance, perfect for busy attorneys who need quick responses during case preparations or client consultations. These smart bots ensure no query goes unanswered, keeping potential clients engaged.

AI-driven chatbot technology goes beyond immediate responses, providing a personalized experience by learning from each interaction and adapting its answers. Today’s clients want tailored solutions that understand their unique needs.

In short, embracing chatbot technology streamlines your firm’s operations and supercharges your client engagement strategy, making it more efficient and effective than ever before.

##Predictive SEO & Voice Recognition Technology
Artificial intelligence is making SEO smarter than ever. With predictive SEO, law firms can work to predict future actions, using past data to make strategic decisions. Voice recognition technology can now allow people to employ their voices to query the internet with products such as Alexa and Google Home.

Voice searches bring new challenges for law firms. Optimizing content for voice search can be challenging because people talk differently than they type. By mastering the nuances of voice search, law firms can gain an advantage over their rivals.

##Impact of Generative AI on Search Engines
Generative AI, a type of AI that produces content akin to humans, could alter the way we use search engines. Despite being in its infancy, many communication professionals have yet to consider its impact on their strategies.

#####Potential Disruption by Generative AI
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a prime example of generative AI models, are already making waves in various industries, including SEO. They can generate highly relevant content based on user queries, revolutionizing how businesses optimize for search engines.

#####Impact on Search Engine Evaluation and Ranking
In the near future, experts predict that generative AIs will change how [search engines evaluate and rank content](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo/how-search-engines-operate%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1705074513603929%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw2e91cP_SYvJxf2nbQhVTRv&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1705074513610282&usg=AOvVaw33hMbhTsmW9QQh6uo7rz9X). This means new ranking factors may emerge, focusing more on relevance and quality generated by these advanced algorithms rather than traditional methods like keyword density or backlinks.

This seismic shift towards intelligent automation presents both opportunities and challenges for law firms aiming to stay ahead in their digital marketing efforts. It’s crucial to keep abreast of these technological advancements while maintaining a focus on creating valuable, human-centric narratives that resonate with your audience.

##Why Human-Centric Content Still Reigns Supreme in the Age of AI
Now for the good news! Despite the impressive advancements in artificial intelligence, human-centric content continues to play a vital role in SEO. According to research, the first page of search results is still dominated by captivating narratives crafted by real people.

#####Engaging Human-Created Stories Rule the Search Rankings
The power of a compelling story is unmatched. Even with fancy AI technologies, it’s the genuine and emotionally resonant content created by humans that often secures the top spots on search engine result pages (SERPs). This highlights the importance for law firms to invest in creating high-quality, user-focused content.

#####Poorly Generated Automated Content Gets Lost in the Shuffle
In contrast, poorly generated automated content tends to get filtered out during searches. Users can easily spot such material due to its lack of depth or relevance, proving once again that machines can’t fully replicate the thoughtfulness inherent in human beings when crafting communications or devising [SEO strategies](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttp://www.lawquill.com%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1705074513604692%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw06FEKX3BxQ7QvsGJjyKBB3&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1705074513610694&usg=AOvVaw3pzU3jCXJeDPue3mrbUXzJ). While AI tools can be helpful for automating certain aspects of SEO work, they should never replace human creativity entirely.

##Conclusion
AI has become an essential tool in SEO for law firms, automating keyword research and improving search engine rankings. Big players like Google have used AI to create innovative solutions, while chatbots provide real-time support and personalized experiences for clients.

Predictive SEO and voice recognition technology allow for forecasting future outcomes and adapting to voice-assisted searches. However, human-centric content still dominates first page rankings, as poorly generated automated content gets filtered out during searches. Remember, if everyone is using AI, then Google still must choose the content to place at the top of its search engine – the best and most unique content will always receive the distinction of that top spot.

# CES Start-Ups Shun Gen AI Hype For Real-World Solutions
## A lesson for legal tech.

To kick off this year’s CES, the media group ShowStoppers, in conjunction with the Japanese trade group JETRO, gave 10 start-ups the opportunity to pitch to a room brimming with media and potential investors.

I frankly wasn’t expecting much from the pitches to be directly relevant to legal. However, listening to start-up pitches is always a source of inspiration and energy. But it took me a few minutes of listening to the pitches to realize something was missing: There was a conspicuous absence of the mention of Gen AI in their narratives.

The presenters simply weren’t talking about Gen AI. Nor were they hawking products and platforms that even used Gen AI. In a landscape dominated by the buzz and relentless hype around Gen AI, especially in  legal, this was a refreshing change 

And despite predictions of CES 2024 being awash with Gen AI innovations (one trusted media source predicted a Gen AI tsunami) the young presenters didn’t seem to have gotten the message. Out of 10, nine didn’t even mention Gen AI. Their focus? Old-school problem-solving.

Each of these nine pitches instead started with a specific problem to be solved and then on a unique technological solution. Yes, some of the ideas seemed a little far fetched at first blush. But when you listened to the problem each idea was designed to solve, they didn’t seem so outlandish after all.

Here is what they pitched and the problem each solved:

- A carbon accounting platform for measuring and monitoring carbon emissions to improve global warming and meet the demands of industries to be carbon neutral.
- A compact robotic food packaging solution to deal with labor shortages in the food industry.
- An advanced holographic communications platform to enhance and make more realistic virtual communications such as with Zoom.
- An innovative vacuum packaging product designed to prolong food shelf life and reduce waste.
- Music tailored just for dogs to alleviate stress and separation anxiety. (Dog music sounded a little goofy until they said the catalyst for the idea to calm down and reduce the stress of dogs in shelters.)
- A speaker designed to help seniors better hear dialogue and the spoken word.
- A multitasking robot that will cook food and clean utensils in response to restaurant labor shortages.
- Ultra-thin, fire safe insulation promising easier installation and better performance.
- Glasses with automatic focusing to address changing vision problems over a lifetime.
The lone Gen AI pitch? A product that was promised to summarize market research for companies. ( I think ChatGPT has got that one already btw.) The pitch sounded like many legal tech pitches over the past year: an effort to come up with something that used the term Gen AI as a buzzword rather than offering a unique solution to a real problem. 

What exactly have we seen in legal over the past year? Companies racing to supply Gen AI products or at least promise of products. Law firms screaming for products that might enable them to proclaim their use of AI. They seemed to be saying give us any Gen AI product whether it really does anything or solves anything. Many were more interested in being able to say they were all about Gen AI than really wanting to use it to solve a problem. 

The result? A market flooded with unnecessary products, products that could yet do what was claimed, and overhyped capabilities. Hastily called press conferences promising big announcements that were instead used to just hawk something that was not much different than what had been previously revealed. Offerings designed more to keep up with everyone else instead of providing something new or groundbreaking. Vendors stopped thinking as much about problems that lawyers and law firms may have. 

Instead of riding the Gen AI hype wave, legal vendors should take a cue from the young presenters at CES. The focus should be on first understanding lawyers and law firms’ problems and then exploring how Gen AI could be used to address those needs. The vendors instead seemed to start with a solution — Gen AI — and then try to find and define a problem the solution might solve.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The pitches were  a reminder that technology should not be about technology for its own sake. It’s about solving real world problems with practical solutions. These young entrepreneurs got it right. Technology should be about addressing needs not just incorporating the latest buzzwords. There is indeed still room for the blocking and tackling of real problems with solutions that make life easier. 

I don’t know if any of these things pitched this week will work. But that’s not the point. The presenters didn’t chase the hype. They prioritized real problems and thought about technology as a means to an end, not the end itself. Legal tech vendors need to do the same.

Why do I come to CES? To get just this kind of perspective.

# Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve

Major law firms appear to be sticking with a long-term office space strategy even as many lawyers indicate a preference for something different. Above the Law recently reported one example of this dichotomy: despite mandating a 50% in-office policy, one Am Law 50 firm reported that 40% of its attorneys showed up less than 25% of the time. Another indicator is the continued spending on lavish leases. Paul Weiss inked the largest 20-year commercial lease of 2023 in New York worth $1.46B, and Davis Polk also expanded its footprint in the city last year to a 25-year lease for over 700,000 sq/ft, according to reporting in the New York Times.

Small wonder then that attorney billable rates keep rising. Bloomberg Law reports that despite flat demand for legal services, large law firms posted a 6% increase in revenue in 2023, fueled in large part by an 8% increase in billing rates. It would appear, then, that clients are subsidizing expensive law firm office space while the evidence suggests that a large percentage of lawyers prefer remote work. And industry data shows distributed law firms are gaining momentum as they evolve to address a broader range of needs.

Law Firms Move into a New Phase on the Remote Work Adoption Curve

The first fully remote firms came on the scene over a decade ago, emphasizing lower overhead and increased autonomy for attorneys. But while “distributed firm 1.0” identified the benefits of lower overhead and greater flexibility, early movers arguably did not preserve those features of traditional firms that lawyers value: a focus on key practice areas, the need and desire to collaborate, and the importance of brand and quality. The first and largest distributed firm recently split up – and there’s every indication some of these factors contributed to many of its attorneys seeking a different version of the distributed firm experience.

Although the adoption of remote work in the broader economy was already under way before the COVID-19 pandemic, the lockdowns of 2020-21 certainly had a dramatic and almost immediate effect on workers who had never considered a career that was not tied to a physical office location.

According to the Pew Research Center, by October 2020, just six months into the lockdown, 71% of workers with office jobs were working from home all or most of the time. Today, offices have reopened, but 60% of those workers are still remote all or most of the time. Forbes reports that 65% of workers want full-time remote work, and 57% would consider leaving their current job if their employer stopped offering a remote work option.

Similarly, remote work continues to attract members of the legal profession, with new distributed firms opening around the country. Some of the newer market entrants offer associate programs, retreats, practice groups and a culture of collaboration, while also placing greater emphasis on brand quality and values – in addition to the benefits of remote work and low overhead. So can this new “distributed firm 2.0” model attract more lawyers to reimagine their practice?

The Distributed Law Firm “Adoption Curve”

While 16% of companies operate fully remotely, almost no major law firms do. Recent developments in the distributed firm market suggest that remote work is gaining wider acceptance among lawyers, but progress is lagging compared to the broader white collar economy. One way to think of this is to describe fully distributed law firms as entering a new phase on their own “adoption curve”. So what is an adoption curve?

In the 1960s, the sociologist Everett Rogers proposed his “diffusion of innovations” theory to explain the process by which new ideas are adopted. The theory has been applied broadly since, most notably perhaps in the development of the technology adoption curve, which describes the process of adopting and accepting new tech products. The curve is built around users who define the five phases of change adoption: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards.

The early law firm innovators embraced remote work primarily as a function of technology: if computers could replace the need for in-person communication and physical libraries and file rooms, law firms could simply ditch office space and provide a platform to support legal practices. Early adopters – attorneys looking for lower overhead and greater flexibility – embraced the model and were willing to overlook some of the shortcomings inherent in the early firms’ models. The first distributed firms attracted hundreds of lawyers looking to try something new.

As with technology adoption, however, early adopters of a distributed law firm model may have been too willing to accept the inherent flaws of this new solution without appreciating fully the “attorney user problems” they were trying to solve. For example, the fact remains that the practice of law is a relationship business, and is deeply collaborative; and while many lawyers bemoan long hours in the office, the strong collaborative bonds formed among colleagues are key to building successful legal teams ready to tackle clients’ toughest challenges. Cutting the overhead cost of office space has obvious attractions and benefits to lawyers and clients alike, but legal talent still values collaboration, team-building, and the prestige of practicing with other top tier professionals.

Towards a Winning Formula

More recently, firms like [Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c), Rimon, Outside GC, and others have evolved the distributed firm model to bridge the gap from early adoption to an early majority. This so-called distributed firm 2.0 model takes advantage of the efficiency and recruiting opportunities available to remote work firms, while retaining the benefits of traditional firms that lawyers appreciate – including associates and counsel to efficiently staff deals, a brand built around core practice area strengths, and an emphasis on collaboration and quality. Indeed, these values have been cited by groups departing the early remote work firms in search of an evolved model.

A recent ABA report entitled, “Where Does the Legal Profession Go from Here?” found that working remotely is now a top priority for attorneys, with 44% of the new generation of lawyers stating they would leave their current jobs for the ability to work remotely elsewhere.

As with any new idea, the wider adoption of remote work at law firms relies heavily on social capital: new users will always look to early adopters to point the way, and trust among users is inherent in any successful growth. With the increased emphasis on quality at newer distributed firms, the growing numbers of attorneys seeking the benefits of remote work without sacrificing quality now have sufficient options in the market to try a new model. If current trends continue, we could see the practice of law cross the chasm from early adoption to early majority. Good news for lawyers and clients alike.

# Global Biglaw Firm Freezes Associate Salaries, Delays Bonuses, Reduces Partner Pay Amid Coronavirus Crisis
## The firm is pulling out all the stops to remain financially secure.

Wouldn’t it be nice if the recession 2.0 were a big April Fools’ joke? Unfortunately, it’s not, and Biglaw is trying to figure out how to deal with the economic consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak that’s left many firms reeling. Some have opted for [layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-announces-associate-layoffs-and-other-cost-cutting-measures/) and [furloughs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firm-furloughs-associates-firm-hopeful-they-can-return-to-work-soon/), while others have chosen to cut salaries (some by [10 percent](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-announces-associate-layoffs-and-other-cost-cutting-measures/), some by [20 percent](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/associate-salaries-slashed-by-20-percent-to-protect-law-firms-viability/), some by [25 percent](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-cuts-partner-pay-entirely-associate-salaries-by-25-percent/), and some partners have [slowed](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firm-cuts-back-partner-compensation-amid-covid-19-economic-upheaval/) or [eliminated](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-cuts-partner-pay-entirely-associate-salaries-by-25-percent/) their distributions). Even [benefits have taken a hit](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firm-cuts-retirement-matching-in-effort-to-avoid-layoffs/) in this new normal.

The latest firm to make a move is Allen & Overy, and they’re pulling out all the stops. To make sure the Magic Circle firm remains financially secure, partners are holding a capital call and reducing their profit distributions at the same time. The firm has also frozen pay for associates and support staff, and upcoming bonuses people were expecting to receive this summer will now be split into two payments (one in July and one in October). The firm will also be delaying and canceling some recruitment and other events.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
UPDATE (10:55 a.m.): Please note that U.S. attorneys are not affected by this salary and grade freeze.

“The COVID-19 global crisis is an unprecedented situation for us and our clients,” a firm representative said in a statement. [Law.com International](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/03/31/allen-overy-holds-cash-call-cuts-partner-pay-outs-and-freezes-associate-pay-405-57318/) has more:

“The firm is in a very strong financial position but given the unknown nature of the evolving challenges, and their long term impact on our markets, it is sensible to introduce some prudent management measures as part of our ongoing scenario planning.

“A&O retains good diversification across practices and one of the broadest international offerings among the global elite firms, so we are confident in our resilience if economic conditions worsen.”

Allen & Overy has no debt and yet the firm is still trying to avoid prospective catastrophe by going through with all of these financial maneuvers. Just imagine what would have happened if A&O had [completed its merger](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/09/after-over-a-year-allen-overy-and-omelveny-call-off-merger/) with O’Melveny & Myers.

# This Firm Won't Give You Anywhere Near A Full Bonus If You Don't Meet Your Hours Requirements
## Is your firm planning to pull one over on associates like this? We hope not!

Thus far, this bonus season has been a relatively happy one. Aside from some gripes about being spoonfed the same high-dollar bonuses year after year after year and complaints about [associate compensation being cut](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/biglaw-firm-matches-cravath-but-are-they-cutting-associate-compensation-while-no-ones-looking/) by virtue of changes to health insurance plans, things have been just peachy — until now.

This afternoon, Norton Rose Fulbright matched the Cravath bonus scale. Like [Weil associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/will-this-biglaw-firms-bonus-tradition-wind-up-screwing-associates/), NRF associates will receive their bonuses in January 2018. Associates don’t seem to be bothered by that, since their 2016 bonuses were paid in January of this year. From a tipster: “If NRF shifted the 2017 associate bonus into December 2017, then we would receive two bonuses in the same calendar year, and it is likely we would pay significantly more income tax due to those last dollars being taxed at a higher marginal tax bracket. Consistency is critical.”

What associates are pissed about is the fact that there’s an hours requirement for them to qualify for full market bonuses. We’ve been told that associates must have 2300 hours in order to qualify for market bonuses, and anything less than that — specifically, 2000-2299 hours — will earn them just 50 percent of market. Ouch!

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
With about a month left in 2017, associates who find themselves stuck at around 2000 hours will have absolutely no motivation to bill more, since there will be no difference in compensation for them. “Not a great decision or result from a managerial standpoint,” a source quipped. “This is disheartening considering what other Texas ‘peer firms’ are doing for their associates.” No kidding, this is awful.

Here’s what bonuses look like at NRF for those who have less than 2300 hours:

Class of 2017 — $7,500 (pro-rated)
Class of 2016 — $7,500
Class of 2015 — $12,500
Class of 2014 — $25,000
Class of 2013 — $32,500
Class of 2012 — $40,000
Class of 2011 — $45,000
Class of 2010 — $50,000
Class of 2009 — $50,000

Is your firm planning to pull one over on associates like Norton Rose Fulbright has done this year? We certainly hope not, because this seems really unfair.

UPDATE (11/29/17): Sources from the firm have reached out to us to let us know that “some discretionary bonuses are paid for those who are significantly above the 2,000 hour mark, but below the 2,300 hour mark.” In addition to that, as readers know, Norton Rose Fulbright [recently merged](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/biglaw-merger-means-the-end-of-chadbourne-parke/) with Chadbourne & Parke, and we’ve been told that while all legacy Chadbourne associates will receive full market bonuses in January, “many (probably the vast majority) of the legacy NRF associates are subject to the lower scale described.”

UPDATE (11/30/17): Norton Rose gave this statement given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/newyorklawjournal/2017/11/29/bonuses-come-with-billable-hours-catch-at-some-law-firms/) with regard to its bonuses: “In addition to hour-based bonuses, our associate compensation program includes a significant discretionary bonus component to encourage and acknowledge important non-billable activities, such as client development and pro bono activities. We use discretionary bonuses in conjunction with hour-based bonuses to ensure that Norton Rose Fulbright’s compensation is in line with, or exceeds, the compensation paid in each of our markets.”

Congratulations to Norton Rose Fulbright associates who were able to meet their hours, and condolences to those associates who came up short this year, as it turns out that their bonus payouts will come out even shorter.

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. Remember: as soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”).

# 3 Focus Areas For Successful In-House Legal Tech Implementations
## Successfully implementing legal technology requires careful attention to addressing project management, change management, and adoption challenges.

Where is the disconnect between the apparent enthusiasm for using the latest legal technology tools and the lack of adoption in the field? 

Almost half (47%) of in-house legal professionals surveyed said the ability to adopt new technology is the most critical nonlegal skill for the next generation of in-house professionals — at a rate over three times higher than any other skill listed in the Association of Corporate Counsel’s [2023 State of Corporate Litigation Report](https://www.acc.com/sites/default/files/2022-10/ACC_State_Corp_Litigaton_Report.pdf).

However, due to poor implementation processes, many new legal-tech tools fail to gain traction in legal departments. In a recent report, [77% of in-house professionals](https://www.artificiallawyer.com/2022/05/23/77-of-inhouse-lawyers-experience-failed-legal-tech-projects/) said they had experienced a failure in tech implementation.

How can you make legal technology implementations more successful? Concentrate on three main focus areas: project management, change management, and adoption challenges. Here’s how it looks and why it helps:

Focus On Legal-Tech Project Management For A Clear Plan

Legal tech implementation projects require careful planning and execution. Without a clear strategy and timeline, projects can quickly become derailed. Designate one project manager to oversee the implementation process from start to finish. Your project manager’s responsibilities are to create a thorough and detailed project plan, identify key milestones and deadlines, and ensure all stakeholders are informed and engaged throughout.

Effective Change Management Underlies Every Successful Legal Tech Implementation

Some people resist change like cats resist baths. Others embrace change with the enthusiasm of dogs greeting their owners at the front door. When you roll out new technology, you will discover your employees’ comfort levels with change.

For change to go over well, employees must feel prepared to accept it. Long before your formal implementation begins, ensure you involve employees in the process. You may opt to: 

- Solicit feedback on the technology’s design and functionality before choosing a final product.
- Communicate the new technology’s expected benefits in terms of how employees’ daily work lives will improve.
- Provide initial in-person training and 24/7 access to training materials such as how-to videos and guides.
Garner reports that when employees primarily own implementation planning, [change success increases by 24%](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/this-new-strategy-could-be-your-ticket-to-change-management-success) and improves the odds of an initiative being well-received and sustainable. Building employees’ understanding helps increase their confidence to overcome resistance at its source.

Address Adoption Challenges Early In The Process

Monitor user adoption rates to spot and address any issues promptly. Despite your best intentions and preparations, it’s possible that employees will not use the new technology as intended — or at all. That’s one reason it’s crucial to involve those who use new technology tools in the implementation process from the start. Ways to solve adoption challenges include: 

- Solicit feedback from users about how the technology is and isn’t working for them.
- Provide ongoing training opportunities and continuous IT support. 
- Create incentives for employees to use new technology tools. 
- Celebrate successes along the way.
Successfully implementing legal technology requires careful attention to project management, change management, and adoption challenges. By addressing these areas head-on and involving employees in the entire implementation process, you increase your chances of success and can fully benefit from adopting the latest legal technologies.

Do you have any additional tips or tricks to share? 

What do you do to simplify the implementation process?

# Suspended Biglaw Associate Disbarred After Guilty Plea In Molotov Cocktail Attack
## He's also looking at some jail time, with his sentencing scheduled for next month.

When we last checked in on suspended Pryor Cashman associate Colinford Mattis and housing attorney Urooj Rahman, both charged in May 2020 for their [involvement with a Molotov cocktail attack](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/furloughed-biglaw-associate-charged-in-new-york-molotov-cocktail-attack/) on a police vehicle in Brooklyn, New York, in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, they’d pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit arson and possess an explosive device — charges which carried with them sentences of 18 to 24 months.

At that June hearing, both Mattis and Rahman acknowledged that their pleas would result in their disbarment. Now, that day has finally come. We turn to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/ny-disbars-lawyers-who-threw-molotov-cocktail-police-car-during-george-floyd-2022-11-15/) for all of the details:

New York’s Appellate Division, First Department said Mattis and Rahman qualified for automatic disbarment based on their guilty pleas in June.

Although the court’s order was released Tuesday, it retroactively dated the start of their disbarment to June 2, when Mattis and Rahman admitted in Brooklyn federal court to conspiracy to commit arson and possess an explosive device.

Mattis and Rahman told U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan at the time that they understood they would lose their law licenses as a result of their guilty pleas.

As we [noted](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/suspended-biglaw-associate-pleads-guilty-to-new-charges-in-molotov-cocktail-attack/) previously, when making his guilty plea, Mattis told the judge, “I wish I had made different and better choices that night.” Rahman also said she regretted her actions.

In addition to the loss of the ability to practice law and their upcoming sentences, Mattis and Rahman have agreed to pay $30,137 in restitution to New York City. To our knowledge, Pryor Cashman has yet to officially fire Mattis but we suspect that shoe may drop soon.

Rahman will be sentenced this Friday, and Mattis will be sentenced on December 16.

# Biglaw Firms May Be 'Reluctant' When It Comes To Layoffs During The Next Recession
## Instead of pink slips, some firms will offer partnership promotions to their associates.

I think law firms are going to be very reluctant to shed capacity as they did in 2007, 2008 or 2009 because it left them with a bubble in their leveraged attorney population—a bubble in their associate ranks that was hard to close. So I think they’re going to be very careful about that. But there will likely be some absorption of this weakened demand environment, in the form of the already-increasing associate turnover we’re seeing, and just letting some of that run off without being replaced.

— Michael McKenney, a senior client adviser and business development officer at Citi Private Bank Law Firm Group, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/06/17/equity-partnership-numbers-still-stagnant-but-law-firms-may-find-reason-to-tinker/) concerning the recession that may be looming and what Biglaw firms may do to avoid a staffing catastrophe in the future. In fact, some firms are considering [opening up their equity partnership ranks](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/06/17/equity-partnership-numbers-still-stagnant-but-law-firms-may-find-reason-to-tinker/) to attract and retain talented associates during these uncertain times.

What was the average PPP of an Am Law 100 firm in 1987, when The American Lawyer published its first Am Law 100 survey?

Hint: Back then, the mantra was “NYto65K” if that helps you put this in perspective.

# What Consumer Tech Can Tell Us About The Future Of Legal Tech
## Business tech is still behind, but it's able to learn lessons from the consumer side.

If you spend any time at all online, you have almost certainly experienced a form of data targeting. You know the drill: you log onto your Amazon account to search for an item you want to buy, and less than ten minutes later, that item and items like it are showing up in the sidebars of other websites you’re browsing. A half hour after that, you’re seeing ads at the top of your personal email inbox for the same merchandise. It’s not a coincidence — it’s the result of targeting technology from consumer sites that can track your searching and purchasing behaviors, actively trying to get to know your preferences in order to better serve you content that you are likely to consume or purchase. If you’re not expecting this sense of “connectivity” between vendors, the experience may seem annoying or even downright creepy depending on the context.

When targeting works well though, it provides an amazing sense of convenience and reduces the overall work required by the consumer — sometimes even driving to a better outcome. Imagine booking airfare for a weekend getaway and then having an offer for a great hotel deal (that you otherwise would not have found) show up in your inbox. Fewer mouse clicks, information that you need at your fingertips, and an optimal outcome. Sounds much like the holy grail of knowledge management to me.

The mechanisms that make this possible are similar in form — albeit, more sophisticated — to some of the technologies we have discussed in this column before. AI tools, specifically machine learning and data analytics, are two common technologies used by marketers and content providers to analyze information and deliver content at the right moments to the right audiences. A wide range of online consumer content, from the product suggestions you get on Amazon to the movie recommendations you see on your Netflix account, are generated by algorithms that have identified commonalities in your search history and preferences.

Many of the technologies that we enjoy today — the Internet, mobile phones, and GPS to name a few — rose out of military investments as part of the Cold War. The trend I think we will increasingly start to see is the consumer marketplace (which seems worlds ahead of the business marketplace) start to influence the business-to-business (B2B) market. In recent years, AI tools have become more common and ingrained in B2B technology — including legal content and solutions. As specific use cases for these technologies become more developed and more widely used, I believe that there are some trends that we’re likely to see in B2B tech moving forward — and with those trends, there are lessons that the B2B community can learn from the consumer tech world as well.

Using Algorithms for Recommended Content

When you conduct a search for a product on Amazon, the site uses an algorithm to learn about you and your customer journey based on the items you search and the keywords you use. This same mechanism could become a tool for technology providers to find recommended content for their users – including attorneys. An attorney managing a $1B deal in the health compliance space might find it useful to have recommended news stories and resources served to her on her dashboard based on her search history. We already know that algorithms can be built to do such a thing — and if applied in a legal tech platform, it could prove to be a useful tool for legal professionals.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
If you use streaming sites like Hulu, Spotify or Pandora, you’ve probably come across one or two recommendations that, from your point of view, make absolutely no sense based on your preferences. This is probably because a) the algorithm hasn’t been that well trained yet, or b) your preferences range so widely that it’s difficult for the algorithm to identify recommendations for you accurately. For situations where the behavioral data is not sufficient to get a good “fit” with customer preferences, demographic data can fill the gap. In the legal context, it’s helpful to know who the attorneys / researchers are, what their area of specialty is, and (potentially) who their clients are / what matters they are actively working on. This data, when combined with behavioral data, can help to refine search / recommendation results.

Security Obligations

As mentioned above, the tracking ability of consumer sites can be alarming for many people — particularly as vendors get aggressive in collecting additional demographic data for each of us. The nature of many white collar professionals’ work — and especially that of legal professionals — is often very sensitive, and as such, tech providers should be mindful of their obligations to their clients from a privacy standpoint. Providers could look into making auto-generated recommendations something that could be enabled or disabled, based on their individual clients’ comfortability with that kind of feature.

Consumer sites continue to develop AI tools that not only harness large amounts of data, but also make that data actionable. We may not see these trends moving into B2B tech overnight, but the foundation has already been laid for B2B tech tools to reach new levels of sophistication. As AI becomes more embedded in the fabric of legal technology, tech innovators could learn a thing or two from what’s already out there.

Connie Bertram

Last year Proskauer Rose was hit with a $50 million lawsuit by a partner — initially only identified as Jane Doe, but later revealed to be Connie Bertram — that alleged “substantial gender disparities” at the firm. The complaint also claimed Bertram was objectified by two partners and that her compensation lagged behind that of similarly situated male partners.

But on Friday evening a [stipulation of dismissal](https://www.pacermonitor.com/view/L5NXB3Q/Doe_v_Proskauer_Rose_LLP__dcdce-17-00901__0055.0.pdf?mcid=tGIYDK) was filed in the case. As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2018/08/11/proskauer-partner-firm-resolve-50m-gender-bias-suit/) Law.com, the filing indicated that both parties agreed the case would be dismissed in its entirety, but no details on the settlement were disclosed. A spokesperson for Proskauer would only comment that the matter had been resolved, while plaintiff’s attorney, David Sanford of Sanford Heisler Sharp, said in a statement, “unfortunately, we are unable to comment.”

The settlement comes after a court mandated alternative dispute resolution proceeding, as per local rules. In March U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, the presiding judge in the case, denied Proskauer’s motion for summary judgement and limited discovery on the question of whether Bertram should properly be considered an employee was set.

Though the initial stages of the litigation were noted for being particularly contentious — in their answer the firm said the complaint[ “cherry-picked” data](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/05/24/proskauer-says-partner-in-50m-gender-bias-suit-cherry-picked-pay-data/) — Bertram remains a partner at the firm, and, [according to her bio](https://www.proskauer.com/professionals/connie-bertram) on the firm’s website, has a leadership role at the firm. She’s the the head of the DC Labor & Employment practice, co-head of the Whistleblowing & Retaliation Group, and head of the Government Contractor Compliance Group.

# Biglaw Firm Implements Two-Tier Compensation System
## What you make depends on what you bill.

Now that it is July, and a large swath of Biglaw associates have had their recent raises hit their bank accounts, it’s easy to think the salary increase momentum has waned. But, there are still firms making their own compensation move, even if it is a little later than their peers.

Take Crowell & Moring, a firm that brought in $514,391,000 in gross revenue last year, making it 77th on the Am Law 100. They recently announced a new compensation system that tiers associates, based on how many hours they bill.

So, if you bill 2000+ hours, associates’ compensation range will be between $205,000 and $365,000, depending on class year. Which, not coincidentally, is the same salary range as the market leading DPW scale.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
If you only make a 1900-hour target, then you fall into a reduced range of $185,00 to $340,000. Let’s peep at how the firm describes it to the incoming class of associates:



After their second year at the firm new associates will be placed in a tier, based on their billable history. You can read the full email on [the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/crowell-raises/%E2%80%8E2/).

And remember, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# The Best (And Worst) New York Law Schools For Biglaw Jobs
## Which schools open the most Biglaw doors?

Whenever an undergrad asks me about choosing the right law school to get a Biglaw job in New York, I always say the same thing: “Go to a T14 law school — preferably Harvard, NYU, or Columbia for proximity’s sake — or go to a lower-tier school in New York and graduate in the top of your class.” It’s simply not true that, say, a St. John’s grad is locked out of Biglaw. The firms take the top folks from the local schools every year. It’s just that it’s a lot easier road to be an above-average NYU grad than a superstar at St. John’s.

But one tipster has gone through and actually broken down how many students from each New York area school are landing at specific Biglaw firms. Here’s the methodology:

I scoured the websites of Cravath, S&C, DPW, Skadden, STB, Cleary, PW, Debevoise, Latham, and K&E (Weil’s website made it impractical to include them), and saw how many associates they each currently employ from Brooklyn, Columbia, Cardozo, Fordham, Hofstra, NYLS, NYU, Pace, Rutgers, Seton Hall, St. Johns. Since I was mainly interested in recent placement, I kept the list to associates only (no partners, counsel, etc). My goal was to see how successful each school has been at placing students at these top firms, and if you’re really that much better off paying more to go to a better school (spoiler alert: you are).

Oof. Hofstra’s still not on the board. Maybe next one…

Of course my old firm has a soft spot for my school. Spoiler, this will be the only Biglaw firm in this sample with more NYU than Columbia grads…

Simpson Thacher	Associates
Brooklyn	7
Columbia	46
Cardozo	3
Fordham	16
Hofstra	1
New York Law	1
NYU	35

The lesson we’re seeing is Hofstra may not be the easiest place to go if you’re looking to get into this market. Next, the former home of my Above the Law colleague Elie Mystal…

Debevoise	Associates
Brooklyn	12
Columbia	52
Cardozo	16
Fordham	6
Hofstra	1
New York Law	5
NYU	40
Pace	1
Rutgers	10
Seton Hall	3
St. John’s	12
Wow. Debevoise has a lot more love for Brooklyn and St. John’s than its peers. If you’re going to one of those schools, definitely hit up the firm’s sponsored events for some networking.

Now for last year’s highest grossing law firm…

Latham	Associates

Columbia	62
Cardozo	2
Fordham	21
Hofstra	5
New York Law	0
NYU	53
Pace	0

Finally, we have Kirkland…

Columbia	64

Fordham	17
Hofstra	2
New York Law	1
NYU	44
Pace	0
Rutgers	1
Seton Hall	0
St. John’s	2
In case you were wondering how that all totals up, we have that from our hard-working tipster too:

Law School	Associates
Columbia	705
NYU	553
Fordham	152
Brooklyn	72
Cardozo	70
St. John’s	45
New York Law	38
Rutgers	19
Hofstra	13
Seton Hall	13
Pace	4
Use this information wisely. It’s not as though someone has to land at these sample firms to have a sterling legal career. But if you’re mulling over that law school decision and want to work in the elite tier of the legal industry, this should help guide you.

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Is The First NOT To Announce A Cravath Match
## Associates aren't pleased by this at all.

Biglaw firms across the country are eagerly announcing their Cravath matches in order to remain competitive during this white-hot lateral market for legal talent. As a reminder, the Cravath scale ranges from $215,000 for first-year associates to $415,000 for eighth-year associates and beyond. While many firms that had already matched the Milbank and Davis Polk scales are once again updating their salaries to match Cravath, firms that had yet to make salary moves at all are finally stepping forward to match Cravath. Other firms, however, seem to be ignoring that Cravath raised the stakes and have decided to match Davis Polk, days after it was no longer en vogue to do so.

That looks to be what’s happening at Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer, a top 50 firm according to the latest Am Law 100 ranking. Today, the firm announced that it would be matching the Davis Polk salary scale, which is less take-home compensation for associates than what’s offered under the Cravath scale — sometimes in the range of tens of thousands of dollars less. To say that associates aren’t happy would be an understatement.

This is what the Davis Polk salary scale looks like at Arnold & Porter:



“Arnold & Porter has apparently decided to match Davis Polk and NOT Cravath,” said one source of the firm’s raises. “Associates are furious. This is a total slap in the face.”

We always suspected that raises like this would divide Biglaw into compensation tiers, but we didn’t think it would happen this quickly. Are there any other firms out there that won’t be matching the Cravath salary scale? Which firm will be next to join Arnold & Porter in adopting a lower salary scale than the rest of Biglaw’s best?

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Arnold & Porter.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

For five years, Solicitor General Don Verrilli has fought in our nation’s highest court for a better future, winning landmark cases that moved America forward. Thanks to his efforts, 20 million more Americans now know the security of quality, affordable health care; we’re combatting discrimination so that more women and minorities can own their piece of the American Dream; we’ve reaffirmed our commitment to ensuring that immigrants are treated fairly; and our children will now grow up in a country where everyone has the freedom to marry the person they love.

— President [Barack Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama), in a statement issued after he received news that Solicitor General [Donald Verrilli Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_B._Verrilli,_Jr.) would be [stepping down from his position](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/06/02/verrilli-who-defended-obama-policies-in-landmark-cases-is-leaving-justice-department/) at the Justice Department, effective June 24. Verrilli is the [seventh longest-serving solicitor general](http://www.npr.org/2016/06/02/480378708/donald-verrilli-who-argued-groundbreaking-cases-for-the-government-stepping-down) in the country’s history. Attorney General [Loretta Lynch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loretta_Lynch) referred to Verrilli as “one of the most consequential solicitors general in American history.”

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
[Ian Gershengorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Heath_Gershengorn), Verrilli’s deputy, will be appointed as acting solicitor general. Verrilli plans to [take a long vacation](http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-solicitor-general-donald-verrilli-to-step-down-this-month-1464876002) — one that may begin prior to the Supreme Court announcing decisions in its remaining cases. Verrilli, a former partner at Jenner & Block, will likely be [welcomed back to the firm with open arms](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/06/02/verrilli-who-defended-obama-policies-in-landmark-cases-is-leaving-justice-department/) if that’s where his career leads him.

# Top Biglaw Firm Announces Bonuses And Changes Its Tune About Special Bonuses
## Exciting news for everyone at the firm!

‘I see bonus money!’

It’s the first week of February, and in the neverending Groundhog Day that is the world of Biglaw, another firm has rolled out bonuses.

Remember back in September when the leadership at O’Melveny & Myers [refused to pay out special fall bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/omelveny-says-no-to-fall-bonuses-are-covid-appreciation-bonuses-over/), but instead said there would be “enhanced” bonuses for select associates and counsel in February 2021? The time has come, and bonus news has finally been announced. How did things turn out for associates at the [best law firm to work for](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/vault-quality-of-life-rankings-the-best-law-firms-to-work-for-in-america-2021/) in America, as ranked by Vault?

As is their tradition, OMM announced bonuses via voicemail, so there’s no memo to share with everyone. But, we can confirm the firm is paying full market salary as well as associate appreciation bonuses. Here are both of those bonus scales, in case you’ve somehow forgotten what they look like.

Year-end Bonuses

• Class of 2019 – $15,000 bonus

• Class of 2018 – $25,000 bonus

• Class of 2017 – $50,000 bonus

• Class of 2016 – $65,000 bonus

• Class of 2015 – $80,000 bonus

• Class of 2014 – $90,000 bonus

• Class of 2013 – $100,000 bonus

• Class of 2019: $7,500

• Class of 2018: $10,000

• Class of 2017: $20,000

• Class of 2016: $27,500

• Class of 2015: $32,500

• Class of 2014: $37,000

• Class of 2013: $40,000

Associates who contacted us about the firm’s bonuses seemed generally pleased with the news. “O’Melveny announced bonuses, market rate for regular bonuses and a one time appreciation bonus that matches market as well,” said one of our sources. “What’s surprising is appreciation bonuses are not tied to hours. Now we wait to see how much the firm takes away as a result of draconian penalties for late time sheets.”

Now that would be truly cringeworthy. We await word on whether associates will actually receive market bonuses after these reported penalties, but for now, congratulations to everyone at the firm.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks for all of your help!

# Associate Layoffs Hit Billion-Dollar Biglaw Firm Baker McKenzie
## Truly shocking news from this elite firm.

The legal profession has been put through the wringer in 2020 thanks to the pandemic. Now that the fall is almost upon us, dozens of firms that cut salaries to combat the economic turmoil that COVID-19 brought with it have now either partially or fully rolled back those reductions. At other firms, the news is a little less celebratory: attorneys are being laid off.

This may come as a shock to some, but Baker McKenzie is conducting layoffs. The Biglaw behemoth has over 4,800 attorneys worldwide and was recently ranked by Am Law as the fourth highest-grossing firm in the country with $2.92 billion in revenue in 2019. If you recall, back in April, coronavirus cuts came to the firm, with [salaries slashed by 15 percent for all U.S. attorneys](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/baker-mckenzie-salary-cuts/) and business professionals making over $100,000, while those in Canada sustained a 10 percent reduction to their salaries.

Yesterday afternoon, sources let us know that cuts were underway at the firm, and that midlevel and senior associates were the subject of layoffs across several offices. We reached out to Baker McKenzie for confirmation, and received this statement:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
As a global firm, Baker McKenzie has felt the impact of increased market and business disruption around the world. Over the past seven months, we’ve been quick to maneuver and adapt by staying close to our clients as we realign to meet their changing needs.

As such, we can confirm that we are reducing the size of our workforce in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. This reduction includes lawyers, other timekeepers and business professionals.

To say this was a hard decision is a massive understatement. We are deeply aware of the human impact of these decisions, and are treating our people fairly and with dignity. But having considered the full array of options, we are confident that this is the best path forward.

It is unknown at this time how many people lost their jobs at Baker McKenzie, what their severance packages look like, or what other kinds of assistance the firm will offer to those who now find themselves without employment.

On the bright side, the firm’s salary cuts will be a thing of the past in 2021. “Looking to the future,” a firm spokesperson said, “we can also confirm that the current salary reductions announced earlier this year in the U.S. and Canada will end on December 31, 2020.” Coupled with the layoffs announced in the very same statement, these salary cut rollbacks now seem like they’re some sort of a consolation prize.

If something like this is happening at an elite firm like Baker McKenzie, it must be worrisome for other firms that weren’t as financially well off in the first place. Best of luck to all those who are affected by the layoffs at Baker McKenzie.

# Harlan Crow's Lawyers Double Down On Genius Strategy To Invite Contempt Charges
## Crow's lawyers at Gibson Dunn have done the first half and are really hoping the Senate doesn't initiate the 'and find out' part.

Gibson Dunn got [mercilessly mocked](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/harlan-crow-gibson-dunn-senate-letter-clarence-thomas/) for its first letter informing the Senate Judiciary Committee that it would rather not talk about whether its client, Harlan Crow, acted as Clarence Thomas’s personal ATM machine for years. The legal arguments raised in the letter signed by partner Michael D. Bopp were so flimsy that Georgetown constitutional law scholar Josh Chafetz wrote, “[I hope the Gibson Dunn lawyers who worked on this are suitably embarrassed](https://twitter.com/joshchafetz/status/1661062986063134721?s=20).”

The letter presented a cavalcade of shoddy, half-formed, out-of-context argumentation that somehow managed to never once mention either of the two statutes at issue. Unsurprisingly, the Judiciary Committee pointed all of this out.

Now Gibson Dunn is back! In a letter reproduced below, Gibson Dunn mildly concedes that Bopp will deign to speak with Senate staffers. But they aren’t ready to eat crow entirely, and took another opportunity to string together some caselaw in support of Crow’s meritless assertion that the Senate Judiciary Committee lacks the authority to probe Thomas’s failure to comply with existing disclosure statutes.

And they’re really hoping no one bothers to look up these case cites because… they don’t really help Crow’s case.

We write on behalf of Harlan Crow in response to your letter of May 26, 2023 (the “May 26 Letter”) responding to our May 22, 2023 letter (“Response”), which raised serious concerns about your original request of May 8, 2023 for information regarding Mr. Crow’s friendship with Justice Clarence Thomas.

[Narrator voice]: They were not serious.

While the concerns we expressed in our Response about the Committee’s investigation remain, we respect the Senate Judiciary Committee’s important role in formulating legislation concerning our federal courts system, and would welcome a discussion with your staff.

Remember, the original argument was that the Senate had no role “in formulating legislation concerning our federal courts system” at all. Their “serious” concerns about the role of the legislative branch subtly shifted from zero to “important.”

This should end the discussion. Gibson Dunn should finish that paragraph with “and would welcome a discussion with your staff about when to schedule Mr. Crow’s voluntary production of materials and testimony before we have to get a subpoena and inevitable contempt of Congress referrals in here.”

But it does not.

Instead, we embark on a journey to the nexus of supercilious and disingenuous. In case you’re wondering, Gibson Dunn will still refuse to address by name the specific statutes involved here, but this time they will acknowledge that the laws at least exist. PROGRESS!

From Pilot and Above The Law  
The fact that Congress has enacted ethics legislation previously––a point on which the May 26 Letter relies heavily––is no answer to our concerns. “[P]ast practice does not, by itself, create power.” Medellin v. Texas, 552 U.S. 491, 532 (2008) (quotations omitted).

There are no quotations omitted in there. Unless you’re counting the quotation marks they failed to include because this quote is itself a completely lifted quote from Dames & Moore v. Regan. There’s a reason Gibson Dunn elides the original source of the quote, because when the Dames & Moore Court wrote those words, they were followed by a comma and would go on to say, “… but ‘long-continued practice, known to and acquiesced in by Congress, would raise a presumption that the [action] had been [taken] in pursuance of its consent,” citing an even older case. Even in Medellin, the Court’s ruling didn’t turn on past practice not creating power, but the fact that the act in question was “not supported by a ‘particularly longstanding practice.'”

By contrast, the ethics legislation at issue in this dispute date back to 1978 and the justices have — Thomas’s lapses aside — complied since then.

Thus, Congress may undertake measures to facilitate Article III’s vesting of judicial power in the Supreme Court, such as by fixing the number of Justices who serve on the Court above the constitutional minimum. See U.S. Const. art. III, § 1; U.S. Const. art. I, § 3, cl. 6; id. § 8, cl. 18. But fixing the number of Justices is, as this Committee has recognized in the past, done “for purely administrative purposes.” S. Rep. No. 75-711 at 12 (1937). It is a ministerial measure to help execute the vesting of judicial power. It is not a regulation of the exercise of judicial power, which the Constitution reserves to the judiciary. See Stern v. Marshall, 564 U.S. 462, 483 (2011) (“[T]he judicial Power of the United States can no more be shared with another branch than the Chief Executive, for example, can share with the Judiciary the veto power.” (quotations omitted))

Putting aside whether the Roberts Court has de facto seized veto power, this is chicken-and-egg level intellectual masturbation. Is a legal requirement to disclose gifts, and then to potentially recuse from cases involving a conflict, a provision to “help execute the vesting of judicial power” or “a regulation of the exercise of judicial power”? One could say “violating the ethical code divests the judge of judicial power as an administrative matter” or one could say “violating the ethical code prevents a judge from exercising judicial power.” Resolving that distinction matters here and the fact that ethical codes are “administrative” matters in every other context would seem to tilt in favor of the former.

Don’t worry, they have an answer for that!

Nor is an ethics standard a “prerequisite” to the Court’s exercise of judicial power. Patchak v. Zinke, 138 S. Ct. 897, 907 (2018).

This is a trend in both Gibson Dunn letters: citing cases to manufacture negative implications. Zinke said “a congressional grant of jurisdiction is a prerequisite to the exercise of judicial power.” That’s the statement they’re plucking “prerequisite” out of. From this floating hook they imply some sort of expressio unius est exclusio alterius that because jurisdiction is a prerequisite… ethical codes must not be? That’s not how any of this works. The case doesn’t whisper on the question of whether an ethics standard — or anything else for that matter — would be a prerequisite to anything.

That means an ethics standard of any kind, imposed on the Court by Congress, would be unlawful. See United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 607 (2000).

Morrison?!?!? They’re citing federalism cases for this? Why not throw in “this would discriminate against a branch of government per Brown v. Board” while you’re at it because it’s about as legally sound. When it comes to crafting a compelling legal argument, there is such a thing as subtraction by addition and this is a great example.

Now put on your cleats because we’re embarking on the slippery slope:

The independence of the Court is exactly what is at issue here. If Congress were empowered to enact ethics standards targeting the Justices, that power could readily be used to coerce or harass them for exercising the judicial power in ways deemed objectionable by legislators. An ethics standard imposed by Congress on the Justices would loom over the Court’s independence as an implicit and omnipresent threat that the political branches may, at any time, “punish the Justices whose opinions [they] resent.” S. Rep. No. 75-711 at 12 (1937).

The cited report is about FDR’s threat to expand the membership of the Supreme Court… an act that literally everyone agrees would be constitutional (even if it might be unwise). Is there an effort to explain why “don’t take hundreds of thousands in undisclosed graft from parties before the court” or even why “the Supreme Court must abide by the same rules imposed on lower courts” would result in coercion or harassment? Nope!

Likewise, any enforcement mechanism for such an ethics standard would further undermine the constitutionally mandated independent role of the Supreme Court. A code enforced by the Judicial Conference of the United States, for example, would impermissibly invert the hierarchy of the judicial department, placing lower court judges in a supervisory role over the Supreme Court.

Not to school the lawyers who just did such an admirable job mucking up the concept of “administrative,” but the “hierarchy” of the judicial department is a matter of substance not administration. The Judicial Conference already involves district judges in a position to pass judgment on the actions of circuit judges. In fact, they district judges have some measure of administrative authority when it comes to the Supreme Court, which is why a committee of the Judiciary Conference chaired by the Chief of the Western District of Kentucky [heard ethical complaints against Clarence Thomas in 2012](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/judiciary-thomas-ethical-lapses-2012/) before dismissing them as inadvertent.

And a congressionally mandated code that was meant to be enforced by the Justices themselves would be a usurpation by Congress—a command to the Justices to exercise in a particular way an inherent judicial power that is reserved exclusively to the Justices’ discretion. See Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 905 (“The separation of powers, among other things, prevents Congress from exercising the judicial power.”).

Again begging the question — why is an ethical code a matter of exercising judicial power instead of a concededly permissible matter of vesting? They just keep jamming those inapposite cases into this letter hoping to numb the Committee into assuming this shaky premise.

If the arguments Crow mustered to claim that Congress has no legitimate legislative purpose to impose ethical standards are bad, wait until you get a load of his argument that Congress has no legitimate legislative purpose to investigate Clarence Thomas’s failure to comply with ethical laws already in place for 45 years.

The Committee’s requests also cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny for an additional reason. Because its requests are aimed at obtaining private information about a sitting Justice of the Supreme Court, they squarely implicate the separation of powers, which means the Committee’s investigation must satisfy a heightened standard in order to establish a valid legislative purpose for seeking the requested information. But the Committee makes no effort to meet that heightened standard.

You know… impeachment is a legitimate legislative purpose. While the House would have to initiate any impeachment and there’s zero chance of that happening in the near future, that doesn’t make it any less legislative.

In all honesty, it’s shocking that Gibson Dunn wanted to pull this thread.

So Crow and Gibson Dunn want to stretch out the FA half of the equation. Is the Senate preparing to bring the FO component? Per [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/harlan-crow-lawyer-agrees-speak-panel-clarence-thomas-gifts-rcna87895):

Wyden warned that the committee could issue a subpoena, saying, “I’ve already begun productive discussions with the Finance Committee on next steps to compel answers to our questions from Mr. Crow, including by subpoena, and those discussions will continue.”

Well then.

In the meantime, at least Gibson Dunn is collecting some nice billable hours out of these letters, because they’re getting nowhere fast substantively.

# What Happened At The NALP Recruiting Summit?
## Living life in a post-Guidelines world...

Two weeks ago, for the second time in three weeks, I found myself back on the road for a business trip. While my [previous venture](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/on-the-road-again/) outside of Nashville was to meet with legal employers in the Washington, DC market, this trip was a bit different. After an inexplicable two hour delay on the BNA tarmac — on the plus side, I can say that both [Netflix’s Sex Education](https://www.netflix.com/title/80197526) and the recent [Robert Caro piece](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/01/28/the-secrets-of-lyndon-johnsons-archives) in The New Yorker are quite good — I arrived in New York City to attend the sixth annual National Association for Law Placement (NALP) Recruiting Summit, which brings together some the nation’s top law schools and legal employers for a day long discussion on an array of legal recruiting topics.

With those in the NALP orbit still reeling from the decision made one month prior to [abandon](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/the-recruiting-game-done-changed/) [the recruiting guidelines](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/what-are-we-doing/) which had been in place for more than four decades, and with the Summit representing the first time the various NALP stakeholders would all be in the same room, one might have thought this would be an all-day discussion as to what will fill the vacuum, or more simply, what happens next. Well, you would be wrong.  While there would be a time to discuss the post-Guidelines world, the Summit stuck to its established practice of taking a broad look at the legal recruiting universe.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The opening session saw Citi’s David Altuna provide an overview of the state of the legal economy. In short, the financial situation for the law firms continues to improve, though with some significant caveats. From 2010 through 2017, law firm revenue increased 4.4 percent year over year, which is a respectable growth rate for any industry. However, demand for legal services — measured by Citi as the total number of hours logged by attorneys at law firms — grew only 1 percent per year during this same period. How did revenue growth vastly outpace demand growth? Billing rates increased during this same period by 3.9 percent year over year. If you cannot get consumers to buy more of your product, you can bolster your bottom line by charging them more for the same thing. Of course, the concern is that, theoretically, you eventually hit a limit on how much consumers are willing to pay. The good news is that over the first nine months of 2018, the aforementioned figures all increased. Firm revenue shot up by 6.3 percent, demand increased by 2.5 percent, and billing rates increased by 4.3 percent. On the flip side, firm expenses also increased in the first nine months of 2018 by 5.9 percent, compared to the 4.2 percent rate of increase from 2010-17, but that increase is still less than the increase in firm revenue and can be explained, at least in part, by the bump in associate salaries to $190,000.

That was the good news. Not surprisingly, there was also some bad financial news. Much like the American economy as a whole, the growth in the legal market is primarily happening at the top — both in an inter- and intrafirm manner. Despite the fact that the top quarter of the Am Law 200 saw the largest increase in billing rates from 2010-17, those same firms saw the highest increase in demand for their legal services. In fact, the entirety of the growth in demand was limited to this top 25 percent. Those firms saw a 3.7 percent growth in demand post-Great Recession while the rest of the AmLaw 200 saw a contraction of demand by 0.5 percent. For the top 50 AmLaw firms, it is as if the Great Recession never happened. For the other 150 firms, well… at least the bottom is no longer falling out. Interestingly, boutique firms are actually on stronger financial footing than Am Law 50-200. And within firms, nearly the entirety of this increased revenue is flowing to the partnership.

Wearing his best flak jacket, NALP Executive Director Jim Leipold took to the podium next and reviewed the results of the recently completed recruiting survey. After a small dip, entry-level legal recruiting has returned to its post-recession peak. While the total number of students securing legal jobs after graduation continues to fall, that is due to the fact that the total number of graduating law students are at record lows. However, the current crop of national 1Ls is larger than the cohort that just graduated so we should finally see an increase in graduating law students in 2021 under President Gillibrand. 

The class of 2017 saw 54.4 percent of graduates working in private practice, which is near the historical norm and a vast improvement from the dark days of the recession when the figure fell below 50 percent. 28.1 percent of these graduates entering private practice went into Biglaw, i.e., firms with over 500 attorneys. Reflecting what David Altuna had previously explained, some law firms are showing growth in their recruiting efforts, both in terms of the size of their summer associate classes and the number of schools they visit for recruiting purpose, while other firms are retracting in both areas.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
One of the more interesting figures discussed is that for the just completed Fall 2018 Recruiting Cycle, 53 percent of callbacks resulted in offers and 35 percent of all extended offers were accepted. While those statistics are not remarkable on their face, what makes them worth mentioning is that both increased from a year before. An increase in either offer or yield rate is typical, but both increasingly simultaneously is unusual. In looking at post-graduation offers, 97 percent of 2018 summer associates received an offer and 88 percent accepted.  Both numbers are record highs, but while the former is only slightly above the peak, the 88 percent acceptance rate is significantly higher than the low to high-70s percent rate seen pre-recession. As Jim pointed out, this is likely due to a drop off in the 3L hiring market. Fewer students are willing to turn down a good job for the prospect of a landing a “better” position that is likely not going to materialize.  

Jim also reviewed the biennial student survey which included some interesting nuggets that confirmed my prior beliefs — students like employer swag, so keep cranking out those branded portable powerbanks. Perhaps the most interesting statistic of the entire presentation came during this section when those students surveyed said that 45 percent of all summer associate offers had been accepted by the end of August. For those of us in the legal recruiting world, this continual, for lack of a better phrase, calendar creep is not surprising, but to think that even ten years ago, callbacks routinely stretched into the September and October, this new timeline is remarkable.

The student survey also contained some fascinating narrative responses, including the following on OCI:

The entire OCI process was antiquated, stressful, and ultimately almost made me drop out of law school. I firmly consider it to be one of the lowest points of my life and wish that no other person has to suffer through it. The screener interviews are a complete joke that does very little in gleaning any substantive information about the firm. Every response is a stock answer that makes the interviewer look like nothing more than an automaton. In fact, there were multiple points where I wasn’t sure if I was actually being subjected to a Turing Test. Not only that, but I had numerous interviewers outright insult me. One called me a liar when I told him what practice area I was interested in, “You’re lying, you’re a liar, I don’t believe you.” Another mocked me for not being very good at hockey, “You were probably terrible . . . My son could skate circles around you.” My OCI experience was so negative that I rejected both offers from Vault 100 firms and decided to go into Public Interest where I might be treated with at least a semblance of respect. I hope the day comes soon where law students aren’t put up for auction in front of cruel people in nice suits.

I am not sure I have come across a more trenchant paragraph on the topic of OCI. If the author of this quote reads this column, know that you can reach out via email if you want to talk.

The remaining presentations had some interesting portions. I wanted to roll my eyes when 17-year-old Josh Miller discussed Generation Z, especially after he mentioned he was born in December 2001, i.e., after September 11th, but I found many of his insights quite valuable. Apparently, by a two to one margin, members of Generation Z are more interested in a job with financial security than doing something they love, a marked shift from millenials and something that raises long-term questions for all of the public interest capacity that law schools have built up in recent years. Also, Instagram is the most popular social media platform for Generation Z because of the inherent competition for likes. So basically, the Black Mirror episode [“Nosedive”](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5497778/) is about five years away from being a documentary rather than dystopian fiction. In a separate presentation, Summit attendees got to see some of the interesting video tutorials being developed by the Career Services Office at the University of Virginia School of Law.

However, as I mentioned at the start of this column, while the whole Summit was not devoted to our post-Guidelines world, an hour had been blocked off for round table discussions on the topic. As you might imagine, I was READY to talk.



Unfortunately, the cathartic moment I was craving did not come to pass. Rather than an open, free for all discussion, each table of 8-10 participants had a conversation with a NALP board member who served as the institutional voice explaining the decision. While other participants might have had a different experience amongst their small group, I do not think many minds were changed at our table. Those who came in with objections to the changes, myself included, seemingly only had their opposition harden. In my mind, the effect that the post-Guidelines world will have on first-generation college grads, those who do not come from a family of attorneys, and those who attended non-“elite” undergraduate institutions will be more acute than I originally thought. I also now wish I had taken at least one course in Antitrust Law while at NYU.

But while I might have wished for a slightly different structure and focus to the day’s events, at the end of the day, I was glad that I attended the NALP Recruiting Summit and as with all my trips to New York City, very much in the mood for some dumplings and pizza — not necessarily at the same time, but also not inherently opposed to such a combination.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs.

# What Was The Best Biglaw Summer Associate Event Of 2017?
## Some Biglaw firms kept it real, but others kept it real boring...

After a relatively uneventful summer (in terms of law firm scandals, that is), summer associates have returned to their law schools, offers in hand, with only fond memories — not to mention full bank accounts — to remember their time with their firms. But which Biglaw firm provided summer associates with the most memorable experiences?

Let’s hear from you, our readers, to get the inside scoop. It’s time for Above the Law’s annual [summer associate event contest](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/best-summer-associate-event-contest/).

Last year, Quinn Emanuel trounced the competition for the second year in a row by taking summer associates on an all-expenses-paid [trip to Iceland](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/best-summer-associate-event-contest-2016-the-winner/). Even though Quinn’s summer program was smaller thanks to its [scaled-back program](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/biglaw-firm-decimates-summer-associate-program/), the firm still managed to blow the competition out of the water. Maybe this year, a challenger will be able to pry the honor of having the best summer associate event from the firm’s hands. Does your firm have what it takes?

Former Locke Lord partner, Mark Scott, was [convicted](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/former-biglaw-partner-convicted-in-cryptocurrency-scam/) in federal court in 2019 on conspiracy to commit bank fraud and conspiracy to launder money charges. Yesterday, for his role in the $400 million cryptocurrency scheme, Scott was sentenced to 10 years in prison.

Scott left his international mergers and acquisitions and private equity practice in Biglaw to work at OneCoin, and prosecutors say he had a key role in the plot to launder $400 million from the cryptocurrency. Prosecutors said Scott bragged about making $50 million before he was 50 years old. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said, “Indeed, Scott accomplished his goal, but by fraud and deception, and will now spend a decade in prison and has been ordered to forfeit all of his illegal proceeds.”

As [reported by](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/lawyer-sentenced-10-years-400-mln-crypto-money-laundering-scheme-2024-01-25/) Bloomberg Law, the 10-year sentence Judge Edgardo Ramos imposed was a compromise between what the defense wanted and prosecutors sought:

Scott had sought a sentence of five years of imprisonment in a brief filed on Friday, opens new tab. He said he was a “broken man” who has spent the last four years in home confinement, unable to leave his apartment except for medical or legal reasons.

Prosecutors sought at least 17 years in prison for Scott. He was “motivated by greed” and was not satisfied with the “luxurious lifestyle afforded to him by being an equity law firm partner, living in a $1.5 million condo in Coral Gables and earning upwards of a million dollars a year,” prosecutors said in a court filing, opens new tab.

Additionally, Scott was ordered to forfeit $392,940,000, several bank accounts, a yacht, two Porsche automobiles, and four real-estate properties.

Scott was disbarred by New York state in 2020.

# From ‘It Depends’ To Data-Backed Answers: Automating Legal Case Analysis
## AI offers a shortcut for optimizing the legal case analysis process.

As every lawyer knows, the response to nearly every legal question is: “It depends.” The law is a perpetual “what if” field surrounding unfortunate events and large sums of money. And the higher the stakes, the more clients want to know the likelihood of a positive outcome. 

To accurately predict case outcomes, a lawyer needs decades of thinking through what-if scenarios, identifying how multiple factors impacted previous case outcomes, and applying case law strategically. But even the savviest, most experienced lawyer couldn’t study every relevant case or predict every aspect influencing a potential new case.

AI offers a shortcut for optimizing the legal case analysis process. Using tools like ChatGPT, or a similar large language AI model specially trained on legal data, you can quickly identify winning legal strategies, increase your odds of positive outcomes, and expand your answer to clients’ what-if questions beyond “It depends.” Here’s how.

Automate And Enhance Legal Case Analysis With AI

Legal case analysis is about discovering how various legal arguments, litigation strategies, and other variables influenced final judgments and verdicts in cases similar to the one you’re considering. 

Manual legal case analysis is time consuming and labor intensive. Success depends on how much information a lawyer or legal team can consume in a limited time. Even when a lawyer’s career spans decades, she cannot digest a tenth of the information AI can in just a few minutes. With the power of AI in hand, you leverage machine learning algorithms to automate and enhance the entire case analysis process. 

Increase The Chances Of Favorable Outcomes

Vendors train legal-specific generative AI models on extensive databases of legal cases and their outcomes. The models analyze features of every case, such as legal issues, facts, jurisdiction, judges’ decisions, relevant precedents, and more. You simply input appropriate prompts regarding a current case you want to analyze. The AI system generates a legal case analysis that identifies comparable factors that contributed to successful outcomes in similar past scenarios and offers vital insights that increase your odds of a favorable outcome.

Predictions and probabilities on how a case might unfold give you a clearer understanding of your current case’s potential risks and possibilities. With this enhanced clarity, you can make more-informed decisions about how to approach a case. And you can get this information early enough to determine whether you want to accept the case. 

When you do accept a new case, AI helps identify winning legal arguments, case laws, and precedents that successfully achieved favorable outcomes in the past. You get data-backed insights that help you craft stronger legal strategies and suggestions for tailoring winning arguments to the facts at hand. With insight into judges’ tendencies, potential biases, and preferences, you learn what worked before in front of a particular judge to align your arguments with that judge’s viewpoint.

Keep The Human In Legal Practice

While generative AI presents numerous opportunities for improving legal practice, several challenges remain. Data quality is chief among them. Only a comprehensive and unbiased dataset can deliver accurate and meaningful insights.  

Additionally, many lawsuits hinge on nuanced legal language that AI struggles to interpret. An AI model may not fully grasp the complex contextual factors in some legal circumstances. Increasing an AI system’s comprehension level is just one reason to train it on legal-specific text.  

AI tools also possess inherent limitations. For example, a tool may be unable to access more recent information than several years ago. Ethical considerations also come into play, as analyzing past cases, especially sensitive or high-profile ones, requires careful consideration of data privacy. 

Interpret AI-generated results cautiously, as your human judgment and legal expertise remain vital to legal practice. You may still need to preface your responses to legal questions with “It depends.” But now you have data-backed answers to explain what it depends on and why.

# Leading Biglaw Firm That First Refused Special Bonuses Includes Them With Their Cravath Match
## Another law firm shows they have the cash to keep up.

When [Baker McKenzie first announced bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/) nearly two weeks ago, it raised some brows, but was otherwise met with dead silence. The rest of Biglaw was patiently [waiting for Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/cravath-bonuses/) to give Baker’s bonus scale credence, and now that the perrenial compensation leader has done just that, the bonus floodgates have opened.

The latest firm to announce bonuses is Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. Moments ago, the firm sent out a memo matching not just year-end bonuses, but special bonuses as well. If you recall, in mid-October, Cleary initially [refused to match](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/cleary-makes-a-move-in-the-fall-2020-bonus-wars/) the generous Davis Polk special bonuses, which one associate referred to as a cringeworthy punch to the nether regions.

Here’s the bonus scale, in case you’ve forgotten what it looks like:

Bonuses at Cleary will be paid on December 22. Congrats to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Cleary Gottlieb.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro to become a SCOTUS repeater? On June 20, 2016, after oral argument exactly two months before, the [U.S. Supreme Court](http://www.supremecourt.gov) issued [a 6-to-2 decision](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-415_mlho.pdf) remanding this case for further proceedings in the [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit](http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov).

Today. a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit issued [this decision](http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2017/01/09/13-55323.pdf) on remand. The first paragraph of the “Conclusion” section of today’s Ninth Circuit’s decision begins:

After a thorough, de novo review of congressional intent, we hold that the exemption in sec. 213(b)(10)(A) does not encompass service advisors. We acknowledge that our holding conflicts with published decisions by the Fourth and Fifth Circuits and by the Supreme Court of Montana.

The odds of this case’s becoming a SCOTUS repeater would appear to be very high.

Access today’s Order List of the [U.S. Supreme Court](http://www.supremecourt.gov): At [this link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/010917zor_c07d.pdf). The Court did not grant review in any new cases, but the Court did call for the views of the Solicitor General’s office in four cases. In addition, the Court dismissed the direct appeal in Parrott v. Lamone, No. 16-588, “for want of jurisdiction.”

In White v. Pauly, No. 16-67. the Court issued [a unanimous per curiam decision](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-67_2c8f.pdf). Justice Ginsburg issued a concurring opinion.

And in early news coverage, The Associated Press reports that “[High Court won’t hear appeal over Backpage.com escort ads](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_SUPREME_COURT_BACKPAGE_SEX_TRAFFICKING?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT)“; “[Ventura loses appeal to reinstate $1.8M verdict](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_SUPREME_COURT_SNIPER_AUTHOR_VENTURA?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT)“; and “[Supreme Court rejects appeal from flight-sharing company](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_SUPREME_COURT_FLIGHT_SHARING?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT).”

From Reuters, Lawrence Hurley reports that “[Supreme Court rejects Dow over $1 billion tax deduction claim](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-dow-idUSKBN14T1MA)” and “[U.S. top court rejects banks over FDIC lawsuit](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-fdic-idUSKBN14T1OH).” And Andrew Chung reports that “[U.S. Supreme Court will not examine tech industry legal shield](http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-backpage-idUSW1N1B5020).”

Just when we thought we were [seeing some consensus](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/salary-movement-trickles-down-to-midwest-mainstay/) on salaries in the heartland, someone comes along and raises the stakes again.

[Dowd Bennett LLP](http://www.dowdbennett.com), a St. Louis-based, high-stakes litigation boutique, has pushed starting salaries to $180K and carved out its place as the Cravath of Mississippi River.

And its roster certainly befits that comparison. With fewer than 30 attorneys, the firm boasts former Senator [John Danforth](http://www.dowdbennett.com/attorneys/john-c-danforth/), two former United States Attorneys, two former United States Supreme Court clerks, four former clerks to United States Courts of Appeals, and more lawyers with a bevy of impressive stops on their bios. So it’s a destination employer even before announcing raises.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But oh what a difference these raises will make! For those keeping score at home, Husch Blackwell just raised its St. Louis salaries to $130K and Bryan Cave is paying $135K, so it’s safe to characterize Dowd Bennett as blowing away the market. And while the boutique is on the smaller side with only a handful of associates, it’s certainly the firm every top graduate and hotshot AUSA has to be gunning for now. It’s always hard to predict what will motivate a firm to move on compensation, but one has to think the biggest firms in St. Louis can’t let a roughly $50K shortfall go unanswered.

In the meantime, Dowd Bennett will continue racking up recruiting wins as the top dog in St. Louis litigation.

Remember, when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# On Law Firm Perfection
## Once institutions begin to prize revenue over perfection, they may lose their focus.

Good law firms say they don’t make mistakes.

The firms instill this in their associates.  You file a brief; you notice a typo after it’s filed; you cringe and curse:  “Damn!  I can’t believe I missed that!  What an idiot!”

Partners circle typos on associates’ drafts.  Maybe the partners explain that this firm doesn’t produce work with typographical errors.  Maybe the partners don’t actually explain that; they let the circles speak for themselves.

On the one hand, the associates think this is crazy:  “Why are they so nuts about typos?  The judge will know what we mean.”

On the other hand, the partners know that they’re right:  “If we’re perfect and the other firm is not, we get more and better work.  If the other firm is perfect and we’re not, the market destroys us.  We’re perfect.”

The sane associates may quit.

The nutcases may remain.

But the firm continues to produce top-notch work.  (The work isn’t really perfect, of course.  The work is, however, what you produce when you pursue perfection, and that’s what the firm is after.)

The pursuit of perfection:  That’s the way it works.  That’s the way it’s supposed to work.  That’s how you instill a culture of perfection.  (Heaven help the associate who overlooks something that’s actually important, such as a key case, or the associate who misstates a holding.  Real blunders may have real consequences.)

Once in a blue moon, you hear a partner say that an error doesn’t matter.  But these are special occasions.  For example, the associate has been at the firm for seven years.  The associate’s work has been flawless for those seven years.  And the associate now overlooked something in a brief that’s been filed.  The associate is overcome with remorse, because the associate is actually a top-notch lawyer (and a compulsive nutcase).  The partner tries to calm the associate:  “That’s okay.  Everyone makes a mistake every once in a while.  I even made a mistake back in ’83.  We’ll fix your error in the reply brief.  Don’t worry about it.”

But that’s very, very rare.

I suspect (but don’t know from personal experience) that other top-notch professional services firms operate the same way.  The very best management consultants, investment banks, and the like strive for perfection.  It’s how they survive.

But once institutions get sufficiently large, or start to operate in less competitive spaces, or have less demanding clients, or begin to prize revenue over perfection, institutions may lose their focus.

“How do you feel about malpractice claims?”

“You have to be compassionate.  I figure that anyone can make a mistake.”

Your institution is dead.

The pursuit of perfection is gone.  And if you’re not pursuing perfection, you’ll never got anywhere close to achieving it.

# Biglaw's $115,000 Bonus Scale Gains Steam And High Billers Can Take Home Even More Cash

Another Biglaw firm has decided to play ball with the new bonus scale — set by Cravath yesterday — which ups the take home for most associates by 15 percent over last year’s bonuses.  This afternoon, Boies Schiller Flexner announced they will be handing out bonuses on this new and improved scale.

Here’s the bonus scale, which Biglaw watchers are increasingly familiar with — but as you’ll notice, high billers can take down even bigger bonuses:


At Boies Schiller, associates have the option of doing the market bonus system, which will get them the above scale, or [they can opt](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/despite-changes-to-their-compensation-system-associates-at-boies-schiller-can-still-take-home-huge-bonuses/) into the firm’s formula compensation system, which includes a revenue share component that affords associates a cut of the matters they work on, which for contingency work [can be massive](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/boies-schiller-makes-its-associates-very-happy-once-again-with-giant-bonus-checks/).
