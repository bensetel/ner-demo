# Think Fall Is A Bad Time To Make A Lateral Move? Think Again.
## Read on to hear why — contrary to popular belief — fall is a great time to lateral.

Every fall, we at Lateral Link have conversations with associates who are ready to switch firms but worry that this is the wrong time of year to do it. Wouldn’t it make more sense to just wait until the new year, after annual bonuses have been paid?

That line of thinking is fundamentally flawed, for many reasons. As a service to any associate who might be holding off on making a move until 2022, we’ve assembled the collective wisdom on this topic of a dozen Lateral Link recruiters. Read on to hear why — contrary to popular belief — fall is a great time to lateral.

Don’t worry about your annual bonus! The new firm will make you whole

“The lateral firm hiring market is very active from now until around Thanksgiving, so it is a very good time to explore your options. We can always negotiate a signing bonus to make you whole for the year-end bonus that you may be leaving on the table.”  – Romina Filippou

You might actually come out ahead financially by moving now

“We are seeing lateral associate offers with extra signing bonuses on top of true-up signing or guaranteed bonuses. Making associates whole is standard with the majority of most Am Law 100 firms and many firms are incentivizing prospective lateral associate hires with significant additional signing bonuses. This gives lateral associates the opportunity to earn substantially more for the fiscal year than they would if they remained at their current firm.”  – Jesse Hyde

“Biglaw firms are regularly offering full year-end, signing and even special bonuses to associates, especially corporate associates, that join between now and bonus season. So, you may actually make more money if you leave your firm now, than if you wait to make a move in January! Special bonuses are generally being paid out this fall, in the case of firms that are offering them.” – Romina Filippou

If you’re worried about meeting your hours target, a lateral move could be a solution

“Some candidates prefer a fall start date if they know they likely won’t make their hours by the end of the year, so they want to get out and be made whole before that happens.” – Kelly Rizzo

Strong firm demand + weak competition = exceptional opportunity

“When we hit Q4, the supply of strong candidates tends to drop dramatically. But the demand from firms is just as high (in some cases, higher given how many end of year closings there are). Many firms I work with will not only make candidates whole but will offer compelling bonuses on top of that in order to make the decision a no-brainer. The other scenario is that attorneys can make a move that is by no means ‘lateral,’ in that they’re joining a much stronger platform with better short-term and long-term prospects. So it’s truly an upward move that puts them on a far better trajectory.”  – Zach Sandberg

“If everyone is going to zig, a Fall move might be the right time to zag. The needs of firms remain strong. Less competition for a dream role or firm can happen if everyone’s waiting until January to leave their current position.”  – Steven Rushing

“Your dream job may not wait for the new year. Firms that hire in the fall — especially for roles on smaller teams or for a practice that is steady, but not booming — may not hire again until the back half of 2022.” – Andrew Clyne 

The lateral market will be much more crowded in the new year

“Competition will be more fierce in the spring when everyone is looking to move.”  – Ed Hossain

“Don’t get lost in the crowd. If you wait until bonuses are paid, you’ll be part of a huge surge in applicants we see every January. That increases competition for the same openings.”  – Amy K. Savage

“I expect an especially competitive January this coming year. Many firms have moved their office reopening dates back to January 2022, which will trigger more lateral movement at that time. By moving now, you’ll get a leg up.”  – Stephanie Ruiter

A fall start enables you to ease into your new job

“Associates like starting new roles in the Fall because they like to time their ramp-up period with a new firm at the end of the year (and end of the firm’s billable cycle).  This takes some pressure off, particularly if the candidate is receiving a guaranteed year-end bonus.  Then he/she can hit the ground running in the new year.”  – Zain Atassi

“Some candidates want to transition before the holidays to get familiar with their new firm and team in order to hit the ground running after the new year. Any transition involves some ramp-up time and the fall is a perfect time to settle into a new role.” – Megan Penrod

It’s silly to stay at a firm where you aren’t having a good experience

“Consider the opportunity cost. Why put up with months of misery when you can leave and join a team where you will thrive over the holidays?”  – Amy K. Savage

The lateral process could take longer than you expect

“The process can also take longer than you might think from resume to start date. So if you start the process now, you may not end up starting until January 2022 anyways.”  – Abby Gordon

As Russia continues its invasion of Ukraine and the associated war crimes mount up, the role of Biglaw in building and maintaining the Putin war machine comes under increased scrutiny. While firms are [leaving the country in droves](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/biglaw-firms-ditching-russian-government-clients-because-its-the-right-move/) — though some [offer some cagey statements about the scope of this withdrawal](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/what-all-the-biglaw-firms-are-saying-about-future-russia-business/) — the question on everyone’s mind is “what did firms know and when did they know it?” Not necessarily as a legal matter as much as a moral matter.

One might have thought “right around when Putin invaded Ukraine in 2014,” but news travels slow when there are billables on the line.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
[Representative Steve Cohen of Tennessee](https://cohen.house.gov/) has seen enough to conclude that at least some lawyers based in London knew the score when it came to their specific representations and has [written the State Department](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2022/04/Cohen-Letter.pdf) asking that six lawyers be banned from the United States as part of a program to deter “foreign enablers of Russian oligarchs.”

The lawyers named in Rep. Cohen’s letter run the gamut from 8000 lawyer giant [CMS](https://cms.law/en/int/), to mid-sized outfits like [Harbottle & Lewis](https://www.harbottle.com/), to elite boutiques like [Schillings](https://www.schillingspartners.com/team/):

• Nigel Tait of Carter-Ruck, who has acted on behalf of Kremlin oil champion Rosneft on abusive suits against Catherine Belton and HarperCollins and worked for Gennady Timchenko in seeking to stifle investigative reporting.
• John Kelly of Harbottle & Lewis, who represented Roman Abramovich in his abusive lawsuit against Catherine Belton and HarperCollins.
• Hugh Tomlinson, who represented Roman Abramovich, Mikhail Fridman, and Petr Aven in abusive suits against Catherine Belton and HarperCollins.
• Geraldine Proudler of CMS, who worked for Mikhail Fridman and Petr Aven in abusive suits against HarperCollins and worked for Major Pavel Karpov, formerly of the Russian Interior Ministry, in an abusive suit against Bill Browder.
• Keith Schilling of Shillings, who is well known for bringing abusive suits against journalists and worked tirelessly to protect the fugitive Malaysian businessman Jho Low, is accused by U.S. prosecutors of running a money laundering scheme to embezzle billions of dollars from Malaysian state investment fund, 1MDB. Schillings sent legal threats to UK booksellers to prevent them from selling a book about their clients that was published by reporters working for The Wall Street Journal.
• Shlomo Rechtschaffen, who is representing Walter Soriano, an enabler of Oleg Deripaska, Roman Abramovich, and Dmitry Rybolovlev, in an abusive lawsuit against Scott Stedman.

This list largely tracks the list [publicized by UK MP Bob Seely](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/going-ahead-and-naming-names-of-lawyers-working-for-russian-regime/) back in March.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Working for Russian businesses isn’t necessarily a bad thing let alone an illegal one. But given the effort the Putin regime reportedly puts into laundering assets through a web of otherwise legitimate operations, working for Russian entities in recent years should have raised at least some no-pun-intended red flags. It’s up to firms to “know your client” enough to feel reasonably secure that the firm isn’t just becoming a cog in a shell game that, ultimately, produces tragic results.

UK Legal Week [reached out to the firms involved](https://www.law.com/international-edition/2022/04/19/us-congressman-calls-for-cms-schillings-lawyers-to-be-banned-over-russian-work-slams-uk-blood-money/) to get their reaction to the allegation that they went over the line:

“We strongly reject the allegations of impropriety that have been made against CMS, and in particular Geraldine Proudler. We have reviewed the steps taken in our media litigation practice and are confident that these were compliant with all professional regulations as well as our wider responsibilities at the time,” a CMS spokesperson said.

“Congressman Cohen says he seeks to sanction lawyers who are currently performing work for Russian clients, but as we have said since the invasion of Ukraine, CMS is no longer accepting new instructions from Russian-based entities or from any individuals with connections to the Russian government,” the spokesperson added.

I’m not sure his letter is limited to lawyers currently working with the Russian government. The letter explicitly says, “individuals who have enabled,” which reads very backward looking. But the firm seems comfortable with its actions beforehand as well.

“The claims made against Carter-Ruck are misconceived and are rejected entirely. In addition to other matters, we are not working for any Russian individuals, companies or entities seeking to challenge, overturn, frustrate or minimise sanctions. We have never acted for Russian individuals, companies or entities seeking to challenge sanctions,” the spokesperson said, adding that the firm condemns the Russian government’s decision to invade Ukraine.

There’s that focus on what’s happening now again. Carter-Ruck also asserts that it properly followed “know your client” laws at all times, but it sticks out how much all of these responses put on “not anymore” when that’s not really the basis of the complaint.

In any event, the UK is looking into firms alleged to have breached its rules and will ultimately clear or condemn the lawyers involved.

But that’s not really the point of Rep. Cohen’s letter.

He’s not actually saying that the lawyers involved did anything illegal. In fact, the letter seems to operate from the premise that they didn’t do anything illegal because he argues that UK rules are too lax in the first place. Instead, the letter contends that, given a lack of outright violations, the United States should use its power to limit the privileges it chooses to grant as a mechanism to discourage lawyers who might lend their talents to the Russian regime now or in the future by denying visas to lawyers who already represented key figures in the Russian hierarchy.

There’s no question that these lawyers represented those folks — and that’s all his letter turns on.

The State Department’s response will be interesting.

The webinar will include a demonstration of Lex Machina’s award-winning Legal Analytics® platform, which is expanding into its largest practice area yet: commercial litigation. Legal Analytics is a combination of data and analytics software that provides unprecedented strategic insight at your fingertips to craft winning litigation strategy.

# Biglaw Firm Faces Potential Sanctions For Stonewalling Sexual Assault Plaintiffs
## The judge is not happy.

Pepper Hamilton is potentially in some hot water for failing to produce documents pursuant to a court order. The discovery kerfuffle comes as a result of Doe v. Baylor University, a Title IX lawsuit in which students allege the University did not do enough about their allegations of sexual assault, and created an environment which allowed sexual attacks to flourish.

Baylor had engaged Pepper Hamilton in 2015 to review the[ school’s handling of sexual assault claims](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/irony-alert-ken-starr-should-lose-his-job-for-not-investigating-real-sex-crimes/). And the Biglaw firm’s report… didn’t leave the school in a good light and left a [string of fired people in its wake.](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/former-baylor-coach-rips-pepper-hamilton-calls-out-ken-starr/) In the civil suit, Pepper Hamilton was ordered by U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman to produce all documents responsive to discovery requests that Baylor does not have, or anything Baylor has not yet produced. But, [as reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/06/10/pepper-hamilton-might-face-sanctions-for-discovery-fiasco-in-baylor-sex-assault-case/) Law.com, come time for the discovery deadline all of the documents were not produced:

However, by the April 11 deadline, Pepper Hamilton certified that the firm didn’t have any materials that Baylor doesn’t also possess, said the court’s June 7 order. The firm asked the court to reconsider or clarify the order for documents that Baylor had not yet disclosed, and raised three brand-new “untimely objections” to complying with discovery. The law firm now claims it shouldn’t have to release records that Baylor logged as privilege, anything dated after June 15, 2016, and records related to three “separate” legal matters that the firm worked on for Baylor.

Judge Pitman was not happy that Pepper Hamilton waited so long to make these objections, and he pointed to multiple discovery issues over the last two years of the litigation when he said sanctions are very much on the table:

“This violation has caused three months of delay in a case that has already been pending for three years and forced the parties to revisit issues that should have been resolved two years ago when the subpoena was first issued. This conduct increases costs for all parties and wastes public resources that are meant for adjudicating good faith disputes,” Pitman wrote.

The firm will have the opportunity to argue they shouldn’t face sanctions at a June 17th hearing.

You can read the judge’s order below.

# New York Market Update: Strong Lateral Demand, Though With Variation Across Practice Areas

With talk of recession on the rise nationally, how are law firms in New York holding up? So far, the lateral market remains open for business. Firms are emphasizing some different practice areas compared to a year ago, but they continue to hire broadly.

Lateral placement data indicate a healthy market: there were around 75 more lateral moves in New York in Q2 2022 than in Q2 2021. That’s saying something, considering that 2021 was an exceptionally strong lateral market.

Litigation rises as transactional starts to slow

Demand for transactional lawyers has moderated compared to last year: there were 341 lateral placements in Q2 2022 into corporate practices (35% of all placements in the quarter), as compared to 420 the year before (46%). However, other practice areas are picking up the slack. Demand for litigators is on the rise: whereas in Q2 2021, there were 162 lateral placements in litigation, the number rose to 210 in Q2 2022.

A central driver of the growing opportunity in litigation is a widespread effort among firms to expand their white-collar practices. The Biden administration has made no secret of its intention to increase enforcement, and firms are positioning themselves to compete for what should be a lucrative wave of white-collar assignments. Boutiques that are mainly known for complex commercial litigation have lately been especially active in the lateral market, seeking to build up their white-collar credibility.

Many opportunities in niche practices

Among more niche practice areas, antitrust is in strong demand, as firms anticipate [coming enforcement activity](https://laterallink.com/the-2022-milton-handler-lecture-refocusing-antitrust-enforcement-on-competition/). Funds is a particular bright spot on the transactional side, with practices sufficiently stretched such that they have been willing to retool junior associates from other groups. And both real estate and bankruptcy are on the rise, with around twice as many lateral placements in Q2 2022 as compared to the same period a year earlier. Bankruptcy and restructuring practices are particularly interested in candidates who have both transactional and bankruptcy litigation experience. Of course, if a recession does materialize, demand in this area should accelerate further.

Who is best placed to make a move?

Across practices, midlevel associates have the broadest range of lateral opportunities, with the sweet spot around 3-5 years of experience. In litigation, there has been an unusual level of demand for more senior associates in addition to midlevels. Boutiques in particular have been extending offers to sixth and seventh years.

With most firms having adopted a hybrid working model in their New York offices, we are seeing an increasing number of interviews conducted in-person, which candidates tend to find helpful in gaining insight into a firm’s culture. This summer is a particularly good time to enter the lateral market because an unusual number of associates are tied down by bonuses issued last year or in early 2022, either as part of a lateral move or as a retention incentive.

Though candidates shouldn’t worry about changing firms right now, we are urging those exploring in-house roles to proceed with caution. The risks of a layoff appear to be elevated in the current environment, especially for lawyers entering at more junior levels. Keep in mind that [unlike at law firms](https://laterallink.com/is-your-firm-recession-resistant-enough-to-thrive-in-an-economic-downturn/), the most recently hired employees tend to be most vulnerable when companies go through layoffs.

# Andrew Yang Is Just Like Us, When It Comes To Biglaw

The Washington Post did a big profile of Andrew Yang’s aborted Biglaw career and… well, it pretty much sounds like everybody’s aborted Biglaw career. Yes, he had all the credentials. Yes, he made a lot of money. But the feelings of pointlessness and soullessness took hold, and he eventually left Biglaw to find what he really wanted to do.

Yang went to Brown for college, Columbia for law school, and Davis Polk for money. Then, he got off that train. The only significant difference between his story and most is that Yang only lasted five months. Most last a bit longer.

The rest checks out. Here are some quotes [from the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/28/andrew-yang-was-groomed-high-paying-job-an-elite-law-firm-he-lasted-five-months/?arc404=true):

He frequently refers to his lawyer days as “the five worst months of my life.”

“Working at a law firm was like a pie-eating contest, and if you won, your prize was more pie,” Yang said in a recent interview on the Acela train from Washington to New York, between hurried bites of a turkey sandwich.

The law jokes play well, especially because seven of the 12 candidates in the last televised Democratic debate have law degrees.

Everybody makes that joke, WaPo.

“It felt very purposeless and empty,” Yang said. “I was looking out at New York and thinking, ‘Wow, is this why my parents came to this country?’ ”…

Yang said he did a “test” with himself to see whether he was in it just for the money.

“I went to Bloomingdale’s and bought my family cashmere scarves and some other nice gifts. Then I brought them to them that weekend, and they seemed to like them,” he said. “And I thought: Is this enough for me to do a job I don’t like? Definitely not.”

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
After a case unexpectedly settled in the middle of the week, I took the rest of the week off, bought a first-class ticket to Vegas, at the airport, and won about half of it back taking money off of people there for some sort of convention. It wasn’t enough.

Look, we’ve all been there, some people find a way to love what they do. Others find a way to love the money they make while doing it. And a lot of people eventually quit. The best thing about Yang’s story is that he went through the process so quickly. It took me two years to figure out how to get out. It takes others longer. Some people are a decade in before they finally break free.

Often, things work out. Maybe not as well as they’ve worked out for Yang, but in my travels I’ve found that the skills that made people successful Biglaw candidates can be redeployed to make them successful at other things. The training is never really lost, it just has to be re-formatted a bit. As Yang puts it:

He said he doesn’t regret studying law, which made him more “structured and detail oriented.” On the other hand, he said, the cautious analysis taught in law school can get in the way of an entrepreneur who needs to make decisions quickly, often based more on instinct than data. He said he had to “unlearn” some of what his law professors taught him.

Plunge on in, the water’s fine. You almost probably won’t totally drown in debt for the rest of your life.

# Former Chief Operating Officer Accuses Proskauer Of ‘Machiavellian Management’ In Latest Filing
## The defendant comes out swinging.

The explosive [lawsuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/proskauer-files-lawsuit-against-fired-chief-operating-officer-what-you-need-to-know/) between Biglaw firm Proskauer and its former Chief Operating Officer, Jonathan O’Brien, has reached a new level of acrimony with the latest court filing. You’ll recall, the firm alleges the now-former COO downloaded 34 gigabytes of internal data to a USB drive before announcing he was leaving the firm. (The firm fired O’Brien the same day they filed the Southern District of New York complaint.) The complaint also alleges O’Brien attempted to delete emails subject to a litigation hold.

In the defendant’s filing he told the court he only downloaded the information necessary to do his job as he traveled abroad at year end, “Mr. O’Brien did precisely what any COO traveling abroad at year end would have done; he took steps to ensure that he had the information he would need to do his job, and nothing more.”

Further, as [reported](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/former-proskauer-exec-hits-back-vindictive-data-theft-lawsuit-2023-01-12/) by Reuters, O’Brien accuses the firm of using the lawsuit to stem a tide of recent departures:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The real motivation behind Proskauer’s lawsuit is to intimidate and dissuade other employees from leaving the firm after a spate of recent partner and business-side departures, O’Brien alleged, accusing the firm of “Machiavellian management.”

O’Brien had [reportedly](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/ex-proskauer-exec-was-heading-to-paul-hastings-before-biglaw-lawsuit-blew-it-all-up/) turned in his notice at Proskauer to pursue an opportunity at rival Paul Hastings. However, that offer appears to be rescinded after the allegations in the complaint became public.

O’Brien told the court he is considering filing counterclaims “against both Proskauer and the individuals at Proskauer in their personal capacity who are driving this vindictive litigation,” which he said has left him “unemployed for the foreseeable future.”

“Proskauer has improperly used the judicial system as a sledgehammer to destroy Mr. O’Brien’s career and reputation,” he said.

The firm provided the following statement on the filing:

# Unlimited Vacation Policies Can Be Bad For Associates
## Law firms often have selfish reasons for instituting unlimited vacation policies.

Before starting my own practice [earlier this year](http://www.rothmanlawyer.com), I worked at a number of law firms. Although each of those shops offered various job perks, all of them allowed attorneys to take time off for vacations. Each of the firms where I worked had a different vacation policy, and a few had unlimited vacation policies.

Under that kind of vacation policy, firms basically tell associates that they can take off as much time as they want so long as they meet their billable hour requirements and satisfy client expectations. At first blush, this might seem like a great perk, since this policy can afford associates greater flexibility and more vacation time than in other shops. However, law firms often have selfish reasons for instituting unlimited vacation policies.

One reason why firms might not want to give associates a set number of vacation days is because they do not want to pay attorneys for unused vacation time when they leave their jobs. Many firms, as well as companies in other industries, offer employees a set amount of vacation time, usually two to four weeks. Some firms even allow associates to roll over a certain number of unused vacation days from year to year. At a number of law firms (and companies in other industries), when an associate leaves, the attorney will be paid for any unused vacation time.

I worked at one firm that had such a policy, and paying associates for any unused vacation time gave attorneys a number of options. Associates could use their vacation days to take time off, or if they were like me, and did not prefer to go on vacations, they could pocket more money when they departed the firm. That system provides financial benefits to associates and, to the benefit of firms, may prevent attorneys from taking time off frivolously.

However, if firms do not designate a set number of vacation days to which each employee is entitled, they can completely sidestep the issue of paying for unused vacation time. As a result, firms can save a substantial amount of money by having an unlimited vacation policy. Accordingly, firms should not be given credit for having an unlimited vacation policy, since firms can realize significant financial benefits from such a policy.

In addition, having an unlimited vacation policy makes it difficult for associates to understand how much time they can take off in a given year, which may force attorneys to go on vacation less frequently. For instance, I once worked at a firm that did not pay attorneys for unused vacation time but guaranteed each attorney a set number of vacation days each year. Since the number of vacation days was established, people were encouraged to take time off to avoid missing out on this perk.

One time, I took off for nearly three weeks at the end of one year, since I had the vacation time, and I would lose the vacation days if I didn’t use them. I selected the last several weeks of the year to take off (since litigation is usually pretty slow around this time), and it felt great not being bothered and having so much time to myself. It goes without saying that attorneys at this firm had a better work-life balance than at other shops, mainly because the guidelines about vacation time were clear and respected.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
However, if firms do not specify how much vacation time each attorney can take, it might be more difficult to assess how much vacation time is reasonable and what expectations are around the office. Ambiguous expectations may not only impact associates but also affect management. Indeed, partners I worked with at firms that had unlimited vacation policies did not respect vacation days as much as partners at firms that had set policies.

For instance, I had a friend — who worked with me at a firm which had an unlimited vacation policy — who needed to take two weeks or so off from work to go on a honeymoon. A two-week vacation is not a big deal at many firms, especially when a number of shops offer four weeks of paid vacation each year. However, a partner criticized the associate for taking so much time off and sternly reminded the attorney to make up for lost billable hours upon returning to the office. If this firm had a fixed vacation policy, the partner possibly would have respected the associate’s vacation time more and not given the attorney such a hard time for taking time off. When firms blur expectations about vacations and don’t establish clear rights when it comes to taking time off, it is much easier for managers to be harsh to attorneys for taking vacations.

In the end, some shops advertise unlimited vacation policies as a great perk, and it might be easy for associates to think that there are only benefits to such a policy. However, firms often institute such policies for selfish reasons, since firms can realize financial benefits from such policies, and not designating a set number of vacation days can make it difficult for associates to take time off.

# Law Firm Leaving Russia Has A Bit Of Trouble Describing Its Russian Spin-Off

Think of these as successive official statements from the firm.

Spin the PR wheel… is this an exclusive relationship? A preferred relationship? Maybe a loose understanding? What do we call this thing? As they say, “[big money, big money, no whammies, stop!](https://theretronetwork.com/big-money-no-whammies/)”

Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Biglaw firms have built up a substantial book of Russian business. And, as the Russian Federation’s business environment morphed to include a similarly substantial level of laundering for the Putin regime, firms kept on working in the country employing measures to keep their business as distanced from Putin as possible — with varying success.

Regardless of how fruitful these anti-corruption measures were, in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, law firms are issuing statements announcing their plans to… do something with their Russian business. Some statements proclaim a planned withdrawal while others read like [some kind of facsimile of a withdrawal](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/what-all-the-biglaw-firms-are-saying-about-future-russia-business/).

Enter today’s announcement from Eversheds Sutherland. Or “announcements,” as the case may be. The firm posted on LinkedIn earlier that it would spin off its Russian operations as a new firm known as Birch Legal. Does this sound like the firm is following through on its promise to “no longer have a presence” in Russia?



A “relationship firm” servicing the needs of Eversheds Sutherland’s international clients doesn’t read emphatically like a withdrawal from Russia. And that’s certainly how a number of lawyers in the U.S. seem to have read it too. As one tipster put it, “The message was passed around in various associate text threads and mentioned in some meetings and the general consensus was that this is viewed as essentially still remaining operating in Russia and ultimately a distinction without a difference.”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Fast forward and later in the day the message had changed:



“Eversheds Sutherland’s relationship firm” has changed to “Eversheds Sutherland’s preferred relationship firm,” suggesting a little less exclusivity than the original message. A tipster also noted that, “An announcement sent to all US lawyers was even softer and said only that the new firm could provide Russian services for clients that need them.”

Hey, maybe the firm had a steady position all along and all these slightly shifting descriptions are just the result of a game of corporate communication telephone. That’s always possible.

But whatever the reason, and putting aside the moral propriety of this particular arrangement, this kind of semantic reshuffling highlights the deeper problem many firms face when it comes to Russian business: a lot of them are in too deep.

Lots of firms have business in Russia, but they also have non-Russian clients who still want to do business in Russia. Cutting the country loose leaves all the work of the last 30 years on the table and prompts some clients to take lucrative deals elsewhere. So you end up with firms embodying the [Bilbo Baggins meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/after-all-why-not-why-shouldnt-i-keep-it), staring at their Russian business and muttering “After all… why not? Why shouldn’t I keep it?”

At least in some form.

Maybe it’s some empty statement about carefully evaluating the situation. Maybe it’s a temporary withdrawal. Maybe it’s a spin-off that ultimately functions as a mutually beneficial cooperative venture. Whatever it is, it’s still a continuing business relationship with Putin’s overarching economic kleptocracy — and however successfully firms navigated those waters in the past, it certainly seems as though it’s going to be a lot harder to steer clear of lining the pockets of questionable actors going forward.

Hopefully this particular firm knows what it’s doing with its new exclusive relationship. Or preferred relationship. Or “strangers we kind of know from LinkedIn” or whatever they’re calling this now.

# Biglaw Attorney Leaves Firm Over Vaccine Requirement, Wants Everyone To Know He's A Big Bozo
## Just... get vaccinated people. It's not that difficult.

Between [availability of Pfizer doses](https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/08/politics/jill-biden-child-vaccine-tour/index.html) for kids aged 5-12, the GOP coming for[ Big Bird](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/big-bird-vaccine-announcement-sparks-backlash-conservatives-gop-n1283425), Aaron Rodgers revealing himself to be a[ lying liar/homeopathic anti-vaxxer](https://sports.yahoo.com/terry-bradshaw-leads-morning-show-charge-criticizing-aaron-rodgers-you-lied-to-everyone-233354067.html), and[ OSHA’s vaccine mandate ](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/osha-vaccine-mandate-impact/story?id=80991283)getting temporarily blocked from taking effect, news about the COVID-19 vaccine has reached a fevered pitch. And it makes sense — vaccination is the best bet for a society eager to be done with a prolonged pandemic but despite that fact, the vaccine hesitant or outright opponents of vaccines persist.

And that battleline between the health and safety of society and a misguided sense of “personal freedom” has come to Biglaw. Yes, of course lawyers *should* be [well-versed](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/arguably-the-most-important-supreme-court-case-right-now/) in the[ constitutionality](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/trust-us-states-really-can-make-you-wear-masks/) of vaccine mandates, but that doesn’t mean some don’t see a hill to die on.

Enter this… interesting farewell email from now former WilmerHale attorney Matthew Celestin. In it he writes:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Over the years, I have imagined many different scenarios under which I might leave the firm, but I must admit that being let go over a mandatory vaccination policy was never on my radar. But, here we are and so be it — live and let live (well, I guess, technically not).



[UPDATE: According to a tipster:

I didn’t want to be the one to out the guy, but I thought I’d add that the link he provided for Vaccination Policy is to an Alex Jones narrated anti-science “documentary”

I’m not linking to “COVIDLAND: The Lockdown” because it is gross disinformation but trust it only makes my already low opinion of Celestin’s reasoning take a nose dive.]

Above the Law reached out to WilmerHale and they confirmed they do have a vaccine requirement for employees.

Of course, Celestin is free to decide that continued employment at the 29th highest grossing law firm in the country is no longer in the cards for him for any reason at all — even one as silly as a vaccine mandate. But broadcasting the reason behind his departure to the entire firm puts future employers — and clients —  on notice. And they might just take a hard look at his suspect reasoning on vaccines and decide that’s a poor indication on his legal reasoning.

Well, well, well, what do we have here? It’s another match!

Cadwalader — a firm that brought in $608,953,000 gross revenue in 2021, putting it in 73rd place in the most recent Am Law 100 — has stepped into the Biglaw bonus zone. The firm is offering associates the prevailing market rate, which in this case, goes up to $115,000 for its most senior associates.

Here’s the bonus scale, in case you’ve forgotten what it looks like:

- Class of 2022: $15,000 (pro-rated)
- Class of 2021: $20,000
- Class of 2020: $30,000
- Class of 2019: $57,500
- Class of 2018: $75,000
- Class of 2017: $90,000
- Class of 2016: $105,000
- Class of 2015: $115,000
As an extra bonus for the firm’s highest billers — we’re talking associates who have logged 2200 or more hours — year-end bonuses of 120% of the amounts listed above will be awarded. Very exciting news!

Congratulations on your bonuses, Cadwalader associates! You can look forward to seeing the money in your accounts at the end of February 2023.

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Cadwalader.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks for your help!

# This Time, The Piper Follows The Bonus Pack
## Err... the piper follows the bonuses? Whatever.

Do you know what “pied” means in the context of Pied Piper? Honestly, it never crossed my mind until now. Apparently it means being multi-colored decoration “especially black and white.” Huh. No kidding.

Anyway, DLA stands for “Dibb Lupton Alsop,” and this is the specific Piper following the parade of bonuses this Friday afternoon.

DLA Piper is number 3 on the Am Law 100 with $3,471,437,000 in revenue in 2021 and the very, very big verein is joining the bonus consensus.



The payout is a little complex… but it’s good news for big performers:

Qualifying associates who are meeting the firm’s expectations, as detailed in the
Policy and rated at least a 3, will receive a market-level bonus. The firm will pay
additional bonuses to Associates who have met the criteria set forth in the Policy and who made even greater contributions to the firm’s success, based on billable hours and performance evaluations. Associates rated a 4 or 5 will receive a bonus increase for each additional rating.

Associates in good standing based on hours entered by December 16 receive 50 percent of the base market bonus noted above on December 30. The rest, including any above-market bonus, will be paid out on January 27, 2023. BUT, if the target is not met by December 16, but do reach it by December 31, will get everything on January 27.

Got all that?

Counsel and off grid folks will get individual notifications.

Congrats. Memo on next page.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

# The Art Of Management For A Young Lawyer: Developing Your Management Style
## Each person's style will be different, but some core principles are universal.

I recently reflected that I have been practicing law in one capacity or another for about 10 years now. In each position I have held, I have been given more responsibility to manage the work of my colleagues. At my [current firm](https://balestrierefariello.com/), I am lucky enough to now manage the work of some junior lawyers and paralegals. That made me think — do I have a management style? And what is it that works best?

I believe that each person needs to develop their own style of management and find out what work best for them. But I also think that there are some core principles that will assist most lawyers in becoming better managers of their colleagues.

First, I think to be an effective manager, you need to be a good leader. The best way to establish yourself as a leader in your firm is to lead by example. If you expect your colleagues to work late at night, you should be prepared to do so as well. I know that seniority has it benefits, but if you show your more junior colleagues that you are willing and able to work late, then they will respect you more as a leader. This will also help you earn your colleagues’ respect and show them why you are in a management position.

Second, I believe that having a good demeanor is key to being an effective manager in the legal field. You should aim to be kind and understanding but at the same time, don’t allow your colleagues to take advantage of you. That is why I think it’s important to strike a balance between being a good colleague and a good boss. You still need to be stern and sometimes you may need to set aside your friendly demeanor so that things get done when necessary.

Third, to be an effective manager, you should always reward your junior colleagues’ good work. I think that having workplace events from time to time leads to more productive lawyers. Whether it be a firm event in the office, or taking your colleagues out for a celebratory meal, rewarding your colleagues for a job well done will encourage them to work even harder on the next assignment, and it will make for much better morale in the work setting.

There are also other ways to reward the lawyers and staff that you manage. I believe that most junior lawyers and staff really value experiencing the events in a case that they often can attend. If possible and cost efficient, make sure to bring your staff to client meetings, depositions, and court appearances. Speaking from the position of a former paralegal and junior lawyer, being brought to these types of meetings and appearances really meant a good deal to me. Being able to see what goes on after a document review or research memo is completed, works wonders to help your junior staff’s confidence and desire to work harder.

Overall, I think that you should manage your colleagues in a way that you would like to be managed by your bosses. If you were not treated well and not brought to client events as a junior lawyer or paralegal, you should not continue that trend. If you were to treat your colleagues in the negative way that you may have been treated, it will only create a bad work environment. Thus, if that is the case, then try to change things and be a good, effective leader who is respected by his or her colleagues and gets things done.

# Second Quarter Was Even Worse For Law Firms

The Thomson Reuters Q1 Law Firm Financial Index was generally positive but [suggested worrying times could be ahead](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/law-firms-put-a-lot-of-eggs-in-one-basket-and-that-basket-is-looking-iffy/) for the legal industry.

The [Q2 report](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/legal/lffi-q2-2022-warning-sign/) is the “ahead.”

It’s not really a surprise given the rough state of the economy over the last three months. The flashes of good news like the recent jobs report didn’t hit until the beginning of Q3 so whether those augur a return to form that extends to law remains to be seen. But for now things looks a little grim.

How grim? Well, the stock image above isn’t all that far off from reality.



Yikes.

Part of the problem stems from returning to the office and resuming business travel pumping up costs and then getting hit with an inflation double whammy. But the firms are really hurting because this quarter took away their umbrella.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Unfortunately, Q2 demand growth was not able to outpace expenses as it had in past quarters. Previously, transactional practices — corporate general, mergers & acquisitions (M&A), real estate and tax — had driven demand growth and compensated for contracting non-transactional practice demand. This quarter saw transactional practice demand slow, and as a result, overall demand shrank.

We warned in May that putting all the firm eggs in transactional work could only shield the firms for so long. Hopefully all these deals will start souring in the slowdown and send firms some litigation and bankruptcy to salve their wounds.

Still, there was a little good news in the report:

Despite the poor indicators described above, the industry at large is not showing signs of structural instability. Worked rate growth was solid, and rate realization improved. Another area that continued to shine was technology spending, which grew at its fastest pace in nearly a decade. Given that IT hardware and services are normally a deflationary market, this is particularly telling of the legal industry’s well-being. This acceleration in investments suggests that firms are keeping their long-term health in mind rather than nursing the bruises of struggling revenue growth in Q2.

Again, the economy might be coming around and the legal sector remains generally stable. But maybe hold off on spending that next bonus for a bit.

Big money for even bigger billable hours requirements?

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

[It’s] tone deaf. It’d be like saying, ‘Look how rich I am,’ when the economy is struggling.

— The anonymous leader of an Am Law 50 firm, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/11/13/tone-deaf-or-sign-of-healthy-industry-am-law-100-firm-leaders-weigh-in-on-milbank-raises/), criticizing Milbank’s recent move to [raise the Biglaw associate salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/milbank-raises-associate-salaries-and-announces-year-end-bonuses/) amid 2023’s slower demand for legal services. In additional comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/11/13/tone-deaf-or-sign-of-healthy-industry-am-law-100-firm-leaders-weigh-in-on-milbank-raises/), an executive at an Am Law Second 50 firm said, “All we’re doing is continuing to put targets on these kids’ backs. Increasing salaries…causes them to increase salaries up the chain [and] increase billable hours for them. I just think they’re taking this pound of flesh out of them.”

# Biglaw Firm’s 2017-18 Bonuses That They'll Pay You In 2019
## All money news is good news.

The Biglaw firm of Sheppard Mullin has a strange way of giving out their yearly bonuses. As [we’ve discussed in detail before](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/10/update-sheppard-mullin-doesnt-have-new-bonuses-they-just-have-a-weird-measure-of-time/?rf=1), their measuring period runs from 10/1-9/30, though the actual bonus money won’t get disbursed until March while promotions and raises take effect in January. (UPDATE: According to additional tipsters, the firm has upped its bonus payday this cycle to January.) Confused yet? Well, the key to remember here is that while Sheppard isn’t setting the market standard for the upcoming 2018 bonus season (we’ll likely have to wait until ’round Thanksgiving for that circus to begin), money news is still news we are happy to report.

As is par for the course at Sheppard, there hasn’t yet been an announcement, but the memo and bonus structure have been found on the firm’s intranet. (UPDATE: Obviously as the firm has yet to make an official announcement, the numbers here are subject to change/market influences. But as this isn’t the first time the firm’s bonus plans have leaked before they’ve been announced based on unsecured documents widely available at the firm, it’s not unfair to assume the firm knows exactly what they’re doing.) So, what will those bonuses (likely) entail?

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
According to tipsters, there’s a bump for the top billers and on the flip side, the band for folks that bill 1950 hours is being eliminated for future bonus cycles. You can read the full memo below.

So, what do you think about the bonuses? Feel free to sound off [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# After Taking Heat Last Year, Paul Weiss Spent 2019 Providing Firms A Blueprint For Improving Diversity
## It's time to put a little more heat on the rest of Biglaw to be a little more like Paul Weiss.

When talking heads complain about “political correctness” and how “it’s impossible not to offend these people,” they’re kind of missing the whole point. Doing right by folks is not a quest for perfection, but a willingness to embrace shortcomings and to take action to get it right. In other words, don’t get defensive, get proactive.

Last year, Paul Weiss announced a new partnership class that might well have raised no eyebrows except that it [came with a picture](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/paul-weiss-press-release-captures-everything-broken-about-biglaw-in-one-image/) worth several thousand words and those words weren’t particularly positive. The partnership welcoming portrait showed a gaggle of white men followed (alphabetically, but that didn’t help the optics) by a lone white woman. Paul Weiss employees flooded our inbox with the image and, as we explained at the time, the fact that the image didn’t set off any red flags before released summed up the problem with Biglaw writ large: it’s not the lack of diversity as much as the inability to notice the lack of diversity as out of the ordinary.

When called out for this, many firms would double down or try to just weather the bad press and carry on. Paul Weiss took the opposite course.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The firm quickly held a town hall to hear from the concerned attorneys and explain plans to address diversity concerns. Over the course of the year, the firm took the initiative to add diversity through the lateral market, landing [former Attorney General Loretta Lynch](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2019/05/28/ex-attorney-general-loretta-lynch-joins-paul-weiss/) and Supreme Court litigator [Kannon Shanmugam](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/paul-weiss-launches-supreme-court-practice-as-press-spotlight-returns-to-partnership-diversity/). The rest of the lateral class for the year: Jeannie Rhee, Sarah Stasny, Jean McLoughlin, Andrew Finch, and Laura Turano brought more diversity to the ranks and the incoming class, announced today, adds even more women. From a memo released this afternoon:

Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP is pleased to announce that seven attorneys have been elected to the partnership, effective January 1, 2020: Jonathan H. Ashtor, Rachael G. Coffey, Alexia D. Korberg, Caith Kushner, Kyle T. Seifried, Brette Tannenbaum and Austin Witt. All are resident in the New York office.

When Paul Weiss got publicly called out over this last year, we noted that there was [some sense of karmic injustice to it](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/sullivan-if-a-biglaw-firm-falls-in-the-woods-and-no-one-issues-a-press-release-about-its-lack-of-diversity/). After all, other peer firms had atrocious diversity records but were flying under the radar simply because they didn’t put their classes in a picture.

On the other hand, maybe karma did right by the industry here. There aren’t many firms that could have stumbled like this and then turned around to provide a blueprint to the whole profession of how to make amends.

Diversity isn’t something that gets “solved.” That’s sometimes difficult for results-minded professionals to accept, but diversity is always a process of striving to get better. Paul Weiss spent 2019 showing that it took 2018 seriously and understands that there’s always more to be done. It knows it’s not perfect, because perfection is an empty concept invoked to engender complacency. But the firm’s going to adhere to a strategy of promoting diversity in its partnership whenever and wherever it can.

And that’s what it means to be proactive.

# Am Law 100 Firm Launches 'Work-From-Anywhere' Virtual Office
## Associates can work anywhere they want and still make Biglaw money.

We don’t see this as work-from-home. We see this as work-from-anywhere. It’s very liberating. You don’t have to live near a physical office location or in a city where there is a physical office location. You have the freedom to live where you want to be. We are enabling people to organize their work around their life rather than their life around their work. And at the end of the day, those people are going to be more happy and more successful.

— [J.Y. Miller](https://www.huschblackwell.com/professionals/j-y-miller), managing partner of Husch Blackwell’s brand new virtual office (referred to as “The Link”), commenting on all of the pros of the firm’s remote work offering. This week, the firm [launched the new office](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/this-big-law-firm-has-permanent-plans-for-remote-working) with 50 staff members and nearly 40 lawyers, whose compensation remains unchanged. “I am convinced that this will be permanent,” Miller said. “It will expand. And it will be one of our largest offices in the firm.”

# The State Of Biglaw And The Evolving Role Of The Law Librarian

I just returned from Baltimore, where I had the pleasure of attending the [2018 annual meeting and conference](https://www.aallnet.org/conference/) of the American Association of Law Libraries (AALL). I attend, cover, or speak at many legal conferences, and AALL is one of my favorites. It boasts a nice collegial vibe, and the attendees are extremely attentive and engaged during panels. Polite law librarians — no surprise there![[1]](#f1)

On Sunday night, I interviewed Dean Sonderegger, Vice President and General Manager at Wolters Kluwer (and [Above the Law columnist](https://abovethelaw.com/author/deansonderegger/)), about the changing role of the law librarian in Biglaw — and what librarians can do to evolve along with their duties. He outlined several ways that [librarians can add value to their organizations](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/ai-and-the-practice-of-law-realizing-value/) during a period of flux for the legal industry.

These themes of innovation and change emerged again in a panel the following morning, entitled “The State of the Legal Industry and the Evolving Role of the Law Librarian.” It was moderated by Rob Alston, Senior Director of Legal Intelligence Sales at ALM Intelligence, who was joined by Lee Bernstein, Library Manager at Haynes and Boone; Joseph Keslar, Director of Library Services at Blank Rome; and Steve Kovalan, Senior Analyst at ALM Intelligence.

Kovalan opened the discussion by sharing findings from ALM Intelligence’s annual survey of law librarians. He showed a chart reflecting what many observers of Biglaw already know: since the Great Recession, demand for Biglaw services has increased at a sluggish pace, well below the growth of GDP over this period. More specifically, a survey of in-house counsel found that 30 percent of them plan to decrease their use of outside counsel (compared to 15 percent who plan to increase their use, and 55 percent who plan to stay around the same level).[[2]](#f2)

What’s driving this? The high cost of outside counsel — 62 percent of surveyed law departments said they’re reducing their use of outside counsel to realize cost savings — which has led to in-house counsel “taking back” work from their outside lawyers. Almost two-thirds of law departments said that work previously done by outside counsel is being transferred to in-house attorneys.

Kovalan outlined six trends that he has been seeing in Biglaw and expects to continue:

1. The emergence of areas of intense competition between firms.
2. More consolidation of law firms (aka “merger mania”).
3. Continuing increase in the sophistication — and demands — of corporate law departments.
4. Growing importance of investment in technology.
5. Growing importance of firm management (i.e., firm success will be determined in significant part by firms’ ability to execute on their strategic plans).
6. Greater collaboration across different types of vendors.

What does this changing environment mean for law librarians? Here are three quick takeaways.

First, law librarians need to ensure that they’re getting adequate recognition for their contributions to firm success. According to Kovalan, historically this has been an issue for library departments.

One possible solution discussed by the panel: should the library and librarians change what they’re called, to something incorporating terms like “knowledge management” or “research specialist”? I found this finding noteworthy:

Is the word ""library"" in the department's name? For Am Law 50 firms, just 22% use the word ""library"" (vs. something like ""knowledge management"" or ""research), compared to 67% for Am Law 151-200 firms (per [@SKovalan](https://twitter.com/SKovalan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) of [@ALMLegalIntel](https://twitter.com/ALMLegalIntel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) at [#AALL18](https://twitter.com/hashtag/AALL18?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)). [#AALL2018](https://twitter.com/hashtag/AALL2018?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

— David Lat (@DavidLat) [July 16, 2018](https://twitter.com/DavidLat/status/1018865710271991808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

(This led to another interesting conversation among the panelists over whether the shift away from the word “library” could be driven by sexism. Joseph Keslar suggested that the practice could reflect a failure to adequately value the contributions of librarians, who today are predominantly women.)

Second, law librarians and library departments need to be flexible, unafraid of making changes when necessary. This could include changing reporting structures, perhaps to reflect how the library department interacts with other departments like information technology; purchasing new legal technology offerings (and nudging change-resistant attorneys to adopt them when helpful); or adjusting approaches to billing. (Going back to the issue of nomenclature and labels, some clients resist paying for “librarians,” but have no objection to paying for “information specialists.”)

Third, law librarians need to make sure they have the resources needed to do their jobs. This includes both adequate staffing and a budget sufficient to cover subscriptions to all necessary services — which are proliferating, thanks to the explosive growth in the world of legal technology.

Of course, like much advice about Biglaw, all this is easier said than done. And much of it comes down to office politics — which could easily be the subject of many more discussions…..

[ [1]](#reff1) Law librarians are a polite lot, but make no mistake: they also know how to party, as I discovered when I stopped by an after-hours shindig hosted by [Fastcase](https://www.fastcase.com/). (I left the festivities right around the time that hotel security showed up.)

[ [2]](#reff2) Random aside: I overheard an audience member complain to another attendee about what he viewed as the survey’s low response rate — under 15 percent from law librarians, who tend to be a responsive bunch. This librarian said that he and some of his colleagues don’t take the survey because in the past, partners would use the survey findings “against” the library — e.g., to justify budget or staff cuts.

# Biglaw Firm's Reopening Focuses On Flexibility, With No Minimum Number Of In-Office Work Days
## The rest of 2021 is looking pretty great at this firm.

The first week of June has come and gone, and yet another firm has decided to let its employees know what their eventual return to the office will look like. Loeb & Loeb, ranked 99th in the most recent Am Law 100, with $385,271,000 gross revenue in 2020, is the latest firm to announce its reopening plans, and it looks like the five-day, in-office workweek will be a thing the past.

On Friday, [Kenneth Florin](https://www.loeb.com/en/people/f/florin-kenneth-r), the firm’s chair, laid out Loeb’s plans. With a goal of “allow[ing] for as much flexibility as possible,” the firm will start inviting employees back to the office in three phases: after the July 4th holiday, employees can visit the office voluntarily if they wish; after Labor Day, the firm will encourage a “somewhat more meaningful return to office,” which will last “through at least the end of 2021”; thereafter, Loeb will evaluate its new hybrid way of working to figure out what will the future of the firm will look like.

Here are the highlights from each of the firm’s return-to-office phases (memo available in full on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/loeb-reopening-2021/2/)):

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
- Phase 1: The firm will host “fun offerings” on certain days each week to make office visits “more meaningful and enjoyable.” Florin emphasizes that “no one should feel obligated to come in during this time” and that employees “should feel no pressure to do so.”
- Phase 2: The firm will “not be requiring a set minimum number of work days in the office” for attorneys and paralegals; instead, department chairs will arrange a set of guidelines based on department needs, client needs, and individual circumstances. “While we expect many will strive toward an average of 2 or 3 days per week in the office,” Florin notes, “others may make different arrangements which involve them coming in more or fewer days.”
- Phase 3: The firm’s final phase will start in 2022, and leadership will “use everything we learned during our first two phases to inform our longer term plans” concerning a flexible work environment.
Florin closes his message, recognizing that flexibility is key to work/life balance:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
[A]lthough we will be returning to the same physical space we left over a year ago, it is clear that our way of working will be very different than what we are used to. But, hopefully, it will be improved, allowing for more flexibility and a work/life balance that works for each of us while maintaining the nurturing culture that is Loeb. I thank you once again for all your patience and diligence as we work to reintegrate everyone in the most comfortable way possible.

Congratulations to Loeb & Loeb on creating a plan that focuses on flexibility in the next normal — one where lawyers and staffers alike will be able to work remotely as suits their individual needs.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

The U.S. economy is, not to get too technical about it, in a weird place. A number of traditional economic indicators are all pointing in the direction of bullish ongoing growth. Others are bearish or outright frightening.

If you’re looking for good news, consider that the Dow Jones is up over 13% YTD, while overall market stability appears to have been increasing over that same time according to volatility indexes such as [VIX](https://www.cboe.com/tradable_products/vix/). And have you tried buying a home lately? Demand is drastically outstripping supply in many regions. Houses are routinely selling as soon as they hit the market, sometimes for tens or hundreds of thousands above asking price. Buyers are offering all-cash deals and forgoing home inspections to get in on the action.

The Good, The Bad, And The Confusing

But that’s where we were back in 2008, and [look where that got us](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596363/). Although it’s unlikely that the same fundamental cross-collateralized financial collapses that fueled the Great Recession will repeat themselves, that red-hot real estate market does appear, at least in part, to be fueled by market speculation and pure FOMO. There comes a time when there’s no one left to [buy all those tulips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania). No one’s going to claim total surprise if a market correction or outright crash hits. But few would bet their houses on it, either.

Other market indicators range from puzzling to outright worrisome. The strong YTD performance on the Dow was undercut Wednesday by a 450-point intraday drop being [pinned on investor uncertainty](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/07/stock-market-open-to-close-news.html). COVID-19 restrictions are lifting, and unemployment benefits are running out, but people aren’t going back to work as quickly as some expected. The Bureau of Labor and Statistics [recently reported](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm) over 9.2 million job openings in the U.S. labor market, around the same as there were a month prior. No one has convincingly argued why, but plenty of theories abound, many of which likely bear some truth. Some families have learned to operate with a single income, while others are still struggling to secure the child care necessary to get back to the labor market. Some workers are refusing to go back given the quality of jobs available and are holding out for better wages and benefits.

And then there’s [inflation](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/07/business/inflation-warning-imf.html), a central bank’s Public Frenemy No. 1. A bit of steady inflation keeps a market in a healthy condition. The U.S. Fed targets 2% inflation annually. The Consumer Price Index, one of the foundational measures of inflation in the U.S., clocked [in at 5%](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm), the highest increase since (gulp) August 2008.

The traditional move to curb inflation is to raise interest rates. Done right, that eases the economic engine out of the red zone, slowing the economy down just enough to get inflation back under control without losing too much speed. Done poorly, there are any number of ways for the economy to spin off the rails. Fingers crossed, right?

So What Do We Do?

Taken together, no one really knows where our economy is headed. The economy is always hard and complicated, and COVID-19’s effects were profound and unpredictable. It’s going to be a few more years, and a lot more analysis and argument, before we really understand what is happening today and why.

Unfortunately, “we’re not sure yet” isn’t a valid strategy in law firm management. Most firms feel the ebbs and flows of the economy. There aren’t that many truly evergreen practices. Most boom or bust over time, either in sync with larger economic trends (think real estate and corporate work) or counter to those trends (bankruptcy and litigation). It’s our job as firm leaders to be prepared for the changes ahead of us. In that spirit, here are some tips for the coming years to hopefully keep your firm thriving, no matter where we end up next.

Get Smart About Your Firm’s Debt

We spent the better part of a decade with interest rates in the basement following the Great Recession. Just as they’d started creeping back up, COVID-19 send the Fed scrambling to tamp them down again. Rates can’t get much lower, and with inflation creeping up, the Fed’s [already tipped its hand that they will rise in the not-too-distant future](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/16/fed-holds-rates-steady-but-raises-inflation-expectations-sharply-and-makes-no-mention-of-taper.html).

If your firm is carrying any debt, now is the time to get your arms wrapped around it and understand what those rising rates might mean. If the loan is variable rate, the cost of maintaining those payments will probably be going up. It may be time to get aggressive on paying those lines down to free up more funds in future years, when the repayment terms may be more onerous. Even if it’s fixed-rate debt, paying down debt now can free up cash in the future on debt-servicing expenses.

All of this can be politically difficult, as firms need to stay competitive on the compensation front, and most attorneys prefer cash disbursals today over potential upside tomorrow. If the partnership can be persuaded, however, getting outstanding debt wrangled might leave a firm in a much more prosperous position as it faces future uncertainty.

Budget For A Bust, Have A Plan For A Boom

There’s never a bad time to revisit the budget and examine overhead. Every dollar wasted on unnecessary expenses is a dollar out of the pockets of a firm’s owners. Trimming extravagances, eliminating redundancies, price checking your vendors, and other cost-saving measures will help your firm successfully absorb a downturn if one hits. But if the economy stays sunny, all those cut costs might leave your firm with a nice pile of money waiting to be used.

As[ I’ve discussed in this space before](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/what-productizing-means-to-your-law-firm/), smart firm planning requires some amount of reinvestment back into the firm, whether it be in technology, physical renovations, or any number of long-term material improvements. Again, this balance is tricky. Too much reinvestment can leave the firm susceptible to poaching if compensation does not meet market levels. Too little leaves it uncompetitive on the client services front. Planning early and developing a set of priorities before the sudden windfall increases your chances of getting that balance right.

Invest In Your People

The firm’s management team isn’t the only group trying to figure out what today’s economy means. Your attorneys and legal professionals are wondering what their own futures hold and planning accordingly. The cure for all that fear, uncertainty, and doubt is community. People who feel like they’re cared for, part of a collective vision, and who feel confident in their leaders are much more likely to stay the course and help the firm ride out some potentially bad times. People who don’t feel that way are liable to jump ship in search of the security and family they’re missing where they are.

No law firm exists without people. Treat yours well, see them through their bad times, and they’ll see you through yours.

# The Pink Ghetto: Women Lawyers Will Be Harassed No Matter What They Wear
## What should you do when a partner tells you to wear a miniskirt, a low-cut blouse, and a push-up bra?

Check out her ‘sexy’ outfit.

Welcome back to [The Pink Ghetto](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-pink-ghetto/), a series where we take a look at some of the most appalling stories from one of the most sexist industries in the world: the legal profession. Today, we’ll take a look at the way that women are criticized, critiqued, and harassed over how they look and what they wear to work. These are real emails we’ve received from real readers.

When you see things like this happening, say something. Together, we can inspire the change necessary to stop this disturbing behavior from being so prevalent in the law.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
When I was in law school, I scored a 1L paid summer associate position at a small IP boutique in Connecticut. The partner who hired me was an alum of my law school and was my father’s age. I was thrilled about this paid job and the interest he seemed to take in my career. Working there was fine, even though there was only one other female attorney. One day, the partner who hired me invited me to go to NYC to attend a settlement conference so I could see what that was like, and then invited me to lunch with him and his wife at a fancy restaurant afterwards. While at lunch, he started talking about how the paralegal at the office was a “10” and how she always wore black thongs with white slacks. I got very uncomfortable and, in a lame attempt to change the subject, asked him about my upcoming 2L summer interviews and how I should handle them. The topic of appropriate dress came up, and he told me I should wear a miniskirt, low-cut blouse, and push-up bra. He said this in front of his wife, who just laughed and said, “Oh honey, I think she’s asking a serious question.” I was mortified and felt dirty for the rest of the internship.

I had just taken a job in-house at a mid-size company and traveled to the annual industry legal conference those in my sub-field all attend. One of the usual suspect law firms in the field had in attendance a mid-level female associate with whom I am good friends and an older (50s) male partner who had advised a few lawyers at my new company over the years. My friend set up a dinner for the three of us during the conference, presumably so their firm could maintain a foothold with my company, and although I have close ties to another law firm in the industry and would prefer to give any business I can to them, I felt it would be rude to decline, and innocent enough to network, especially with my friend.

On multiple occasions before, as we were leaving the hotel for, and at the dinner, the partner made comments about how he wasn’t sure he wanted to intrude on our “girls’ night,” showing that he considered the outing less serious than a business dinner with the firm’s client. Otherwise, dinner was fine enough and the partner actually talked about how empowered his pre-teen daughter is as a young woman with a strong voice (though in hindsight, it seems like he felt more hen-pecked than supportive).

The next day, I saw the partner as we both got on the elevator at the conference hotel. I was wearing high heels as opposed to the flats I had worn to dinner the previous night. In front of an elevator full of our industry peers, he asked me if I was wearing my “big girl shoes today.” Shocked, but not knowing what to do, I faked a laugh.

I am now a small-town lawyer at a small firm, but before law school I was a paralegal at one of the bigger firms in Washington, D.C. I was assigned to an insurance dispute that culminated in a multiple week trial. In the last couple of weeks, I was in court periodically. At the end of my last day in court, one of the partners and I were cleaning up the trial table and collecting things to bring back to the office.

The judge suddenly reappeared in the courtroom and started chatting with us. He was very friendly and took particular interest in me and my career plans. I said I was a recent college graduate intending to go to law school, but had only just begun my search. He replied, without taking a breath, “Blonde women, especially those who wear red, will never be taken seriously in the legal profession, especially not the courtroom. You should really think about his.” I froze, looked down at my red blouse under my very conservative black pantsuit, looked back up, and thanked him for his advice.

The judge went back to chambers. The partner and I collected the rest of our things. Not a word was ever spoken of it again

Supporting women and parents in the workplace is obviously a vital element to any diverse workplace. But it is also essential to look beyond the platitudes about diversity and dive into what it is really like at elite law firms. Earlier this week, Working Mother [released ](https://www.workingmother.com/best-law-firms-for-women-2021) their annual list of the Best Law Firms For Women.

Every year, Working Mother puts out this list, but with all the garbage that folks had to deal with in 2020 due to the pandemic, they made some changes to their methodology:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
[Working Mother’s parent company] Seramount’s 2021 Best Law Firms for Women application includes more than 300 questions about attorney demographics at different levels, schedule flexibility, paid time off and parental leaves, and development and retention of women. This year, in light of COVID-19, several questions were added about the success of working from home for lawyers.

So what do we know about the recognized firms? Well, 40 percent of attorneys at the firms are women, 34 percent of non-equity partners at the firms are women, and 25 percent of equity partners are women. The firms average 13 weeks of paid parental leave and 100 percent of the firms on the list let parents return to work on reduced schedules.

Without further ado, here are this year’s honorees:

# Biglaw Firm Announces Market Bonuses Plus Special End Of The Year Bonuses
## So why are some associates worried?

The bonus scale that [Cravath set last month](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/breaking-cravath-announces-annual-bonuses/) is a generous end of the year bonus, particularly in a year where the Biglaw elite already [bumped up associate salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) and gave out [mid-year bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/). Given the largess already showered upon them, most are grateful their firms feel the need to meet that standard. But one Biglaw firm has just announced that in addition to the (admittedly expected) end of the year bonuses, they are also offering special end of the year bonuses.

The firm in question is Cahill Gordon, and they’ve made a[ habit of coming over the top](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/biglaw-firm-goes-over-the-top-of-market-bonuses/?rf=1) of the going market standard on bonuses by offering special bonuses. The bonus schedule is as follows:


According to the firm-wide memo, the special extra bonuses will range from $5,000 to $40,000. But multiple sources at the firm have reached out to Above the Law with concerns that this year’s memo has words like “discretionary” and “outstanding individual effort” as caveats to the extra cash when in years prior everybody got the special bonuses.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
- Extra bonuses are now gone as a standard thing and are entirely discretionary. People fear what this means in practice
- Cahill bonuses. Appears special bonuses are reserved for high performers this year
Associates will have to wait until their annual reviews in January to find out exactly what their bonuses will look like.

(Read the full bonus memo on the next page.)

We’ve[ already told you](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/the-best-law-schools-for-getting-a-biglaw-job-2018/) about Law.com’s list of “Go-To” law schools. They break the employment data for schools down and rank those that put the most students into Biglaw jobs after graduation. Now, Biglaw might not be your bag — hell, the editorial staff here at Above the Law proves that life really isn’t for everyone — but if you do want to sell your soul for 180,000 shiny gold pieces, some law schools are better positioned to be your accessory.

But what if you long to spend your three years of law school in the Golden State, basking in the sunshine while you study torts? Well, fear not! The good folks [at the Recorder have you covered](https://www.law.com/therecorder/2018/03/12/the-2018-go-to-law-schools-california-edition/). They’ve broken out the best law schools in California that provide you an opportunity to hate your life by working in Biglaw.

Without further ado, here are the top Cali law schools to land yourself a Biglaw gig.

Biglaw firm after Biglaw firm after Biglaw firm made salary announcements today, and this one from Jenner & Block — a firm that brought in $446,295,000 gross revenue in 2020, putting it in 88th place in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — came in juuuuuust before [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cravath-raises-22/) announced even bigger and better cash compensation for its midlevels and most senior associates.

Here’s what the previously prevailing Davis Polk salary scale will look like at the firm, retroactive to January 1:



Congratulations to everyone at Jenner & Block, who will now be kept waiting and wondering if the firm will match the latest largesse out on the market.

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Jenner & Block.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post.

# Easing 7 Pain Points With Document Automation By Contract Express
## Let’s look at some of those pain points and see whether document automation with Contract Express may mitigate that discomfort.

[](http://bit.ly/2HNVToA)Where does advanced enterprise software reside in your large law firm? Is every practice group and attorney invested in the merits of document automation to make your workflow faster, more efficient, more productive, and less costly?

Many law firms are slow to adopt technology, and playing catch-up becomes the daily grind. For the law firms that wisely invest in document automation solutions, like [Thomson Reuters Contract Express](http://bit.ly/2HNVToA), they notice a visible easing of pain points in document drafting alongside significant benefits. Customers indicate that Contract Express brings value throughout the firm from partners to junior associates and the knowledge management team.

Get to Know Contract Express

[Contract Express](http://bit.ly/2HobJmE) is a Thomson Reuters enterprise, web-based solution that automates legal document assembly. Trusted by the world’s leading law firms and corporations, Contract Express allows users the ability to automate creation of their preferred legal documents, reduce and eliminate delays, costs, bottlenecks, and the risks inherent with manual drafting. The result is faster, more efficient and compliant legal services and products.

Easing Pain Points of Manual Document Drafting

If your law firm is still manually drafting lengthy, repetitive, or complex documents, there is likely a high level of pain and waste associated with that. Let’s look at some of those pain points and see whether document automation with Contract Express may mitigate that discomfort.

- Too much time spent drafting documents. It’s true. Attorneys spend an exorbitant amount of time making complex and repetitive changes to documents. Is that time well spent? Document drafting aided by automation is where the legal industry is heading. When a law firm adopts Contract Express, it can significantly shave document drafting time. In an August 2017 online survey of legal professionals by ALM about document automation, 33 percent of survey respondents said Contract Express cut their time by 51 percent or more.
- Lack of creative AFAs. General counselors are always seeking alternative fee arrangements (AFAs) from the law firms they hire. Your law firm may be stumped on new, creative AFAs to implement. With Contract Express, there’s a self-service model that document automation provides. Law firms can set up a self-serve client portal and add the questionnaires and forms clients need so they can contribute to their own legal work. Attorneys are freed up to work on other aspects of the matter and negotiations — where their expertise is needed most. What’s more, risk for error is reduced at the onset of a matter, while the [partnership between firm and client is strengthened](http://bit.ly/2HrHA5Z).
- Less billable time for attorneys. Time spent drafting is often unbilled time. Therefore, when attorneys “waste” time drafting documents manually, they lose hours they could bill back. Contract Express helps attorneys find more time for billable work because less time is needed to draft documents. What also occurs is a transition from plain vanilla client documents to higher quality presentations that create positive reactions. The discussion soon centers less around billable time and more around quality work products that streamline productivity and efficiency while creating satisfied clients.
- Single-sided solutions. Many software solutions serve a single purpose which begs the question, why invest in low-value software? Thomson Reuters solutions integrate nicely, and that goes the same for Contract Express with Thomson Reuters Practical Law and Drafting Assistant. Attorneys using Practical Law can access up to 300 automated templates in Contract Express and get even more functionality using Drafting Assistant to enhance document creation and the finished product.
- Unidentifiable forms When your knowledge management team develops forms to disperse throughout the firm, each form often takes on a life of its own becoming unrecognizable. Contract Express eliminates that by enabling authorship in tandem with knowledge management, standardizing forms, and templates.
- Contextual learning confusion. Those who develop and write forms know the context and word choice they’re using. However, junior associates do not have that context, making it cumbersome for them to understand.  Contract Express provides guidance, preview and note options that provide excellent training resources for associates and other attorneys not as familiar with the legal documents in question. The Thomson Reuters solution enables authors to develop forms at whatever level is most comfortable regardless of the context of the wording.
- Gap in technology innovation. There are many law firms that still have a way to go in filling the technology gap. That also means core support teams may not have the opportunity to learn new skills that help position the firm competitively. Document automation is part of the legal framework now, and Contract Express is an intuitive automation tool with many ways for attorneys and the administrative team to learn the basics of document automation.
To get further acquainted, set up a Contract Express demo with a Thomson Reuters account executive or install a free 28-day trial in your law firm. To learn more, speak with our support team by email at [contractexpress-support@tr.com](mailto:contractexpress-support@tr.com) to identify your account representative.

# Hunton Andrews Kurth Attorney Tops List As Biggest Jackhole Lawyer In America
## This is not the way to conduct yourself in the public spotlight.

Lawyers get a bad rap out there, but Hunton Andrews Kurth partner [John Shely](https://www.huntonak.com/en/people/john-shely.html) is working hard to make sure the profession deserves every bit of bile it conjures up in regular people. Shely just found himself on the losing end of what some are calling the largest verdict in an individual “bad faith” insurance case in Oklahoma history, with his client forced to cough up over $25 million for its gross mismanagement of a dying woman’s health claim. Having been thoroughly spanked by a jury, Shely’s reaction, [as reported by CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/10/health/aetna-verdict-oklahoma-orrana-cunningham/index.html), takes sour grapes to a new level.

[The victim’s husband Ron] Cunningham had another encounter in court. He said Shely, Aetna’s lead attorney, walked up to him and congratulated him after the verdict before telling him he’d lose on appeals.

Of course, he might be correct. Like many right-leaning states, Oklahoma has spent decades gutting the civil justice system in the name of “tort reform,” forcing appellate judges to override juries to ensure liability never actually stings a corporate malfeasor. Oklahoma’s been so aggressive in this lane that the state’s Supreme Court has had to strike down some of the legislature’s reforms as wildly over-the-line. Still, Shely would have good reason to believe his client will end up skating away from its handling of the death of Cunningham’s wife having to pay little more than a rounding error.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The National Law Journal recently named Shely a “[Litigation Trailblazer](https://www.huntonak.com/en/news/national-law-journal-names-john-shely-a-litigation-trailblazer.html),” an honor “which spotlights 30 litigators nationwide who are making a difference in the fight for justice.”

Well, telling the bereaved that he still planned to rob him of his jury-approved recovery is a curious definition of justice. Still, this was just the icing on a trial that made Shely the clubhouse leader for the Roy Cohn Memorial Award for Legal Jackholery. In the instant case, Ron Cunningham’s wife had a particularly dangerous tumor and her doctors prescribed proton beam therapy to shrink the tumor. Aetna summarily denied the treatment as “experimental.” Having just had my own claim to get a f**king flu shot denied by United Healthcare, I’m now curious if “experimental” was their excuse. In any event, Aetna’s decision forced the Cunninghams close to financial ruin. It’s that stress and financial burden that formed the basis of the jury’s award.

As oncologists point out, proton beam therapy is hardly experimental and is actually covered for pediatric patients — even insurance companies don’t want the bad press of denying that claim — and by Medicare — reason 8,283,366 for a Medicare-For-All plan.

Aetna attorney John Shely said in closing arguments that the insurance giant was proud of the three medical directors who denied coverage, even turning to thank them as they sat in the front row of the courtroom, according to jurors and other witnesses in court.

It was a message that didn’t sit well with the 12 jurors, who found that Aetna “recklessly disregarded its duty to deal fairly and act in good faith with the Cunninghams.”

Thanking the people who denied a dying woman’s claim is not the savviest trial move in the best of circumstances, but after “all three medical directors acknowledged they spent more time preparing for the lawsuit than on Orrana [Cunningham]’s medical case” it’s either insanity or trolling. In either event, Shely’s trial strategy resulted in a 9-3 verdict where at least two of the dissenters only opted out because they thought the jury award was too low.

UPDATE: In digging around the filings, it appears Shely also objected to Judge Lisa Davis’s proposal to reassign the matter to another judge for trial to accommodate the judge’s own cancer treatment. Shely’s motion, if granted, could have caused another lengthy delay in the case. Instead, Judge Davis unexpectedly rescheduled her own treatment to get the case done. So, by the looks of it, Shely functionally fought to inconvenience a woman seeking life-saving treatment. Astounding!

Shely does make an effort to redeem himself in a quote to the Oklahoman:

“If it’s in our control to change, that’s what we’re going to do,” attorney John Shely said. “Aetna has learned something here.”

Have they? The company claims to be evaluating the appeal that Cunningham claims Shely promised in the aftermath of the verdict. For a company that makes over $3 million every day, there’s not a ton of incentive to learn anything.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
But Hunton Andrews Kurth — and the many other law firms who take up similar positions around the country — should learn something here. Part of their duty to zealously represent their clients should involve counseling them that discretion is the better part of valor. That Aetna could take this through a costly trial — probably lose — and then fight a lengthy appeal to cap the damages isn’t worth the public relations nightmare. That’s a lesson that really should be learned.

That, and definitely don’t tell bereaved people you plan to beat them.

Companies and investment firms are increasingly under pressure from shareholders, employees and customers to certify that public commitments to DE&I are being fulfilled. A racial equity or civil rights audit is a powerful tool that companies can deploy to actively address potential gaps, get ahead of any risks and ensure that their actions are aligned with their values. No firm has more experience in these matters than Paul, Weiss.

— [Loretta E. Lynch](https://www.paulweiss.com/professionals/partners-and-counsel/loretta-e-lynch), former U.S. Attorney General and litigation partner at Paul Weiss, commenting on the firm’s [new practice area](https://www.paulweiss.com/about-the-firm/firm-news/paul-weiss-launches-dedicated-civil-rights-and-racial-equity-audit-practice?id=43465) that she will lead while working alongside many powerful legal heavy hitters. “We are living in an era of increased stakeholder scrutiny and accountability, with companies assessing their programs and policies to identify gaps and disparate impacts,” said Paul Weiss Chairman [Brad S. Karp](https://www.paulweiss.com/professionals/partners-and-counsel/brad-s-karp). “With the launch of this practice, we are bringing our deep expertise in internal investigations – as well as our storied history litigating civil rights cases – to help companies address potential deficiencies and ensure continued support from their key stakeholders.”

Some of these appointments have been previously reported in these pages — Don McGahn as [White House Counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/biglaw-partner-to-be-trump-administrations-white-house-counsel/), Noel Francisco as [Principal Deputy Solicitor General](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/the-latest-in-the-solicitor-general-sweepstakes/), Greg Katsas as [Deputy White House Counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/the-latest-in-the-solicitor-general-sweepstakes/) — but it’s nice to have official word. The rest are new (and, as far as I know, previously unreported by any other news outlet).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)

More observations to follow in an update to this post — refresh for the latest version — but I wanted to break the news as soon as possible. Congrats to Jones Day on its immense influence within Trumpworld.

UPDATE (6:02 p.m.): Five additional facts and observations:

1. The appointments were announced today by firm-wide email at Jones Day. (UPDATE (9:32 p.m.): The email was not sent firm-wide; we’ve heard from some JD lawyers outside D.C. who did not receive it.)

2. The departures will take place over a range of effective dates, starting today and going until January 27.

3. It was always expected that Jones Day lawyers would do well in terms of landing legal jobs in the new administration. Don McGahn, Above the Law’s reigning [Lawyer of the Year](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/above-the-laws-2016-lawyer-of-the-year-contest-the-winner/), served as the Trump campaign’s general counsel and was quickly named White House counsel after the election, and the transition team [boasted several JD lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/the-biglaw-attorneys-on-trumps-doj-transition-team/). But this is still a ton of top jobs.

4. This is very good news for Jones Day and the lawyers remaining at the firm. It’s great for the firm’s prestige, and it also means that JD lawyers will be eagerly sought after by clients with issues pending before their former colleagues.

5. Speaking of lawyers remaining at the firm, it’s interesting to note that veteran litigator [Michael Carvin](http://www.jonesday.com/macarvin/), who was mentioned in [early speculation about the next solicitor general](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/who-will-be-the-next-u-s-solicitor-general/) (before the [two finalists](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/the-latest-in-the-solicitor-general-sweepstakes/) emerged), doesn’t seem to have an administration job (at least not yet).

UPDATE (10:45 p.m.): Rick Hasen has this post over at the Election Law Blog about John Gore: [Incoming DOJ Deputy Assistant AG for Civil Rights Worked Defending Redistricting Plans](http://electionlawblog.org/?p=90559).

UPDATE (1/20/2017, 12:45 p.m.): It’s official: Donald J. Trump is President of the United States. Check out his administration’s [Justice Department “beachhead” team](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/d-day-at-doj-the-trump-administrations-beachhead-team-for-the-justice-department/).

# Associate Bonus Watch: This Prestigious Biglaw Firm Has Announced Its Bonuses
## What did Gibson Dunn do this year? Well, what do you think?

After we put Gibson Dunn & Crutcher on our list of [top ten prestigious firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/move-over-wachtell-theres-a-new-firm-at-the-top-vault-top-100-firms-2017/) (as ranked by Vault) that have [not yet announced their bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/these-prestigious-biglaw-firms-havent-announced-bonuses/), we received protestations — and tips — from GDC readers. For example:

GDC doesn’t send out a [firm-wide] memo, but bonuses have been communicated to anyone who has had their review — at this point, probably at least half of the associates, if I had to guess. They are expected to be paid out next week, as has been the firm’s practice in the past. Hope all is well, happy holidays!

And the holidays should be happy for Gibson Dunn associates. In New York, the firm matched the market (read: [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2016-associate-bonuses/)) scale, which it pretty much does every year. It does this on a fairly lockstep basis, as a different source said:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
I’m in New York and it was [the market amount for my year]. Pretty sure everyone gets be market bonus for their class year. A [junior associate] told me that he knows two people his level who were egregiously low in hours and still got the full bonus.

As longtime followers of bonus coverage know, Gibson Dunn takes a more flexible approach [in its non-NYC offices](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/associate-bonus-watch-gibson-dunn-new-york-bucks-west-coast-matches-dpw/), but still uses the New York scale as its lodestar when sitting individualized bonuses. And GDC associates seem pleased:

- “No formal bonus memo, but it looks like they have matched the Cravath scale. So good news.”
- “As expected, Gibson matched Cravath and gave high performers a bump [e.g., $10K above Cravath for this midlevel associate with hours north of 2100]. I’m happy, and I get the sense that others are too.”
- “I got a fully pro-rated Cravath-scale bonus [after joining a non-New York office as a lateral mid-year]. Another [midlevel] friend got the full Cravath amount too. Firm has explicitly told us that we follow and never set market.”
- “Fully unsurprised. Gibson literally always matches market and is also always on the later end of announcing.”
- “By all accounts, Q1 the first half of 2016 was slow industry-wide, and yet we’ve got higher salaries and the same fairly high bonuses as last year, no complaints here.”
- “Happy that the market uncertainty and rise in salaries did not affect bonuses. Given the widening spread in PPP, I have trouble imagining that there will be a single uniform bonus scale for firms below a threshold level of profitability in the future.”
Agreed — which is why some of the remaining bonus announcements, from firms not at Gibson’s level in prestige or profitability, will be particularly interesting.

To cover those announcements, we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks for your help.

Don’t forget, if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please enter your email address in the box below. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything.

Maybe you think that swing voters in Ohio spent the weekend following Donald Trump’s callous decision to throw his own son under the bus on Twitter. Or maybe you think they were following the battle between Trump and “Ohio’s favorite son,” LeBron James.

I assure you, low-information “swing” voters who can’t even be bothered to be “political” cared about a “favorite son,” but not the King. Last week, Urban Meyer, head football coach at (the) Ohio State University, was put on paid leave after one of his assistant coaches became embroiled in a domestic violence dispute.

[If you haven’t been following along with that story](https://www.theringer.com/2018/8/2/17644646/urban-meyer-ohio-state-zach-smith-administrative-leave), well you are just as alien to me as the people who don’t know that over 30 people have already been charged in connection with the Russia probe. The quick and dirty version is that Meyer assistant Zach Smith has been accused by his ex-wife of domestic violence, and there’s documentation of incidents that go as far back as 2009. Meyer was aware of these incidents, didn’t fire Smith until just recently, and then lied about what he knew about the incidents at Big Ten media day last week.

Urban Meyer is the highest-paid public employee in the state of Ohio, [which is not unusual for top college football and men’s basketball coaches](http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/22454170/highest-paid-state-employees-include-ncaa-coaches-nick-saban-john-calipari-dabo-swinney-bill-self-bob-huggins), but bears repeating every time because America is stupid. Meyer is extremely important in and to the state of Ohio, and suspending him a month before the start of the season is a huge deal.

Ohio State has commissioned an investigation into what Meyer knew, when he knew it, and whether he followed appropriate procedures for reporting domestic violence. They’ve commissioned [Mary Jo White](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/watch-the-secs-mary-jo-white-get-publicly-shamed/?rf=1) — now back at Debevoise & Plimpton [which is where the former SEC chairwoman goes when Republicans are in power](https://dealbreaker.com/2017/02/mary-jo-white-back-to-debevoise/) — to lead the investigation.

According to reports, Ohio State is promising that the investigation will take 14 days. [From CBSSports](https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/ohio-state-expects-to-have-its-urban-meyer-investigation-wrapped-up-inside-14-days/):

In a statement released late Sunday night, Ohio State announced that it plans to have its investigation into coach Urban Meyer and what he did or did not know regarding former assistant Zach Smith’s history of alleged domestic violence wrapped up at some point over the next 14 days.

I know this is a difficult concept for a football school, but you can’t just pull out a stopwatch on everything and demand results. Holding an independent investigation to an arbitrary time constraint is a good way to get a pre-ordained result. It seems like Debevoise is being brought in to rubber stamp whatever decision the administration has already made, before Ohio State kicks off against Oregon State on September 1st.

That said, even if the administration has already tacitly made its decision on Meyer’s future, we really don’t know which result they prefer at this point. It’d be easy to fire Meyer: he lied to the press about what he knew about domestic violence happening on his own staff. For all non-Trumpian public figures, lying is a good way to get fired.

On the other hand, it would be easy for tOSU to keep Meyer. He is one of three football coaches in history who have won national championships at two different schools. Former Florida football coach Jim McElwain could have [lied about death threats](https://www.alligatorarmy.com/2017/10/29/16566972/jim-mcelwain-fired-florida-gators-reasons-why) AND [actually humped a shark](https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2017/7/11/15955780/jim-mcelwain-shark-humping-didnt-do-it) and he’d still have a job if he’d won more.

I guess we’ll know Meyer’s future soon. Even if he’s fired for covering up domestic violence, I’m sure Baylor would hire him.

As Lyle Denniston noted in a post from December 2014 titled “[Appeals court: Gun control must meet toughest test](http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/12/appeals-court-gun-control-must-meet-toughest-test/)” published at “SCOTUSblog,” [the original three-judge panel’s opinion](http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Second-Amendment-6th-CA-Tyler-ruling-12-18-14.pdf) in the case applied strict scrutiny to invalidate the challenged ban. A majority of the judges participating in today’s en banc Sixth Circuit ruling instead have chosen to apply intermediate scrutiny in evaluating the ban.

The New Mexico Bar Association’s 27th Annual Appellate Practice Institute takes place tomorrow in Albuquerque: The reduced volume of blogging here this week, which will continue through Saturday evening, can be attributed to the wonderful time I have been having traveling through northern New Mexico this week. The [scenery](https://www.ghostranch.org/visit/tours-trail-rides/okeeffe-tours/okeeffe-landscape-tour/) and [Native American history](http://www.puyecliffs.com/) that I have observed (the preceding two links just being an example of each category) have been outstanding.

My visit to New Mexico will conclude with a presentation I will be delivering tomorrow at the event mentioned in the title of this post. You can access the agenda’s event [at this link](http://www.nmbar.org/NmbarDocs/CLE/API16.pdf).

As always when I am traveling, additional appellate related retweets are likely to appear at [this blog’s Twitter feed](http://www.twitter.com/howappealing).

“Judge sharply questions defense of Indiana’s Syrian refugee ban: ‘Oh, honestly.

Matt Ford of The Atlantic has a report headlined “[‘Are Syrians the Only Muslims Indiana Fears?’; A three-judge panel proves skeptical of Indiana’s efforts to turn away Syrian refugees](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/09/posner-easterbrook-indiana-refugees/500117/).”

Dave Stafford of The Indiana Lawyer reports that “[Judges blister Pence’s position, solicitor general in Syrian refugee case](http://www.theindianalawyer.com/judges-blister-pences-position-solicitor-general-in-syrian-refugee-case/PARAMS/article/41455).”

# If You're Angry That Your Firm Hasn't Raised Yet, Trust That Associates Here Are Even Angrier

As the clock winds down on June, those associates who still haven’t heard anything from their firms are preparing to Hulk out. We’ve been keeping [a running tally](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/by-any-metric-these-firms-really-should-have-raised-associate-compensation-by-now/) of the firms with the best Am Law 100 numbers that have still held out on their associates. We feel your pain.

But one group of associates just got that extra kick in the genitals that’s driving associates mad.

In 2016, Katten Muchin matched in all its offices except Charlotte. Fair enough. Many of those offices probably didn’t warrant a full match, but what’s done is done. As we’ve said before, if a firm felt the 2016 match was appropriate, then they have to match today. It’s simply a cost of living adjustment. There’s no real excuse for holding out.

On the cusp of July, not only has Katten Muchin not announced raises or bonuses, despite repeated inquiries from associates but then they pulled this.

Katten just sent out an email to all the attorneys in the firm — the sort of email that pops into your inbox and prompts you to grab your phone so you can grab the winning screenshot that will end up in Above the Law. And instead you find this:



Are. You. Kidding. Me?

UPDATE: Amazingly, that’s NOT ALL. WilmerHale, who also hasn’t announced raises — they’re conducting upward evaluations right now — did the exact same thing on Monday:



A good rule of thumb for whichever staff offices were charged with quarterbacking these surveys: under no circumstances should anything be sent as a mass email to the associates during raise or bonus season unless it’s about money or the importance of cooperating with the FBI agents who just raided. As we can’t imagine any scenario where Katten (or WilmerHale) would face the latter issue, let’s just stick with not sending out anything during cash time.

And if you are going to breach this rule, definitely don’t do it to announce a survey that invites those attorneys to share their thoughts about firm culture because, I’m willing to wager, this doesn’t help the eventual feedback.

It’s still relatively early in the day, by Biglaw standard, and Katten may be planning to spring a nice little raise on everyone at happy hour. And if they do, they can slough this all off as their misguided attempt at a practical joke.

Davis Polk is certainly doing its part to make associates’ lives better.

The Biglaw firm is perennially at the top of the compensation heap, but in 2020 they really pushed the pack forward. Back in September, [they responded](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/) to news of[ Cooley’s special COVID appreciation bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cooley-bonuses/) with jaw-dropping numbers of their own — ranging from $7,500 to $40,000, depending on class year — which quickly became the standard to match.

Now the firm has announced MORE thank you gifts for hard-working associates. Managing partner Neil Barr recently sent this email:

It may not be cash, but it’s still worth a pretty penny. According to tipsters at the firm, we’re talking ~$1,500 value:

Davis Polk‘s managing partner just gave us an additional thank you gift! It’s not money, but they are “experiences” which we can select – we can pick one and each of them is worth at least $1500 (for example, the “jet setter package” is a $1000 Marriott gift card + tumi suitcase, another is The Mirror (workout equipment), another is a $1000 shopping spree at Nordstrom with a private personal shopper, another is a home theater package with a Samsung 50″ The Frame QLED tv and Bose tv speaker, and many more) – there are 13 packages in total!

# Biglaw Lawsuit Reveals *Messy* Partner Issues

Former Dentons partner Jinshu “John” Zhang has filed a lawsuit against the mega firm alleging he was wrongfully terminated for trying to stop firm leadership from stealing tens of millions of dollars. The complaint alleges that, at the behest of CEO Michael McNamara and general counsel Edward Reich, the Biglaw firm forged a document to try to get the millions from a China-based client.

As the complaint reads:

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
“With Zhang’s clients gone, his reputation destroyed, his compensation eliminated, and his career in shambles, Zhang now brings this action against defendants for statutory and common law wrongful termination, racial discrimination, international infliction of emotional distress, and declaratory relief, to hold them accountable for their horrendous and cruel misdeeds.”

But that barely scratches the surface of the allegations between the former partner and the Biglaw firm. As [reported by](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/06/09/former-dentons-partner-claims-he-was-fired-after-reporting-an-attempt-to-divert-millions-in-client-funds/) Law.com, Dentons has hit back saying Zhang is making “slanderous and false allegations.” And that he was fired for cause after Zhang’s attempt for payment of 85 percent of a contingency fee, which the firm claims is contrary to firm practices. The firm then says Zhang circumvented the firm, and took his fee demands directly to the client:

“Zhang went around Dentons to the client, with whom Zhang negotiated for Zhang to personally receive the lion’s share of the contingency fee award,” according to the document signed by [Dentons’ attorneys] King & Spalding’s Joseph Akrotirianakis. “Zhang also began secretly exfiltrating sensitive and confidential information from Dentons, including client confidential information and sensitive personal information of non-party individuals.”

Dentons alleges that the firm terminated Zhang for cause on May 5 and entered into arbitration with Zhang to attempt to collect the contingency fee award, but he initiated a state court lawsuit against the firm during the dispute resolution process, violating the firm’s partnership agreement. [The case was later removed to federal court.] “Zhang, however, continued to participate in arbitration proceedings until the issuance of an adverse ruling against him on May 26, 2021, at which point Zhang abruptly withdrew from the arbitration,” according to court documents.

But Zhang’s filings paint a different picture:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
According to Zhang, the board said he violated the partnership agreement by “[a]ttempting to negotiate his compensation ‘off-cycle,’ daring to demand McNamara’s termination, sending emails to his personal email account, and other made-up or make-weight arguments.”

Zhang also contends that he withdrew from the arbitration proceedings with Dentons because “the emergency arbitrator clearly did not have jurisdiction to make the rulings that he did—and separately because his rulings represented gross violations of Zhang’s rights of petition, due process, and free speech.”

The firm issued a statement on the allegations:

“Zhang’s slanderous accusations and misleading attempts to falsely portray himself as a whistleblower, tellingly made only after Dentons directly confronted him, are as outrageous as they are untrue. Dentons is taking every appropriate step to address Zhang’s blatant misconduct.”

However this matter gets resolved, these filings give an interesting look behind the scenes of the giant firm.

# More Bang For The Buck: Hiring Lateral Partners In Groups Is Gaining Popularity
## Why settle for one book of business when you can get several?

Paul Hastings has been doing a lot of hiring lately. Same as many other firms, right? Actually, not quite. Paul Hastings has been in the headlines not for bringing on many new partners, but for hiring partners in groups. In March, the firm poached a group of 43 restructuring attorneys from Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, including 18 partners. In May, Paul Hastings brought over a three-partner energy team from Shearman & Sterling. And in June, the firm hired a group of four financial services partners from Buckley.

Paul Hastings is executing this recruiting strategy on a particularly notable scale, but the firm’s appetite for lateral partner group hiring is hardly unique. In February, Reed Smith brought on an 11-attorney real estate finance group, including five partners, who had previously been at Akerman. In April, Norton Rose Fulbright announced the hiring of an 11-lawyer group, including four partners, from Minneapolis litigation boutique Blackwell Burke.

The benefits of a group move are increasingly compelling to both firms and individual partners. At the most basic level, hiring a group of partners gives a firm more bang for the buck. Why settle for one book of business when you can get several? Of course, not all partners are equally valuable, and before hiring a group, a firm will need to become comfortable that each potential partner meets its bar. But broadly speaking, the more partners the firm can hire, the more incremental business it stands to gain.

From a partner perspective, making a lateral move as a group eases the challenge of integration, facilitates client transitions, and strengthens confidence that the new firm will stand by the partner even in more challenging times.

Easier Lateral Partner Integration

Although cultural fit is typically a factor that both firms and lateral candidates take care to assess when discussing a potential lateral move, no two firms are perfectly alike, and integrating into the culture of a new firm can be a challenge. Having some familiar faces around tends to help — after all, it’s a good bet that a group that chooses to move together has an existing successful working relationship. It is easier to integrate a “working group” into the firm’s culture than to integrate lawyers individually: instead of starting afresh with entirely new colleagues, attorneys who arrive in a group may be able to keep many of their existing teams intact.

The lateral partner questionnaires of the partners in the group can be an especially useful tool in curating the lateral partner integration plan. The questionnaires collectively set out a roadmap allowing for each partner (and the partner-to-be) in the group to benefit from the group’s bench strength.

The benefits of more rapid integration tend to be reflected in immediate business development success. The hiring firm is making a bet that a lateral partner will not only bring over existing business but will also use the new platform to attract new clients quickly. When a group of partners moves together, they benefit from immediate cohesion in the new firm setting. As with any move, there will be a learning curve as the newly arrived partners figure out how to refine their marketing pitches to showcase the new firm’s distinctive capabilities. But with a solid base of longtime colleagues already in place, the refinement is more icing on the cake than a fundamental reworking of the partner’s story. Partners in this situation are poised to compete immediately and successfully for new clients.

Smoother Client Transitions

For both the hiring firm and the moving partner, a critical component of a successful lateral move is transitioning as much of the partner’s existing book of business as possible. That process can be a real test of the partner’s relationship with his or her clients. From a client’s point of view, the decision to move is considerably simpler if it is clear that the client’s matters will be handled at the new firm not just by the same lead partner but also by the same larger team of attorneys. That continuity of the “bench” is highly reassuring.

Long-Term Strategic Support and Execution

When a law firm hires a group of partners, associates, and counsels, there is an implicit long-term commitment from the firm to support the integration of the group and the expansion of the group’s practice. A firm that brings in a group is presumably thinking beyond any individual member and is more likely to be intentional about creating a succession plan for the longevity of the practice. This degree of strategic support from the new firm can be especially critical when the group experiences a challenging period. Cutting loose an entire group is more of a black mark than releasing an individual partner in challenging times. So from an individual partner’s perspective, there is valuable security in joining as part of a larger group.

# Legalweek Robot Fight Was Mayweather-Pacquiao For AI Case Briefing Software

UPDATE: There are a number of updates and clarifications below.

And much like the actual Mayweather-Pacquiao fight, one side was way more prepared for it.

Legalweek isn’t the sort of event that usually spawns an old-school rumble. It’s a bunch of tech geeks and lawyers gushing about efficiency and productivity. If there’s any event in the world more at risk to a swirlie attack, it’s this one. But somehow a throwdown emerged yesterday.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
It all began with ROSS Intelligence CEO Andrew Arruda hyping his latest announcement:

Going to be huge news at [#LegalTechNY](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LegalTechNY?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#LegalWeek18](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LegalWeek18?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw).
Stay posted. [pic.twitter.com/D3Xa3cYLeB](https://t.co/D3Xa3cYLeB)

It's going to be an absolute game changer.

OK, you’ve got our attention. When the big announcement came — a product called EVA that uses artificial intelligence to assist litigators in writing briefs — Arruda literally dropped the mic.

The resulting thud was a metaphor for the reaction from tech observers wondering if this wasn’t just another version of Casetext’s CARA. Not that there’s anything wrong with multiple solutions occupying the same space — but it is kind of the opposite of a game changer.

That’s when Sarah Glassmeyer ignited a fire that would soon burn out of control.

How long until the law review article comparing EVA and CARA results? ROBOT FIGHT ROBOT FIGHT ROBOT FIGHT

Because Casetext’s Jacob Heller was fully prepared to play Battlebots.

Gauntlet thrown. Sounds like a fun diversion for a conference that can get a little repetitive. They could totally ham it up like a wrestling match.

There was just one problem.

Looks like [@Casetext](https://twitter.com/casetext?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)'s [#RobotFight](https://twitter.com/hashtag/RobotFight?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) offer was declined … speaks volumes. Proud to work with the team building the [#legaltech](https://twitter.com/hashtag/legaltech?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) of the future, used today by the country's best litigators.

So the [@ROSSIntel](https://twitter.com/ROSSIntel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) “big” announcement was that they created an identical tool to [@casetext](https://twitter.com/casetext?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)? And now they’re shying away from comparing the two tools. Not a good look, IMO.

Casetext had some thoughts on the argument that CARA’s great disadvantage was that law firms would have to pay a fee for it:

.[@casetext](https://twitter.com/casetext?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)'s [@Jacob_Heller](https://twitter.com/Jacob_Heller?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) on [@ROSSIntel](https://twitter.com/ROSSIntel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)'s Eva being offered free: ""for people that don’t have consistent access to [@Westlaw](https://twitter.com/Westlaw?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) or [@LexisNexis](https://twitter.com/LexisNexis?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw), this is huge you can check when your brief is overturned.""

To channel the late 90s… aw snap.

This is where the story would end under most circumstances. But Casetext decided they didn’t have to wait for ROSS to have tussle. Casetext just went ahead and set up EVA so they could run it head-to-head.

[#RobotFight](https://twitter.com/hashtag/RobotFight?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) is on! CARA v. EVA. 1:30 at Bridges Bar at Hilton.

And so it was on. Bob Ambrogi livestreamed it and you can [read his breakdown over here](https://www.lawsitesblog.com/2018/01/robot-fight-casetexts-cara-vs-rosss-eva.html) and watch it below. As bar fights I’ve witnessed go, it involved way fewer broken shards of glass wielded as weapons (UPDATE: Apparently the video isn’t embedding properly. You can [watch it here](https://www.facebook.com/robert.ambrogi/videos/10212555832665487/?notif_id=1517338847234582&notif_t=live_video))

In a display of professional diplomacy, Heller was more even-handed during Cyber Slam than he probably would have been if Arruda had been there to defend his product.
But that doesn’t mean there wasn’t a little shade (UPDATE: Heller pointed out on Twitter that [he wasn’t trying to throw shade](https://twitter.com/Jacob_Heller/status/958875800962465793). But it certainly sounded that way to this reporter):

.[@Jacob_Heller](https://twitter.com/Jacob_Heller?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) on how [@casetext](https://twitter.com/casetext?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) is different from [@ROSSIntel](https://twitter.com/ROSSIntel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)'s EVA platform: ""The major difference is you will find things that are relevant to you and things you are working on"" [#Legalweek18](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Legalweek18?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#LTNY18](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LTNY18?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Or, a lot of shade:

.[@casetext](https://twitter.com/casetext?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) Co-founder had some strong words for [@ROSSIntel](https://twitter.com/ROSSIntel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) 's newly released Eva case analysis platform [#robofight](https://twitter.com/hashtag/robofight?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#legalweek18](https://twitter.com/hashtag/legalweek18?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#LTNY18](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LTNY18?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/hTTRQ81RPt](https://t.co/hTTRQ81RPt)

EVA didn’t help itself with this announcement right in the midst of the fight:

Case search purely by name right now is experiencing some difficulties. If you want to find the case quickly however just use the case citation for now!

— EVA Status (@EVA_Status) [January 30, 2018](https://twitter.com/EVA_Status/status/958416339479289857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Yikes.

Aside from the ludicrousness of gathering around some computers in a hotel bar, Adam Ziegler’s post hits the nail on the head about the whole affair:

Even apart from the gamesmanship, this [@casetext](https://twitter.com/casetext?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) CARA v. [@ROSSIntel](https://twitter.com/ROSSIntel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) EVA 'head-to-head' video is fascinating [https://t.co/H1Y6i1ynkn](https://t.co/H1Y6i1ynkn); I love the open, enthusiastic engagement; maybe someone should host a legal research innovation olympics?

— Adam Ziegler (@abziegler) [January 30, 2018](https://twitter.com/abziegler/status/958449850764419072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Before the battle, Arruda did some work managing expectations for his game changer.

Glad you are enjoying EVA – REMEMBER! EVA is less than two months old, you'll be able to see how much better EVA gets in the coming days, weeks, months & years!

Be sure to share EVA with your [#lawyer](https://twitter.com/hashtag/lawyer?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) friends – the word has to spread in [#legaltech](https://twitter.com/hashtag/legaltech?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) & [#law](https://twitter.com/hashtag/law?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) beyond [#legalweek18](https://twitter.com/hashtag/legalweek18?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)! ???? [https://t.co/GO27a1e57t](https://t.co/GO27a1e57t)

Arruda’s point is worth remembering. Casetext’s CARA has reached a stage of maturity that a two-month-old platform could never match. But EVA has time. It’ll work out the lumps and, you know, figure out how to search by case name. A year from now we’ll have all forgotten EVA’s early days.

Except he had to go and call it a game changer… (UPDATE: Arruda told me he meant “game changer” to refer to the fact that the system will be free, bridging the access to justice gap.)

(I just wanted Aaron Kirschenfeld to write another law review article comparing legal research tools.)

# Supervising AI: 7 Steps For Lawyers To Create Accountability
## One thing remains certain: accountability is vital.

Supervision is a familiar concept for professionals in various fields, including lawyers bound by the American Bar Association’s model rules. However, there is yet to be a universally agreed-upon definition of successful supervision or established best practices for overseeing humans or machines. 

As lawyers now become responsible for supervising AI technology, one thing remains certain: accountability is vital. Embracing this responsibility gives lawyers the power to help shape AI as a fair and just technological advancement that enhances the pursuit of justice in society.

Until industry and government leaders develop official AI supervisory frameworks and audit processes, here are seven steps you can use to create accountability in AI use now:

1. Maintain a decision log. It’s hardly surprising that, with lawyers involved, most of these steps involve documentation. Keep track of your decisions while using AI, especially the decisions you base on an AI tool’s output (see 2). Note when and why you decided to use a specific AI-powered tool. This log will serve as a valuable reference for future improvements and as evidence should any issues arise.

2. Record reliance on AI outputs. Expand your record-keeping with details on all AI-generated conclusions you rely on, including the tool used and steps taken to verify its findings independently (see 3). Adding the date and time creates a chronological record that may prove useful should legal disputes occur regarding your choice to use (or not use) AI.

3. Fact-check and scrutinize AI-generated content. Lawyers must diligently monitor the work of AI, just as they do for new associates working in law firms and legal departments. Examine AI outputs thoroughly to ensure their accuracy, credibility, and completeness. Verify any material conclusions and legal reasoning AI provides before finalizing your work. In doing so, you uphold the integrity of the legal profession and aid in refining AI technology to foster its development into a fair, unbiased, and indispensable tool of legal justice.

4. Address conflicts of interest. Take proactive steps to consider possible conflicts arising from your firm, clients, AI tool vendors, AI models, and the source of the data sets used to train AI. Document your considerations and how you addressed each to demonstrate transparent and ethical conduct.

5. Test various generative AI prompts. Experiment with different methods of prompting a generative AI tool to explore potential inconsistencies or discrepancies in its answers. This can help you uncover underlying biases or shortcomings in an AI system, reducing potential harm and building a more robust and helpful tool for users as AI systems learn from your feedback.

6. Prevent and address biased outcomes. Actively prevent the creation or reinforcement of any unfair biases in AI data sets and training models. Unfair biases can perpetuate detrimental stereotypes and uphold inequalities that seep into decisions that impact lives. 

Collaborate with AI experts who can help you pinpoint sources of bias and develop counteractive remedies. Continuously monitor AI systems to detect and rectify any unintended biases promptly.

7. Seek independent analysis for bias detection. Periodically solicit an outside opinion on the conclusions your AI tool provides. A neutral external perspective can uncover blind spots and biases that may go unnoticed during internal evaluations and illuminate areas for improvement.

Promote The Responsible Use Of AI

Through these steps, you can do more than just confidently supervise AI and ensure accountability for its use. You can also help promote AI technology’s fair and unbiased development in the legal field. Your efforts help shape AI’s evolution into a tool that can create equitable outcomes for all. 

As lawyers embrace a transparent and comprehensive approach to AI supervision, companies and society will realize short-term benefits — such as improved efficiency and accuracy — and long-term advancements grounded in fairness and justice. Then, we’ll ask AI to produce the ideal definition and best practices for successfully supervising humans and AI!

What do you think changes when lawyers supervise AI rather than humans?

What other steps should lawyers take to ensure accountability for AI use?

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

Hint: Don’t get it twisted: the lateral market is currently hot, as NALP’s Executive Director James Leipold notes, “This news may seem to be at odds with people’s current experience in the market, where the competition for lateral associates is reportedly red hot, but in July of 2021 the legal services industry is in a very different place than it was in calendar year 2020.”

# New York Times To Donald Trump: Come At Me, Bro

Yesterday, Donald Trump [threatened to sue](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/donald-trumps-biglaw-firm-threatens-to-sue-new-york-times-over-publication-of-sexual-assault-allegations/) the New York Times over its report on women who claim the Republican nominee sexually assaulted them.

Today, [the Times responded](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/new-york-times-to-donald-trump-come-at-me-bro/2/). They are… umm… [“not scurred.”](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=scurred) The Times isn’t just standing by its story, it’s openly inviting Trump — who has recently seemed to threaten lawsuits more than he files them — to bring it on.

The response letter from [David E. McCraw](https://its.law.nyu.edu/facultyprofiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=profile.overview&personid=35186), associate general counsel for the New York Times, closes with “we welcome the opportunity to have a court set [Donald Trump] straight.” So we’re not talking about something conciliatory. Trump threatened to sue the Times for libel, but the Times doesn’t even accept the notion of Trump having a reputation that can be damaged:

Ouch.

Look, Trump is a public person, running for president of the United States, no less. Trump would have to show “actual malice” on the part of the New York Times, and that is just unlikely in this case. The Times has deep pockets and can defend itself. Trump is threatening a whale with a letter opener.

That alone would make the Times confident. But reading their letter suggests something else. They want him to sue. Truth, remember, is an absolute defense. And if Trump sues the Times, that opens him up to discovery. Other documents, or videos, about Trump’s past sexual conduct would become relevant. Trump would be deposed, under oath, about his sexual escapades. The Times would LOVE Donald Trump to sue them over this. They’d never settle. There would be a public trial where all this stuff would come out. They’d win a freaking Pulitzer.

Which doesn’t mean that Trump won’t sue because Donald Trump seems to just want to watch the world burn. It just means that the Times is ready for this. They were ready for it before they published. The letter shows that this is a fight they are entirely prepared for.

“He acquiesced to a radio host’s request to discuss Mr. Trump’s own daughter own daughter as ‘a piece of ass.'” That is New York Times speak for “BRING IT ON, M***ER***KER!”

Read the full letter on the next page. And know that this was one of the happiest billable hours in the life of an NYT attorney.

## Lawyers are always expected to be credible and reliable sources of information.

Every profession has its own set of standards that must be upheld in order to maintain its credible and reliable reputation. Lawyers are no different, as we are always expected to be credible and reliable sources of information. One way we can live up to this perception is by providing valuable advice based on our knowledge of the law.

Below, you will find five of the many ways that lawyers can build trust with their clients.

Developing A Strong Client Base

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The first step to becoming a trusted advisor is to develop a strong client base. This means building relationships with clients and getting to know them on a personal level. The more you know, the better you will be able to understand their needs and provide them with the best possible legal advice.

For instance, if you had a client who was going through a divorce, you would need to be able to empathize with them and understand what they are going through in order to give them relevant and appropriate advice.

Being Up To Date On The Latest Legal News

This allows you to provide your clients with the most current information and advice. You can stay up to date on the latest legal news by reading legal publications, attending CLE courses, and networking with other lawyers.

Providing Valuable Advice

Providing valuable advice — with emphasis on the “valuable” — means giving advice based on your specialized knowledge and experience of the law. For instance, you may give a client advice on how to handle a difficult legal issue, earning their trust by showing them you are knowledgeable about the law and that you are willing to help them resolve their legal issues.

Being Responsive

It’s important to be responsive to your clients’ needs by making sure you return their phone calls and emails in a timely manner. It also means being available to meet with them when they need to discuss their cases.

This is one of the most important aspects of being a lawyer. You must have integrity in order to be trusted by your clients. This means being honest and ethical in all that you do.

Conclusion

Trust is essential in lawyer-client relationships. It is what allows clients to feel comfortable sharing their personal information, and it is what keeps them coming back for more legal advice. Being up to date on the latest legal news and providing valuable advice are both great ways to become a trusted advisor.

For more information on how lawyers can become trusted advisors, be sure to watch “[Finding Your Voice as a Trusted Advisor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sm199cUv_sE)” on Notes to My (Legal) Self. This episode features Alexandra Ross, a lawyer and trusted advisor who helps lawyers find their voices and build trust with their clients.

# World's Wealthiest Law Firm Conducts Layoffs Due To Market Conditions
## The size of the firm's capital markets team was reportedly 'too big.'

The highest-grossing law firm in the world is reportedly conducting layoffs — and remarkably, they’re not of the stealth variety this time.

As noted by [Law.com International](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/03/04/kirkland-lays-off-capital-markets-lawyers-in-greater-china-405-137372/), Kirkland & Ellis — a firm that brought in $6,514,300,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 1 on the most recent Global 200 — recently handed out pink slips to at least nine of its capital markets attorneys in Asia, where the firm has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong. Market conditions in the area have been described as “turbulent.” Here are some additional details:

The capital markets lawyers were told to attend their weekly team meetings last week in person rather than via virtual platforms. At a team meeting on February 26, 2024, Hong Kong partner Mengyu Lu said some associates were being laid off, attributing the firm’s decision to market conditions and the size of the team, which is “too big,” one person told Law.com International. The associates were also told by Lu that their release is not performance related.

Sources say that those who were laid off will leave the firm by the end of the month.

Kirkland did not confirm the layoffs, stating, “We do not comment on internal matters.” The firm did, however, brag about its remaining capital markets team, saying, “We would note that our Asia capital markets team, with eight partners and over 30 fee earners, continues to be one of the largest in the region and has a track record of leading the most complex capital markets transactions and delivering commercial, proactive and experienced advice to all our clients.”

Best of luck to those who are being let go from Kirkland & Ellis.

If your firm or organization is reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through deferrals, open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

We are so deeply excited to bring this story of an Asian American woman trying to break the glass ceiling at an elite law firm to life.

— Georgia Lee, co-executive producer and co-showrunner of “Partner Track,” commenting on the [new Netflix series](https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/partner-track-netflix-series-what-we-know-so-far/) adapted from [Helen Wan’s 2013 novel](https://amzn.to/3u6u9Bp) of the same name (affiliate link). “Full of fun and romance, this is a contemporary and insightful look at the added pressures for women and those of underrepresented backgrounds in the workplace today,” [said](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/netflix-is-making-series-set-big-law-how-realistic-will-it-be-2021-09-16/) Jinny Howe, Vice President of Original Series at Netflix. Arden Cho, best known for her roles on “Teen Wolf” and “Chicago Med,” will play the lead role of Ingrid Yung.

# Biglaw Attorney With Depression Wants Other Lawyers To Know They're Not Alone
## He says 'going public' with his mental health struggles changed his life for the better.

I am heartened for the future because we, as a profession, finally appear ready to start having a real, constructive dialogue on the complicated, and often uncomfortable, issue that is mental health. The dialogue is going to have its ebbs and flows, but it is a dialogue nonetheless—one that we were not having, and in fact actively avoided, until quite recently.

— [Mark Goldstein](https://www.reedsmith.com/en/professionals/g/goldstein-mark-s), who works as counsel at Reed Smith, in comments made about [what has happened to him](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/07/07/what-happened-after-this-big-law-attorney-told-the-world-about-his-depression/) since he told the Biglaw world about [his mental health struggles](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/biglaw-depression-story/) this past February in an op-ed published in the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2019/02/12/scared-ashamed-crippled-how-one-lawyer-overcame-living-with-depression-in-big-law/). Since that time, Goldstein has received thousands of letters of support from members of the legal profession. Goldstein closes his [latest op-ed piece](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/07/07/what-happened-after-this-big-law-attorney-told-the-world-about-his-depression/) with the following: “I suffer from mental health disabilities. And if you do too, or if you simply are passionate about or can relate to this issue, remember that you are not alone and that together, we can create the future about which I am so heartened.”

Good news for Akin Gump partners and employees — it’s now easier for those at the firm to save for future education costs. The firm recently announced a new benefit for employees, a 529 College Savings Plan which allows folks to start saving for those educational expenses through automatic payroll deductions.

According to the firm, the program will be rolled out through SoFi and allow employees to save for a variety of educational expenses.

Akin Gump is now among the very few large law firms offering a 529 College Savings Plan benefit to its partners and employees. Through this new benefit, plans may be opened by partners and employees and may be used for an array of education expenses that extend beyond tuition. Employees with existing 529 plans may set up deductions to begin investing into the plan, while those without existing plans may use SoFi’s Savings and Selections Tool to identify the plan that best fits their needs.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Akin Gump chief human resources officer Meg Meserole said of the new program:

“We recognize that paying for college and all the expenses it entails can be a source of major financial stress, particularly if families have not prepared in advance. That is why we are so excited to partner with SoFi on this new benefit. Eligible employees can identify a plan and investment amounts that work best for them and contribute through convenient payroll deductions, allowing them to prepare for this major life expense.”

This new benefit is part of the [firm’s recent push](https://www.akingump.com/en/news-insights/akin-gump-announces-significant-enhancements-to-family-friendly-benefits-launches-adoption-surrogacy-and-fertility-resource.html) to increase family friendly benefits for all of their employees. They’ve expanded parental and family leave for staff (to make it commensurate with attorneys’ time off), and launched and adoption, surrogacy, and fertility benefits.

At this time of the year we spend a lot of digital ink at Above the Law waxing on about how much money lawyers at Biglaw firms are making. Associate year end bonuses are an important part of the Biglaw ecosystem, but we’d be remiss if we didn’t also talk about the money lawyers are giving out this season.

It’s generally a tradition for lawyers at Biglaw to give gifts — usually cash — to the support staff that make their job smoother. But how much you should give to that essential paralegal is not always clear. Our network of tipsters has reported a wide spectrum of support staff gifts, from a measly $20 on the cheap end to an impressive $1000 on the generous side.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
We know there are a variety of norms at different firms. For example, some places pool attorney cash contributions that scale based on seniority and hand those out to the whole support team while others have a laissez-faire attitude towards attorney generosity and associates are left without a benchmark for what they should give.

So we are taking the question to you, dear readers. Let’s delve into how much you’re giving to the paralegal/admin/support staffer in your professional life.

For the purpose of this first question, assume you’re a midlevel associate (and that amounts would scale up slightly as a senior or down as someone pretty junior). So how much are you giving to a support staffer that is absolutely essential to your ability to get your job done?

How much do you give to essential support staff at the holidays?

My sense is that the worst is over, although I’m not suggesting there wouldn’t be more cuts three to six months down the road in response to a continued economic downturn.

— Alan Stone of Boston-area Stone Legal Recruiting, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/02/09/how-goodwin-procter-turned-1000-lateral-associates-into-250/), on Goodwin Procter’s recent [round of layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/am-law-20-firm-begins-layoffs/), made in response to the firm’s overcapacity considering the current economic climate. The firm has seen historic associate turnover since 2020, hiring more than 600 attorneys while losing almost 400 before January’s layoffs.

# Top 25 Biglaw Firm Hands Out Big Raises, Bonuses To Associates
## Exciting news for everyone at the firm. Congratulations!

Hanukkah isn’t over yet and Christmas is just around the corner, so Biglaw firms still have ample time to give their associates the greatest gift of all: more money. Which firm is the latest to let its attorneys unwrap cold, hard cash?

That would be Sullivan & Cromwell. After bringing home $1,694,809,000 gross revenue in 2022, the firm came in 24th place in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking. S&C has now spoken out on raises and bonuses. The firm doesn’t publish memos related to compensation, but instead sends out individualized links to its attorneys. According to our sources, the firm is following the market.

Like all other firms of its ilk, SullCrom has chosen to use the Cravath scale for its compensation increases, meaning these are the salaries associates at the firm will see, as of January 1, 2024:

- Class of 2023 – $225,000
- Class of 2022 – $235,000
- Class of 2021 – $260,000
- Class of 2020 – $310,000
- Class of 2019 – $365,000
- Class of 2018 – $390,000
- Class of 2017 – $420,000
- Class of 2016+ – $435,000
S&C is also matching the Cravath bonus scale, and this is what year-end bonuses will look like at the firm:

- Class of 2023 – $15,000
- Class of 2022 – $20,000
- Class of 2021 – $30,000
- Class of 2020 – $57,500
- Class of 2019 – $75,000
- Class of 2018 – $90,000
- Class of 2017 – $105,000

# DLA Piper Partner Out Amid Sexual Assault Allegations
## The firm decided to part ways with the partner before their internal investigation is complete.

Louis Lehot

Earlier this month DLA Piper partner [Vanina Guerrero](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/vanina-guerrero/), penned an open letter to the firm and filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in which she [alleges the co-managing partner of the firm’s Silicon Valley office, Louis Lehot, repeatedly sexually assaulted her,](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/dla-piper-partner-accused-of-sexual-assault-by-fellow-partner/) beginning shortly after she began working for the firm in 2018 and asking to be released from the firm’s forced arbitration agreement so she’d be free to pursue her claims in open court. Initially the firm said they were investigating the allegations against Lehot, but now, before said investigation is complete, the firm has parted ways with Lehot.

As[ reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/10/11/louis-lehot-let-go-from-dla-piper-following-sexual-assault-allegations/) Law.com, in an email sent to attorneys and staff, the firm said they “remain steadfastly committed to our zero-tolerance policy for harassment in the workplace,” and revealed that Lehot was pushed out of the firm:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“We are saddened that this type of allegation has arisen at our firm,” the email said, regarding partner Vanina Guerrero’s allegation that Lehot sexually assaulted her multiple times after recruiting her to join the firm.

“Despite the fact that the allegations have not been substantiated by the investigation to date, the firm has concluded for various reasons that it is in the best interest of the firm that we part ways with Louis Lehot,” the email said. “We understand and share the deep concern about this matter, and would like to be in a position to share more detailed information. This is an ongoing legal matter, however, and therefore we cannot share further details.”

While Guerrero’s lawyer, Jeanne Christensen of Wigdor LLP, appreciates this “first step,” she also points out the firm’s notable silence on whether they intended on forcing Guerrero into arbitration:

“But DLA Piper has said nothing about releasing Ms. Guerrero from forced arbitration,” Christensen said. “This continued silence means DLA Piper intends to enforce the provision. It needs to explain why.”

DLA Piper has been under pressure for their stance on mandatory arbitration for a while now. Law students have organized an online campaign urging fellow law students to[ #DumpDLA](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/one-biglaw-firm-refuses-to-do-away-with-forced-arbitration-agreements/) over their mandatory arbitration policy and there [have been](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/law-school-students-protest-outside-of-dla-piper-over-alleged-sexual-assault/) repeated[ protests](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/law-school-students-are-taking-to-the-street-over-biglaw-firms-with-mandatory-arbitration-agreements/) in front of their offices over the issue. We’ll be following along to see if the firm does decide to reverse course on the issue.

# The Legal Trick Payday Lenders Are Using To Skirt The Law

A 60-year-old Navy veteran needed money fast. So he did what far too many people do in that situation and applied for a short-term “payday-type” loan. When all was said and done, he was charged well over 100 percent interest. Seriously. One [major player in the industry](http://triblive.com/business/headlines/6575923-74/loans-cashcall-lending#axzz3D73Sb9LR) offered a $2,600, 47-month loan, and sought a total repayment of $20,280.03! That’s a 204.94 percent annual percentage rate!

Most of us realize that short-term lenders make their nut on exorbitantly high interest rates, but states have systematically cracked down on these companies and capped the interest they’re allowed to charge. State regulators have had a good deal of success in recent years securing hefty settlements for citizens victimized under state usury laws.

But our Navy veteran friend wasn’t so lucky. He got his loans from the wrong companies, and the state Department of Banking had to tell him that they were powerless to assist him.

It’s hard to believe a company can so blatantly thumb its nose at the rules, but they have a secret and some Biglaw bigshots on retainer to fight tooth-and-nail to protect their lending practices….


How do you avoid state laws? Headquarter in Indian Country, of course! Increasingly, the big players in short-term lending are managed by Native American tribes and headquartered on reservations, [sheltered from those pesky state regulators](http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/investigations/Online-Payday-Loan-Borrowers-Charge-Sky-High-Rates-274682251.html).

But for all the companies the DOB could force to pay up, there are others that it can’t touch because they are owned by Native American tribes.

“They say you can’t touch us because we’re on an Indian reservation,” said [Connecticut Department of Banking Commissioner Howard] Pitkin. “Tribal sovereignty.”

It’s a lesson Dwight Graham learned the hard way after taking out three other loans from companies that the DOB can’t go after.

They include One Click Cash, which is owned by the Santee Sioux Nation of Nebraska; United Cash Loan, owned by the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma; and MobiLoans, which is owned by the Tunica-Biloxi Tribe of Louisiana.

All claim sovereign immunity, meaning Connecticut’s banking laws don’t apply.

It’s more than just a handful of opportunistic tribal lenders:

“There are about 80 websites we know of offering unlicensed lending. Half of the business is done by five of the sites who claim tribal sovereign immunity from state banking laws,” [Consumer Federation of America’s Tom] Feltner said.

Half!

So Native Americans are ravaging the population through high-interest — one might say “predatory” — lending? What did America ever do to them? Oh, right. The systemic genocide and continuing humiliation. The “cycle of abuse” has been a hot topic this week and the relationship between America and the Indians is the cycle of abuse writ large. Land stolen, [basic services underfunded](http://www.nnaapc.org/publications/20100814NativeHealthUnderfunded.pdf), [over-incarcerated](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jamaal-bell/mass-incarceration-a-dest_b_578854.html) — pretty much the only advantage they have left in its lop-sided relationship with the U.S. government is the exemption from state regulation. And, unsurprisingly, some Native tribes have capitalized on that advantage with industries designed to prey upon people facing hard times. Gambling and payday lending.

At least those industries make big money. Enough money to hire some high-powered lawyers.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
After several calls to these loan companies, the Troubleshooters discovered many are represented by teams of lawyers and public relations firms.

“We have one letter from a pretty high classed law firm which goes through two pages of ‘you can’t touch us’,” said Pitkin, “and in the last paragraph it says, ‘But, you know, customer service is really important to us.’”

…

The DOB wants consumers to know that if they get a loan from a company owned by a Native American tribe, the state can’t help.

So states are powerless. But where’s the federal government? The vagaries of the Trust Doctrine plenary power doctrine (UPDATE: don’t know why I blanked on that one — thanks to our tipster for pointing out that I cited the wrong one) grant the federal government sweeping powers over Native American lands. Well, it turns out the federal government is trying to fight back against these companies and running into a Biglaw brick wall.

A couple of Biglaw firms have represented one lender in an ongoing battle with the FTC. The FTC brought suit against AMG Services, Inc. alleging violations of the FTC Act, the Truth in Lending Act, and the Electronic Funds Transfer Act. The defendants originally retained Morrison & Foerster and are now represented by Kirkland & Ellis. They recently prevailed on a summary judgment motion brought by the FTC [on a jurisdictional question](http://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/federal-court-agrees-with-magistrate-tha-24486/):

However, the Report denied the FTC’s motion for summary judgment in response to the tribe’s second claim, and ruled that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the tribal defendants are “corporations” as defined in the FTC Act. “Corporation” is defined in the FTC Act to include certain “entities organized to carry on business for their own profit or that of their members” [emphasis added]. As evidence that the tribal defendants are for-profit corporations covered by the FTC Act, the FTC presented the tribal defendants’ articles of incorporation and bank account opening form stating that the purpose of the entities is to generate profits. The tribal defendants countered that their entities are governmental instrumentalities or economic and political subdivisions of a sovereign nation, wholly unlike private corporations covered by the FTC Act.

If Native American “corporations” aren’t “corporations” within the meaning of the FTC, maybe the CFPB could help. This seems like their bailiwick. They’ve filed suit [against some of the big players](http://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/cfpb-tests-the-limits-of-tribal-lending-90117/). But a quick look at PACER shows they are mired in motion practice over moving the case to California. Neil M. Barofsky of Jenner & Block is spearheading that defense/stalling tactic.

Beyond that case, the CFPB did rule against the payday lenders in a motion to quash Civil Investigative Demands, but the young agency hasn’t pressed the issue in court. Could they be afraid of losing?

Seriously, is anyone going to help out folks like our old Navy vet? The fact of the matter is that the lawyers for the tribes are probably right: Congress likely failed to consider the unique issues surrounding tribal sovereignty when it drafted these laws. That doesn’t mean Congress lacks the power to act though. If the FTC or CFPB ultimately fail with the judiciary, the ball is squarely in Congress’s court. But it’s unclear whether or not they’ll gather the political will to close this regulatory loophole.

Here I’ll help: let’s just say payday lending is all Obama’s fault. That should get them working.

# Amid Growing Scandal, MoFo Launches Investigation Into Partner Justin Fairfax
## It isn't just Fairfax's political job that is on the line.

Virginia Lt. Governor Justin Fairfax (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)

Virginia Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax finds himself in the eye of a scandal, as two women have now accused the Biglaw attorney turned politician of sexual assault. The allegations of Dr. Vanessa Tyson and Meredith Watson have sparked turmoil in the state — supercharged by the blackface scandals surrounding two other Virginia politicians, Governor Ralph Northam and State Attorney General Mark Herring — with articles of impeachment against Fairfax already [being discussed](https://www.wavy.com/news/virginia/sponsor-backs-off-fast-track-impeachment-of-fairfax/1772678725).

But it isn’t just Fairfax’s political job that is on the line. Fairfax is [a partner](https://www.mofo.com/people/justin-fairfax.html) at the Biglaw firm of Morrison & Foerster. The firm’s Chair, [Larren Nashelsky](https://www.mofo.com/people/larren-nashelsky.html), [told Law.com](https://www.law.com/2019/02/08/justin-fairfax-takes-leave-from-mofo-as-firm-opens-investigation/) that the firm has launched an investigation (conducted by outside counsel, though which firm has been engaged has not yet be revealed) into the allegations. Nashelsky’s statement on the matter expressed how “seriously” the firm is taking the investigation:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“We take the allegations against Justin very seriously,” Nashelsky said. “As a firm, we believe that it is important to seriously listen to any allegation of sexual assault or harassment, and to treat all persons making such allegations with respect and sensitivity.”

Fairfax has taken a leave of absence from the firm during the investigation. Fairfax [engaged Beth Wilkinson of Wilkinson Walsh + Eskovitz](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/kavanaugh-hearing-attorneys-clash-again-in-virginia-lt-governor-case/?rf=1) after the first allegations of sexual assault surfaced as part of a newspaper report that ultimately never ran. Wilkinson was also hired by Brett Kavanaugh when he faced his own [allegations of sexual assault](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/3-brett-kavanaugh-accusers-versus-all-the-kavanaugh-denials/).

Donald Trump is [struggling to find representation](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/trump-on-the-hunt-for-a-florida-attorney-willing-to-light-their-career-on-fire-in-miami-tomorrow/) in his multi-count federal criminal case and it shows because he just can’t stop saying incredibly damaging stuff about his case. Like how he [will plead guilty for money](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/donald-trump-plead-guilty-damages-insanity/). This is what happens after decades developing a reputation for stiffing attorneys. We also have more layoffs from [Orrick](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/orrick-layoffs-deferral/) and [Reed Smith](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/another-top-50-am-law-firm-cuts-its-global-work-force/) — what can we glean from these moves? And a Massachusetts court expanded the standard for ineffective assistance of counsel to include instances where the lawyer is clearly bigoted.

# How Consultants Recommend Cutting Legal Bills
## In-house columnist Mark Herrmann identifies what looks like the wave of the future.

If you ask a consultant to reduce your legal bills, what would the consultant say?

If I were you, I’d be interested in the answer to that question. If I were a corporation, I’d want to reduce costs. And if I were a law firm, I’d want to know what consultants were proposing that would reduce demand for my services.

So here goes:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Consultants recommend entering alternative fee arrangements. [I’ve written about this](http://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/the-alternative-fee-arrangement-that-will-force-big-firms-to-innovate-or-die/) repeatedly [in the past](http://abovethelaw.com/2015/01/fixed-fee-deals-3-traps-for-the-unwary/). Many corporations are already using alternative fee deals. My sense is that this is old news, but you still run into companies doing business with law firms the old-fashioned way — paying by the hour.

Consultants also recommend pushing ediscovery work to ediscovery vendors. My sense is that this, too, is already widespread. Law firms resisted the use of ediscovery vendors 15 years ago — “What of quality control? Our lawyers must read every document! We personally must do the work!” — but law firms long ago gave up that fight.

What do consultants suggest that’s actually new?

Consultants suggest “partnering” with law firms. An associate at a law firm costs a ton. A lawyer from a legal vendor is cheaper — maybe half the price. And an in-house lawyer is cheaper still. If corporations can replace bodies at law firms with bodies from legal vendors or in-house bodies, then corporations can save money.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Suppose you have a case that would require five lawyers at a firm. You tell the firm that you’re going to replace one of the lawyers at the firm with a substitute — someone from a legal vendor or the in-house department. Thus, instead of staffing the case with senior partner, junior partner, senior associate, junior associate, very junior associate, the firm must instead staff the case with a substitute for one of those five slots.

I can hear the law firms complaining already: “We didn’t train the replacement lawyer! We didn’t hire that person! We can’t fire him (or her). We can’t dock a bonus. We can’t reprimand. If the person performs poorly, there’s no price to be paid in not getting staffed on future cases. What happens if the replacement lawyer commits malpractice? We won’t stand for it!”

Frankly, I’m pretty sympathetic to this. ([If you assume, as I do](http://abovethelaw.com/2014/07/overcoming-the-presumption-of-incompetence/), that all lawyers you haven’t worked with before are incompetent, then the firm partner is being asked to put an incompetent lawyer on her team. That’s awfully dangerous.)

You’d have to substitute lawyers very carefully. You’re not substituting the replacement lawyer for one of the firm’s partners. The senior folks are, after all, the reason you hired the law firm in the first place.

Smart corporations wouldn’t substitute a replacement lawyer for the senior associate. I’m speaking from personal experience — 17 years as a partner at a big firm — now. I spent a long time trying to find associates who I was willing to let help me on my cases. I’d staff cases only with senior associates who could suggest important issues to investigate, do legal and factual research intelligently, write persuasive briefs efficiently, take depositions of most witnesses, and so on. And those people had grown up within our firm. They knew the systems, the technology, the procedures, and the like. Replacing a critical piece of the team with a new person of unknown quality would be a mistake.

But how about substituting the replacement lawyer further down the food chain?

Many cases involve routine discovery. Maybe you could substitute a replacement lawyer for the firm’s very junior associate who would otherwise be copying form discovery from the last case to use in the new case. Or assembling the usual boilerplate objections to the other side’s discovery. Or perhaps deposing custodians of records or other tangential witnesses.

I understand that this would cut into law firms’ profits. But the outsourcing of ediscovery also cut into law firms’ profits.

And, if you think about the issue more broadly, this improves the life of law firm associates.

If you inflict the pain of routine, repetitive, relatively unimportant tasks only on folks from outside your firm — and you give your associates the more interesting and challenging assignments — that might not be such a bad thing. I know that it reduces your “profits per partner,” but it might increase your “job satisfaction per lawyer,” which has benefits of its own. Many big firms now complain that new associates work for the firms for two or three years, pay off their student loans, and then move on to do other things. That high turnover is expensive. Maybe, if the jobs at firms were more interesting, you could reduce turnover and save money.

In any event, I suspect that law firms will have to start thinking about this. Some corporations are already “partnering” with their firms on big cases; consultants are recommending it; and it appears to be the wave of the future.

# Women In Biglaw Should Be Pleased That Partners Aren't Showing Them Their Members

As far as I know, no partner at a major firm is in the habit of exposing himself or pleasuring himself in front of female associates. I don’t know if male lawyers have better moral compasses or are more fearful of legal consequences, but I think we ladies should be thankful that they keep their pants on in the office and their hands to themselves. Those little things count.

[UPDATE 4:49 p.m. EST: The Marshal of the Supreme Court has responded… see below]

A former Chief Justice conducted an investigation producing a thorough and detailed 888-page report that Americans have openly and repeatedly called into question for almost 60 years. The 20-page [Dobbs leak report](https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/press/Dobbs_Public_Report_January_19_2023.pdf) — released [yesterday](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/all-that-and-the-supreme-court-still-has-no-idea-who-leaked-the-dobbs-decision/) — makes the Warren Report and its investigation look as unimpeachable as George Washington chopping down a cherry tree while doped up on sodium thiopental.

If someone turned in an internal investigation report like this, regulators would drive that company into bankruptcy. Indeed, with the right set of eyes, the Dobbs leak report reads like an internal investigation report framed to answer only the narrowest, least consequential questions and handed over in hopes that the SEC loses interest before considering any obvious follow up.

But there’s no regulator around to push back. From the Court’s preamble to the report:

The Chief Justice assigned the task to the Marshal of the Supreme Court and her staff. After months of diligent analysis of forensic evidence and interviews of almost 100 employees, the Marshal’s team determined that no further investigation was warranted with respect to many of the “82 employees [who] had access to electronic or hard copies of the draft opinion.”

This is the first critical point from the report. Chief Justice Roberts controlled every aspect of the investigation up to and including the decision to keep the FBI out of it. He also provides the final word on the quality of the investigation’s conclusions. Just like a tobacco company looking into smoking, Roberts decided there his cherry-picked investigatory sample provided all the evidence he needed to declare the whole thing inconclusive.

On the subject of cherry-picking, consider this from the Marshal’s report on the conduct of the investigation:

The draft majority opinion was circulated on February 10, 2022. Politico published the draft opinion on the evening of May 2. The investigation focused on Court personnel – temporary (law clerks) and permanent employees – who had or may have had access to the draft opinion during the period from the initial circulation until the publication by Politico.

Clerks and “permanent employees.” The reader can almost hear the coffee mugs clanking at the late night “drafting by committee” meeting where they pitched “how can we make it sound like we might have talked to the justices without revealing that we didn’t talk to the justices?” Alas, the Supreme Court is not a venue for imprecision in writing, and if the investigation had spoken with the justices the report would say so instead of trying to hide behind vagueness. The report’s seemingly deliberate effort to never put the fact that it only interviewed 82 employees who had access to the opinion on the same page that it states “in addition to the Justices, 82 employees had access to electronic or hard copies of the draft opinion,” took some doing and I applaud the effort.

I’m more convinced that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction than I am in Alito and Thomas having clean hands here.

In another clumsy feint, the Marshal cites, as the fourth and final potentially relevant standard, the code of conduct applicable to federal judges:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
(4) Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges. The Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges provides: “A judge should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court. A judge should require similar restraint by court personnel subject to the judge’s direction and control.” Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges, Canon 3A(6).

If relegating this to the rung of least importance didn’t set off enough red flags, this appears to be included in the vain hope no one would point out that the justices are not bound by the Code of Conduct. “The Code of Conduct, by its express terms, applies only to lower federal court judges. That reflects a fundamental difference between the Supreme Court and the other federal courts,” Chief Justice Roberts has said.

We could feast on kipper for days off this red herring.

Could the Chief be too clever by half? Making a show of a thorough but hopelessly narrow investigation might fool some people, but ultimately trying to obscure the fact that no one looked into the most obvious vectors of the leak only makes one of them look more guilty.

The investigative team received outside assistance with a fingerprint analysis of an item relevant to the investigation. That analysis found viable fingerprints but no matches to any fingerprints of interest.

Oh? There are fingerprints on it that are explicitly NOT the fingerprints of any of the employees? To borrow from Sherlock Holmes, “when you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however COMPLETELY F**KING OBVIOUS, must be the truth.”

The Marshal’s report is not the end of the inquiry though! The Supreme Court also commissioned Michael Chertoff, Sam Alito’s former colleague when they both sat on the Third Circuit, to evaluate the Marshal’s investigation.

His one-page assessment that the Marshal did a bang up job includes similar conspicuously narrow language.

I was asked by the Chief Justice to independently review and assess the thoroughness of the investigation into the Dobbs draft opinion leak and to identify any additional useful investigative measures as well as actions that would improve the handling of sensitive documents in the future.

My review assessed that the Marshal and her experienced investigators undertook a thorough investigation within their legal authorities…

Now, that could mean that they did everything they could without the power to subpoena — picking a name totally at random — Ginni Thomas. But it could also mean within the scope authorized by the Chief Justice. The report does seem to indicate a very thorough review of the limited population the Marshal actually set out to investigate.

As opposed to its [10-second investigation of the Hobby Lobby leak](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/alito-leak-supreme-court-ethics-investigation/).

The initial round of interviews included a broad swath of employees and were appropriately and professionally conducted.

Having read a lot of reports like this while in practice, let me tell you that “broad swath” is a super convenient phrase when the author can’t in good faith write “all.”

At this time, I cannot identify any additional useful investigative measures.

Well, take your time. Brainstorm for a bit and we can all regroup later.

Bringing us all the way back to the preamble:

In May 2022, this Court suffered one of the worst breaches of trust in its history: the leak of a draft opinion. The leak was no mere misguided attempt at protest.

That’s perhaps the most straightforward conclusion in the whole report. The leak was “no mere misguided attempt at protest.” Everything about this report makes clear through its omissions that the leaker did not have protest on their mind when releasing the draft to box potentially nervous conservative justices from abandoning the draft in favor of the Chief Justice’s “death of a thousand cuts” approach.

[UPDATE 4:49 p.m. EST: The Marshal of the Supreme Court responds —

Translated: ""my awkward report made everyone think I didn't interview justices as part of the investigation"" FULL STOP ""I also spoke to justices ABOUT this investigation"" F/S ""so after I made 80+ ppl sign affidavits, I thought 'NOT worth asking the last 9 to 'swear not to lie'"" [https://t.co/nslLXv0AFS](https://t.co/nslLXv0AFS)

It’s bad enough to feel forced to write a follow up to your own “final report” within a day of its release, but then bringing more goofy, hyper-specific phrasing into the mix only makes it worse.]

# Biglaw Firm Could Pay $1.4 Million After Malpractice Verdict
## The verdict is in, but that doesn't mean the firm will go gentle into that good night.

Yesterday, Alston & Bird received a jury verdict in a malpractice lawsuit, holding them 32 percent responsible for a former company manager’s theft from a client. Their (now former) client, family-held Hatcher Management Holdings LLC, took a loss after former manager, Maury Hatcher, cashed out of the business, allegedly at an inflated price in addition to hundreds of thousands of dollars in self-dealing fees. Hatcher Management Holdings alleged Alston & Bird partners assisted the departed Maury Hatcher from providing company members access to financial records and documents after he left the company.

Now the jury has returned a verdict in the malpractice case, finding Alston & Bird 32 percent to blame. They also found Maury Hatcher 60 percent liable, and Hatcher Management Holdings got 8 percent of the blame. The jury award $697,614 in damages and $341,831 in interest, which needs to be apportioned according to blame. They also awarded ~$1.1 million in fees and expenses, which the firm has to cover in full (and makes a pretty compelling argument in hindsight in favor of settling).

The actual total amount A&B is on the hook for is still unknown — as Law.com [reports](https://www.law.com/2018/02/28/alston-bird-malpractice-verdict-may-exceed-1-4-million/), there is some discrepancy on how the apportionment will breakdown:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The verdict left both sides’ lawyers arguing over what the apportionment breakdown means. Lead plaintiffs attorney Harmon Caldwell told Superior Court Judge Craig Schwall the awards should only be reduced by the 8 percent blamed on Hatcher Management.

Defense attorney Richard Robbins said the verdict means Alston & Bird is only responsible for 32 percent of the entire award, including the fees and expenses.

Schwall said the plaintiff’s version didn’t seem to comport with the apportionment law.

“What’s the point of the apportionment statute if you can’t reduce nonparty fault?” he asked.

“I don’t know the answer,” Schwall added, instructing both sides to draft briefs outlying their arguments.

But, unsurprisingly, the fight isn’t over for the Biglaw firm. Their lawyer says, “This verdict will be on appeal for the next four years.”

# Tips For Finding Your First Legal Job
## Legal recruiters don't work with entry-level candidates; what steps can you take on your own to find a great first legal job?

Are you looking for your first legal job? First legal job in the U.S.? First legal job in a new practice area? Have you been out of the workforce or in a non-legal role for a number of years now and are looking to get back in? Have you been working outside the U.S. for some time?

Legal recruiters do not work with entry-level candidates for the simple reason that most firms have their own procedures for hiring at the entry level that do not involve recruiters. What steps can you take on your own?

- Make a list of your concrete skills. Think about which roles your concrete skills best lend themselves to. Remember firms/companies may not be in a position to train you on the basics.
- NETWORKING. NETWORKING. You have a much better shot at landing your next job through personal connections. And keep up the networking once you land your next job. Networking should be [authentic and ongoing](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/the-importance-of-authentic-networking/), not just something you do during a job search.
- LinkedIn, LinkedIn, LinkedIn. Connect with people, but be sure they are meaningful connections. And be sure your LinkedIn profile is in tip-top shape before starting your reach-outs.
- Work your alumni networks — undergrad, law school, and former law firm colleagues. Ask for warm intros to others in their networks.
- Remember that Career Services isn’t just for current students. Call your law school Career Services office anytime! Again, ask for warm intros.
- More and more law firms are creating alumni affairs offices. Call your former firm!
- Consider joining a city or state bar association and getting involved with one of the committees.
- Team up with a more senior lawyer to write an article or engage in a business development–type activity. Even if you’re unemployed, you can still be working towards your career and resume-building.
- Set up online alerts for job openings. Ask me for a list of online in-house job search resources.
- Start by requesting informational interviews, especially of those with whom you already have some connection. Do your homework before making the request and certainly before the interview. Structure the conversation to be sure you’re not wasting the other person’s time. Specify the time frame and offer to email questions in advance. Be sure to offer something in return (sharing an article with them they may find interesting, etc.) and show appreciation for the person’s time.
- Keep an open mind. You don’t want to sell yourself short, but put yourself in the employer’s shoes. They are taking a big chance on you. You know you’re awesome, but they don’t know that yet. Be hesitant to pass up a good opportunity just because it isn’t perfect. You don’t have to stay at this next job forever. Especially if you’re looking to move geographically, it may be best to land a job that checks two-thirds of the boxes; think of it as an 18- to 24-month stop with feet on the ground, and aim to be in your true dream job within a couple of years.
- Consider enlisting a third party’s help. Reach out to me directly and I’ll be happy to share some recommendations for career coaches with experience in the legal field.
- If you’re looking to re-enter the workforce after time outside the workforce, you may want to consider PE funds, consulting firms, or other employers who tend to value “smarts” over specific experience. They often prefer to mold someone to the job. The catch: many of them will not even consider candidates from below the Top 6 law schools. You could also look at banks and some other larger employers who may have specific workforce re-entry programs (e.g., [JPMorgan Chase](https://careers.jpmorgan.com/us/en/students/programs/reentry-program?search=&tags=location__Americas__UnitedStatesofAmerica.)).
Of course, feel free to reach out to me or any of my [colleagues at Lateral Link](https://www.laterallink.com/team/) if you aren’t sure if a recruiter might be able to assist. We can always help point you in the right direction.

I’ve already written about Hogan Lovells partner Neal Katyal’s [harrowing escape from the deadly mud at Burning Man](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/biglaw-partner-neal-katyal-escapes-burning-man-avoids-trench-foot/) and his ability to avoid the plague of World War 1, trench foot. But I’m not the only one to notice Katyal’s adventures in the Nevada desert.

Jeffrey Clark is the former Department of Justice employee who earned [the scorn of other lawyers in Trumpland](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/jan-6-testimony-reveals-colleagues-basically-think-doj-coup-lawyer-jeff-clarks-an-incompetent-idiot/) for his efforts to[ keep Donald Trump in power](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/jeffrey-clark-gives-environmental-lawyers-a-bad-name/) following the 2020 election. That also notched him a [Georgia indictment](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/lawyer-mugshots-georgia-election-fraud-edition/) and the title [unindicted co-conspirato](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/third-donald-trump-indictement/)r in the federal January 6th indictment against Trump.

Anyway, Clark is back in the news with thoughts about the annual Burning Man festival, and Katyal’s attendance. And it’s safe to say his take is very different.

Why am I not surprised that Neal Katyal made it a priority to get to a neopagan ritual?

See picture below in lower right.

Pray that these folks come to the light & realize that the only path is through and to our Lord.

We are all fallen and need God, and to repent as a Nation. [https://t.co/6m9Dk1Ddcj](https://t.co/6m9Dk1Ddcj)

Um, whaaaa? That reads like religious zealot Mad Libs. Katyal had an absolute fire response:

Dear Criminal Defendant Clark:

I am a Hindu. Are you suggesting I do not belong in this country?

You might be better off studying our Founders, the text of our First Amendment, and (albeit for other reasons), the Criminal Code.

I sincerely wish you the best,

But legal Twitter/X wasn’t done with Clark.

Clark is beneath contempt. Great response by [@neal_katyal](https://twitter.com/neal_katyal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw). Admirably restrained but utterly devastating. [https://t.co/HJGZoNjZ0i](https://t.co/HJGZoNjZ0i)

Jeff Clark posts this ridiculous diatribe without the faintest hint of irony

Were you coming to the light while plotting to overthrow our government, Jeff?

Were you repenting as the insurrectionists you enabled were assaulting Capitol Police?

No

You were enjoying the carnage [https://t.co/4RZAht7Gua](https://t.co/4RZAht7Gua)

Hell, it wasn’t just lawyers piling on Clark. Beloved sports reporter Mike Lupica got in on the action.

A boneheaded social media screed definitely isn’t Clark’s biggest problem at the moment, but it sure ain’t a good look.

King & Spalding recently concluded their yearlong investigation, commissioned by the U.S. Soccer Federation, into the National Women’s Soccer League. The investigation, led by former Deputy Attorney General turned King & Spalding partner Sally Yates, found verbal abuse, emotional abuse, and sexual misconduct that was “systemic, spanning multiple teams, coaches and victims,” and further found such behavior was “rooted in a deeper culture.”

As[ reported by](https://www.law360.com/articles/1536664) Law360, some of the allegations that came to light during the course of the investigation demonstrate just how widespread the problem is in the league:

According to the report, coach Christy Holly of the Racing Louisville Football Club once called in a player to review game film and showed her pornography instead. Rory Dames, who coached the Chicago Red Stars, was notorious at the highest levels of women’s soccer for alternately berating his players and then quizzing them about their sex lives. Paul Riley was fired by the Portland Thorns after several complaints by players to team and league officials had gone overlooked for two years. He was still hired by another league team shortly after his firing, without team officials informing his new employer of the allegations.

Unfortunately, there was less than full cooperation with the investigation around the league:

Three women’s soccer clubs — the Portland Thorns, the Chicago Red Stars and Racing Louisville — did not fully cooperate with the investigation and in some cases impeded it, the report said. Jeff Plush, the league’s commissioner from 2014 to 2017, never responded to attempts to interview him, the report said, and Dan Flynn, who retired as CEO of U.S. Soccer in 2019 after 19 years in office, declined to sit for an interview and responded only to written questions.

The Player’s Association noted how painful the environment is to work in, and looked forward to working toward a safer league:

“Our goal is to marshal all the facts to inform evidence-based recommendations about how to advance the goal of a league centered on player safety,” the statement said. “As difficult as this report is to read, it has been even more painful for players, whether known or unknown, to live it.”

The report made recommendations on how to change the culture of the league, which include investigating and holding coaches accountable, better vetting of hires, and advocating for players.

U.S. Soccer President Cindy Parlow Cone called the report findings “heartbreaking and deeply troubling.” Cone went on promise concrete changes to improve the league:

Cone said U.S. Soccer would immediately put at least three of the recommendations into action: create a new Office of Participant Safety in charge of policy and reporting mechanisms, begin publicly identifying those who have been punished for their conduct rather than concealing them, and establish background checks for all participants from youth soccer leagues on up.

“U.S. Soccer and the entire soccer community have to do better,” Cone said, “and I have faith that we can use this report and its recommendations as a critical turning point for every organization tasked with ensuring player safety. We have significant work to do, and we’re committed to doing that work and leading change across the entire soccer community.”

There is a separate investigation, commissioned by the league, being conducted by Covington & Burling. That investigation, led by partner Amanda Kramer, is ongoing.

For companies with disputes arising from contracts with foreign parties, international arbitration represents the best way of coming to a resolution on neutral grounds — and enforcing any subsequent awards. 

International arbitration, however, implicates a number of issues that don’t typically arise in traditional litigation, including questions such as:

- What’s the appropriate place of arbitration?  
- Under which rules should you arbitrate? 
- How many arbitrators should you have on your panel? 
- Which arbitrator should you choose for your party? 
- How can you make an arbitration proceeding more efficient?  
- How do you enforce an arbitration award?  
In a one-day PLI program, [International Arbitration 2022](https://www.pli.edu/programs/international-arbitration?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2), a panel of experts in international arbitration practice will address these questions and others, providing a thorough overview of the information you need to successfully navigate the international arbitration process.

Other critical topics that will be addressed include:

- Current issues in international arbitration
- The international arbitrator’s point of view
- Pitfalls to avoid with fact witnesses and experts 
- Practical tips for winning your cases
Successful international arbitration requires skills and preparation. If you handle any aspect of international arbitration or mediation for your clients, you’ll benefit from the insights of this experienced panel. [Register](https://www.pli.edu/programs/international-arbitration?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2) today.

# Am Law 50 Firm Offers Retroactive Pay For All, Plus Amazing Benefits For Lawyers Who Became Caretakers During Pandemic

Today is a great day in the world of Biglaw. Not only are year-end bonuses out, but other top firms that instituted salary cuts during the height of the coronavirus crisis are now promising to make their employees whole by offering retroactive back pay, just in time for the holiday season.

If you recall, Orrick — a firm that brought in $1,158,537,000 in 2019 gross revenue, placing in at No. 31 in the most recent Am Law 100 rankings — rolled back all of its austerity measures as of October 1, restoring pay and full-time schedules for all of its employees prospectively. Now, the firm will be making everyone whole for the period of April through September 30. (If you recall, these [“make whole” rewards](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/orrick-rolls-out-salary-cuts-paired-with-make-whole-cash-rewards/) were originally hours-based, for top contributors only.) This money will be reflected in everyone’s November 30 paychecks.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
On top of these retroactive salary reimbursements, Orrick is offering a special program for lawyers who have also worked as family caretakers (for children, elderly parents, or both) during the pandemic. Through the end of the first quarter of 2021, the firm will allow associates and of counsel to work an 80 percent schedule at full compensation for up to three months. “We understand that this does not solve the problem,” said [Mitch Zuklie](https://www.orrick.com/en/People/8/5/E/Mitchell-Zuklie), Orrick’s chairman and chief executive officer, “but we hope it provides some meaningful help, particularly as the coronavirus battle heads into a new phase across our country.” For working parents who are dealing with hybrid learning schedules at schools that have been opening and closing with the news of COVID positive cases on top of their billable hours, this is an incredibly welcome benefit. 

Last, but certainly not least, Orrick has committed to matching last year’s bonus scale — which is now [this year’s bonus scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/) — and will “take into consideration this year’s circumstances and market developments” (i.e., the appreciation bonuses that were offered by many firms earlier this fall).

We’re sure that everyone at Orrick is thankful that the firm is taking their mental health seriously during these unprecedented times. For many, the stress of a smaller paycheck coupled with unexpected caretaking responsibilities has been quite overwhelming, but at least they’re taking steps to do something positive about it.

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Orrick.)

# More Biglaw Firms Delay Openings, Lay Down Strong Vaccination Policies

As the country experiences an upswing in infections driven almost exclusively by the unvaccinated, law firms are taking a harder and harder line against vaccine holdouts.

Early in the process of office reopenings, firms were “encouraging” attorneys and staff to get the vaccine. At the time, firms relied upon the inherent professionalism of employees to do the right thing without wrapping the firm up in needless mandates. And this probably got the workforce almost all the way there!

But if we’ve learned two things over the last 18 months or so it’s that (1) “almost all the way” isn’t really how vaccines work best and (2) there are dolts in literally all educational strata who will screw up an invitation to do the right thing.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
So we’ve entered the era of mandated vaccination to return to work, up to and including policies that shut off identity card access to the buildings until workers can prove they’ve taken the absolutely bare minimum steps to protect their co-workers and their families.

And, of course, we’re seeing planned reopenings delayed. We have three new announcements along these lines today.

Paul Weiss informed the firm’s workforce via email today that due to the Delta variant, it will indefinitely postpone the planned “phase 2” office reopening from September 13. A new date will be announced roughly 30 days ahead of the ultimate reopening.

In the meantime, “all Paul, Weiss personnel and visitors will be required to be fully vaccinated to enter our U.S. offices” as of August 9 and anyone who has failed to provide proof of vaccination by that date will have card keys deactivated. Masks and distancing will remain in effect in all office common areas for the time being.

Simpson Thacher basically laid out the whole above history of firm responses to the vaccine in one paragraph:

In prior updates, we strongly encouraged everyone to receive a COVID-19 vaccination as soon as possible for their own safety and that of their colleagues and loved ones. Given the emergence of the more contagious
Delta variant and the resultant increase in COVID-19 cases across the country, we believe vaccination is an essential component of our efforts to create a safe working environment for all our employees. We understand that a high percentage of our attorneys and professional staff have already been fully vaccinated.

TL;DR We relied on people to get vaccines, most of you did, some of you didn’t, and this is why we can’t have nice things.

Starting Monday, everyone is required to be vaccinated to go back to the Simpson offices.

Over at Winston & Strawn, the firm announced that beginning today, it is “requiring all attorneys and staff to be fully vaccinated before coming into our offices, with the expectation that all individuals will be fully vaccinated no later than the end of September.” The firm is also offering up to 4 hours of paid time off to get the vaccine with additional time available in the event of adverse reactions.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
For those with legitimate reasons that they cannot get the vaccine, the firm urges them to speak with HR about a medical or religious accommodation. “Please note that you will be asked to engage in the interactive process to determine if a reasonable accommodation is required and will be asked for support for your request.” This of course can double as a quality control measure as anyone who cites “HIPPA” has no place working in a firm that deals with actual laws in the real world.

# The Top 100 A To Z Law Firms In America!

For years, the NLJ 500 (and before that, the NLJ 250) was the only game in town when it came to ranking the top law firms. Well, the Am Law 100 (and 200!) existed too, but the NLJ 500 was the only ranking that would tell you exactly how many lawyers the firm employed!

But as we explained yesterday, the National Law Journal [has some competition](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/dueling-rankings-of-the-biggest-biglaw-firms-in-the-country-2022/)!!! The Law360 400 (Law760?) ranks the largest U.S.-based law firms based on… exactly how many lawyers the firm employs.

With not one but two rankings based exclusively on counting, we at Above the Law felt the public demand for rankings still has room for more superfluous saturation. So without further ado, we present our latest ranking, the first annual Top 100 A to Z Law Firms:

Kudos to Thompson & Knight for [rocketing up this list](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/biglaw-firms-to-merge-miss-ultimate-in-branding-opportunity/) by a whopping 50 slots this year!

Now you might think our methodology merely involved taking the Am Law 100 and alphabetizing them, but you’d be wrong — we also put in the numbers.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In all seriousness, the NLJ 500 is a stupid ranking. [And we’ve said so for years](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/the-500-largest-law-firms/). An ultimately vapid exercise in rankings clickbait using the most superficial sorting mechanism available. Firm size does “matter” but only to the extent you feed that into a function to figure out revenue per lawyer. It’s like measuring a baseball player on total plate appearances without bothering to ask what happened next. On its own the ranking is just the easiest possible way to throw together a ranking. To see Law360 also in the ranking game and opt for the another “simple counting” approach is downright frustrating.

Rankings are hard work, but there’s a lot you can show the industry about itself applying a clever philosophy to a ranking. And then there’s also a lot you can show by applying a simplistic philosophy to a ranking and calling it a day.

# Biglaw Firm Still Paying The Price For Former Partner's Romantic Scandal
## Romance isn't dead, but it could cost your Biglaw firm $13 million.

The romance between David R. Jones and Elizabeth Freeman caused quite the stir in legal circles. The pairing is not per se noteworthy, but when a federal bankruptcy judge gets together with a bankruptcy partner of a major law firm and continues to hear cases involving that partner/law firm, well, that kind of ethical lapse will set tongues a-wagging. In the immediate aftermath of the romantic entanglement becoming public, [Judge Jones resigned ](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/the-wild-ethical-lapse-that-led-to-the-resignation-of-a-top-bankruptcy-judge/)his position on the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, ending the ethics inquiry that the Fifth Circuit opened on the judge. Freeman is no longer at Jackson Walker, but the firm is still dealing with the aftermath.

The firm received fees in 26 Chapter 11 cases in front of Jones that Freeman worked on. The firm — which says it didn’t know about Freeman’s relationship until 2021, at which time she was instructed not to bill to any matters before Jones — didn’t disclose the entanglement between the judge and their then-partner in those cases, putting $13 million in fees at risk.

As [reported by](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bankruptcy-law/jackson-walker-in-legal-hot-seat-following-judge-romance-scandal) Bloomberg Law, this could be very bad for the firm:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
But Jackson Walker and others in the coming months face more accusations that they harmed creditors and others involved in several cases overseen or mediated by Jones and that they jeopardized the integrity of the nation’s bankruptcy system by failing to adhere to legal disclosure requirements.

“I’m not sure the ball has stopped rolling yet,” said Northwestern Pritzker School of Law professor and former Nevada bankruptcy judge Bruce Markell. It all turns on “who knew what, when,” he said.

The lawsuits from creditors alleging they got a bum deal in front of Judge Jones are already rolling — in fact, it was one such [lawsuit that brought the relationship to light](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/01/scandal-ridden-former-federal-judge-seeks-to-squash-lawsuit-that-started-it-all/). Plus the Justice Department’s bankruptcy oversight program, US Trustee, has gotten involved, trying to restore faith in a system whose reputation has been badly damaged by the scandal.

It’s filed numerous bankruptcy court requests to disgorge fees that the firm earned in dozens of cases presided over by Jones from 2018 to 2022 while Freeman was an attorney at the firm. But the process is convoluted and remains in the early stages.

In some instances, trials are set. Judge Marvin Isgur of the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas in August will hear Jackson Walker fee disputes in the cases of Neiman Marcus, Seadrill Partners, and Strike LLC.

But many others remain in flux. The fact that several months have passed and it’s still undetermined which court will be handling certain matters “is most unfortunate for those who care about the public confidence in the bankruptcy process and the bankruptcy system,” said [Clifford White, former director of the US Trustee Program].

But trying to untangle this particular web has been particularly challenging. Some of the fees US Trustee is trying to disgorge are from cases that are closed — sometimes years ago. Confusing is an understatement.

The administrative burden of reviving bankruptcies that, in some cases, were long ago completed, has even caused confusion for Judge Christopher Lopez, who is tasked with overseeing some of the US Trustee’s fee disgorgement requests.

“I didn’t know these cases were closed,” Lopez said at a March 21 bankruptcy court hearing regarding a subset of the cases assigned to him months ago.

The truth is, we don’t even know what other ramifications are on the horizon for those wrapped up in the scandal. Nancy Rapoport, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas law professor, told Bloomberg, “We don’t even know the other shoes that are going to drop. Depending on what facts get found, there may be bar complaints, too.” There’s also the distinct possibility of a criminal referral stemming from this mess as well. So stay tuned for the next episode of As The Bankruptcy Court Turns.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Jamaican Me Crazy: Harvard Law Hottie Wins Jamaican Beauty Pageant

It looks like Wyclef Jean can’t run for president of Haiti. But elsewhere in the Caribbean, visitors from the mainland are being welcomed with open arms. A reader at [Harvard Law School](https://abovethelaw.com/harvard-law-school/) reports: “A member of the Class of 2010 was just crowned Miss Jamaica World 2010. Not sure if she had an offer or is deferred or what.”

(Although she’s a freakin’ beauty queen, note how the tipster immediately turned to discussion of her law firm employment status. Welcome to HLS!)

The news is true: [Chantal Raymond](http://worldshowbiz.info/beauty-contest/chantal-raymond-profile/), who graduated from Harvard Law a few months ago, is the new Miss Jamaica World. As noted in the [Jamaica Observer](http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/Harvard-Law-grad-cops-Miss-Jamaica-World_7896742), Raymond will represent the island nation at the Miss World competition later this year, in Sanya, China.

Yes, we know: pics or it didn’t happen.

We have the pictures. And yes, of course the pageant included a swimsuit competition….


We asked our HLS correspondent if he had any additional information about Chantal Raymond. He responded: “Very nice girl, went to UF [University of Florida] undergrad, not much else… Her contestant bio on that [website](http://www.missjamaicaworld.com/2010/?page_id=328) is funny, if you haven’t looked at it.”

Indeed it is. It [begins](http://www.missjamaicaworld.com/2010/?page_id=328):

Sponsor: Miss Geddes Refrigeration
Age: 24
Body Status: 34-26-36, weight 143 lbs, height 5 ft 9

[](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2010/08/Chantal-Raymond-headshot-2-Chantal-Alicia-Raymond.jpg)First, congratulations to Raymond on her earlier crown as “Miss Geddes Refrigeration.” Apparently this Harvard Law hottie is so sizzling that she needs to be sponsored by an [air conditioner servicing company](http://www.geddesrefrigeration.com/).

Second, we’re impressed by her “body status” — those are nice dimensions. To paraphrase [Sir Mix-A-Lot](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CBkQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lyricsondemand.com%2Fonehitwonders%2Fbabygotbacklyrics.html&ei=VvN1TKjfB4H6lwe3kZntCw&usg=AFQjCNGDhVDfm2hsaJgfU1fLy3DPVBP0dg&sig2=wAcHAeREer1qyEqRETE4tw), “34-26-36? Only if she’s 5-9.”

Back to the bio. After reciting her impressive academic credentials — HLS, which she graduated from at the tender age of 24, and UF, where she was awarded a whopping nine (9) academic scholarships — it goes on to note:

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Her desire in the near future is to be the CEO of a major International Corporation which has roots through Latin America and the Caribbean….

She is desirous of meeting Michelle Obama – a Harvard Law School Alumina class of 88. Chantal views the First Lady as an outstanding woman who has built a successful career promoting service and the advancement of youth, while supporting and nurturing her own loving family.

And she is desirous of Mrs. Obama’s killer biceps, too!

Perhaps Michelle Obama, a highly attractive and statuesque woman, should have participated in beauty contests back in her HLS days. For whatever reason, at least compared to women at other top law schools, Harvard Law females seem to excel in the looks department — and that’s not even counting [Elle Woods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_Woods).

Chantal Raymond is just the latest of several Harvard Law ladies with triumphs on the beauty pageant circuit. The one who enjoyed the greatest success as a beauty queen would probably be [Erika Harold](https://abovethelaw.com/2006/11/there-she-is-miss-ames-moot-court-finalist/), Miss America 2003. She graduated from HLS in 2007 and went on to work at Michelle Obama’s former firm, Sidley Ausitn (although what Harold is up to these days is [unclear](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erika_Harold)).

The one with the most impressive legal career, however, would be [Elizabeth Barchas Prelogar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Idaho_US), HLS class of 2008. Although she didn’t win the Miss America pageant — she had to settle for being Miss Idaho 2001 — Prelogar won an arguably more awesome award: a coveted [Supreme Court clerkship](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/08/supreme-court-clerk-hiring-watch-the-official-list/), with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

Actually, make that two Supreme Court clerkships. As we [previously reported](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/08/supreme-court-clerk-hiring-watch-justice-kagans-clerkslady-kaga-hires-a-seasoned-crew/), Prelogar was invited to stay on at One First Street, to serve as one of [Lady Kaga’s little monsters](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/08/supreme-court-clerk-hiring-watch-justice-kagans-clerkslady-kaga-hires-a-seasoned-crew/). We suspect that Prelogar’s Harvard Law degree, as well as her status as a highly attractive female, didn’t hurt her during her clerkship interview with Justice Kagan.

But we digress. Congratulations to Chantal Raymond, Miss Jamaica World 2010, and good luck in the Miss World contest in China!

If Raymond actually is a deferred associate, traveling the world as a beauty queen is a heck of a way to spend a year off. If you have information about what Raymond is up to professionally right now, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Chantal%20Raymond).

The promised swimsuit pictures appear below. For more images of the pulchritudinous young lawyer, check out the Facebook group [Chantal Raymond for Miss Jamaica World 2010](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Chantal-Raymond-for-Miss-Jamaica-World-2010/135767043121157). Fabulous!

Everyone knows that the holidays are a time of giving. The best gifts are those that feel like they were chosen with you in mind. Upon graduating high school, I was given a quilt that I still hold dear to my heart. One of my friends gave me a really cool set of personalized kitchen towels. That said, it is really hard to pick out the right gift for one person — let alone a whole firm’s worth of people. But you know what the second best thing is? Money!!

Alston & Bird just unwrapped a new bonus table that matches the Cravath/Davis Polk scales just in time for Christmas across all of its U.S. offices.

Maybe now you’ll be able to gift each member of the family with [FIVE GOLDEN RINGS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UHmQANFtNs) at the Christmas table. Or me. I know we aren’t that close but hey, ’tis the season.

We like hearing about bonuses and salaries almost as much as you enjoy spending them. As soon as your firm’s memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Salary & Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

Clifford the Big Raise Law Firm arrived on the scene this morning, delivering good news to its US associates. With over $2.5B in gross revenue and sitting at 13th on the G200, Clifford Chance will match the Cravath scale on all counts.

As a reminder, that puts the new associate salary schedule at:

Class	Bonus
Class of 2023	$225K
Class of 2022	$235K
Class of 2021	$260K
Class of 2020	$310K
Class of 2019	$365K
Class of 2018	$390K
Class of 2017	$420K
Class of 2016+	$435K
And bonuses will be issued at:

Class	Bonus
Class of 2023	$15K (pro-rated)
Class of 2022	$20K
Class of 2021	$30K
Class of 2020	$57.5K
Class of 2019	$75K
Class of 2018	$90K
Class of 2017	$105K
Class of 2016+	$115K
Associates won’t see these payouts until January 12, meaning the London-based firm will fittingly wait until after the holidays to start shedding some pounds.

# Biglaw's Parental Leave Backslide
## Parental leave and a bumbling Supreme Court highlight the week.

Are law firms going to get stingy with parental leave? While most firms report solid revenue, sparking resentment over a few weeks of leave seems like a weird strategy, but [DLA Piper recently cut back on the leave available to non-birthing parents](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/03/dla-piper-parental-leave/). It’s a first as far as Above the Law can tell, but will it be the last? Also, [the Supreme Court screwed up its metadata](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/03/supreme-court-accidentally-forgets-to-delete-basic-metadata-in-trump-ballot-ruling/), committing an error that would get junior associates fired. And finally, Joe Biden offered the Court some tough talk… [by quoting them](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/03/joe-biden-stares-down-supreme-court-as-he-quotes-dobbs-back-at-them/).

Yale just can’t keep out of the legal news. Over the last several months we’ve had high-profile fights with professors, a student club behaving badly, and now this.

Meanwhile, we have new rankings out featuring the best law school deals and the coolest Biglaw firms. Finally, conservatives have a plan to fix the Supreme Court and it’s… renaming the building.

# The Legal Mental Health Crisis Hits Home
## From the perspective of Career Services, the mental health crisis unfolding that has unfolded in the legal community is hard to ignore.

As I imagine is the case for many Above the Law readers, I subscribe to the twice daily email blasts from The American Lawyer.  I typically scan the headlines to see which firms will be next in the seemingly never-ending [merger craze](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/merger-mania-dominates-2018-in-the-legal-industry/) while also keeping up to date as to which firms are gaining, or losing, certain partners or practice groups — occasional emigration is normal, but if it becomes a regular feature it might portend something about the long-term health of the firm, a vital piece of information to pass along to students.  After a quick read, the email is sorted as part of my never ending quest to reach [Inbox Zero](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/ultimate-way-inbox-zero.html).



Monday’s ALM Afternoon Update was different.  Rarely does an email, let alone an ALM Update, stop me in my proverbial tracks, but “[Big Law Killed My Husband”: An Open Letter from a Sidley Partner Widow](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/11/12/big-law-killed-my-husband-an-open-letter-from-a-sidley-partners-widow/) did the trick.  I put down what I was doing and dove into Joanna Litt’s heart-wrenching account of how her husband Gabe MacConaill, a partner in the Los Angeles office of Sidley Austin, took his own life last month in the firm’s parking garage at the age of 42.  Unfortunately, stories of lawyers struggling with mental health issues, even to the point of suicide, [are all too common](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/deaths/).  But this story was different.  While my CSO job requires that I show no favoritism among employers, Sidley will always be special to me.  I spent my 2L summer split between two offices of the firm (neither of which was the LA office) and then briefly returned after my clerkship.  While my tenure at the firm was short and unremarkable, I still consider it “my” firm.  That’s why Litt’s piece had such an impact.  While I am quite familiar with the mental health crisis unfolding — or rather, that has unfolded — in the legal community, it has often seemed like other people’s’ problems.  Now the issue has somewhat come home and it’s hard to ignore.

What does this mean from the perspective of Career Services?  It has been my experience that many students at Vanderbilt, and probably most elite law schools, have a career default towards Biglaw — this default probably extends to students at nearly every law school, but the feasibility of getting on such a career path can be daunting for many.  The rationale for such a default is rather understandable considering that it is far easier to pay off student loan debt in the six figures with a $190,000 salary than it is with $50,000.  Even for those students without onerous student loans, that Biglaw salary is enticing once students, to paraphrase Leo McGarry, discover that they can [buy stuff with money](http://www.westwingtranscripts.com/search.php?flag=getTranscript&id=70).  Finances aside, the Biglaw path can be alluring to students due to the accelerated hiring timeline.  3L is a lot more enjoyable when you have a job waiting for you after graduation than when you do not.  Biglaw is appealing to those of us in CSO as well because it serves as a stable destination for students with that aforementioned accelerated timeline which allows us to focus more attention on the students who really need our help as well as 1Ls beginning to navigate the system.

The problem with such a default is thrown into sharp relief with Litt’s letter.  Working in Biglaw is very hard and can be extremely taxing on attorneys.  Not too long ago, I was meeting with a Vanderbilt student who was getting ready to head off into a Biglaw summer associate position in a major market and the student inquired if the typical hours for an attorney at the firm were in the range of 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.  I honestly contemplated resigning my CSO position for a moment because I had so fundamentally failed this student.

But while at least most law students anticipate long hours as a Biglaw associate, many believe that if they make it to partnership, the long days are replaced by frequent trips to the golf course and even larger paychecks.  While the latter might be true, Joanna Litt’s letter disproves the former.  Even though he was a partner, Gabe MacConaill was pouring his life into his work.  Litt describes her husband not sleeping and working weekends on a major bankruptcy matter to the point where a colleague noticed that MacConaill’s “sense of humor had been gone for a while.”

Why do attorneys stay in positions that are obviously having a deleterious effect on their health?  One line in particular from Litt’s letter stood out, “I told him we could sell our beautiful house and move to Mammoth, our happy place, and snowboard all winter and then figure it out” (emphasis added).  Golden handcuffs — economic incentives that keep individuals in jobs they might otherwise leave — are something that everyone in Biglaw will eventually have to grapple with, and as associate salaries continue to rise, that timeline moves closer and closer to one’s Biglaw start date.  Gabe MacConaill had seemingly used the economic fruits of his Sidley labor to purchase a gorgeous house.  Abandoning that residence and that lifestyle can be extraordinarily difficult, especially when it is no longer just you in the home.

Is all this to say that law students should run as far away from Biglaw, lest they develop serious mental health issues?  No.  Stories such as Gabe MacConaill’s are still the exception rather than the norm.  But those of us who work with law students must make sure that we are providing them with as full a description of Biglaw life as possible.  Allowing a student to default into a Biglaw position when it is clear that such a position could have damaging mental health effects is a disservice to both the student and even the Biglaw employer.

But more broadly, the legal industry needs to have an honest and thorough discussion about mental health in the profession.  I did not know Gabe MacConaill and the story of his suicide still shook me. I cannot imagine how I would react if I see the name of a deceased former Sidley colleague in the next American Lawyer update.

# Stop Using Phrases Like 'Good Fit' In Clerkship Hiring
## Too few organizations focus on diversifying clerkship applicants, even though the lack of diversity among clerks has enormous implications for diversity in the legal profession generally.

I wasn’t everyone’s idea of what a law clerk “should” look like. I was assertive, confident, and voiced my opinions in chambers. For that, I was [derided](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU03/20220317/114503/HHRG-117-JU03-20220317-SD005.pdf) by the judge for whom I clerked as “bossy,” “aggressive,” having “personality issues,” and making him “uncomfortable.” In addition to the more serious problems I encountered during my clerkship — bullying, gender discrimination, and harassment — I probably wasn’t a “good fit” with the quiet, contemplative, older male judge for whom I clerked. But like most clerkship applicants, I applied broadly — across the U.S. and across the political spectrum, to any judge I was willing to work for — and I accepted the first clerkship I was offered.

I wasn’t looking for a lifelong mentor. I clerked because I aspired to be a homicide prosecutor in the D.C. U.S. Attorney’s Office. There was an unspoken expectation that applicants should clerk. Clerking in the courthouse where I aspired to practice law seemed like the right strategic move.

Both judges and law schools [frame clerkship hiring](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/do-your-research-stick-it-out-and-other-things-law-schools-should-stop-telling-students-about-clerkships/) as a question of “fit.” Judges look for the right person to “fit in” with their small chambers, and perhaps a clerk who complements their existing “law clerk family.” Clerks and judges work long hours, in close quarters and stressful circumstances, in small and physically secluded work environments, with just a handful of colleagues: there is an unspoken “chambers culture.” Clerkship applicants — law students and new attorneys often desperate for this “gold star” on their resumes — endeavor to pitch themselves as the right “fit” for whichever judge they are interviewing with — no matter the judge’s political ideology, geographic location, or professional background. Too often, applicants conceal their personality and identity to conform to societal expectations of what a clerk should look like: someone deferential [who does not rock the boat](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/actually-your-reputation-isnt-everything/) or question the principal.

Who is a “good fit” in a small, hierarchical judicial chambers? Since the judiciary is still predominantly white and male, the “best fit” for a white male judge — especially as perceived by the white male Top 14 law school faculty members who help facilitate clerkship hiring for many judges — is probably a white male applicant. That’s who these older, white, male judges feel most “comfortable” with working long hours in close quarters — with whom they feel the most familial kinship. Because they’re hiring someone who looks like a member of their own family.

Law clerks are still overwhelmingly white and male: 79% of federal clerks and 72% of state court clerks in the 2019 graduating class [were white](https://www.nalp.org/0221research), even though white students represented just 67% of law school graduates that year. Too few organizations focus on diversifying clerkship applicants, even though the lack of diversity among clerks has enormous implications for diversity in the legal profession generally. Today’s law clerks are tomorrow’s prosecutors and public defenders, Biglaw associates and partners, law professors, and judges. The [pathway to the bench](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/clerkships-are-a-pipeline-to-the-bench-we-need-to-diversify-them) often starts with serving as a judicial law clerk.

The legal profession — including Biglaw — continues to [prioritize the hiring](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/elite-law-firm-will-offer-150000-in-clerkship-bonuses/) of former clerks, who are overwhelmingly white and male. Firms lament the lack of diversity among hires, yet they focus on the same old strategies, including diversity fellowships and on-campus recruiting, while failing to recognize that the best way to diversify the profession is to address the root cause: a lack in diversifying judicial clerkships.

The federal judiciary has no formal diversity initiatives. There is no oversight over individual judges’ hiring. Judges are not required to report any data on diversity (or lack thereof) among their clerks — although [legislation](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/judges-who-interpret-title-vii-should-themselves-be-subject-to-it/) introduced in the last Congress would require them to. And since the federal judiciary is not subject to anti-discrimination laws, if you’re a diverse clerk who is discriminated against or harassed because of your gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, age, or disability status, you have no legal recourse.

As[ recent research](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4290102) about diversifying appellate law clerk hiring highlighted, many judges are interested in hiring more diverse clerks. But to accomplish this, judges must expand their thinking about what a law clerk should look like. This means reaching beyond their standard criteria: [the top law schools](https://columbialawreview.org/content/some-are-more-equal-than-others-u-s-supreme-court-clerkships/), the top 10% of the class, and the profile of clerks they’ve hired before — white men.

This same research revealed that nonwhite judges do the majority of diverse hiring. Yet even female and nonwhite judges have prior assumptions about what a clerk should look like, based on who they’ve hired and who their colleagues hire. There is perhaps even more pressure on these diverse judges if they are the “first” in their court or their circuit to achieve a judgeship, to ensure they hire only the best applicants, based on these prior assumptions.

“Good fit” is a euphemism for discrimination in hiring, as it is used by law school clerkship directors, deans, and faculty members facilitating clerkships, and by judges considering applicants. To be clear, this is likely unintentional: those who use this framing do not realize how much of the applicant pool they exclude. For law schools, it’s a form of shorthand to help applicants narrow their judge lists and to help clerkship advisors facilitate clerkships. For judges, while many tell me they intentionally work to diversify their hiring, they may not have fully considered whether this necessitates adjusting their expectations of law clerk profiles in order to capture a broader pool of applicants.

Because a judicial chambers is particularly hierarchical, “good fit” is also a euphemism for someone who toes the line, does not rock the boat, and does not question the power structure. An assertive, outspoken woman like me? Probably not the best fit for most chambers.

Yet judicial clerkships are pathways to prestigious careers in academia, the government, Biglaw, and even a future judgeship. Many government job postings require one year of work experience — a euphemism for a clerkship requirement. Unfortunately, the characteristics that likely would have made me a strong homicide prosecutor — outspokenness, tenacity, assertiveness, confidence, and attention to detail — worked against me in my clerkship. While I imagine there are chambers where I would have fit in better, the aforementioned qualities are not the ones most judges look for in clerkship applicants right now. Yet foreclosing candidates who are not “good fits” — women, nonwhite applicants, first-generation, and disabled applicants, and anyone else who is an “other” — excludes large swaths of the legal profession from career advancement through clerkships, perpetuating the white, male status quo.

Too often, mistreatment is characterized as “poor fit” or a “personality conflict” between judge and clerk. This enables the judiciary to discount the scope of problematic behaviors in their ranks and empowers some clerkship advisors to continue sending applicants perceived as “good fits” (white, male applicants) to clerk for judges like the judge for whom I clerked.

Law schools and judges have relied for decades on the same strategies for clerkship advising and hiring. Specifically, relying on preconceived notions of what clerks should look like, not wanting to take any “risks” by advising or hiring outside standard methods. It’s time to admit the system does not work for most applicants. Both law schools and the judiciary must commit to achieving solutions. Clerkships are overwhelmingly homogeneous in part because reliance on “fit” over skill perpetuates what would otherwise be discriminatory hiring practices, were judges subject to any oversight in hiring.

Discussions about law clerks’ personalities as a gauge of fit have the effect of excluding large segments of the law school population. For assertive women like me, the double standard that plagues women throughout their legal careers — women must assert themselves to obtain opportunities typically reserved for men, but are perceived as “bossy” and “aggressive” when they do — begins by disadvantaging some female applicants in clerkship hiring.

Judges tell me that hiring law clerks is one of their most important responsibilities: they rely heavily on their clerks. Clerks — at the very beginning of their legal careers — have enormous responsibility for consequential decisions affecting litigants’ lives, livelihoods, and liberty. Judges only hire clerks once a year, sometimes very early in an applicant’s law school career. Yet I worry judges perceive their hiring as too consequential. Many attorneys could do clerkship work — writing, research, and some advising — given opportunity, training, and supervision, especially if law schools are willing to be honest with applicants about what the work entails and properly train students to prepare for their clerkships. Some applicants just need a chance.

I also speak with judges about clerks who “didn’t work out.” Judges view this as a substantial failing in their role as hiring manager and a significant disruption to their chambers when one clerk does not carry their weight. This fear cuts against implementing any changes to their hiring practices.

Judges should not drastically lower their standards for clerkship hiring. Yet the high-stakes nature of judicial research and writing may be overblown. Perhaps judges should rely slightly less on their clerks and slightly more on the expertise that got them appointed or elected in the first place. It’s also incumbent on both judges and clerks [to adjust](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/not-every-good-jurist-is-a-good-manager/) and try to make the professional relationship work.

I cannot think of any other legal job where hiring managers use “fit” as the primary criterion. Government employers and law firms are subject to more oversight and scrutiny over their hiring: in many workplaces, a conversation about an applicant’s “fit” would be flagged by the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion director, hiring manager, or human resources office. These workplaces, while they have not achieved parity, are at least making greater strides toward diversity than the judiciary.

Unlike most legal jobs, the judiciary is not subject to hiring regulations or oversight. It should be. In the meantime, heading into this year’s clerkship hiring cycle, judges must be mindful of the ways their preconceived notions and hiring practices effectively exclude many aspiring clerks — particularly historically marginalized groups — as well as the enormous power their hiring decisions will have over young attorneys’ future career success. Judges can help diversify the profession.

It’s time for the legal profession — including judges who hire clerks and law schools that facilitate clerkships — to expand their idea of what a law clerk should look like, especially if they insist on continuing to message judicial clerkships as necessary for career advancement. No longer relying on “fit” as the ultimate benchmark benefits clerks, considering both the outsized influence of clerkships on future career success and the significant swath of applicants this antiquated heuristic excludes. Let’s retire phrases like “good fit” — not just from our vocabulary, but from our hiring practices.

# Biglaw Attorneys Tend To Make Some Pretty Weird Arguments
## Is it to justify their high rates? Or is it it to convince a client that their firm is better than other shops?

As many people are aware, Biglaw firms typically charge insanely high rates for their services.  One of the reasons why Biglaw firms are paid so much is because clients can trust that attorneys at Biglaw firms will advance every argument that can be made on their behalf.  And it is true that most of the time, Biglaw attorneys are worth their fees, and clients can rest assured that their Biglaw attorneys are arguing the best points on behalf of their clients.

However, Biglaw attorneys also have a tendency to make pretty weird arguments from time to time.  One reason for this is since it can be hard for Biglaw firms to justify insanely high fees.  Biglaw attorneys sometimes also make unusual arguments in order to demonstrate to their clients that they are creative and are thinking of points that other firms might have overlooked.  However, in certain instances, [advancing weird arguments does not really serve the client’s interests, and is mostly a waste of time](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/balance-side-hustles-main-job/).

My time as a practicing attorney has shown me that a lawyer’s ability to achieve success for a client is mostly preordained by the facts of a case and the law that already exists on a legal matter.  Indeed, I have seen the crappiest solo practitioners beat the biggest and best law firms simply because the law and facts were on their side. There is, of course, some leeway in most matters, and many Biglaw firms “make their money” by advancing arguments regarding contested areas of the law and facts.  However, Biglaw firms overreach sometimes when trying to make up for issues with the law or facts of a case.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
As an attorney in Biglaw, I vividly remember two instances in which I was tasked with researching weird arguments that had almost no chance of succeeding.  Right after starting my Biglaw gig, the “brass” at my firm asked me to draft a memo arguing that a certain federal law preempted state law causes of action.  While researching this issue, I found that this federal law had existed for centuries, and no court since virtually the dawn of the Republic had ever found that this law preempted state causes of action.  Of course, it would have been great if this law did preempt other causes of action, since we felt that the claim based on this federal law was not viable.  However, we had little to stand on when making this argument.

Of course, [I did what any good Biglaw associate would do](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/extra-money-main-job/), and I made an argument for preemption that passed the “laugh test.” I went back to general principles underlying the law and made an extremely broad argument.  In the end, this argument was not successful, and it was a huge waste of time for us to spend resources researching this point.

Another time, I was tasked with making an argument that a certain law was subject to a statute of repose rather than a statute of limitations.  The only problem was that the law courts used when assigning a statute of limitations to the relevant law literally said “statute of limitations” in the text of the law!  Again, no court had ever held that the law in question was subject to a statute of repose rather than a statute of limitations.

We were trying to make this argument since the claim at issue would not stand if a statute of repose applied rather than a statute of limitations.  However, it was difficult to make this argument, and I had my work cut out for me when following my marching orders.

I once asked my boss why we made unusual arguments, and he told me two main reasons.  First, my bosses oftentimes liked to “shotgun” arguments in some legal papers in the hopes that one of a variety of points will compel a court to side in our favor.  The only problem with this theory is that courts typically like to resolve cases on the narrowest grounds possible.  I have been successful “shotgunning” and arguing that opposing counsel had not complied with technical procedures like a good-faith affidavit requirement.  However, I have never seen “shotgunning” work with arguments that would completely upset well-settled law surrounding an issue.

The other reason my Biglaw boss told me why we made unusual arguments was to preserve our points for appeal.  I completely understand this, and you oftentimes get more time and resources to think about an issue on appeal than you do at the trial level in certain circumstances.  Of course, if you don’t preserve an argument for appeal in your underlying papers, you might lose the ability to advance a given point on appeal.  However, it is still not worth it to preserve doomed arguments for appeal, and I never understood why resources were wasted for this purpose.

When I worked at smaller law firms, we usually did not make weird arguments.  We didn’t have the time to waste developing unusual points, and we did not need to prove anything to our clients.  However, Biglaw attorneys tend to make weird arguments, either to justify their high rates or convince a client that they are better than other shops.  Nevertheless, in most instances, [there is no reason to waste time and resources](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/stress-strategies/) developing doomed arguments in order to try and impress a client.

There comes a time in every lawyer’s life when they wish they could leave their firm because it feels like they’ve been there forever. [Barry Garfinkel](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/g/garfinkel-barry-h), a litigator who celebrated his 65th anniversary with Skadden less than two weeks ago, was at his firm forever, and he credited the firm with enriching his very long life.

Garfinkel, 93, passed away on August 29. He was Skadden’s oldest active attorney, and the ninth lawyer to be hired by the firm. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/skadden-his-blood-after-65-years-firm-barry-garfinkel-has-died-2021-08-31/) columnist Jenna Greene spoke to several Skadden partners about Garfinkel’s impact on the firm. “He really had Skadden in his blood,” partner John Gardiner, global head of Skadden’s international litigation and arbitration practice, said. Jay Kasner, Skadden’s securities litigation practice leader, referred to Garfinkel as “the embodiment of the history of the firm,” calling his passing “the end of an era.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Garfinkel was the last attorney at the firm to have known and worked with all five of the name partners at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. In the past, he served as the head of the firm’s litigation practice and led its international arbitration practice. “He never wanted to retire,” Gardiner said. In fact, Garfinkel was still working on a major case with Gardiner when he passed.

Fourteen of Skadden’s litigators published the following in a [New York Times obituary](https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/nytimes/name/barry-garfinkel-obituary?pid=199977157) for Garfinkel:

Personally, he was a mentor and friend to so many of us in the New York litigation group. Barry’s deep, baritone voice will continue to echo through the halls of Skadden as we endeavor to continue to uphold the ideals of the profession and the “upper margin work” that Barry personified in his 65 years at the firm.

At a dinner celebrating his 50th anniversary at the firm, Garfinkel said, “Fifty years, when you enjoy what you are doing, goes in a flash.”

# Top 10 Biglaw Brands In The U.S.
## Why not just ask the clients who they trust?

There are a lot of ways to measure the strength of a law firm. We receive annual reports on total revenue, profits per equity partner, revenue per lawyer… and after covering this industry for this long, I can run down the arguments for and against each metric. Every ranking has some merit, except of course [a rote listing of head count](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/the-500-largest-law-firms/).

But the most straightforward appraisal of a firm’s strength in the marketplace is just to ask clients who they trust. Thomson Reuters released a report this week “based on data compiled from a Sharplegal market research study of the global legal market across 55 countries with more than 2,000 senior in-house counsel, as well as 746 interviews conducted with senior legal buyers in the U.S.” to determine what Biglaw brands carry the most gravitas with the people who matter.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Are there problems with a survey of clients? Sure. It’s often a lagging indicator of a firm’s actual strength as clients cling to perceptions of past incarnations of the firm. Conversely, it can overreact to recent events and ding a firm for a high-profile partner defection or reward a firm for a one-off big-ticket deal. On the other hand, when it comes to bringing in business, perception may be more real than reality.

So here’s the top 10:

1. Kirkland & Ellis
2. Latham & Watkins
3. Jones Day
4. Skadden
5. DLA Piper
6. Morgan Lewis
7. Sidley
8. Gibson Dunn
9. Baker McKenzie
10. Hogan Lovells

No surprises that the firm known for shelling out the big bucks to corner the market on talent earns the top spot when it comes to trust. Jones Day, historically a winner in these sorts of rankings, tumbled from first place to third. This tracks an earlier Thomson Reuters-sponsored brand ranking that used a different methodology to rate global firms and [found Jones Day falling five spots](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/the-best-biglaw-firms-in-the-world-according-to-corporate-clients-2021/). Maybe Jones Day is proving that corporate America continues to have a short attention span when it comes to the whole “[firms laying the ground work for conspiracy theories culminating in deadly insurrections](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/yesterday-was-the-day-america-learned-what-weve-known-about-jones-day-all-along/)” thing.

There are a lot of Biglaw firms on this list (maybe the head count does matter?), but DLA Piper and Baker McKenzie making the top 10 is interesting as the two biggest firms in the country [per the NLJ 500](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/the-500-largest-law-firms-in-america-2020/) get a bad rap among snooty attorneys as just “big for big’s sake.” But as it turns out, their model has pushed them above many more storied whiteshoe firms when it comes to impressing clients.

There’s a lot more data in the full report, including an impressive jump for Faegre Drinker who jumped 22 spots from last year to land at 16th.

# BREAKING: Biglaw Bonus Season Comes Early (And No, It's Not Cravath!)
## WOW -- bonuses are here!

Bonus season has officially arrived — and it’s here SUPER early!

It’s actually a bit shocking that Biglaw bonus season is here so soon. This is actually the third earliest time that Biglaw bonuses have been announced since 2006. But what comes as an even bigger shocker is the fact that Cravath was not the firm to make the first move on year-end bonuses.

Which firm is kicking off bonus season early this year?

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
This is a nice little Veterans Day gift from … Baker McKenzie. Wow! Even though Baker is the fourth highest-grossing firm in the country with $2.92 billion in revenue in 2019, this is very unexpected behavior. The global firm shocked its associates this morning by announcing this year’s bonuses for its U.S. associates.

So, let’s get into the details. What do the bonuses look like this year?

Class	Bonus
2019	$15,000
2018	$25,000
2017	$50,000
2016	$65,000
2015	$80,000
2014	$90,000
2013	$100,000
2012 and more senior	$100,000
This is the same exact bonus scale that’s been making the Biglaw rounds for years (just as [80 percent](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/biglaw-bonus-season-is-here-but-which-firm-will-make-the-first-move/) of our readers predicted it would be). But who can really complain about getting this much cash during a pandemic? We’ll get to that later.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
When announcing its bonus scale, Baker McKenzie not only promised to match any increases in the market should they occur, but the firm also noted that its [salary reductions](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/baker-mckenzie-salary-cuts/) (which took effect on May 1) would end on November 30, 2020, one month earlier than previously planned. On top of all of that good news, the firm will additionally reward top performers during the coronavirus crisis whose practices were impacted by the economic downturn, plus others who “demonstrat[ed] exemplary performance.” We don’t know what those additional monetary rewards look like yet.

(It should be noted, however, that Baker McKenzie did not hand out appreciation bonuses to its associates earlier this fall, and has not committed to offering them at this time, either. [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/) set the standard on those bonuses, which ranged from $7,500 to $40,000. That said, Baker McKenzie is technically already offering below-market bonuses. Given that the market increased before the firm even announced its year-end bonuses, will it still make the match? This is a firm that recently [conducted attorney layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/baker-mckenzie-layoffs/), after all, so suppose we’ll have to wait and see. As we mentioned just yesterday, this year, there will be [different tiers set for compensation](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/biglaw-bonus-season-is-here-but-which-firm-will-make-the-first-move/) if not all firms offer additional bonus dollars to their associates on top of their standard bonuses to truly match the market. We just didn’t think it would happen this soon.)

When announcing this year’s bonuses, Colin Murray, Baker McKenzie’s North America Chief Executive Officer, said, “The firm would like to express our sincere appreciation for our associates’ hard work on behalf of clients and also for navigating the many personal and professional challenges brought on by COVID-19.”

Congratulations to everyone at the firm, and congratulations to all other associates who may be receiving bonus news sooner than expected this year.

Earlier this month, in partnership with our friends at [Lake Whillans](https://lakewhillans.com/), we released our [2023 Outside Counsel rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/top-outside-counsel-rankings-2023/), an annual look at the Biglaw firms most trusted by corporate legal departments. Today, we focus on the law firms rated highest by in-house counsel based on the industries in which they work.

# Biglaw Business Development: 7 Tips From Top Rainmakers
## Prominent partners from five top law firms share the secrets of their success.

In a [challenging environment](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/2018-looks-like-another-year-of-blah-for-the-legal-industry/) for large law firms, where overall demand for Biglaw legal services is [flat or declining](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/why-these-global-100-numbers-should-scare-the-bejeezus-out-of-you), business development matters more than ever. Last week, I shared with you [five business-development insights from chief marketing officers](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/biglaw-business-development-5-insights-from-chief-marketing-officers/), courtesy of [All Star Business Development for Lawyers (2018)](https://www.pli.edu/Content/Seminar/All_Star_Business_Development_for_Lawyers/_/N-4kZ1z0zxnc?fromsearch=false&ID=323958&t=BCV8_9AFAC), a superb program recently hosted by the Practising Law Institute (PLI) and organized by [Deborah Brightman Farone](https://www.deborahfarone.com/biography) and [Katherine D’Urso](https://www.pli.edu/Content/Faculty/Katherine_DUrso/_/N-4oZ1z0zxm5?t=BCV8_9AFAC&ID=PE916684) (former [CMO of Cravath](http://www.lawdragon.com/2017/09/05/legal-consultant-limelight-deborah-farone/) and current chief client development officer at WilmerHale, respectively).

One of the CMOs on the panel stressed the importance of getting buy-in from lawyers for marketing efforts — and lamented the fact that some CMOs [can’t get no respect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwu-6GxBHN4) from the lawyers at their firms. This CMO recounted a conversation he had with a senior partner at a prior firm, who told him, “I don’t even know why you’re here; I built my entire career without you.”

It’s an unfortunate reality that, thanks to what [Ron Friedmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronfriedmann/) has aptly labeled the [“Biglaw caste system,”](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/alt-legal-the-biglaw-caste-system-an-impediment-to-innovation/) practicing lawyers often feel they have nothing to learn from other professionals at their firms, like CMOs. But these lawyers should respect and follow advice from fellow lawyers — especially if those lawyers are some of Biglaw’s biggest and best rainmakers, right?

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The final panel at the PLI program, “Hitting Home Runs: The Rainmakers Speak,” featured just that — a panel of partners who have generated millions of dollars in business for their firms, year after year:

- [Brad Karp](https://www.paulweiss.com/professionals/partners-and-counsel/brad-s-karp) (moderator), chair of Paul, Weiss since 2008;
- [Candace K. Beinecke](https://www.hugheshubbard.com/attorneys/candace-beinecke), senior partner and former chair of Hughes Hubbard & Reed (where she became the [first woman to lead a major New York law firm](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/02/nyregion/public-lives-charm-at-the-top-it-only-looks-easy-folks.html), in 1999);
- [Adam O. Emmerich](http://www.wlrk.com/AOEmmerich/), powerhouse M&A attorney and longtime partner at Wachtell Lipton;
- [Ralph C. Ferrara](http://www.proskauer.com/professionals/ralph-ferrara/), partner at Proskauer and securities lawyer extraordinaire (former general counsel of the Securities and Exchange Commission); and
- [Jeffrey S. Klein](https://www.weil.com/people/jeffrey-klein), leading sports lawyer and head of the employment litigation group at Weil Gotshal.
The panel, expertly moderated by Brad Karp, felt like a delightful dinner party conversation — lively, entertaining, and marked at times by disagreement. I distilled the discussion down to seven key points.

1. Shape your business development efforts to reflect your personal style.

As Karp noted at the outset, business development is an art and not a science — and so, just like a great artist, a great rainmaker will have her own distinctive style.

Take Candace Beinecke. As she once told the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/02/nyregion/public-lives-charm-at-the-top-it-only-looks-easy-folks.html) (and reiterated at the panel), “Don’t wear someone else’s clothes if they don’t fit. I tried on several when I was starting out. I looked at big, brash, bullying types and tried yelling and screaming…. I had no idea what I was doing.”

But now she knows exactly what she’s doing — and has discovered that extroversion and empathy are hallmarks of her own style.

“I love people and thinking about their issues,” Beinecke said. “Clients know I go to bed in the evening and wake up in the morning thinking about their problems.”

2. The best business development tool is a happy client.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Over the years, Beinecke’s satisfied clients have garnered her so many more clients. Happy clients can be excellent ambassadors for you and your firm — so don’t be afraid to enlist their help in your business-development efforts, she said.

Adam Emmerich echoed these sentiments: “Happy clients remember and tell their friends. Conversely, the worst thing to have is an unhappy client.”

How do you make (and keep) clients happy, and avoid making them unhappy? Make the client look good — and avoid making the client look bad.

Sounds simple, right? But it’s actually more complicated than it might seem.

First, you need to figure out who is “the client.” Nowadays, thanks to what former GE general counsel Ben W. Heineman Jr. has identified as [The Inside Counsel Revolution](http://amzn.to/1WtlRxm) (affiliate link), the general counsel is a more powerful figure than ever at many companies — and this GC will often intermediate the relationship between C-suite executives and outside counsel (as opposed to outside counsel having a direct relationship with the CEO, which used to be much more common).

Brad Karp shared a cautionary tale. After his firm won a huge victory for a client, an excited partner shared the good news directly with the CEO and board of directors — who then notified the general counsel of the win. The GC was presumably not thrilled with this chain of communication — and did not retain the firm for future matters.

Second, you need to manage expectations. For example, don’t make the common mistake of overpromising during a pitch, in an effort to land the business; the client will be especially unhappy when you don’t achieve the promised result. As Karp put it, “Better to lose a pitch than to win a pitch on false pretenses.”

The need to manage expectations continues into the client relationship. Candace Beinecke described a situation where her firm, at around the same time, (a) lost an $8 million litigation and (b) won motions in a class-action case that reduced the company’s potential exposure from $4 billion to $100 million. Taken together, those were great results — but the problem was that the head of the business unit inside the client on the $8 million case didn’t feel that he had been warned adequately about the chance of the loss.

“What did I hear more about from the client? The $4 billion win, or the $8 million loss that nobody was prepared for?”

3. Take a broad view of the attorney-client relationship.

What keeps clients happy? Yes, they want great results — wins in litigation, successful transactions on the corporate side — but the lawyer-client relationship involves so much more.

“I’ll help my clients with anything,” Beinecke said. This might involve helping a general counsel find a certain medical specialist, or helping the CEO’s kid into a selective school. She recalled handling one such request for a client and having an associate complain to her, “This isn’t legal advice!” Her response, delivered from the other side of her partner’s desk: “This is why I’m here — and how you could get here.”

The panelists had an interesting disagreement on whether the lawyer should see herself as the client’s “friend.” Adam Emmerich took the “no” position, emphasizing the importance of results: “You’re not their friend, you’re their lawyer.” (This might not be shocking coming from a partner at Wachtell Lipton, which probably has more one-off clients than a typical Biglaw firm — e.g., a company hiring Wachtell as it sells itself out of existence.)

Jeff Klein of Weil disagreed: “I do think clients want to like their lawyers.” Toward that end, he spends significant time bonding with his clients — even if it means “going to sporting events for teams I don’t like.”

(For the record, Adam Emmerich is all in favor of lawyer-client friendships. As he pointed out, being someone’s lawyer “means having their back and getting the job done, whatever the obstacles, whatever is required. You’re there to be of service. And succeeding in that -– particularly in the tough, important matters that we all strive to be a part of — will surely result in a friend for life.”)

4. Think about how to respond to the erosion of relationships.

Ralph Ferrara seemed to come down closer to Adam Emmerich’s side of the “lawyer/friend” debate. In Ferrara’s view, “The world has changed — and relationships don’t mean as much as they did 25 years ago.”

Instead, business development is more transactional. According to Ferrara, “Clients want to know — what’s the last case you had just like mine, and what was the result?”

How are Ferrara and his colleagues at Proskauer responding to this new reality? They are harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and using AI-driven tools and techniques to alert them to financial, economic, and other conditions within a company that could give rise to litigation. This allows them to proactively reach out to companies and offer their services — even before any lawsuit has been filed.

When it comes to the world of Biglaw, according to Ferrara, “we are way behind in the use of Big Data.”

5. Look for opportunities arising out of greater fluidity in the market for legal talent.

Why do clients today have a more transactional mindset? As noted by Adam Emmerich, it’s not necessarily a decline in personal loyalty; instead, it flows from several long-term trends, including more lateral movement of partners within Biglaw, more lateral movement of in-house lawyers, and changes in the nature of what corporate legal departments do.

These trends create opportunities as well as challenges, according to Emmerich and Karp. For example, if a general counsel you’ve done great work for moves to a new company, then you might be tapped for business by that GC. In this environment, it’s no longer the case that the GC will send all of the company’s business to a single firm that has historically served as outside counsel.

6. It’s all about teamwork.

Candace Beinecke told the story of how her firm successfully landed a new client. The client had a new general counsel, and this GC scheduled “meet and greets” with several firms he was thinking about retaining. Beinecke and some of her Hughes Hubbard colleagues met with the prospective client, had a wonderful meeting, and later learned that the client would be hiring them.

Good rainmakers should constantly be asking clients what their firms did right (and wrong), and Beinecke did that here. The client said he was impressed by the collegiality and teamwork that the Hughes Hubbard lawyers displayed during the initial meeting. In contrast, for the team from one unsuccessful firm, a single senior partner did almost all of the talking — and kept interrupting his colleagues whenever they tried to enter the discussion.

Firm culture and compensation systems can enhance — or stymie — teamwork. The panelists from firms with [lockstep (or fairly close to lockstep) compensation schemes](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/09/biglaw-its-not-all-about-the-benjamins/) emphasized how under their systems, partners have strong incentives to work together, help each other, and cross-refer work.

In contrast, firms with more “eat what you kill” comp systems will often see partners hoarding clients and fighting with each other for “origination credit.” At these firms, quipped Karp, “There are elbow sharpeners on every floor.” Ferrara responded that if bounties are to be paid, they should be paid to partners who introduce their clients to the practices of others in their firm. Reward the gracious, not the pernicious.

Another key aspect of teamwork is grooming future team leaders — in other words, mentorship. The panelists gave shout-outs to several of their mentors, including such prominent figures as Ira Millstein, for Jeff Klein, and Judge Simon Rifkind and Arthur Liman, for Brad Karp. (Judge Rifkind gave Karp this invaluable piece of advice: “Use the word ‘we’ when talking to your client — it makes clients feel that their problems are your problems.”)

Mentorship must be organic and not forced, according to Karp. He mentors junior colleagues by including them in as many client interactions as possible, modeling good behavior during those meetings and calls, and explaining why he did what he did afterwards.

Ralph Ferrara offered a refreshingly candid take on mentoring. Mentoring isn’t about heart-to-heart conversations over long lunches; instead, it’s about “telling your people that they need to develop a core competency, become an expert in some area of law, and display their talents in the media — by publishing, publishing, publishing.”

In this day and age, when a general counsel is staffing her matters, she seeks expertise and results. Relationships matter, but maybe not quite as much as they once did.

7. Don’t be afraid to say no to work.

This was one of the most interesting (and surprising) takeaways from a panel on business development. Sometimes the best thing for a rainmaker to do is to turn down work.

Yes, you want to help your clients with as many of their legal problems as possible. And yes, you want to cross-refer work to your colleagues, generating more business for your firm and expanding the overall client relationship.

But the interests of the client must always come first — and sometimes this means declining work.

Jeff Klein recalled pitching a colleague to a client for a high-stakes matter involving the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), a statute with notoriously large exposure for companies. The client said to him, “You say you’re sure this person can handle my case. Are you $20 million sure?”

“Clients appreciate it when you tell them that they would be better off with another firm for a certain type of case,” Brad Karp said. “The credibility you gain from saying that is often worth more than the value of the matter you just declined.”

At the end of the day, credibility is crucial — wisdom that it sometimes takes lawyers years to realize.

“I loved law school,” Adam Emmerich said. “I haven’t had three happier years since.” (This led Jeff Klein to quip, “I went to the wrong law school.” For the record, Emmerich went to U. Chicago and Klein went to Columbia.)

“But life is not law school,” Emmerich continued. “Law school involves getting a task, doing it well, getting the next task, and doing it well. But the real world is about so much more — relationships, character, and thinking about things from another person’s perspective.”

Relationships, character, and empathy — a recipe for success not just in law, but in life.

# Fox News Parts Ways With Lawyer After Coughing Up $787 Million And Counting
## Honestly, what took so long?

Viet Dinh is stepping down as Fox’s Chief Legal and Policy Officer, the post he’s held since 2018, presumably to take a position where he’ll cost a client less than the better part of a billion dollars.

In the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, Fox News hosts provided an open platform for wingnuts claiming Dominion, a voting machine manufacturer, tainted the results. Dominion lodged a $1.3 billion lawsuit that ended [with Fox forking over $787 million](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/it-was-a-game-of-chicken-and-fox-blinked/) to avoid trial. Another voting machine company, Smartmatic, still has a lawsuit pending.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Dinh supporters would argue that a GC shouldn’t be saddled with responsibility for that total because he reportedly advised holding the line on the Dominion suit. The theory, according to these accounts, rested on the conservative super-majority on the Supreme Court shrugging off defamation law to protect Fox in the long-run. Not sure how that would have meshed with the far-right wing of the Court’s [holy war against NY Times v. Sullivan](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/justice-thomas-wants-the-court-to-reconsider-its-first-amendment-jurisprudence/), but Fox must have hoped for a dash of homefield officiating.

But even this rose-colored counterfactual wouldn’t absolve Dinh of responsibility for landing Fox in this predicament.

Where was legal when Fox hosts were handing over the network to lying conspiracy nuts [tying a Canadian election machine company to dead South American dictators](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/fox-claims-it-had-to-report-mindblowinglynuts-kraken-lies-about-dominion-for-news-value/)? It’s certainly not the legal department’s job to pre-clear every guest for every show, but this went on for weeks. The network didn’t get around to [banning Rudy Giuliani until September 2021](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/fox-news-bans-rudy-giuliani-after-he-couldnt-stop-digging-deeper-potential-defamation-hole/). After the first couple of problematic interviews in late 2020, someone should’ve sauntered down to the studio to remind Tucker Carlson of the legal ramifications these interviews could have for the network.

And yet Carlson, who the network didn’t kick to the curb until a few months ago, and the network’s other prime-time hosts [felt sufficiently emboldened to complain to each other](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/latest-dominion-doc-dump-shows-big-mens-rea-energy-at-fox/) that Fox’s news division was messing with their audience by reporting the reality of the election and undercutting the prime-time shows’ continued trafficking in conspiracies. That reflects a culture of disregard for legal obligations that law departments are expected to stamp out long before it puts a company in jeopardy. Instead, the hosts were coddled by the company as short-term cash cows without regard to the long-term damage they might cause.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Once the lawsuits over election lies started and Dinh supposedly pushed the shoot-the-moon strategy to take the case to the Supreme Court — a plan that would cost millions upon millions even if the network won — how was legal oblivious to the risks of discovery? Did they just assume no one put any of this stuff in writing? Because the decision to push this case to the cusp of trial resulted in all of Fox’s dirty laundry getting aired. Up to and including the fact that the company [failed to disclose that Rupert Murdoch held a position with Fox News](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/fox-news-gets-its-ass-kicked-in-court-before-dominion-defamation-trial-even-starts/) while trying to argue that Fox Corp. had no potential liability in the case because Murdoch had no role with Fox News.

Why wasn’t legal on top of that?!?!? Do they not have an org chart over there?

Every instance where a company would hope for an in-house legal team to slam the brakes, the Fox team hit the throttle and let go of the wheel. The production teams behind these shows should’ve known the rules, someone should’ve stopped those teams when it became clear that they didn’t, and once everything went to hell the first and only priority should’ve been settling the case quickly and quietly.

So, no, Dinh wasn’t the one who cost Fox all this money. But he is the one charged with preventing all this. And that didn’t really work out.

Hmm... we'll just wait right here until those firings don't happen. *insert Jeopardy music here* [[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/marc-short-says-trump-has-no-intention-of-firing-rosenstein-mueller/)] * ""[T]here is no human being, on the planet, with more knowledge about federal criminal law than Michael Dreeben, and no one with more expertise than him."" Meet Michael Dreeben, special counsel Robert Mueller's Supreme Court closer. He's argued more than 100 SCOTUS cases, and is a force to be reckoned with. [ABC News] * Hiring for the law school class of 2017 is ""up,"" with 75.3 percent of graduates employed in full-time, long-term jobs that require law degrees or are considered “JD advantage” positions -- but you probably shouldn't get too excited about that. The only reason the percentage of those employed is higher this year is because the class was 6 percent smaller. In reality, entry-level hiring has decreased. [[ABA Journal](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/fewer_entry-level_positions_in_most_job_categories_for_2017_law_grads_new_a)] * Which Biglaw firm did Wells Fargo turn to ahead of being hit with record fines that turned into a $1B settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency? That would be Sullivan & Cromwell, which ""always [tries] to play absolutely straight with the regulators."" [[American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/04/20/wells-fargo-turned-to-sullivan-cromwell-ahead-of-1b-consumer-settlement/)] * Riley Safer, a spinoff of Schiff Hardin, just elected its first managing partner, and she may be the first black woman to lead a national law firm.

# No Jail Time For Convicted Dewey CFO
## After years and buckets of cash spent on these prosecutions... there's still no one in jail.

Joel Sanders, the former CFO of star-crossed firm Dewey & LeBoeuf, received some welcome news this morning when he was sentenced to a million dollar fine and 750 hours of community service, rather than the maximum jail sentence sought by the DA’s office.

While not as high profile to non-lawyer observers, it marks yet another unfortunate headline for the Manhattan District Attorney, who faced considerable flack last week when details surfaced over his handling of a [criminal investigation of Ivanka and Don Jr.](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/ivanka-and-don-jr-avoided-indictment-the-old-fashioned-way-by-being-rich/)

Have we finally, mercifully, come to the end of the stories about the collapse of Dewey? More importantly, have we finally killed off the bad “Dewey” puns this publication has peddled since this start of this? Now that the DA’s spent years and buckets of cash trying unsuccessfully to land someone — anyone — from the firm behind bars, can we finally put this firm to bed?

# The Billion-Dollar Biglaw Firms That Have NOT Raised Associate Salaries
## These firms have the money -- they just haven't decided to spend it on associates yet.

[Milbank has set the Biglaw world on its ear](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) by unexpectedly raising the base associate salary to $190K for first-years, with corresponding $10,000-$15,000 raises up the associate ladder. Unlike the last salary bump in 2016, [firms are taking their sweet time](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/are-you-there-cravath-its-me-milbank/) deciding if associates deserve a raise. The line between the haves and have-nots in the Biglaw world keeps on growing, but, [despite expectations,](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/who-will-match-the-milbank-raise/) even the haves haven’t matched the new market scale yet.

So which are the firms dragging their feet on compensation decisions?

There are 31 firms that have the revenue to bump salaries — they each are pulling down [more than a billion (yes, with a B) in gross revenue](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/04/24/the-2018-am-law-100-ranked-by-gross-revenue/). But, despite these impressive numbers, exactly none of them have decided to match Milbank’s ([frankly modest](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/why-the-milbank-raise-is-not-that-big-of-a-deal-and-why-it-is/)) associate raises. At least, not yet.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
So, let’s take a look at the firms (and their gross revenue numbers) making the really big bucks that haven’t moved on associate raises:

Kirkland $3,165,000,000
Latham $3,063,992,000
Baker McKenzie $2,670,000,000
DLA $2,634,094,000
Skadden $2,582,325,000
Sidley $2,036,161,000
Hogan Lovells $2,036,000,000
Morgan Lewis $2,001,000,000
Jones Day $1,959,360,000
Norton Rose $1,958,000,000
White & Case $1,804,200,000
Gibson Dunn $1,642,585,000
Ropes & Gray $1,597,091,000
Greenberg Traurig $1,477,180,000
Sullivan & Cromwell $1,400,790,000
Weil $1,390,901,000
Simpson Thacher $1,375,662,000
Mayer Brown $1,313,000,000
Paul Weiss $1,301,773,000
Davis Polk $1,240,000,000
Quinn Emanuel $1,229,807,000
Cleary Gottlieb $1,214,044,000
King & Spalding $1,138,540,000
Wilmer $1,137,300,000
Reed Smith $1,119,239,000
Paul Hastings $1,118,100,000
Cooley $1,072,079,000
Morrison & Foerster $1,062,700,000
Akin Gump $1,039,656,000
Goodwin Procter $1,032,437,000
Squire Patton $1,000,044,000

(Update: Around 1:03 p.m. on June 6th, [Simpson Thacher announced they were matching the new Milbank scale PLUS giving associates a special summer bonus.](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/))

Not convinced that gross revenue is a fair metric to determine which firms should be in a position to raise salaries? Maybe you think they’re highly leveraged, fine — let’s look at the top 25 most profitable law firms. This list, [pulled from Am Law 2018 data](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/04/24/the-2018-am-law-100-profitability-index/) (based on 2017 results), ranks the firms by their profitability index. You’ll see there’s a lot of overlap with the Billion-Dollar Club, but only one firm on the list — the market-setting Milbank — has raised associate salaries. (The other two Biglaw firms to increase salaries fall just out of the top 25 — [Proskauer](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/the-first-biglaw-firm-to-match-the-new-associate-raises/) is 35 and [Winston & Strawn](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/let-the-salary-wars-commence-another-biglaw-firm-has-matched-the-190k-scale/) is 39.)

# Biglaw Strikes Back: The Rich Firms Get Richer This Quarter
## Maybe these raises are helping out some firms.

The Citi Private Bank Law Firm Group’s [latest report](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202772350159/Citi-Report-ThirdQuarter-Growth-Slowed?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=5&curpage=ALL) digests some of the fallout of the mid-year associate salary extravaganza, and while the full impact of that wild time won’t be clear for some time to come, the early indications are that expenses are up, revenue is also up, and Biglaw is distancing itself from other firms.

Revenue grew 3.7 percent at the nine-month point. Billing rate increases of 3.2 percent remain the primary driver of revenue growth as demand (i.e., all timekeeper hours) rose a modest 0.3 percent and the collection cycle shortened by just 0.6 percent.

Expense growth accelerated from 3.1 percent at the six-month point to 3.4 percent for the first nine months. Increased associate compensation helped drive lawyer compensation expense up 4.1 percent, compared to 3 percent at the six-month point.

The analysts behind the report are sticking to their projection of low-single-digit profit growth for the industry.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
But the most interesting observation was just how much the rich are getting richer this quarter, even though they were the ones most likely to have joined the associate spending spree:

Grouping the firms based on Am Law 200 rankings, Am Law 1-50 firms saw both the greatest revenue growth (5.4 percent) and expense growth (4.3 percent). This was the only segment to see revenue growth outpace expense growth. Rate growth and a shortened collection cycle were primary drivers, as was the 0.8 percent growth in lawyer demand. Further good news for this segment is that, even with strong collections, they accumulated inventory at a pace that exceeded the rest of the industry, positioning them for a strong end to 2016.

Now that’s just revenue and expense growth, so it doesn’t mean the next tier of firms aren’t still profitable, but with the Am Law 51-100 firms only boosting revenue by 2.2 percent and the Second 100 firms only increasing revenue a whopping 0.1 percent, it appears as though the top dogs are on a better trend line.

So much for all the clients saying they’ll back away from the top firms if associate salaries went up, because the report also suggests that the industry saw around a 3.2 percent increase in billing rates.

# Is Litigation In 'Secular Decline'?
## And is it a good idea to emphasize corporate work and de-emphasize litigation today?

Stock analysts talk about a security being in “secular decline.” This is when long-term trends doom an entire business model. The advent of the automobile, for example, put the buggy whip business into secular decline.

I recently had lunch with a litigation partner at a big international firm, and he opined that litigation is in secular decline. The litigation business is not just temporarily slow, he said, but is permanently depressed and will never recover. This sad fellow noted that he was glad he’d be retiring in a few years, because it would be awfully hard to create a decent career as a litigator if you were just now graduating from law school.

This startled me. I hear from lots of [glum partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/12/inside-straight-a-partners-lament/), but rarely from successful, rich guys convinced that the world is crashing down around them. Not only that — if this guy was right, then he’d surely (inadvertently) written a blog post for me. Is it possible that litigation is in secular decline?

Nah.

Look: The economy busted in 2007 and 2008, and the resulting financial crisis triggered some lawsuits. That fed litigators for a while. (The crisis starved corporate lawyers, but that’s another story.) Financial crisis litigation has now worked its way through the judicial system, and the big New York firms are surely feeling the result of that. But that doesn’t mean that litigation has died; it means only that litigation has its ups and downs, as do all fields.

Moreover, there were countervailing trends growing out of the financial crisis. Beyond the financial field, the great recession did have an effect. Companies were worried during the recession, and they wouldn’t easily spend a few million bucks litigating in the hope of recovering a few tens of millions. My sense is that we thus saw less of some types of complex litigation in 2009 and 2010, because companies were nervous about footing the bill. That restraint on litigation has recently eased somewhat; companies aren’t suing with abandon, but they’re more willing to spend some dough.

I think my lunch buddy’s mood was influenced by something else: Today, private equity and public M&A lawyers are commanding insanely high rates. Litigators, not so much. There are a very few firms, blessed both with great corporate and with great litigation practices, that are now intentionally choosing to emphasize deal work. Deal work pays higher rates; if a firm does proportionately more deal work than litigation work, the firm is recovering a higher average rate and is more profitable. If you’re a litigator at one of those firms, it feels as though litigation is dying. But litigation is not dying; litigation at your firm in particular is suffering because of a choice that management is making.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Is it a good idea to emphasize corporate work and de-emphasize litigation today?

It depends.

First, for virtually all lawyers, there’s no reason to ask this question; you don’t have a choice. You do the work that comes in the door (and can be handled within your firm’s cost structure); you don’t pick and choose the most profitable stuff. If you’re choosing between doing private equity deals and complex litigation, you’re breathing very rarefied air.

Second, even if you have the choice, I’d bet that private equity and public M&A work are only temporarily booming. Eventually, the economy will slow down, deals will stop, and the corporate guys will have nothing to do. When that happens, firms that maintained robust litigation practices will be sitting in the catbird seat. Diversified practices don’t throw off as much money when transactions are hopping, but they hedge against a downturn. It’s just a question of how firm management chooses to play the game.

When I double-checked my glum lunch buddy’s thesis, asking partners at other firms whether litigation was declining at their joints, I heard almost universally that life’s okay. Litigation’s up and down, but there’s no reason to abandon litigation as a career.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
So there you have it: A thesis. An unscientific testing of a thesis by speaking to a small, non-randomly selected cross-section of people. And the public presentation of those results as though they mean something.

But really: Did you expect anything more?

# Ranking The Richest Biglaw Firms: Is Your Firm 'Super Rich'?
## These firms have money, money, and even more money.

Even after the [rough revenue ride](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/the-am-law-100-biglaw-gets-bucked-off-at-rough-revenue-rodeo/) that was 2022 — a year where Biglaw firms came back to reality after reaching the highest of monetary heights in 2021 — your Biglaw firm may be doing quite well financially… but is it among the Am Law 100’s Super Rich?

What qualifies a firm to be designated as among the Super Rich? These are the Biglaw firms that have at least $1.1 million in revenue per lawyer (RPL) and $550,000 in profits per lawyer (PPL). These Biglaw firms are rolling around in cash, and they’re not afraid to flaunt it after coming through ahead of peer firms last year. After all, according to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/04/18/back-to-reality-the-2023-am-law-100-super-rich/), in 2021, the Super Rich list was the [“most inclusive” on record](https://www.law.com/2022/04/26/the-once-exclusive-super-rich-club-welcomed-more-members-than-ever-for-2022/), but in 2022, the number Super Rich firms dropped from 40 to 34. Here are some additional details on the sheer wealth of the Super Rich firms:

This year’s list averaged a gross revenue of $1.84 billion, outpacing the overall average gross for the Am Law 100 of $1.31 billion. And revenue per lawyer was significantly higher for Super Rich firms than the entire pack, with their average of $1.62 million in RPL exceeding the entire 100’s $1.18 million in RPL.

But the greatest difference can be seen in the profitability per lawyer metric achieved by the rich versus super rich.

While the PPL for the Am Law 100 overall was $487,458 on average, for the Super Rich, the average was $830,912.

Before we get to the members of the 2023 Super Rich list, we’ll let you know which firms didn’t make the cut this time around. They include (in alphabetical order): Alston & Bird; Cadwalader; Cahill; Kramer Levin; McDermott Will & Emery; and Wilson Sonsini.

Without further ado, these are the top 10 firms on the Am Law Super Rich list:

- Wachtell
- Sullivan & Cromwell
- Kirkland & Ellis
- Paul Weiss
- Gibson Dunn
- Skadden
- Quinn Emanuel
- Cravath
- Latham
- Davis Polk
Click [here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/04/18/back-to-reality-the-2023-am-law-100-super-rich/) to see the complete list.

Congratulations to all of the Biglaw firms that made it into the Super Rich club in 2022! If your firm performs well enough, 2023 could be your year to shine.

# Biglaw Firm Seeks Input Before Raising Associate Salaries
## The firm is being mighty transparent about how associate raises happen.

[Just last month](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/dorsey-raises/), Dorsey managing partner Bill Stoeri announced that mid-level on up associates in Minneapolis, Salt Lake City, Seattle, and Denver would get between a $10,000 to $15,000 raise. Which, while nice for them, left associates in major markets with nothing and the firm off the DPW scale entirely.

But life comes at you fast in Biglaw.

After Faegre Drinker Biddle [announced raises of their own](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/biglaw-firm-matches-first-year-salaries-in-some-markets-senior-associates-not-so-lucky/) (though below the market standard for mid-to-senior associates) Dorsey… felt they had to respond. But rather than just let associates wonder as the bureaucracy of the Biglaw firm churned out some response to the competition, the firm is including associates in the discussion.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In another email to associates ([available in full on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/dorsey-transparency/2/)), Stoeri reveals that yes, the firm is likely to respond to the market raises with a compensation boost of their own. But the details are not currently set in stone: what are the hour requirements? What does the bonus program look like? Is it lockstep? What hours (pro bono, D&I, etc.) get included in the calculation? So, the firm will be hosting a town hall to get associates involved in charting the firm’s (compensation) future.

Biglaw isn’t known for its openness and transparency. How nice that the firm is taking a step in that direction (and that they’re likely to give associates raises to boot).

Remember, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Milbank) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post.

When are you going back to the office?

That’s the question buzzing through Biglaw right now. With vaccines widely available and very effective, the legal industry is starting to return to normal. But after more than a year away from physical offices, exactly what constitutes the new normal is a question still being worked out.

West Coast mainstay Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati shared their reopening scheme with employees with a focus on flexibility. In an email circulated by WSGR managing partner Doug Clark, the firm announced its re-opening plan that was shaped by the needs and desires of actual employees. The firm conducted a survey about reopening with an impressive 96 percent response rate. And according to Clark, that data is shaping the firm’s policies going forward. Among the lessons learned are:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
-
Nearly one-third of employees want to go back to the office now; the rest would prefer to work remotely until later this year or indefinitely.

-
Longer term, the vast majority of employees want to spend at least one day a week in the office.

-
Nearly two-thirds of attorneys would prefer to eventually spend one to three days per week in the office.

So the firm is committed to a “flexible, hybrid work environment that permits people to maximize the ability to achieve a work/life balance and to retain some of the efficiency benefits we discovered while we’ve been in a virtual work environment” going forward.

But how will that actually work? Obviously, details are still forthcoming, but the firm is super clear: “No one will be required to return to an office during calendar-year 2021.” Beyond that, subject to local regulation from June 1 until September 20, 2021, the firm will start the reopening process, and all those who wish to go into the office will be permitted to do so. Then on September 20, 2021, the firm will reopen its U.S. offices with full amenities and services — but Clark was clear about his earlier caveat that no one will be required to go to the office in 2021.

In the email, Clark also announced the formation of the Office of the Future Task Force, to deal with question concerning a hybrid work environment. The firm will also continue to support remote work and will convert some of its office space into hoteling options to increase flexibility.
