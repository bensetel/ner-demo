# Federal Prosecutors Are Thinking About Going After Skadden
## The Biglaw firm is under fire for its work on behalf of Paul Manafort.

The work that Skadden Arps did for Paul Manafort on behalf of the Ukrainian government — specifically, writing a report justifying the prosecution of former Russian-aligned Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych’s political rivals — has long been in the spotlight, what with it [being a featured part](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/the-biglaw-bill-taking-center-stage-at-the-second-manafort-trial/) of the Mueller investigation’s case against Manafort. In addition to being well-known, it has also triggered a series of legal woes for Skadden attorneys that worked on the matter.

Former Skadden associate Alex van der Zwaan[ pleaded guilty](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/former-skadden-associate-who-pleaded-guilty-in-mueller-probe-begs-for-no-jail-time/) to lying to investigators in the Mueller probe. And the [case against former Skadden counsel Greg Craig ](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/skadden-counsel-tagged-in-mueller-probe/)was referred to the Southern District of New York for potentially acting as an unregistered lobbyist.

Recent reports have revealed not only that Craig, who was [unceremoniously purged from the Biglaw firm’s website](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/amid-mueller-probe-prominent-skadden-counsel-disappears-from-website/) when the pressure from the investigation got turned up, is in the crosshairs of the S.D.N.Y. for work he did, but now we’ve learned that Skadden Arps Meagher and Flom — the white shoe law firm itself — may be facing penalties for its representation.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
As CNN [reports:](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/14/politics/greg-craig-foreign-agent-registration-investigation/index.html)

In addition, these sources said, prosecutors in the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York are considering taking action against powerhouse law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, where Craig was a partner during the activity under examination. Prosecutors are considering a civil settlement with the firm or a deferred prosecution agreement with Skadden, these sources said.

But those who love a good dose of Biglaw schadenfreude shouldn’t get too excited yet. There’s not yet been a final decision to take any action against the firm or Craig himself:

Prosecutors at the US attorney’s office have notified the Department of Justice of the options under consideration, the sources familiar with the matter said. Prosecutors, however, haven’t concluded that they have adequate evidence to bring the possible charges, these sources said, and as a result haven’t made a determination about whether to proceed.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Through an attorney, Craig has denied he was required to register as a foreign lobbyist, and Skadden has not commented on the matter:

An attorney for Craig, who left the Skadden firm in April and who was White House counsel under President Barack Obama during the first year of that administration, said his client “was not required to register under the Foreign Agent Registration Act.” A spokeswoman for Skadden didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Meanwhile, the rest of us wait with bated breath to see if any action will be taken against the Biglaw goliath.

# A Fifth-Year Could Have Told You About Dupe Emails, WHY COULDN'T THE FBI?
## But the question is WHY Comey couldn't have come to this conclusion 11 days ago?

Any Biglaw associate could tell you that it doesn’t take very long to review half a million emails. That’s not a hard document review. You throw enough bodies at the problem, and you can get it done in a week. You can get it done even more quickly if most of those emails are dupes that you have already reviewed during your investigation.

FBI director — and apparent sleeper agent — James Comey just announced that the FBI had completed its review of emails to and from Hillary Clinton found on a device [we presume to be Anthony Weiner’s](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/responsive-emails-found-on-anthony-weiners-laptop/). [ They didn’t find anything.](http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/06/politics/comey-tells-congress-fbi-has-not-changed-conclusions/)

“Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July,” Comey said in the letter to top Republicans on the House Oversight Committee.

That’s not going to come as a galloping shock to [anybody who has been paying attention](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/hey-liberals-stop-attacking-james-comey-because-it-just-makes-you-look-stupid/).

But the question is WHY Comey couldn’t have come to this conclusion 11 days ago, before he inserted himself into the presidential race and tried to throw it for Donald Trump? He could have conducted this review BEFORE sending a letter to Congress. OR he could have said that they’d be through the emails quickly and to hang on for more information.

At the very least he could have had them run the GOD DAMN DE-DUPING PROGRAM before he alerted Rudy Giuliani that he was working for his guy.

Honestly, that’s the most basic thing.  Take a look at this Tweet.

Sr law enforcement source to [@PeteWilliamsNBC](https://twitter.com/PeteWilliamsNBC): nearly all ""new"" emails earlier-seen duplicates or unrelated to govt. # classified unchanged

— John Harwood (@JohnJHarwood) [November 6, 2016](https://twitter.com/JohnJHarwood/status/795371957457928200)

ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Nearly ALL the emails were duplicates? In the words of Adam Sandler, that was information that could have been brought to our attention ELEVEN FREAKING DAYS AGO.

As many have pointed out, we’re living in a world where the KKK, the KGB, and the FBI are all supporting the same candidate. This FBI “investigation” isn’t up to the level of a mid-tier law firm with a gang of contract attorneys.

What a farce. Don’t forget to vote.

Sharon Fast Gustafson

The position of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission general counsel has been void since December of 2016. The top litigator position has broad discretion in deciding what Title VII cases to pursue, and, as such, will take the lead in determining the Trump administration’s stance on such hot button issues as [sexual harassment](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/sexual-harassment/) and the [gender pay gap.](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/gender-pay-gap/)

The Trump administration has just announced their nomination for EEOC GC, and they’ve gone with [yet another former Jones Day lawyer](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/jones-day-advertising-its-trump-admin-ties-because-they-have-no-shame/) to fill the role. [Sharon Fast Gustafson](http://www.sharonfastgustafson.com/) got the nod yesterday, and she spent four years as a Jones Day associate before[ hanging out her own shingle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharon-fast-gustafson-10b5395/) as a solo practitioner in 1995.

Just because Donald Trump nominated her to a position in the EEOC doesn’t mean Gustafson has a retrograde position on what the EEOC’s role should be. Indeed, as[ reported by ](https://www.bna.com/white-house-nominates-n57982090040/)Bloomberg, Gustafson worked as a solo practitioner to expand discrimination protections under Title VII:

Gustafson was part of a legal team that convinced the U.S. Supreme Court to expand discrimination protections for pregnant workers in 2015. She represented UPS driver Peggy Young, who sued the company for forcing Young to take a leave of absence when doctors advised her not to lift heavy objects during her pregnancy.

In addition to the role of general counsel, the EEOC is also waiting on Senate confirmation of three members of the five-person panel (two Republicans and reconfirmation of a Democratic nominee).

Heise emphasizes the transformative impact of AI, stating, “AI is not just a tool for efficiency; it’s a strategic partner that reshapes how we think about recruitment in the legal sector.” This perspective is pivotal for understanding the depth of AI’s role in revolutionizing legal recruitment processes.

The Dual Advantage: Efficiency and Retention

Improving recruitment efficiency and attorney retention are critical for law firms’ success. Heise highlights, “Efficient recruitment and strong retention are two sides of the same coin. With haistack.ai, law firms can significantly reduce the time and resources spent on hiring, while also investing in long-term relationships with their attorneys.”

Accelerating Recruitment and Enhancing Firm Profitability with AI

Reflecting on the significant financial implications of vacant positions within top law firms, Heise articulates the strategic advantage of AI in legal recruitment: “Every unoccupied chair represents more than just an absence; it signifies missed revenue potential and untapped talent. With haistack.ai’s AI-driven platform, we’re not just filling seats; we’re optimizing recruitment processes to safeguard firms from profit losses and unlock their full potential.”

Dive Deeper into the Discussion

# When Your Salaries Are Undermarket, Even Raises Will Make Associates Yawn
## A raise that's only worth a shrug or two, by the looks of it.

There are pay increases that will make associates jump for joy, and then there are pay increases that will make associates shrug their shoulders and go on about their merry way because the firm was already paying undermarket salaries to begin with and will still be undermarket even with the new raises. Last Friday, a Biglaw firm awarded the latter kind of pay increase to its associates.

Even though Arent Fox is matching the [Milbank scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) (not the [Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/)) for first-, second-, and third-year associates with a $10,000 increase, and a $15,000 raise for all other class years, the increases keep the firm undermarket as far as compensation. One source claims that first-year salaries at the firm are now $170K.

For what it’s worth, Arent Fox isn’t handing out bonuses, either.

“I haven’t heard many associates speaking about it openly at all,” another source said. “I have brought it up with a few friends and they were like — well that’s nice… so it seemed like folks are happy but not over the moon over it. It’s still undermarket and I know several associates have left the firm this year for firms that either pay more or to different firms in different markets where the cost of living is less.”

At the end of the day, money is money, and whether or not they’re acting like it, associates at Arent Fox have to at least be somewhat happy about the fact that their paychecks will be bigger. Congratulations on your newfound cash!

# Magic Circle Joins The Raise Party
## The U.S. offices of Clifford Chance are having a great morning.

Yesterday, I was enjoying a cigarette on the street when a nice man approached me and said: “Hey Elie, where’s my raise?”

I didn’t know where he worked, but I assured him it was coming. Because, if he works in Biglaw, it is coming. Yesterday, [the dam broke](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/today-was-the-day-the-associate-compensation-dam-broke-see-also/) on associate raises. It’s gonna happen now, for everybody. Well, [maybe everybody but Greenberg Traurig associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/greenberg-traurig-explains-why-its-too-cheap-to-raise-associate-salaries/).

Today, a Magic Circle firm joined the party. For the uninitiated, “Magic Circle” refers to a group of elite firms that got their start in the U.K. These firms are now global powerhouses and, like most Biglaw firms, have offices all across America. But we still call them “Magic Circle” because we are a fearful and xenophobic people.

Clifford Chance, which is often an early mover among this cadre of elite international firms, made the first move on raises for all U.S. associates. Here’s the memo:

Re: U.S. Associate Salaries and Summer Bonuses
I am pleased to announce that the Firm is increasing the salaries of our Associates in the U.S. as follows:
Class Year Salary
2017 $190,000
2016 $200,000
2015 $220,000
2014 $255,000
2013 $280,000
2012 $305,000
2011 $325,000
2010 $340,000
2009 and more senior $350,000

Salary increases will be effective July 1, 2018. Salaries for Summer Law Clerks will be increased to the semi-monthly rate of $7,916.67.

In addition, I am also pleased to announce that the Firm is awarding summer bonuses as follows:
Class Year Summer Bonus
2017 $ 5,000
2016 $ 7,500
2015 $10,000
2014 $15,000
2013 $20,000
2012 $25,000
2011 $25,000
2010 $25,000
2009 and more senior $25,000

That’s a match of the Cravath salary scale, and the Simpson Thacher summer bonuses.

I don’t know what the British associates are making, but they have the honor of not living here and having a team in the World Cup, which seems like bonus enough.

And to my street buddy, even if you don’t work at Clifford Chance, yours is coming too. I promise. It’s gonna happen. In fact, just start spending the money now.

As a lawyer, you want to support freedom of speech. But at the end of the day this is a private law firm and they can do whatever they want.

— Stephanie Biderman, a partner at legal recruiting firm Major Lindsey & Africa, [reflecting](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/law-firm-nixing-job-offer-shows-right-to-condemn-israel-views) on Winston & Strawn’s decision to revoke an offer full time employment to NYU Law student Ryna Workman after their statement branding the Hamas attacks as “necessary.” Dean of University of California Berkeley Law School, Erwin Chemerinsky, said though Workman has a right to express their opinion,  “I am saddened and outraged by those who would defend what Hamas did. I—and others—have the right to condemn those views. And employers have the right to decide that they don’t want to employ individuals who express those views.”

# Final Magic Circle Firm Matches
## Relief in the halls of this firm.

You know, we were starting to get a little worried there. Once all the other Magic Circle firms — and a Silver Circle firm — [had announced raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-magic-circle-firm-pulls-money-out-of-a-hat/), the days just kept ticking by without hearing a peep from Linklaters. Perhaps the impending Brexit debacle has kept them up at night.

Whatever triggered the long delay, it came to an end last night when the firm announced its raises. In [a memo](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/final-magic-circle-firm-matches/2/) from U.S. practice head [Scott Bowie](http://www.linklaters.com/AboutUs/OurPeople/Pages/ScottBowie.aspx) sent at 7:55 last night, Linklaters associates were thrilled to learn that they would be matching the Cravath scale through the Class of 2008 ($315K).

In keeping with standard — but [by no means universal](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/wait-who-just-raised-associate-salaries/) — practice, the raise takes effect on July 1. Summers are getting a match as well.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
We were receiving increasingly irate emails from associates over the last week. But now that everything’s been handled, associates are playing it off with cool confidence:

As always, unsurprising news that we matched, and now it’s getting to be a thing that we match late. Still, we usually don’t get nickel and dimed, so it wasn’t much of a worry.

A good reminder that as long as a firm gets its raises in order by July 1, it isn’t really late. Just a little stress-inducing for its associates.

UPDATE (6/23/16 10 a.m.): Actually, some tipsters point out the firm isn’t matching for the Class of 07 at $325K. As people following my posts know, I’ve been harping on this issue when it comes up and I usually get a curt response text that the reason some firms are stopping at $315K is that their firm doesn’t have associates that old because they either make partner or counsel. Apparently Linklaters is the exact firm where this distinction matters.

A Palo Alto University psychology professor, Christine Ford, has come forward [to the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/california-professor-writer-of-confidential-brett-kavanaugh-letter-speaks-out-about-her-allegation-of-sexual-assault/2018/09/16/46982194-b846-11e8-94eb-3bd52dfe917b_story.html?utm_term=.b804b49e651d) with her allegations about Brett Kavanaugh. She claims that, while in high-school, Kavanaugh and Mark Judge corralled her in a bedroom. She says Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, and groped her, and held his hand over her mouth to muffle her screams. She says both Kavanaugh and Judge were “stumbling drunk,” and Judge eventually jumped on top of both of them, allowing her to struggle free and lock herself in the bathroom until the boys left.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Speaking publicly for the first time, Ford said that one summer in the early 1980s, Kavanaugh and a friend — both “stumbling drunk,” Ford alleges — corralled her into a bedroom during a gathering of teenagers at a house in Montgomery County.

While his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it. When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth.

“I thought he might inadvertently kill me,” said Ford, now a 51-year-old research psychologist in northern California. “He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.”

Ford said she told no one about the incident, until 2012. She said that she told her story then, while in couple’s therapy, to her therapist and her husband. She produced notes from the 2012 session:

Ford said she told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband. The therapist’s notes, portions of which were provided by Ford and reviewed by The Washington Post, do not mention Kavanaugh’s name but say she reported that she was attacked by students “from an elitist boys’ school” who went on to become “highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington.” The notes say four boys were involved, a discrepancy Ford says was an error on the therapist’s part. Ford said there were four boys at the party but only two in the room.

To believe that she is categorically lying about her encounter with Kavanaugh now requires you to believe that a university professor made up a story to her husband and a third party six years ago, just in case she ever needed to completely expose her life to a ravenous right-wing media in the midst of a confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court Justice nominated by a reality-TV star.

But Kavanaugh and Judge have kind of locked themselves into the defense that she’s categorically lying. Kavanaugh’s and Judge’s denials have left them no credible wiggle room.

[From Kavanaugh](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/09/14/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-nominee-denies-anonymous-assault-claim/1301974002/): “I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation,” Kavanaugh said in a statement issued by the White House. “I did not do this back in high school or at any time.”

[From Judge](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-mark-judge-high-school-drunk-allegation-alcohol/): “It’s just absolutely nuts,” he said. “I never saw Brett act that way.”

That’s their story now. Many horrible people will try to explain away Ford’s account as a case of “boys-will-be-boys” — you know some kind of version of “this is normal male behavior” line is being workshopped by Republicans right now. But that’s not Kavanaugh’s and Judge’s stories. No, the friends are saying categorically and unequivocally that nothing like this happened.

They could have said “Yeah, we used to get drunk in high school.” I mean, Judge wrote a whole memoir about getting smashed, so I think people would have believed him if he had been able to remember his own writings. They could have tried a “I don’t remember all of the details of every party I went to in high school, but at no point did we try to rape or assault anybody.” Frankly, that’s what I would have expected them to say. That’s what a LAWYER would have said.

But that’s not what they said. According to Kavanaugh and Judge, Ford’s story is categorically and unequivocally false. Because his buddy in the room “never saw Brett act that way.”

If true, Ford is not describing a “boyish prank.” She’s describing a sexual assault. In defense, Kavanaugh and Judge have offered only a blanket denial.

When they change their story, to SUDDENLY RECALL more about the incident, yet still try to paint Ford as untruthful, remember where they started, remember that delta. Remember that Ford seems to have been telling the same story for six years at least, while Kavanaugh and Judge try to get through a weekend on the same page.

15 years of “How Appealing” — reader mail: Today’s email is from an attorney who asked me to omit his name:

Congratulations on the 15-year milestone!

I have been reading this blog since its inception when I was an undergraduate at NYU. I had been reading cases since high school as I just loved (and love) the law. Your blog is the greatest resource for keeping current on the state of the law, which I believe is absolutely necessary to have a successful practice. I have been litigating appeals for 10 years now and I find your insights always interesting and refreshing. Most notably, I think, your blog provides a great resource for CTA cases that eventually become SCOTUS cases. Following the percolation of issues in the circuits is something that is invaluable, and without your blog it would be impossible to track things like that.

So thank you for being a wonderful resource and eminently readable.

And thanks to you for that very kind email! I will post another reader email tomorrow.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs.

# Another Round Of Matching Bonuses As The Holiday Season Really Starts To Kick Off
## Some good news for these folks.

Milbank set off the bonus season a little early this year and firms have taken their sweet time in matching. But now that we’re less than two weeks from Christmas, firms are finally comfortable letting the bonuses fly and they are flying today.

Morgan Lewis joins the ranks of the Biglaw bonus crowd with a full Milbank match for all U.S. associates in good standing and sitting at over 1900 hours (billable plus pro bono). Well, maybe not a full match because the Morgan Lewis fiscal year starts on October 1, meaning there are no pro-rated bonuses for the folks that just showed up. So that means we’re looking at something like this:

Class of 2018 – $15,000
Class of 2017 – $25,000
Class of 2016 – $50,000
Class of 2015 – $65,000
Class of 2014 – $80,000
Class of 2013 – $90,000
Class of 2012 – $100,000
Class of 2011 – $100,000

Bonuses will be paid on January 31. All associates have to do is correctly spell “Bockius” without looking.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Adapting To Market Shifts: U.S. Law Firms In Hong Kong Rethink COLA Strategy
## With top-tier US Biglaw firms in Hong Kong considering phasing out COLA, the industry stands on the brink of a significant shift, driven by market conditions and recruitment challenges.

At least three top-tier US law firms in Hong Kong are currently planning to phase out Cost Of Living Adjustment (COLA) allowances within the next two years, and others are discussing doing the same. The plan is to reduce the payment by 50% in 2024 and to zero by 2025. At least one firm has announced the change internally office-wide, while two others have apparently made the decision internally but have yet to announce to their associates and counsels in Hong Kong.

Will this work? Time will tell, but history suggests these firms are facing an uphill battle to phase out COLA in Hong Kong. This isn’t the first time firms have made moves to rein in COLA. Similar plans have been deployed during previous down cycles. The problem is that unless every firm in the market ends the practice, associates will simply move from firms that reduce COLA to peer firms that maintain it.

If the current hiring downturn lasts for an additional two full years, it is conceivable that no firm would see an advantage in maintaining COLA, while others are phasing it out over two years, and using that policy to attract lateral talent. But a downturn of that length, with both soft and hard hiring freezes going on for three total years, would be unprecedented. It is more likely that the hiring market will pick up in due course at some point in 2024, reestablishing the tight supply dynamics that led firms to offer significant COLA allowances in Hong Kong in the first place. If that happens, firms will have a strong incentive to use COLA as a recruiting tool. And the firms now planning to stop paying it may find themselves reconsidering, especially when their star associates may consider moves next year as their COLA begins to be phased out.

Around ten years ago, two top US firms in Hong Kong made plans to have a three-year tail on their COLA for their US associates, whereby COLA would only be in effect for an associate’s first three years at those firms’ Hong Kong offices. However, around seven years ago, when the scheduled end to COLA for their star associates was looming, both firms quietly continued providing COLA after the three years. One of these two firms completely abandoned the idea of the three-year tail.

Unsurprisingly, firms would rather not make substantial COLA payments, especially in the current down market. There are presently very few associate openings in Biglaw offices in Asia—a major deviation from the norm. Some firms perceive this rare hiring downturn as an opportunity to implement change.

Cost of Living Adjustments: Why Biglaw Offices in Asia Pay US Associates More Than Any Other Region

The market for US-qualified Biglaw associates in Asia has long been unique. As in other regions, Biglaw firms are looking for candidates with top academic credentials and deal experience. But in addition, they look for local language skills—most commonly, fluent Mandarin. This combination of attributes shrinks the eligible candidate pool, and under normal market conditions, competition for the relatively limited number of associates who check all the boxes is intense.

That’s why firms have for many years paid so-called Cost of Living Adjustments (COLA) to US-qualified associates working in Asian offices. Describing these payments as COLA is a misnomer, in that they bear no particular relation to cost of living (which is typically in Biglaw Asian markets roughly the same or slightly lower than in New York). Further, there are substantial tax windfalls for associates who land in tax havens such as Singapore and Hong Kong. This is true for both US taxpayers and non-US taxpayers, although the latter’s tax windfall is much larger than the former’s.

Instead, COLA is more accurately understood as simply an increase in base pay, rather than being tied to any cost of living adjustments or living expenses in general.

How much COLA do firms pay?

Before getting into the numbers, allow me to offer some context about my background. I recently joined Lateral Link, but my close association with Biglaw offices in Asia goes back nearly two decades, and over 500 attorney placements have been made in Asia, mostly at top-tier and second-tier US firms.

The table below presents the typical range of annual COLA (in US Dollars) in Hong Kong. To keep things simple, I have listed a Low, Medium, and High value, along with the number of firms paying at that level, among what we consider to be the top 20 US and UK law firms in Hong Kong. Please note that these COLA numbers are basic and do not include additional COLA allowances paid to associates who have children (a minority of firms in Hong Kong do this). Further, it is likely that by this time next year, there will only be one firm in the “High” range, with one of those firms considering lowering COLA a bit and one of those firms planning to phase out COLA. Outside of the handful of firms considering to phase out COLA, there has been no move to lower the COLA below the current low-end range ($60,000 to $95,000) in the Hong Kong market. This has been the range of COLA for the top 20 firms in Hong Kong for more than ten years.

Location	Low (11 Firms)	Medium (6 Firms)	High (3 Firms)
Hong Kong	$60,000 – $70,000	$75,000 to $85,000	$90,000 to $95,000
One might assume that COLA is for Americans moving to Asia as expats. In the mid-2000s when the COLA system was more basic and the US law firm offices in Asia were very small, that was basically true. But the picture today is more nuanced, especially in Hong Kong—the most competitive market for associate hiring.

COLA is typically offered to attorneys that are in a “US team” (e.g., US Capital Markets, M&A, FCPA, etc.) usually (but not always) led by US-trained and qualified partners. Keep in mind that members of such teams are not necessarily Americans. Many associates are native to the region but are qualified as US lawyers. So a native Hong Kong citizen with an American JD (and with no obligation to pay US taxes) will earn COLA despite living in his or her home jurisdiction.

There are also numerous UK and Australian qualified associates at US firms in Hong Kong that work on US teams and get COLA, regardless of whether they are admitted in any US state.

Interestingly, a minority of US law firms in Hong Kong provide COLA to all or most of their solely Hong Kong-qualified associates. These lawyers are admitted to practice only in Hong Kong and typically grew up in Hong Kong, or at least have been living in Hong Kong their entire legal career. They work side-by-side with US-qualified colleagues who receive COLA, and their firms want to retain them. Accordingly, at these select offices, COLA has effectively transformed into increased base pay for all associates across the board.

# Salary Wars Scorecard: Firms That Have Announced Raises (2022)

Since we broke the news of the new $215K salary scale for associates at large law firms in the United States — a trend that was [started by Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/) on Thursday, January 20, 2022, just six months after the firm [started the last salary war](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/milbank-raises-21/) in 2021 — several firms have fallen in line and matched the scale, but dozens more firms have remained completely silent. [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/davis-polk-raise-2022/) finally decided to step in with more money for associates, and [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cravath-raises-22/) added even more money on top of that. Coupled with Cravath’s final say, maybe this Above the Law feature will encourage more firms to pay up. After all, the lateral scene is white-hot right now, and increased salaries will only encourage talent to remain loyal to their firms.

[Ed. note: This table was last updated on September 6.]

Today, we unveil a table of all of the firms that have already matched the new salary scale (or instituted raises, generally, because of the new salary scale) and the date those matches were made for your viewing pleasure. We will be updating this table on a daily basis, sometimes multiple times, as news on raises unfolds. If you see any information here that is incorrect or needs further clarification, let us know.

We are covering this trend extensively, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”) — when you know of a firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. Sources are kept confidential.

# Ex-Proskauer Exec Was Heading To Paul Hastings Before Biglaw Lawsuit Blew It All Up
## The latest in the Biglaw lawsuit.

The[ news ](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/proskauer-files-lawsuit-against-fired-chief-operating-officer-what-you-need-to-know/)of the lawsuit brought by top Biglaw firm Proskauer against its former Chief Operating Officer continues to be fodder for Biglaw gossip. The complaint alleges the now-former COO, Jonathan O’Brien, downloaded 34 gigabytes of internal data to a USB drive before announcing he was leaving the firm. There are also allegations O’Brien attempted to delete emails subject to a litigation hold. The firm’s executive committee voted to terminate O’Brien’s employment when they filed the lawsuit.

Though the internal review that discovered the alleged downloads was triggered by O’Brien’s notice to the firm, it was unclear where O’Brien planned on working post-Proskauer. When pressed to disclose his future employment, court documents reveal O’Brien would only say firm leader would not be “happy” with his future employer.

Now, Law.com[ reports ](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/01/09/ex-proskauer-coo-was-headed-for-paul-hastings-before-trade-secrets-lawsuit/)that O’Brien planned to work at competitor, Paul Hastings. Unfortunately, that opportunity appears to be collateral damage of the legal dispute. O’Brien’s attorney, Russell Beck of Beck Reed Ridden, said:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“While it is unfortunate that an apparent overreaction based on Proskauer’s mistaken assumptions has improperly interfered with Mr. O’Brien’s planned position at Paul Hastings, he nevertheless looks forward to resolving this entire matter quickly and continuing his successful career in the legal field.”

Paul Hastings had a much terser statement, “Mr. O’Brien is not joining Paul Hastings and we do not comment on any firm’s personnel matters.” And sources have sought to distance Paul Hastings from the allegations.

One source with knowledge of his pre-suit career plans said Paul Hastings wasn’t aware of O’Brien’s alleged wrongdoing until the allegations against him were made public in Proskauer’s Dec. 27 complaint, nor was Paul Hastings involved in O’Brien’s alleged theft of trade secrets or any other confidential information.

A [temporary restraining order ](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/proskauer-wins-temporary-restraining-order-against-former-chief-operating-officer/)in the case bars O’Brien from from working or consulting with anyone with whom he has discussed or disseminated the material in question.

Thanksgiving is just around the corner, and with the way things are going this bonus season, associates sure have a lot to be thankful for (i.e., up to six figures of cash, depending on class year).

Yet another firm has announced bountiful bonuses, and so much money will hit banks accounts soon that it’s almost enough to make lawyers forget there’s a pandemic going on just outside their doors.

Clifford Chance has announced its year-end bonus scale, and it’s the same as Cravath’s. In case you somehow don’t remember what that looks like, here it is:

As [promised](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/covid-bonus-promises-and-caviar-dreams-at-magic-circle-firm/), the firm is indeed offering special bonuses in addition to its year-end bonuses. Associates will be paid on January 15, 2021. Happy Thanksgiving to all of the U.S. associates at Clifford Chance!

(Flip to the next page to read the Clifford Chance bonus memo.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

# The Biglaw Firms That Do The Best On The Diversity Scorecard (2018)
## There's been progress -- just not that much.

If there’s ever going to be any real change in the legal industry, diversity has to be more than a buzzword — it must be a priority across every firm initiative. That’s why taking stock annually on the progress made in Biglaw is so important.

According to the data[ collected as part of ALM’s Annual Diversity Scorecard](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/05/29/gc-diversity-mandates-had-a-soft-launch-now-theyre-serious/) — a ranking that looks at the percentage of minority lawyers as well as the percentage of minority partners at law firms — there’s been progress over the past year, but it’s been really, really slight:

Minority lawyers working in Am Law 200 firms and NLJ 250 firms increased just 0.5 percent in 2017, making up only 16.1 percent of attorneys in Big Law, up from 15.6 percent in 2016. The percentage of minority partners also saw 0.5 percent growth in 2017, to 9.1 percent from 8.6 percent the year prior. The total number of minority nonpartners at law firms inched up to 21.7 percent from 21.2 percent in 2016.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The firm that holds the top spot — and has for five years — is White & Case:

“Our commitment to a diverse and inclusive workplace is absolute,” says Maja Hazell, global head of diversity and inclusion at White & Case.

“In addition to a number of affinity groups, initiatives and projects dedicated to increasing diversity and fostering more inclusive leadership competencies, we value education and growing understanding of our people’s varied backgrounds, interests and needs in order to deliver their best performance,” she adds.

So which firms are the best for diversity? Here’s your Top 10, and you can check out the [full rankings at Law.com](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/05/29/the-2018-diversity-scorecard-the-rankings/):

# Biglaw May See 'Targeted Firings' Instead Of Mass Layoffs
## Yikes, that doesn't sound too good.

Historically, in weaker economies, firms have had cover to counsel out of the firm people who have been underperforming relative to expectations. Usually the worst offenders go first, with firms working their way up from the bottom, starting with those who have been weak performers over a number of years.

Layoffs mean, to me, mass firings of people. I think here it is more a list of people and offices and what they contribute to the firm. The people at the bottom of that list are ones that have been weak performers for years. Targeted firings of weak performers are more likely.

— Kent Zimmermann, a legal industry consultant at Zeughauser Group, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/09/23/marked-slowdown-in-ma-hasnt-led-to-layoffs-but-personnel-decisions-continue/) on what we can expect to see happen when it comes to personnel as a result of the slowdown in demand for legal services, especially in M&A. On that note, an anonymous global M&A practice head told Am Law, “We are not interested in firing people,” while at the same time saying that overall performance was being looked at closely, including office attendance and hours expectations.

# Finance Bro Explains 'HOW TO HIRE GOOD ATTORNEYS' -- Actually Good Attorneys Laugh Hysterically

Twitter lost a lot of its credibility when Elon Musk transformed the “Blue Checkmark” from a signal of identity and expertise to a $96 mercenary badge for thirsty edgelords, but it’s more than made up for it in unintentional comedy. And [racism](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/03/missouri-ag-sues-media-matters-for-aggravated-mean-to-twitter/). But let’s focus on the comedy for the moment.

Before Musk’s tenure, we may never have seen blue checked user @financeguy725 rack up almost 900,000 views (and counting!) sharing his streetwise advice on hiring good lawyers. But now he’s verified and his finance guy thoughts on how much smarter finance guys are than the dumb lawyers enjoy enhanced visibility. Bless the Musk!

HOW TO HIRE GOOD ATTORNEYS

""Your partner hired me, he has to fire me, not you!.""

i handed my phone to my partner over the pizza we were having for lunch

""Joe, fire this piece of shit for me""

first casualty of many

here's my process for finding lawyers who don't suck 👇🧵

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
If the attorney’s client relationship is with the partner specifically (or with the partnership and there’s any question as to the authority of another partner to act independently on behalf of the partnership) then this is… correct? In fact, if the lawyer considered themselves fired by some rando eating pizza without hearing from the actual client contact that would be a way worse sign.

Anyway, this thread went on and it did not get any smarter but it did get way funnier.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Small and mid-sized local firms are filled with excellent attorneys and are more than capable of handling “specialized and local” matters at a lower price point. But if you’re involved in the sort of case that has you even thinking about a Biglaw firm, you probably need a Biglaw firm. Because if you’re in that position, you’re looking at a national scope, brute force, bet-the-company litigation that those firms are built to handle.

Also, unless the matter is pending in the firm’s homefield, a Biglaw firm is going to hire local counsel anyway so what in the hell is he even talking about?

But, sure, “don’t hire Cravath for your $500 spat with a vendor” is decent advice. We’ll give him partial credit here.

Now he’s going to praise Google Maps as a search method, so get out there and — if your jurisdiction allows it — snag “[Law Firm Near Me](https://fortune.com/2023/10/29/restaurant-near-me-business-name-google-seo/)” fast.

This is like saying you should trust BBQ to someone who orders Chili’s Baby Back Ribs once a year over a competition circuit pitmaster.

Litigators are involved in legal battles personally every day. Assuming this isn’t a criminal matter — and we’re giving the author the benefit of the doubt that he’s not addressing the scenario where the FBI’s already shown up — then the same clutch of litigators are working with each other and against each other all the time. They know exactly who is and isn’t good at this because they’re staring at everyone else’s work product all the time.

He then offers some decent advice about talking to multiple attorneys before settling on one, which is just simple comparison shopping. But…

Yes, those with impeccable academic credentials and excellent standardized testing are famously unable to get a good job out of undergrad.

But there’s a theme to be had here: if you come at the legal industry without a basic grasp of what lawyers do, looking to hire a cheap avatar who’ll slap your threats under fancy letterhead, then you would think lawyers are held in bizarrely high regard.

[](https://twitter.com/financeguy725/status/1775236887780655290)

My first question: does the client even know what area of law they might need? It’s a serious question that this checklist glosses over.

If you want a litigator and hire someone who does 90 percent trusts and estates then, sure, you’ve screwed up. But also the attorney screwed up in that case because they shouldn’t ethically take matters they aren’t competent to handle.

On the other hand, holding out for a litigator who only handles some niche area, is not only unnecessary, it might be counterproductive if there’s nothing idiosyncratic about the subject. You’ve just shrunk the available talent pool over a legally inconsequential distinction.

[](https://twitter.com/financeguy725/status/1775236890729365981)

Any answer to this question that will satisfy this guy will also one day be paragraph one of a disciplinary complaint.

On that note…

[](https://twitter.com/financeguy725/status/1775236893732417797)

Of all the bad advice, this might be the worst. Attorneys don’t cave because they dislike opposing counsel. More often than not, unpleasant counsel makes the other side more recalcitrant.

This is just a warmed over version of [Donald Trump’s Roy Cohn fixation](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/donald-trump-roy-cohn-relationship) and the problem with the Roy Cohn model is that it only works when the stakes are sufficiently low. Cohn could bully anyone who wasn’t sufficiently motivated to contest the matter. If, as the author puts it, “this is a fucking street fight” then the other side is not going to just going to methodically break your “fighter” attorney and then file for sanctions. And the “senile judges and lazy clerks” will grant them because they’re just as pissed off.

In the original poster’s defense, his bio says he does “distressed real estate credit” which feels like a lane where bravado might get adversaries to crumble fast. And there’s certainly a value to that. Outside of that context though, consider screening attorneys… basically any other way.

# Biglaw Partner Eviscerates Trump's Cease-And-Desist Letter

Tony Schwartz, the co-author of Donald Trump’s masterpiece, [The Art of the Deal](http://amzn.to/2a2bLDx) (affiliate link), went on Good Morning America on Monday and shared his concerns about a Trump presidency. It’s fair to say Schwartz is not a fan of the possibility. To put a finer point on it, he is profoundly worried about Trump’s “[pathologically impulsive and self-centered](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all)” behavior.

At that point, we all synchronized our Swatches to countdown the inevitable Trump Organization cease and desist letter. Jason D. Greenblatt, the Trump Organization’s chief legal officer, had the letter out the door within hours. Now that’s efficiency — the kind of efficiency we need to bring back to our shores to make America great again!

But I digress.

In any event, [Greenblatt’s letter](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/biglaw-partner-eviscerates-trumps-cease-and-desist-letter/2/) is as brash as his client, demanding millions for defamation and being “very disloyal.” As Jane Mayer [summarizes in The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-threatens-the-ghostwriter-of-the-art-of-the-deal):

Greenblatt demands that Schwartz send “a certified check made payable to Mr. Trump” for all of the royalties he had earned on the book, along with Schwartz’s half of the book’s five-hundred-thousand-dollar advance. (The memoir has sold approximately a million copies, earning Trump and Schwartz each several million dollars.) Greenblatt also orders Schwartz to issue “a written statement retracting your defamatory statements,” and to offer written assurances that he will not “generate or disseminate” any further “baseless accusations” about Trump.

But Schwartz’s lawyer, Davis Wright Tremaine’s [Elizabeth McNamara](http://www.dwt.com/people/elizabethamcnamara/), penned [a response letter](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/biglaw-partner-eviscerates-trumps-cease-and-desist-letter/3/) yesterday that basically asks Greenblatt to kindly look up defamation law before wasting her time with this:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Your letter alludes vaguely to “defamatory statements,” “outright lies” and “downright fabrications,” but you do not identify a single statement by Mr. Schwartz that is factually false, let alone defamatory. Instead, it is self-evident that Mr. Trump is most concerned with Mr. Schwartz’s well-founded expressions of his own opinion of Mr. Trump’s character, as well as Mr. Schwartz’s accurately taking credit for the writing of The Art of the Deal, which you pointedly do not contest. Eed. note: emphasis in original was in italics.]

That pesky “opinion” thing. I guess this is why Trump’s so hot to [“open up” the law](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/26/donald-trump-vows-to-open-up-libel-laws-to-make-suing-the-media-easier-heres-how-he-could-do-it/) to make it easier to sue the media for telling people what a tire fire of a foreign policy plan you have. But, alas, Trump’s glorious regime of protecting himself from ouchy words — seriously, people say the millennials are the coddled ones — is still several months off.

Feeling that she’d accomplished all of her goals in one paragraph, McNamara decided to offer her own opinion of Trump’s mismanaged convention:

The fact that Mr. Trump would spend time during the week of the Republican National Convention focused on settling a score with and trying to censor his co-author on a thirty-year-old book is, frankly, baffling, but only further underscores the very basis for Mr. Schwartz’s criticisms. In any event, the demands you make in the letter are without any foundation in law or fact. Mr. Schwartz will not be returning any of the advance or royalties from the Book, and he has no intention of retracting any of his opinions about the character of the Republican nominee for the presidency, nor does he have any obligation or intention to remain silent about this issue going forward.

You think that’s baffling, just wait until tonight, when Peter Thiel — a rich guy with his own idiosyncratic views on the press — takes the stage and tells the REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION delegates that he’s gay. Obviously there are many pro-gay Republicans — Ted Olson and Justice Kennedy come most obviously to mind — but those folks are probably not embedded with the crowd who spent the whole week yelling at the stage about Benghazi and imprisoning Hillary Clinton.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Setting aside your hyperbolic rhetoric, the sole statements by Mr. Schwartz that your letter cites are from the Good Morning America interview where he stated that he “suspect[s] there are quite a number of things that were false [in the Booki],” and that the Book is “full of falsehoods.” Your attempt to argue that these statements constitute a breach of Mr. Schwartz’s obligations under the publishing agreement for the Book is utterly nonsensical on its face, even apart from the fact that you have wrenched the statements out of the context in which they were made.

If you’re playing “Cease and Desist Response Bingo,” you can mark off “hyperbolic.”

After addressing what she characterizes as the “non-sequitur attacks… throughout the rest of your letter,” McNamara finally heard the call every Mortal Kombat aficionado knows well: FINISH HIM!

Your letter does contain one accurate statement. Mr. Schwartz is indeed “attempting to influence the public” by speaking out. Mr. Schwartz would be the first to acknowledge that he is doing exactly that, and he will not be bullied into silence on this issue by outlandish and baseless legal demands.

And… scene.

Damn. When it comes to public criticism, this [has not been a good week](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/trump-campaigns-plagiarism-sacrificial-lamb-opens-up-questions-of-election-law-violations/) to be a Trump Organization lawyer, huh?

# Bonus Season Isn't Over... It's Just Getting Harder To Decipher Without Your Help

Some firms don’t hand out bonuses at the end of the calendar year because they want to screw their associates out of prime lateral season they have accounting issues. That means tips continue to trickle in to Above the Law about bonus announcements from across Biglaw. Just last week, we [heard from Vinson & Elkins](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/associate-bonus-watch-good-news-and-bad-from-a-texas-powerhouse/) and we know there are more firms taking the bonus plunge as we speak.

But here’s where we remind everyone that Above the Law requires help from readers like you. Many of the holdout firms we’re tracking award individualized bonuses, leaving us with an incomplete picture. Cracking open these “black box” regimes — at least enough to get a peek at the broad trends governing compensation — requires more than a couple of tipsters.

Don’t be a free-rider!

If you work at a firm that doesn’t issue a memo outlining a lockstep bonus schedule, and yet you enjoy Above the Law’s bonus coverage and recognize the value of transparency in the associate labor market, then you need to help out. Drop us a line explaining your situation and the bonus you received or just give us your sense — taken with appropriate grains of salt — about what people got. We’ll honor your confidentiality; we just want to see the big picture inside the firm to give a fair assessment of the market.

You can send tips by [emailing us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or texting us (646-820-8477).

# Why Women Are Leaving The Law -- And What To Do About It
## Sometimes lateraling is your best option.

 In this episode, I welcome back Laura Leopard of Leopard Solutions to talk about their white paper, [Women Leaving Law](https://www.leopardsolutions.com/index.php/thought-leadership/women-leaving-law-research-report/). Laura narrates their experiences writing and running the survey: How depressing it is knowing the reasons why women are leaving the law space and how unfair some firms are to them. She shares how culture affects the work environment. Additionally, Laura describes why a lateral move is important and why law firm leaders should start taking a closer look at what’s going on internally.


The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

# The Making Of A Biglaw Memelord
## The story behind NonEquityPartner, one of the largest law meme accounts on Instagram.

Memes have gone mainstream. They’re no longer just silly little jokes for Gen Z and millennials. A recent conversation with a 50-year-old lawyer made me realize that memes have cross-generational appeal, and have a significant impact on the real world. “I love memes,” the lawyer said. “Especially the ones from NonEquityPartner.”

NonEquityPartner, an Instagram meme account with over 160,000 followers, is run by Bill Moore. He’s an incredibly creative lawyer with a background in corporate M&A, and has been recognized by[ The American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/international-edition/2021/06/09/meet-the-memelords-trolling-your-firm-on-instagram/) as a bona fide memelord. Others have said that NonEquityPartner is an account you should “[follow immediately](https://www.csdisco.com/blog/10-legal-humor-accounts-you-should-follow-immediately)” or that it’s a “[criminally underrated meme page](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacksonweimer/2022/05/01/6-legal-instagram-meme-pages-that-are-criminally-underrated/?sh=22b410d8731c).”

The account’s influence has created all sorts of unique opportunities for Bill. He now offers [bespoke legal recruiting services](https://nonequitypartner.com/a/careers), publishes[ The Industry Pulse](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/new-biglaw-ranking-alert-presenting-the-industry-pulse-top-50-law-firms/) Annual Law Firm Ranking alongside fellow legal meme account[ BigLawBoiz](https://www.instagram.com/biglawboiz/), and recently released an [In-House Compensation Survey Report](https://www.instagram.com/p/CgMqePdAHP8/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link). As a bona fide influencer, Bill also sells merchandise with funny slogans on his own website and creates the occasional sponsored post for brands that inspire him. In all his “free time” (besides his actual, full-time career), he’s an angel investor and startup advisor!

I was very interested in meeting Bill, and wanted to talk to him about his experience running NonEquityPartner. As a content creator in the same niche, I have always been fascinated by the real-world impact of Internet culture. A few years ago, when I was just getting started on my content-creation journey, a friend suggested that social media clout didn’t really have any power. “You can have lots of followers online, but will that actually influence events in the real world?”

So when that 50-year-old lawyer mentioned a law meme account by name — in the real world — I was inspired to learn more. Who exactly is Bill Moore? Is that even his real name? (Spoiler: it’s not.) How did he get started on NonEquityPartner, and what are his goals with the account?

“I never expected it to get this big,” said Bill. His story goes like this. Years ago, while still in law school, Bill came across a Tumblr-style website where people would share gifs along with a funny caption. Bill had always been a creative person. On a whim, he decided to create and submit his own meme. 

“It was super early in terms of meme culture,” he explained.

Bill’s talent was obvious to everyone, though. Within weeks, he became the site’s top contributor.

Although he had a talent for meme-making, at the time it was just a fun hobby. Like many other ambitious law students, Bill pursued the tried-and-true career path after law school. He joined the corporate group at a prestigious New York Biglaw firm and spent the first few years out of law school just like his peers, grinding away at the office.

“As juniors, we used to drop these notes in each other’s offices if we were working overnight: ‘BM;FL’ short for ‘Bill More; Feel Less.’ Those little moments of collegial commiseration kind of served as the origin story for the name and ethos of William Moore, Esq.”

In his free time, Bill would scroll through Instagram and find memes from accounting, finance, and consulting. That’s when he noticed that there was something missing. “There was no one focusing on lawyers like me. I mean, there were a lot of generic meme accounts, but nothing specifically for Biglaw.”

So, Bill created his own. At the time, it wasn’t a huge priority. It was just a hobby that would help him scratch his creative itch when work slowed down. “I was a Biglaw associate. I didn’t have time for any other type of outlet, like writing or reading.” So in late 2018, when deal flow died down during the holidays, Bill Moore created the Instagram account that would eventually become NonEquityPartner.

“There was no master plan,” Bill explained. He struggled to get his first 100 followers. There was no playbook for building an audience for his memes, so the account meandered for a few months while he honed his craft. There came a point though — in spring 2019 — when an interruption in Bill’s personal life forced him to take some time away from work and allowed him to focus on his side project.

“I told myself I’m going to pour myself into this, and started observing larger accounts to see how they did it. Over the course of three weeks, it went from 100 to 1,000 followers, and then I was off to the races. Turns out a lot of lawyers shared the same experiences.”

This isn’t the first time I’ve seen this pattern. In my experience, one of the best ways to discover your superpower is to [create something small on the side](https://twitter.com/heyitsalexsu/status/1520098613589807104), without quitting your job. Not to make money necessarily, but to do something you enjoy for its own sake. In this new, social media empowered world, you can go massively viral and suddenly gain an audience of like-minded fans overnight.

Internet fame has brought Bill lots of interesting commercial opportunities, but despite all that, he’s remained true to his original goals. “At the end of the day, this is a passion project,” he told me. “I do it on the side. Right now I’m just focused on maintaining authenticity and using it for fun. At the end of the day, I just love trash talking lawyers online.”

That authenticity helps Bill cut through the noise. It’s why that 50-year-old lawyer I mentioned earlier, who is probably bombarded by marketing content every single day, remembered NonEquityPartner by name. As someone who thinks a lot about brand marketing, I can tell you that this is very special. I’ve spent the past six years in legal tech — first in e-discovery, and then in contracts tech — I’ve experienced how challenging it is to capture the attention of busy lawyers.

That’s where the memes come in. Their virality creates their own distribution. According to RevGenius, in an[ article describing how powerful meme marketing is](https://mag.revgenius.com/the-unbelievable-effectiveness-of-meme-marketing-in-b2b/), it all “comes from the human instinct to commiserate on deeply-felt emotions. For this reason, the best memes are born out of experience and are difficult, if not impossible, to fabricate.”

Despite this, there’s still some skepticism in some corners about memes and social media generally. Probably because it’s hard to measure their effectiveness. They operate in the[ dark funnel](https://www.cognism.com/blog/illuminating-the-dark-funnel-of-b2b-marketing). So the companies that serve the legal industry, like recruiting firms, alternative legal services providers, or legal tech startups, mostly still rely on outdated marketing playbooks.

“I feel kind of like a teenager in the early 2000s,” Bill joked. “It’s like, I’ve got these Internet friends but now have to convince my parents that they’re real.”

I mean, I get the hesitation. It’s all kind of strange. To those not immersed in Internet culture, memes aren’t supposed to work. You’re supposed to say nice things about the people you’re trying to market to, right? You don’t make fun of them. But Bill built his audience by, as he put it, “trash talking lawyers.”

In reality, that’s precisely what makes memes work so well. You don’t engage with the community you serve by offering platitudes and empty marketing messages. You do it by making inside jokes and calling out commonly known truths that no one talks about openly. This is especially effective in opaque industries, like the legal profession. It’s related to why Instagram and TikTok[ are eating into Google’s market share](https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/12/google-exec-suggests-instagram-and-tiktok-are-eating-into-googles-core-products-search-and-maps/).

I predict that the early adopters of meme culture will collect the lion’s share of the rewards. In a world where it’s becoming increasingly difficult to reach the most valuable audiences in the legal world, the unique space that memelords like Bill Moore occupy will only grow in value. Over time, we’ll start to see the corporate world embrace these “silly pictures with captions” even more as copyright law evolves. (For more on that, check out this fascinating NYU Law Review article titled “[Memes On Memes And The New Creativity.](https://www.nyulawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NYULawReview-Volume-97-Issue-2-AdlerFromer-compressed.pdf)”)

Like it or not, memes are here to stay. I expect that over the next few years, NonEquityPartner will transform into a major media and marketing force for the legal industry, kind of like what[ Litquidity did for finance](https://fortune.com/2022/01/13/litquidity-twitter-bain-venture-capital/) or[ IMGN/Daquan did for music](https://manofmany.com/tech/who-is-daquan). And Bill, by being early to the game, will be incredibly well positioned to create massive value.

In the real world.

# How Do You Judge -- Credentials Or Experience?

There were two partners I’d like to discuss at the firm where I started practicing in 1984.

The first had graduated with no apparent distinction from Yale Law School. He knew exactly how to judge applicants to the firm: “What matters is where you go to law school. How you perform is irrelevant. What matters is that you were accepted at a great school and that you could swim in those waters.”

The second partner had graduated near the top of his class at a law school of no distinction. He knew exactly how to judge applicants to the firm: “What matters is how you do in law school. Where you go to school is irrelevant. The top few students in the class at any law school are basically fungible. People have to prove that they succeeded in their law school environment.”

Everyone, of course, wants to hire people who look exactly like they do.

I recently wrote a column about how we have had some highly perfumed lawyers — former U.S. Supreme Court clerks and the like — in my in-house law department and that I didn’t think anybody gave us a discount in litigation because plaintiffs were facing that formidable foe. The identity of outside counsel may be relevant to valuing a case; the identity of in-house counsel is largely irrelevant.

What reaction did I get to that column? One email said: “Credentials don’t matter. I went to a middle-of-the-road law school, was in the middle of my class, and have had a fine career. Credentials matter when you apply for your first job; after that, experience is what counts.”

I bet about 95% of my readers agree with that assessment — because 95% of my readers don’t have impeccable credentials. And about 5% of my readers disagree with that assessment because about 5% of my readers graduated at the very top of a T14 law school class.

Everyone wants to hire people who look exactly like they do.

Funny how that works, isn’t it?

Both sides have a point, of course.

I’ve known some very fine lawyers who were mediocre students at mediocre schools.

I’ve known some very fine lawyers who were on the law review at top-tier schools.

But consider this: Good credentials are self-replicating. You get good grades during your first year in law school. This automatically leads to law review. This automatically leads to a great clerkship. This automatically leads to a job at a great firm.

This is, of course, double-counting (or maybe it’s quadruple-counting): It all comes down to first-year grades. But the over-counting is repeated on your résumé until you die.

I’m sorry to turn up the heat on first-year law students, but that’s the truth.

The first job you land out of your clerkship also redounds to your benefit forever. You probably went to work at an internationally renowned firm. At that firm, you may have handled tedious projects, but you were probably exposed to big cases in a way that other folks, whose firms rarely handle big cases, were not. Of course, whether or not you were actually exposed to anything important, your résumé implies that you were — and that implication stays with you forever.

When an in-house lawyer is thinking about retaining outside counsel, the in-house lawyer prefers to have previously worked personally with the outside lawyer under consideration. This guarantees, from personal experience, that the lawyer is good. If the in-house lawyer hasn’t worked with the outside lawyer before, the in-house lawyer wants a recommendation from a trustworthy source attesting that the outside lawyer under consideration is good.  If the in-house lawyer can’t find an outside lawyer he worked with, or who comes highly recommended, for a particular case, then the in-house lawyer is hiring blind.  

At that point, you’re playing percentages. You don’t actually know if you’re hiring a lawyer who’s any good, but the question is which of two candidates is more likely to be good. If you’re playing percentages, and have to pick between two candidates who are otherwise indistinguishable, who do you hire: The person who graduated with no distinction from a law school you never heard of — but who tells you during an interview that he’s great? Or the person who graduated at the top of his or her class from a great law school, served on the law review, had a great clerkship or two, and started out at an internationally renowned firm (and, of course, tells you during an interview that he’s great)?

Credentials don’t distinguish good lawyers from bad, but they can certainly influence people for a long time.

That may not be fair, but it’s the truth.

# Biglaw Firm Fires Back After Discrimination Lawsuit
## The firm denies the allegations of their former partner.

Last month, the Biglaw firm of Polsinelli was hit [with a discrimination lawsuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/polsinelli-sexual-harassment/). The case, filed by former equity partner Julia Rix, alleged pervasive sexual harassment over the course of her time at the firm. Rix says she was “‘warned’ about the prevalence of sexual harassment of women at Polsinelli,” and details a “workplace rife with mistreatment and impropriety—and a culture indifferent to the ‘situation’ given this ‘tone at the top.’” The suit also highlights “Polsinelli’s callous gaslighting of Rix in response to her claims of sexual harassment is shocking—but not surprising.”

But now, the Biglaw is fighting back. Last week, the firm filed its response in the form of a partial motion to dismiss and a motion to compel arbitration. The motion argues Rix’s employment contract requires claims be stated under Missouri state law, and that under that standard, they’d fail:

Defendants Polsinelli and [Gabriel Y.] Dabiri move under Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss Rix’s claims under D.C. law because Rix has failed to bring her claims under Missouri law, as required by the terms of her employment agreement; and under Missouri law, her state law claims fail for various reasons, including her failure to exhaust administrative remedies, Missouri law does not provide for individual liability, Missouri law preempts Rix’s tort claims, and her factual allegations fall short of the applicable pleading standard.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And the firm invokes their arbitration agreement with Rix:

The scope of the agreement is broad; it covers all claims related to the business, professional, or employment relationship between Rix and Polsinelli and any disputes about the terms of the employment agreement itself. The agreement to arbitrate is mutual — both Rix and Polsinelli agreed to bind themselves to resolve all disputes exclusively through arbitration. But for the recent enactment of the [Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act], all of Rix’s claims would be subject to binding arbitration.

The firm’s counsel, Laura De Santos of Gordon Rees, said Rix was not subjected to sexual harassment during her time at the firm. De Santos pointed to poor performance as the reason Rix was booted from Polsinelli:

“As our recent filing in connection with Ms. Rix’s lawsuit shows, Polsinelli does not tolerate harassment or discrimination, and Ms. Rix was not subjected to sexual harassment, a hostile work environment or retaliation while at the firm. With a proven record of over half of the firm’s senior leadership positions being held by women, Ms. Rix was surrounded by female leadership during her tenure, and the firm supported Ms. Rix for over two years with an abundance of resources.

Ms. Rix failed to deliver any of the portable business that she represented would follow her to the firm and never came close to meeting the performance requirements that she agreed to before she joined the firm.

Her poor performance is what led to the termination of her employment, not any complaint. Ms. Rix never voiced or filed a complaint until after the firm’s board of directors had voted to terminate her employment. After the decision by the board, Ms. Rix reported a vague complaint that did not include names, dates or locations of any of the alleged incidents she now claims occurred and she refused to even discuss her complaint with the firm. The first time the firm was made aware of any details behind her complaint was through her filing of this lawsuit.

We have since investigated her claims and are looking forward to proving that Ms. Rix was not subjected to sexual harassment, a hostile work environment or retaliation. The two attorneys she implicates in her complaint were her peers who were located in a different office and practiced in a different practice group. Neither was in a position to have any influence in, nor had access to, the firm’s evaluation of Ms. Rix’s performance or decisions regarding her compensation or the termination of her employment.”

Well, we made it.  2019 is upon us and this column can now officially be deemed a multi-year endeavor.  The beginning of a new year also means it is time to turn the page on some issues from the previous year, so I will [set](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/the-recruiting-game-done-changed/) [aside](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/what-are-we-doing/) discussion of the new NALP Principles… for now.

The onset of 2019 has been personally enjoyable because as of yesterday, I can use terms such as Speaker of the House, and the [subject of veneration by children](http://littlegreenfootballs.com/article/48721_Photo_of_the_Day-_Nancy_Pelosi), Nancy Pelosi; Congresswoman, and [pretty good dancer](https://www.thecut.com/2019/01/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-dancing-video.html), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; and unemployed while being [unpopular to a seemingly impossible degree](https://civiqs.com/results/ryan_favorable?annotations=true&net=false&uncertainty=true), Paul Ryan.

But for law students across the country, the end of the holiday season and the start of the new year means one thing: it is time for grades.  For 1Ls, this can be a particularly nerve-wracking period as not only will this be the first time they can see the potential fruits of their Fall labor, but also because of the outsized importance of first semester grades in the hunt for summer employment.  As I have promised now for several weeks, this is the first of a two-part series on how students, specifically 1Ls, should deal with the arrival of grades.  Today will focus on the good news, i.e., those who did well academically, while next week will discuss what do if you fell on the tail end of the bell curve.

However, before a student can know which of these two columns to read, they have to know their grades, which brings us to the first piece of advice: go ahead and look at your grades as soon as you can.  Look, I understand the impulse to try and hide from your grades.  Even if you have some level of confidence in your academic performance, until you actually take a peek at your transcript, a student can find themselves in a sort of [Schrödinger’s Cat](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bringing-schrodingers-quantum-cat-to-life/) situation in which their grades can be both good and bad.  It was just this thinking that led a certain author of this column to not take a peek at his 1L Fall grades until more than a month after they were available, and then only due to the urging/mockery of friends.  Such a delay was silly, not only because my grades that semester ended up being rather strong, but more so because it put me at a competitive disadvantage in the job market — though, despite the obvious flaws of this avoidance method, I replicated it the following semester; ah, the perils of youth.

For those students who have accessed their transcript and discovered a raft of top marks, the critical next step is to try and capitalize on this early success by attempting to lock in future job opportunities.  There are several ways to achieve this goal.  Many students who want to go into Biglaw see a strong first semester of law school as only part of the way to solve the employment equation, thinking that their brilliant Fall performance must be followed by an equally strong performance in the Spring in order to stand out come 2L OCI.  But as been discussed [at length in this column](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-fall-recruiting-season-part-i/), the recruiting cycle continues to shorten and while that might mean hiring 2Ls in July, rather than September or October, for many firms, more importantly, there has been a significant uptick in 1L summer hiring.  In fact, some firms have done away with 2L hiring altogether, instead seeking to pull from the first-year pool and bring those students in for two consecutive summers.  Such a hiring practice places primacy on first semester 1L grades, as those will be the only bit of law school academic performance available to employers hiring in the Spring.  While I personally have my doubts about the efficacy of such a recruiting posture, it is a phenomenon that is definitely on the rise.  If you are a student who did well first semester and want to go the firm route after graduation, see if there are any employers of interest who hire 1L summer associates and apply ASAP.

Such capitalization on a strong first semester can also take place outside the confines of Biglaw employment.  While the [nascent law clerk hiring plan](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/order-in-the-court-the-law-clerk-hiring-plan-returns/) is gaining some [momentum](http://www.scotusblog.com/2018/06/sotomayor-promotes-new-law-clerk-hiring-plan-at-acs-convention/), there are still a great many judges who hire clerks during, or immediately after, 1L.  If you know that clerking is something which appeals to you, take those strong first semester grades and apply to as many judges as possible in the Spring.  Even if you are on the fence about clerking — for those who are, go back and read my [previous opus](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/to-clerk-or-not-to-clerk-its-actually-not-much-of-a-question/) on the topic — go ahead and apply to judges and see what heretofore seemingly unreachable opportunities might now be very possible.  However, make sure you fully understand your school’s policy when it comes to turning down clerkship offers before applying to clerkships on a test case basis.

While not directly related to employment, I will note to those students who do well in the first semester, try not to advertise that fact too loudly and be cognizant of your fellow classmates who might be coming to grips with not excelling academically for the first time in their life.  A lack of braggadocio is the best policy not only because it is the most humane way to act but also because a strong performance in one semester does not guarantee equally strong performances in subsequent semesters.

Making it through the first semester of law school mentally and physically unscathed is, itself, an impressive achievement.  For those students who have managed to not only survive but thrive academically, take advantage of your high GPA while you can and lock in as many employment opportunities as possible, be it with law firms, judges, or really any legal employers.  While it might seem strange that a single semester of high academic achievement can be enough to excel, welcome to employment in the legal sector.

# On Introductions To Briefs That Are Both Generic And Harmful
## The fact that something is true doesn't mean that it's the perfect introduction to a brief.

When I give my “book talks” about [The Curmudgeon’s Guide to Practicing Law](https://www.amazon.com/Curmudgeons-Guide-Practicing-Law/dp/1641054336/ref=pd_lpo_14_t_0/144-3788773-6854967?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1641054336&pd_rd_r=61f38502-781d-47fb-a260-1970deea4a4d&pd_rd_w=AWqCy&pd_rd_wg=kFTh8&pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&pf_rd_r=YK5GGKBGTD85BA2P42XB&psc=1&refRID=YK5GGKBGTD85BA2P42XB) (affiliate link), I explain that there are three classic bad introductions to a brief.

The first bad introduction is an irrelevant chronology: “Plaintiff filed the Complaint on January 1. Defendant removed the Complaint on January 15.  Plaintiff moved to remand on February 1. Defendant opposed remand on February 15.”

If these dates have nothing to do with why the defendant’s motion to dismiss should be granted, why include the irrelevant facts? And why waste precious space laying out those facts in the introduction? The reader is thinking: “I’m three paragraphs into the brief; I’m bored; and I hate you.” That’s no way to win.

The second classic bad introduction is generic: “This is a case in which summary judgment should be granted!”

That could be the first sentence of any summary judgment brief filed in the history of American jurisprudence. Because it’s utterly generic, it’s utterly unpersuasive.

The third classic bad introduction is both generic and harmful: “Although motions to dismiss are infrequently granted, this case presents one of the rare exceptions to that general rule.”

What does that introduction tell the reader?

The standard of review is against me. I should lose. The rest of this brief is a lie.

That’s probably not the best way to start.

I then go on to explain in my book talks the characteristics of a good introduction.

Imagine my surprise several months ago when I received (or perhaps I simply imagined this; I’m not one to disclose attorney-client secrets) a draft brief (from one of the leading law firms in the country) that started with this opening sentence: “Although class certification is usually granted in [cases such as this one], this case presents a rare exception to that general rule.”

“My God,” I thought. “It’s a classic bad introduction! It’s both generic and harmful. Who would have expected such a thing from these lawyers?”

I dutifully wrote back: “Please think again about the introductory sentence. I’d like to start with one of the strongest arguments in our favor. I’m not sure that opening our brief by saying that class cert is usually granted in these types of cases fits that bill.”

The lawyers wrote back: “We understand your concern with the opening sentence, and we’ll see if we can replace it. But it is certainly true that class certification is usually granted in this type of case.”

Of course!

But the fact that something is true doesn’t mean that it’s the perfect introduction to a brief.

A thing could be true, but that thing could show why your motion should lose.  Perhaps that wouldn’t be the best opening sentence of a brief.

A thing could be true, but irrelevant. Perhaps that wouldn’t be the best opening sentence of a brief.

Many things are true.

Fewer things constitute good introductions.

Many judges won’t read intently beyond the introduction of your brief. Make sure you start in the right place.

Today’s topic: life as a real-estate lawyer.

1. What do you do in a typical day?

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
There is no such thing as a “typical” day in real estate practice. Each day varies depending on the type and stage of the transaction being worked on. Each transaction presents its own unique set of issues, so handling those issues generally dictates how a workday will unfold.

A typical day may include performing extensive due diligence, which would include reviewing title, surveys, third-party reports, and other items pertinent to obtaining a comprehensive legal understanding of the project. Other days may be spent drafting, reviewing and negotiating documents necessary to complete the particular transaction, such as loan documents, purchase and sale agreements, leases and other ancillary documents.

Closing a real estate transaction requires extensive coordination with the client and opposing counsel. Accordingly, lawyers may spend large chunks of time during the day discussing issues with their client or opposing counsel in order to properly document, negotiate and close a deal.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
It is common in large law firms for real estate transactions to be staffed with attorneys at differing levels of experience. Small transactions typically consist of one law firm partner, one associate and occasionally a paralegal. Larger transactions involving multiple properties may include, in addition to a law firm partner, multiple junior and senior associates, in order to timely meet the client’s expectations.

Accordingly, it is typical for a junior lawyer to work with a law firm partner or a more senior attorney during the course of a deal. A junior associate may be asked to sit in on conference calls that the partner conducts with the client or opposing counsel and in some instances, a junior associate may be asked to contact third parties directly to complete discrete tasks on a transaction.

Sometimes issues arise during a transaction that require the expertise and involvement of an internal lawyer from another field, such as tax, environmental or land use. When this is the case, the specialized lawyer generally assists the real estate deal team with guidance on the particular issue.

3. What does a common career path look like?

Most lawyers in this practice area will start out as an associate at a large or mid-size law firm to gain experience. The junior years are usually spent learning how to manage and close a transaction by assisting partners or more senior lawyers. As an associate becomes more senior and their skill set grows, it is common to pursue a partnership track at a law firm. A lawyer interested in making partner must be able to run transactions without oversight and will focus on developing their own book of business. Others forgo the partnership track and may transition to a smaller law firm or an in-house position for a client or other real estate company.

4. If variety is the spice of life, how spicy is this practice area?

Closing real estate transactions involves many moving parts, and each real estate project brings its own complexities and unique issues. Accordingly, there is quite a bit of variety and excitement in this practice area that lends itself to interesting new challenges on a daily basis. Closing a transaction requires extensive coordination, from reviewing title and surveys, to drafting and negotiating purchase agreements and loan documents. It also typically requires interaction with opposing counsel and other parties. For example, when closing an acquisition for a large retail shopping center filled with numerous anchor tenants, a lawyer may need to deal with large national retailers that are tenants in the shopping center. The interaction with multiple parties required to close a transaction helps keep this practice stimulating.

There are also intangible benefits that keep this practice interesting. After closing on the purchase, sale or refinance of a real estate project, it is rewarding to drive by the project and admire the fruits of your labor firsthand.

5. How much wear and tear?

Real estate is an extremely high-paced practice area. The demands from clients to close deals quickly can sometimes take a toll. Long hours and weekends are the norm for lawyers in this practice area in order to complete the diligence, drafting and negotiations required to effectively close transactions for clients.

6. Of the people in this practice group who hate it, what exactly do they hate about it?

The most common complaint relates to the long hours put in by practitioners in order to timely close transactions. Other common complaints involve the unrelenting pressure in large law firms to maintain high billable hours and high collections. These demands can take a toll on a lawyer over time.

7. Of the people in this practice group who love it, what exactly do they love about it?

Most real estate transactions have a discrete beginning and end. Consequently, lawyers in this area derive satisfaction from the fact that deals rarely linger and are completed over a period of months rather than years. In addition, each real estate deal has its own unique issues. Navigating these issues with clients presents its own challenges, but provides intellectual stimulation.

8. Are there common avenues out of this practice area?

While other practice areas are more fluid and offer numerous paths out of the practice of law, this practice area is somewhat limited. Some real estate lawyers will transition during their career from practicing law at a large law firm to an in-house position at a bank, insurance company, national retailer or other institutional real estate company. However, beyond the in-house track, there is not a natural progression from this practice area into other common career paths.

9. What are some market trends that impact this practice area?

This practice area is heavily impacted by general business cycles and trends in the economy. During periods when the economy is growing and interest rates are low, the real estate market tends to prosper, and there are a multitude of real estate acquisitions and refinancings. The emergence of commercial mortgage-backed securities financing for real estate projects has also helped fuel the growth in the real estate market. However, during recessionary periods, many retailers are reluctant to open new stores or expand their footprint, and lenders are cautious about making new real estate loans. These trends affect the pool of real estate transactions that occur.

10. If you had to recommend one candidate from a room crowded with recent bar exam graduates, what specific qualities would he or she have that would ensure success in this practice area?

Qualities necessary to ensure success in this practice area include attention to detail, the ability to anticipate issues, and the ability to provide guidance to clients to help navigate and close a transaction. The ability to juggle competing demands is also important, since many lawyers find themselves working on multiple projects at the same time and need to effectively prioritize their daily workload so that they do not miss critical deadlines.

# Raises And Bonuses Continue To Spread Throughout Biglaw
## Another firm has stepped up to the plate.

There’s a sense of jubilation spreading through Biglaw, and it has everything to do with raises. The ball started rolling with [Milbank earlier](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/milbank-raises-associate-salaries-and-announces-year-end-bonuses/) this month, but when [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/cravath-announces-raises-comes-over-the-top-of-milbank-scale-for-some-associates/) made waves this week coming over the top of the Milbank scale (for some classes), notice was given to the rest of Biglaw that they need to step up or get left behind.

And we have another firm making it rain for associates. Fried Frank, which brought in $958,430,000 in gross revenue last year, making it 53rd on the Am Law 100, has announced their compensation move. The firm has decided to keep up with the Cravaths of the world, and offer raises — and year-end bonuses — in line with the top-of-the-market rate.

The new salary grid at the firm is as follows:



There are also premiums on top of the standard bonus amount available at Fried Frank. Those range from $3,000 to $34,500, depending on eligibility criteria.

The full memo is available on the[ next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/fried-frank-compensation-23/2/)

# Major Biglaw Firm Slashes Parental Leave
## What an absolutely awful policy.

Talk about bucking a trend. Over the last few years, *the* story when it comes to [Biglaw parental leave](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/parental-leave/) has been expansion. Increasing the [number of weeks](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/clyde-parental-leave/), making the policy[ gender neutral](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/01/another-biglaw-firm-is-expanding-gender-neutral-parental-leave-for-all-employees/), ramp-up periods with a [reduced billing expectation](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/01/dorsey-parental-leave/) for new parents returning to work — just a whole host of ways to make being a parent and a Biglaw attorney at the same time more humane. And at a time when work/life balance is fueling lateral moves, this trend is mutually beneficial — helping attorneys at the firm through the growing pains of new parenthood and keeping them at the firm to the benefit of Biglaw.

But DLA Piper just went the opposite direction — today, they announced they’re slashing the parental leave offered by the firm by six weeks. As reported by tipsters:

DLA piper reduced its parental leave policy for non-birthing parents. Previously they offered 18 weeks to all parents. New policy provides 12 weeks of leave for baby bonding and 6 additional weeks of short term disability for attorneys who give birth.

Here’s the firm’s email on the subject.



This completely screws over adoptive parents, foster parents, fathers, and even birthing parents are taking a hit. There’s not been a change to short term disability/medical leave, so though birthing parents can still get to 18 weeks off by combining leave with short-term disability, they can no longer hit the 24-week threshold.

Seriously, this is all kinds of fucked up. Above the Law has been [tracking parental leave](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/family-leave-and-related-policies-by-firm/) in Biglaw since 2008 — this is the first time anyone at ATL can remember a firm taking a step backwards and actually cutting back on the amount of leave offered. What a terrible look for the firm.

Also, did DLA Piper learn absolutely nothing from the Kyte Baby [parental leave PR disaster](https://www.popsugar.com/family/kyte-baby-paid-leave-controversy-49335084)? The once-trendy baby brand screwed over an employee who was adopting a child. As a result, they’ve faced massive backlash.

I also can’t help but note how terrible the effective date for the new policy is as well. Any leave that starts after May 1 will be reduced. Can you imagine being seven months pregnant, having you and your partner’s paternity leave plan all figured out, and finding out now your partner has to go back to work six weeks earlier than you’d planned? When you have a newborn, six weeks might as well be a lifetime, and this throws all of those meticulous plans out the window.

Whatever monetary benefit DLA Piper thinks they’re getting from this new policy, it cannot be worth the bad will they’re sowing amongst their attorneys. This is absolutely the kind of thing associates leave firms over — because even if they aren’t immediately impacted by the change, it shows how little the firm actually cares about their non-partner attorneys.

# Biglaw Firm Doesn't Give Bonuses To First-Years
## If you work here, kiss some bonuses goodbye.

UPDATE (7/14/16 10:224 a.m.): Some associates are saying that a healthy touch of discretion in the policy makes it more tolerable than this suggests. Read on…

When we kick off our annual “Associate Bonus Watch” later this year, we’ll be furiously collecting and sharing the reported bonuses all across the legal landscape. But first-years at one firm won’t have any reason to celebrate. And we don’t just mean “first-years” in their stub year from mid-September on. This isn’t a story about a firm opting out of the traditional pro-rated bonuses for the new recruits. This is about a firm that does not pay bonuses to first-years for either their stub year or their full first year on the job.

After we reported on [Foley & Lardner’s confusing raise structure](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/first-years-get-raises-everyone-else-gets-a-warm-glass-of-confusion/) last week, some tipsters came forward to share that the “newly enhanced bonus program” that so many of our sources criticized is uniquely rough on the first-years:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
One thing the firm does is this: first-years are not bonus eligible. But nobody realizes this until after starting and working a few months. I didn’t realize until about halfway into my first year that first-years are not bonus eligible.

That’s tremendously rough on the first-years. Obviously the rookies aren’t contributing as much to the firm’s prosperity and clients balk at paying for what they view as “training,” but first-years still have bills to pay. Assuming Foley & Lardner matched the prevailing Biglaw bonus scale over the past two years, a first year would be shorted $20K compared to first-years at firms paying market (last year’s $15K plus $5K or so for a pro-rated, stub-year bonus). That’s certainly Foley & Lardner’s right, but prospective lawyers should be fully apprised of it, and our tipsters uniformly felt this compensation quirk was never really explained until it was too late.

Here’s the rub: Foley will “hold back” a first year if she doesn’t make her minimum hours, thereby paying her as a first year again during year two and AGAIN making her not bonus eligible. I made my hours as a first year, but I had been warned that if I didn’t make hours this would be my fate. I knew some who didn’t make their hours and were indeed “held back.”

Oh. Well, now that’s just cruel. Foley & Lardner has a reasonably lax 1900 minimum (as of last week), but there are a hundred ways an associate might miss their hours and there’s no need to punish them twice for it. Go ahead and keep this year’s bonus money, but don’t force them to do another year without the possibility of bonus just to earn the right to try to get a bonus the next year. I’m sure the firm is willing to waive this requirement sometimes on a discretionary basis, but for any prospects considering Foley & Lardner, they should be aware that they may need to be in someone’s good graces in case a billing disaster befalls them.

UPDATE (7/14/16 10:224 a.m.): Four associates or former associates wrote in about this policy, but two associates said it really isn’t as bad as it sounds.

I admit I was told a bonus was “rare” when I was a first year, but we were never told it wasn’t possible and, like I said, I know people who received one as first years. We generally have issues with how comp and promotion is handled by office/practice group

So with discretion and office-to-office variance, things aren’t as bleak for first-years as this may sound. Still, the possibility of missing your bonus for a year — or more — is scary even if there are safeguards against it.

# Am Law 100 Firm Restores Pay To Pre-Pandemic Levels, Keeps Special Associate Bonuses In Play

Back in July, around the time when Biglaw firms first decided to start partially or completely restoring the salary cuts they instituted due to the economic upheaval caused by the coronavirus, some firms announced they’d be offering bonuses for high billers during these uncertain times.

One of those firms was Ogletree, which had earlier [reduced pay](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/not-satisfied-with-unpaid-leave-am-law-100-firm-slashes-salaries-for-all/) for equity partners (by 20 percent), associates (by 15 percent), and highly compensated staff (by 10 percent) for the remainder of 2020. At the time, the firm announced that associates would receive special bonus payments of up to $20,000 combined, plus bonuses based on a percentage of their salary, based on their hours billed during 2020’s pandemic. Given that good news, we wondered if and when the firm would consider restoring employees’ pay to pre-COVID levels.

That time, apparently, is now.

Following the Labor Day holiday, [C. Matthew Keen](https://ogletree.com/people/c-matthew-keen/), Ogletree’s managing shareholder, sent out an email (available in full on the next page) letting everyone know that the firm’s August hours were “the best in recent history,” and that given the “positive trend,” salary reductions would be eliminated effective September 1, and the change would be reflected in upcoming paychecks.

On top of that announcement, Keen said that all previously offered bonuses are still in effect, and associates who qualify for these bonuses will be in really great shape, noting that “[m]ost of the associates who earn these bonuses will actually earn more compensation than scheduled before the pandemic.”

Great news all around at Ogletree. Let’s hope more firms decide to restore pay soon.

# Midlevels Are Actually Happy -- Ranking Associate Satisfaction (2016)

So, you are finally an experienced lawyer — well, a little experienced. As a midlevel, the bloom has been knocked off the rose, but you still want to be happy in your career — or at least satisfied. Unfortunately, you work in Biglaw. These two concepts may not be as paradoxical as they initially seem.

Enter The American Lawyer’s [midlevel satisfaction survey](http://www.americanlawyer.com/home/id=1202765213979). It turns out, midlevels are more satisfied than ever before. I guess ponying up the [MoneyLaw](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/moneylaw/) dollars really does have a ripple effect.

Now, let’s get down to the rankings — that’s what the hyper-competitive folks in Biglaw really care about anyway. The full list is available [here](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202765210936), but these are the Biglaw firms that make the top 25 in terms of midlevel satisfaction:

Yes, today’s column is about office chairs. While the topic is mundane, it is your throne during working hours. Some people spend more time with their office chair than with their families.

If you are reading this, then you are probably considering whether you should replace your current chair. So this column will explain when you should replace your current chair, how to select your replacement, and how much you should pay for it.

This column will not discuss ergonomics, improving posture, or relieving back pain. This is because I skipped gross anatomy class in law school. If you have back pain or posture issues, you should talk to your health care professional who can help you select an office chair that meets your needs.

When Is The Best Time To Get A New Office Chair?

Don’t wait until your chair breaks or becomes unusable. You will end up having to go to the nearest office supply store for something in a hurry. You might regret the decision later.  

The best time to purchase a new chair is when you simply want to upgrade your existing chair or when the old chair starts to become uncomfortable or sustains some minor damage. This way, you will have adequate time to research and test replacement chairs. Also, you can probably sell your current chair for a reasonable price or give it to someone who needs it.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
When reading various reviews and rankings of best office chairs, ignore subjective opinions on things like comfort. These anecdotal, “personal lived experience” opinions have little to no value because everybody is different. Just because the reviewer thinks a chair is comfortable does not mean it will be the same for you. Also, some of these reviewers may have received press versions from the manufacturers or other incentives that could also make such reviews suspect. Instead, focus mainly on relevant, objective information such as build quality, features, warranty information, style, and price.

Have A Seat

After doing research, you will probably have narrowed down your choices. The next and most important step is to test each chair before buying. Do not order an office chair online even if they offer a full refund. Ideally, go to a store specializing in office chairs — they will have a large and diverse selection. Also, their staff is likely to be knowledgeable and can provide advice and guidance. Another benefit of a specialty store is that if you like a certain chair, you might be able to buy and take that same chair home instead of a different version that may not feel the same.

Sit on each chair for as long as you need to. You should be able to sit on it comfortably for a few hours. Your feet should not be dangling and you should be able to access your desk with ease. The chair should recline to a comfortable position.

If you must share office space, you might want to check if the chair’s upholstery can absorb silent but deadly odors if that is an issue.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
How Much Should I Pay?

Office chair prices can range widely, from free to even over $2,000. (Amazon lists dozens of office chairs in the five-figure range. Good luck getting the office manager to sign off on that requisition slip.) Generally, you get what you pay for although established brand names are more expensive than unknown ones. More expensive chairs have a few advantages. They are generally made of more durable materials. They have longer warranties. Also, because the price of some brand name models increases every year, you can probably resell your chair for a decent price. Lastly, more expensive chairs come fully assembled while the cheaper ones are DIY. This could be problematic as some chair pieces are heavy and can be difficult to install. A shoddily installed chair will feel wobbly and have a shortened useful life.

In short, if you feel just as comfortable in a $200 chair as in a $2,000 chair, purchase the cheaper one, although you should expect to replace it in a few years. Alternatively, if you want to keep an office chair for life, then you are better off investing in the more expensive one.

Another option is to buy used. But this is a gamble. Individuals might be willing to haggle down their listed price, but the condition of the chair might be questionable. After all, the seller is getting rid of the chair for a reason, and chances are that the seller is not going to be completely honest. Unless the chair is being sold at a very low price, it might not be worth the time to meet the sellers, especially if they live far away or if the seller is giving a bad vibe.

The best way to purchase a used chair is probably by going to an office liquidator store. These places have a variety of gently used or refurbished furniture. However, discounts are likely to be smaller.

You could also ask your friends or colleagues if they are willing to sell or give away any unused chairs. You might be surprised — pleasantly — at the responses.

You will spend a lot of time in your office chair. So you will need to spend some time to search for the right chair that meets your personal needs and budget. The right one will make you productive and comfortable.

# Women Partners Share Disturbing Stories Of What It's Really Like To Work In Biglaw

The day I made partner (we had one tier at the time), one of my male partners came to my office to congratulate me. He closed the door and planted a big wet kiss on my lips and said, ‘I have been waiting for years to do that….now you can’t sue me.’

—A partner responding to a[ survey by the American Bar Association and ALM Intelligence](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/04/18/women-describe-their-experience-working-in-big-law-and-its-not-pretty-405-35599/) designed to look at the experiences of women in Biglaw. This is just one of many depressing responses the survey garnered. Another respondent said, “I had male partners when I was an associate grope me in the office and at firm events after they had been drinking and told me not to be upset. … In fact a shareholder told me I should be flattered and if I was ‘more appreciative’ of the attention, he and others were the shareholders who would one day vote on my partnership. When asked out, the male partner said I did not work for him specifically/not assigned so it’s OK. … I told him I did not date those I work with and I was engaged. He said to relax, kissed me and groped me and when I did report this the firm said they would transfer me to another office or I could live with it.”

You can hardly turn around without seeing a bold headline hyping the value of AI. Generative AI is the latest buzzword, but it is only one among many disruptive technologies emerging to provide value and contribute to our modern technological landscape. 

These nascent technologies present complex legal challenges that require careful navigation. Lawyers today must equip themselves to advise business clients on their coming implications. 

How will you advise clients on their use of emerging technologies? Let’s look at the critical role lawyers play in advising clients on the legal and regulatory issues they will face and explore some of the legal challenges nascent technologies pose.

The Lawyer’s Role In Advising Clients On Nascent Technologies

Every new technology comes with unique legal risks and opportunities, and lawyers are crucial for identifying potential legal issues. That’s because you have the knowledge and expertise to connect legal principles to business and technological concerns. 

You know how to examine the legal issues created by previous technological advancements and assess how the law may respond to new developments. Your experience can help you evaluate how legal principles may evolve. And you can carefully craft language that allows clients to see how laws and regulations that apply to new technologies affect business decisions and outcomes.

Unless you have an impressive technological background, you will likely need to learn about some of the intricacies of each new technology to determine how its algorithms, actions, and results fit within today’s legal frameworks, to help clients make informed decisions that support and encourage innovation while limiting potential liabilities; and to create effective policies and processes that address evolving legal challenges.

Potential Legal Challenges In Nascent Technologies

Some common areas of concern with new technologies include:

Intellectual property rights. New inventions and innovations may lead to questions around patent eligibility and ownership disputes. Corporate clients will need assistance navigating complex IP laws and applying legal precedents to protect company assets and resolve disputes efficiently.

Data privacy and security. Extensive data collection and analysis present privacy and security concerns. Competent legal advice will require up-to-date knowledge of applicable data protection laws and regulations to develop robust privacy policies that safeguard data.

Compliance with evolving regulations. A typical organization [uses 130 SaaS apps](https://www.bettercloud.com/resources/stateofsaasops23/), making manually tracking and reporting on usage and data generation impossible. Software solutions can help you and your clients stay current with new laws and regulations.

Focus On Client Needs

Various industries adopt new technologies at varying rates and apply them for various purposes, e.g., the health care industry uses AI differently than the marine wildlife conservation sector. 

Focus on learning how leaders in your practice area and your client’s industry use the latest technology tools. You can never go wrong honing in on client needs. Far from it! You’re in an ideal position to devise tailored strategies that help minimize operational disruption while empowering clients who want to use the latest technologies to grow their businesses.

I’ve noticed conservative Republican chairs more often eager to get back in the office. Many of those people are in the Southeast or Texas, but a few in Chicago and New York.

— an unnamed law firm consultant, commenting on [post-COVID Biglaw office reopening plans](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/08/28/whats-behind-some-pushing-to-get-back-to-the-office/) and the correlation between their geography and the politics of the region. The consultant also said they’d noticed that men seemed to be much more eager to get back to the office than women.

Ed. note: This article first appeared on our companion site Redline on September 9, 2015.

Ever wish you could jump in a time machine and experience other eras? Maybe take a stroll in a more glamorous era, and relish the period costumes? Well, in case you needed a reminder, the past wasn’t all that. At least not if you’re a woman. (The past was also pretty shitty for other oppressed groups, but aren’t today’s focus.)

We got our hands on a few pages of a Biglaw memo meant to answer internal questions about interviewing prospective lawyers for a position at the firm. The section details how to deal with “Lady Lawyers” and, oh boy, is it a doozy. The memo is from 1956, and… it was a very different time. Ike was president, Elvis Presley made his debut on the Ed Sullivan Show, a gallon of gas cost 22 cents, and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act banning discrimination in the workplace was still 8 years away.

As damning (and, wow, is it damning) as this carefully worded memo is, remember, the firm was, at the time, far from alone in its practices or opinions.

The firm desires to be candid about its preference for male applicants and yet not unnecessarily discourage the distaff side of our profession. We have hired women lawyers in the past and we currently employ one woman who is outstanding in the blue sky field.

Well, at least they’re honest, I guess?

It is, however, also true that the firm does not rate a girl applicant on equal terms with the men applicants.

Welp, there it is. Laid out in all of its discriminatory glory. Males get to be MEN while females are girls, and no matter what women do, they cannot be equal.

If the paper records are the same, the man is given preference, barring some personality defect, on the grounds that being a man, he has probably had extra-curricular experience in the business world which will be of greater use to the firm than the experience open to most girls.

Here’s a fun game: let’s try to think up what kind of “personality defect” would be so insurmountable that a MAN would actually be treated the same as a WOMAN? I shudder to think of the possibilities.

Where grades disqualify a lady applicant it is preferable and quickest to terminate the interview on this ground. If, however, except for her sex the applicant deserves an “8” or better, the firm’s preference for man should be candidly faced. The discussion can then be turned to whether the applicant wants to get a “general practice” job or would consider a specialty in trusts and estates, estate taxes or “blue sky”. The result of this exploration should be noted on the resume.

I’ve got to be honest, I never realized “blue sky” was considered the distaff side of the law (not that it would have radically changed my on-campus interview choices). And I’m shocked estate taxes is something they’re pushing lady lawyers into. I’d’ve thought such enlightened gents would want to keep the fairer sex away from numbers and figures.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Next, an option should be given to the lady applicant either to proceed further with the knowledge that she must overcome a preference for male associates or to withdraw and use her valuable time where such a preference may not apply.

Just look at the handy-dandy list of open-minded (or at least not openly discriminatory) law firms in the 1950s and you’ll see… not much. It is a neat rhetorical trick though, to present it like a choice. Get the pesky women out of your office, and make them feel like it was their idea.

The firm will probably not suffer from its preference for men if the desire to be candid so as to be fair to lady applicants is stressed along with the fact that the firm does not give a final “no” to lady applicants because it wants to stay flexible from year to year and review its position in the light of each outstanding lady applicant who appears. After such an applicant has seen one or two partners, the responsible associate should get them to decide what further disposition is in order.

And there it is: the naked self-interest that underlies the memo exposed. The firm engaged in this kind of behavior because they knew they would “not suffer.” It’s a bit of a shock to read this kind of undisguised sexism when the 21st variety tends to be more [unconscious](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/10/biglaw-memo-from-top-firm-advises-that-women-dont-giggle-dont-show-cleavage/).

# Don't Expect Smaller Law Firms To Raise Salaries Any Time Soon
## Biglaw is not a rising tide that lifts all boats.

This website and other legal news outlets have been discussing the salary increases in Biglaw over the past few months. Indeed, junior attorneys at some of the country’s biggest shops recently received pay raises, and starting salaries have crossed over the $200,000 mark for the first time. Even though Biglaw gets an inordinate amount of attention in the legal press, the vast majority of lawyers work at smaller shops. For a number of reasons, lawyers at smaller firms are unlikely to see pay raises any time soon.

Biglaw is not a rising tide that lifts all boats, and the salary decisions of Biglaw firms have little to no impact on smaller firms. As most people in the legal profession already understand, Biglaw attracts a different set of talent than other law firms. Indeed, Biglaw shops usually only hire from top law schools or top students that attend lower-ranked law schools. As a result, smaller law firms do not need to increase their salaries to attract talent since the talent pool that is headed to Biglaw typically does not look for jobs at smaller law firms. As a result, individuals should not think that increased salaries in Biglaw necessarily mean an across-the-board increase in salaries across all law firms.

Moreover, economic factors are perhaps the biggest reason why smaller firms are unlikely to raise starting salaries any time soon. Many law firms previously required an increased headcount in order to attend the court conferences and other appearances attorneys at a firm need to make on cases. Such appearances are often golden billing opportunities for law firms, and many firms are able to bill travel to and from such appearances as well. However, many of these appearances went virtual due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and lawyers missed out on the ability to bill for travel to and from these appearances. Moreover, at many of these appearances, the vast majority of the time is usually spent waiting for a case to be called. With scheduled virtual appearances, there is no waiting, and lawyers can bill a far lesser amount of time for such appearances.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As a result, many law firms had decreased billing opportunities during the pandemic, and accordingly, had a decreased need for headcount. This motivated some firms to make cuts, and the decrease in open positions made the job market even more competitive for those who were looking for legal employment. Accordingly, firms were able to attract talent with relatively low salaries because there were not too many other opportunities available. As courts reopen as the COVID-19 pandemic wanes, many appearances are still being held virtually, and this will likely be the norm for the next year or so, if not indefinitely. As a result, lower firm headcount might be here to stay, which may decrease the salary firms need to offer to attract talent.

Another reason why starting salaries and other salaries at smaller firms are unlikely to increase soon is because the job market may put downward pressure on salaries. As predicted by many people who lived through the Great Recession ([including yours truly](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/please-dont-go-to-law-school-because-of-covid-19/)), numerous people applied to law schools recently in order to ride out hard economic times caused by COVID-19 in academia. Although, it will of course take some time for these students to work their way through law school and become practicing attorneys, the increased number of law graduates will impact the job market in the near term.

Since more people will be graduating from law schools over the next several years, the job market is sure to be more competitive. The pandemic did not measurably lead to an increase in the number of available lawyer positions, and as a result, a higher-than-normal applicant pool will be chasing a steady or perhaps a decreased number of job openings. As a result, law firms will be able to offer relatively low starting salaries to attract talent. Indeed, there were many stories during the Great Recession of salaries for lawyers at some firms starting at $40,000 or less, even in cities like New York City, and this glutted job market may be on the horizon over the next several years.

Moreover, smaller law firms do not have as much of a “keeping up with the Joneses” problem [as Biglaw shops](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/some-law-firms-have-a-problem-keeping-up-with-the-joneses/) so they may not feel as much pressure to raise salaries. Biglaw firms generally like to offer the same salaries and other perks of top law firms so that they can be part of the class of shops that offer such compensation to associates. Indeed, sometimes firms offer such high salaries even though they might not be able to afford it since the image this generates about the firm is valuable. Smaller law firms are less likely to be impacted by what other firms are doing regarding compensation since these shops mostly rely on providing value to their clients rather than a brand name. As a result, smaller law firms may feel less pressure to raise salaries.

Of course, most people within the legal profession recognize that rising Biglaw salaries will not mean an increase in compensation industrywide. However, some industry outsiders and prospective law students might believe that higher Biglaw salaries mean a lucrative future as an attorney. Nevertheless, Biglaw jobs are very difficult to come by, and substantial salary increases at the vast majority of firms may not occur any time soon.

Arnold & Porter, a huge law firm rarely confused with Travis Porter, is about to [make it rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEsaGwCWIkQ). And with $961,900,000 in revenue in 2020, it’s not surprising that they’ve got the cash to match Cravath. Here’s their scale:



The big money will be retroactive to January 1st and will be reflected in the next month’s first paycheck. Talk about an April Fools’ Day! I wish I got tricked to the tune of a couple thousand.

# Biglaw Firm Lets Bob Cratchit Take Christmas Eve Off
## Wait... this was even in question?

Biglaw has a nasty tendency to bring out the worst in people. Combine the perfectionist mindframe of the legal profession with the pressures of a corporate machine and you can easily end up with some serious Scrooges. The grind never stops and lawyers are more than prone to drag everyone else down into the pit of their own dismal obsession.

Into this world, Sheppard Mullin has decided to shine a little bit of light:

Sheppard Mullin decided to give a little bonus to the staff by turning Christmas Eve into a paid holiday. It’s a small gesture but one our staff is pretty excited about.

On the one hand, good for Sheppard Mullin. Nobody needs to be working on Christmas Eve. Even in a law firm with a global reach, clients understand that nothing’s getting done that day so why force the staff to sit there all day to make their living wage.

On the other hand, “little bonus”? This kind of sounds like Stockholm Syndrome. It’s not really a bonus to tell people not to work on Christmas Eve. It’s literally the request that Ebenezer Scrooge denies in A Christmas Carol that signals to the reader, “Man, this guy is a total dick.” The fact that the staff is treating this act of basic courtesy as a gift says something terrible about how we all relate to our jobs.

Yet even worse is the fact that at least some Biglaw firms out there aren’t even capable of offering this kindness. Stay strong out there.

# How Is Biglaw *Really* Doing On Mental Health Issues?
## It's your turn to sound off!

After years — hell, generations — of ignoring[ mental health](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/mental-health/?rf=1) issues in Biglaw, it looks like the industry has finally turned a corner. It’s not like they’ve solved the problem, far from it, but it’s at least a part of the conversation now.

There’s been a proliferation of [programs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/01/biglaw-firm-forms-mental-health-task-force/) and [pledges](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/biglaw-firms-pledge-to-help-lawyers-struggling-with-substance-abuse-mental-health-issues/) all [designed](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/biglaw-firm-takes-big-steps-to-focus-on-attorney-mental-health-and-wellness/) to encourage lawyers to take care of themselves and their mental health issues. Given the [stigma](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/01/suicide-in-the-legal-profession-is-all-too-common-a-story/) mental health has long had in the legal industry, these are all great steps headed in the right direction.

But we have to wonder, while firms are certainly saying the right things about mental health, what’s it really like on the inside. We recently had a tipster come forward with stories of a Biglaw firm that says they care about mental health, but on the ground fall far short of such lofty goals:

One [Biglaw firm] in particular that signed onto the ABAs pledge to do better in [mental heath] and has moved forward with an initiative (that of course is well marketed all over the legal periodicals), yet still keeps on at least 1 partner who verbally abuses staff and attorneys on a routine basis. Attrition under this person is common as a result of burn out anxiety stress inability to balance work life etc. No surprise, the partner particularly targets and polarizes women. The most senior levels of the firm know of this issue yet do nothing.

So take our poll, and let us know — how are Biglaw firms really doing when it comes to mental health?
How Does Your Biglaw Firm Do On Mental Health Issues?

- Great mental health programs, feel encourage to use them.
- Aware some support exists, but unlikely to use it.
- Talks a good game, but still terrible in practice.
- No mental health support at firm.

A Biglaw defector firm that entered the scene with a bang is now limping away with a quiet whimper.

Back in May, [140 attorneys left Lewis Brisbois](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/becker-ranen-partners-defection-lewis-brisbois/) to join Barber Ranen, a boutique employment firm whose leaders, John Barber and Jeffrey Ranen, promised “something new, something fresh.” As it turns out, the only things fresh and new that sprouted from the firm were the [racist, sexist, and antisemitic emails](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/barber-ranen-offensive-emails/) that its leaders exchanged for years while working at Lewis Brisbois. Barber and Ranen soon [resigned from their own firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/barber-ranen-resign-racist-sexist-antisemitic-emails/), leaving its new leaders to [rebrand the firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/barber-ranen-daugherty-lordan-new-name/) as Daugherty Lordan.

Unfortunately, lawyers have been leaving the firm in droves ever since, including one of its new name partners. According to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/lewis-brisbois-defector-firm-loses-25-attorneys-marking-its-end), Daugherty Lordan just lost its final 25 attorneys and will soon be closing its doors. Here are some additional details:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
[I]n the ensuing weeks [following the firm’s rebranding], dozens of attorneys left for firms including [O’Hagan Meyer,] Ogletree Deakins, Gordon Rees Scully Mansukhani and Dinsmore & Shohl.

Daugherty Lordan is finalizing collections as the last remaining attorneys leave, according to a person familiar with the matter.

UPDATE: A spokesperson for Daugherty Lordan offered a statement on behalf of the firm:

“We thank our clients, colleagues, and families, whose overwhelming support helped Daugherty Lordan emerge and devise a path for its 150+ loyal attorneys and staff. Unfortunately, risk, uncertainty, and market conditions made it impossible for us to thrive as a startup. As a result, with the future of our professionals in mind, we entered into discussions with a number of firms to find stable homes for our talented group. We have achieved that goal and, although the Daugherty Lordan chapter is ending, we will carry the lessons of these past several months throughout our careers.”

What’s the lesson to be learned here? As noted by Zach Olsen, president of PR firm Infinite Global, when commenting on the [trove of offensive emails](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/barber-ranen-email-scandal/) that served as Barber Ranen’s undoing, “You don’t often see this level of misogynistic, racist, and antisemitic content because people—even horrible people—know better than to put things in writing.”

A question I often get asked from law students and young lawyers who are interested in going in-house is, “When is the right time?” or “When should I start looking?” And as much as responses like “It depends” are abhorred, it really is true. It depends on a number of factors. Timing can depend on the size of the company, the company culture, the market, your practice area, and — of course — you and what you want. I suppose a more frustrating but accurate response is that there isn’t necessarily a “right” time, and that timing is relative.

Generally, the prevailing opinion about going in-house directly from law school is that it is rare but not impossible. For example, I know a handful of colleagues who have been in-house their entire careers. At least three of them obtained in-house experience as law students through internships or externships. Two of them are actually my colleagues where I work, two of them happen to be in healthcare, working for hospitals, and one worked for a beverage company. I didn’t even know what going in-house meant as a baby lawyer — but if you know that in-house may be in your future, then interning or externing is definitely recommended.

I have one friend who went in-house at the tail end of five years. She shared that she was given the advice to go in-house around four to six years because you have more knowledge than you realize at that point; and, if you can get in at this juncture in your career, you have a lot of runway to start to develop your in-house career and resume.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
My personal experience is probably the most common — working in law firms, including Biglaw, for eight to 10 years before applying. I had confidence that I had seen enough and had enough experience to guide clients through issue spotting and risk analyses. I also had the maturity and self-reflection to know what I didn’t want in a career. At the same time, although it worked out for me, I don’t like to use my own story as inspiration for others because I didn’t intend to go in-house and only ended up here after rage-applying after a bad day.

I also know a handful of colleagues who were successful law firm partners with at least 20 years of experience who were looking for something different or had done a significant amount of work for a company as outside counsel before making the transition. What I love most about the common experience of those colleagues is that they weren’t escaping or running away from Biglaw but wanted to grow and try something new.

At the end of the day, while there isn’t necessarily a “right” time, most in-house postings prefer candidates with in-house experience, so it is important to get your foot in the door and start developing experience when you can.

# Biglaw Firm 'Outs' All Of Its Flextime Attorneys On Its Website
## This is unnecessary, and it could do a huge disservice to a worthwhile work/life balance initiative.

UPDATE (4/18/17, 8:20 p.m.): Please note the UPDATE at the end; there’s a difference between Littler’s “FlexTime Attorneys” and its lawyers who are on reduced schedules.

Many Biglaw firms tout their work/life balance policies, proclaiming to the world that attorneys who work at their firm will be able to work on flexible schedules on their own terms. But should those firms disclose to others the names of the lawyers who have decided to take advantage of those generous policies?

This is exactly what’s happening at Littler Mendelson. The firm identifies each and every one of its flextime attorneys [on its website](https://www.littler.com/people#qt-casesmart_people-ui-tabs2), all 74 of them (and unsurprisingly, the vast majority of them are women). Though the designation doesn’t apply to Littler’s full-time attorneys, the fact that the firm specifically calls out those who are part of the flex-time program could potentially be stigmatizing. [The Careerist](http://www.americanlawyer.com/top-stories/id=1202783562317/Should-Firms-Out-Lawyers-on-the-WorkLife-Balance-Track?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=7) has more information:

Littler shareholder Scott Forman, who created the flextime program, says it’s “designed for those looking for work/life balance.” He adds that means participants work “significantly fewer overall hours,” and that there’s “no expectation of client development, speaking engagements or article writing.”

The program was born out of the recession of 2008, explains Forman, when firms faced a market shakeout. He adds that the policy also acknowledges the reality that not everyone wants or can be a partner. …

And do clients think less of those lawyers on the flextime arrangement? Not at all, Forman says.

Why is there a need to specifically call out each of the attorneys who participate in this program on the website? After all, as Vivia Chen notes, “the term ‘flextime’ doesn’t have the greatest connotation. More often than not, it suggests a female professional who’s not fully vested in her career.” Lauren Stiller Rikleen, who consults on issues having to do with women’s success in the legal profession, agrees: “[It] signal[s] that there is still some stigma attached that the workplace may be trying to get past.” An anonymous female associate who spoke to Chen thought that the policy of outing attorneys participating in the program on the website was a “horrible idea,” offering this comment: “It basically is saying to the world of clients that I won’t be always available for you.”

That unnamed associate has a great point. By listing all of its flextime attorneys on the website, Littler is essentially giving its clients an excuse to request that these attorneys aren’t staffed on their cases — they’ve already been given notice that the attorneys won’t necessarily be dedicating all of their attention to the matter.

We’re of the opinion that law firms shouldn’t out attorneys who want to partake in these work/life programs. They’re being specifically offered so that associates are able to retain some semblance of a life outside of working hours (not to mention the fact that they’re being offered to remain competitive with other firms). Give your associates a chance to succeed under the auspices of these policies before giving clients a reason to refuse to work with them. Publicly outing your flextime attorneys in this manner could prove to be a huge disservice to your firm’s work/life balance initiatives.

UPDATE (4/18/17, 8:20 p.m.): We received this statement from Littler shareholder Scott Forman, founder of the Littler CaseSmart program, after the publication of this post:

The blog post in American Lawyer completely mischaracterized Littler’s FlexTime Attorney (FTA) program and showed a lack of understanding of the difference between our FTA position and our policies for offering reduced schedules for associates / shareholders. The FTA position is a distinct position within our Littler CaseSmart platform that we recruit for both within and outside of Littler – it is not a “policy” that we apply to lawyers who want reduced schedules.

If associates or shareholders are on reduced schedules, we do not note that on their biographies, nor should we. However, since FTAs are a separate and dedicated position, we do feature them on our website. Our FTAs are an important part of our team and the service we provide to clients, and we believe that not showcasing them on our website would say something about their value within the firm.

It is unfortunate that these pieces advocate for keeping attorneys who choose alternate career paths behind the scenes, rather than focusing on the positives that firms are now offering more options for attorneys beyond a traditional associate / shareholder role. To be sure, alternative career paths, such as Littler’s FTA position, help capture a diverse group of individuals back into the workforce who otherwise might be excluded due to their personal life circumstances.

# Biglaw Firm's Hybrid Reopening Policy Will Allow Lawyers To Control Their Own Schedules
## The firm also has a voluntary vaccination policy.

People are looking forward to having the ability to come back to the office, but there is a real desire to have flexibility built into the new office work model. We have found that lawyers and others at a firm can work at a very high level to support the clients outside of the office in other settings.

[W]e do anticipate that most of our lawyers and consultants will work two or three days per week on average in the office, from the firm office or client location or traveling for client service. This is all evolving. I don’t think any of us could predict what the environment will be even two months from now, so you have to show flexibility.

— [Andrew Kassner](https://www.faegredrinker.com/en/professionals/k/kassner-andrew-c#!#tab-Overview), co-chair of Faegre Drinker, in comments given about [his firm’s hybrid work schedule](https://www.law.com/thelegalintelligencer/2021/07/20/faegre-drinker-to-roll-out-hybrid-work-schedule-after-labor-day-with-flexibility-in-focus/), which is set to commence after the Labor Day holiday. As part of the plan, lawyers will be able to choose their own work schedules, and staff will work all remotely, all in-office, or a combination of the two. Faegre Drinker currently has a voluntary vaccination policy, in that those who are fully vaccinated may request exemption from the firm’s mask mandate, while those who are unvaccinated must wear masks unless alone or taking a socially distanced meal/beverage break. All employees in the office must complete daily health screenings.

# Milbank Raises Associate Salaries And Announces Year-End Bonuses!
## Welcome to the $225,000 compensation scale!
By [Kathryn Rubino](https://abovethelaw.com/author/krubino/)

Bonus season has officially begun! Today, Milbank announced its annual year-end bonus scale. That’s great news for associates who learned that, despite the economic uncertainty at some Biglaw firms, at Milbank things are just fine.

The bonus grid, as noted below, matches the scale of last year’s bonuses for each class. And these bonuses are given to associates without a billable hours requirement, which is wonderful news.



But there is even BETTER news in Milbank’s announcement (available in full below). They’re increasing the base compensation for all associates — to the tune of $10,000 — effective January 1,2024. Looks like Milbank *enjoys* being [compensation leaders!](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/)



Well, that is a bold move that runs counter to many of the [dire predictions](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/biglaw-firms-just-dont-want-too-many-first-year-associates/) folks have been making about the industry. It will be VERY interesting to track which Biglaw firms are able to pony up this additional cash and stay on the top of the compensation heap.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks for all of your help!

# A Look At The Money Jones Day Partners Really Make
## Given the firm's legendary secrecy, it's nice to have some concrete numbers.

Dana Baiocco

Listen, under the Trump administration, it’s tough out there for a liberal (or moderates with a sense of dignity). So, when there’s an unexpected upside to the reign, you’ve got to take the happiness where you can get it. No, of course it doesn’t in any way “make up” for the myriad of shitty things that are going on, but it’s nice. Like finding a shiny penny in the street in the middle of an otherwise awful day.

So it is with Donald Trump’s pick for the Consumer Product Safety Commission, Jones Day partner, [Dana Baiocco](http://www.jonesday.com/dbaiocco/). The firm is [notoriously tight-lipped](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/) about compensation, calling it a “black box,” so our readers are always [thirsty for more details](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/) on what goes on behind the scenes. As part of the nomination process, Baiocco has submitted a [financial disclosure](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4109570/Baiocco-Dana-final278.pdf) and now we know she reported earning $1,224,132 in partnership income. As [noted](http://www.law.com/sites/nationallawjournal/2017/10/16/jones-days-dana-baiocco-trump-pick-for-product-safety-agency-reveals-partner-pay/) by Law.com, her anticipated partnership share and JD capital account have also been valued (though we only get a range for those):

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Baiocco’s financial disclosure, posted by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, said she expects to receive $250,000 to $500,000 in anticipated partnership share. She valued her Jones Day capital account at between $250,000 to $500,000.

Partner paydays at Jones Day [can vary widely](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/more-peeks-inside-the-black-box-of-jones-day/?rf=1), as the firm only identifies one class of partnership, equity partners, though not all of the partners participate in the firm’s profits. That nifty little bit of doublespeak makes it difficult to track exactly who makes what, though [according to sources](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202779428361/A-Quiet-Law-Firm-With-a-Famous-Client), the average JD partner makes over a million dollars a year, while the partners who are getting part of the profits are clocking in at around $2 million.

Given the firm’s legendary secrecy, it’s nice to have some concrete numbers.

# After Jerking Around Associates, McDermott Raises Salaries
## It's all fun and games until someone takes money out of your pocket.

Earlier today, we heard that members of the management committee of McDermott, Will & Emery were gathering, which at this stage in the game led everyone at the firm to expect to hear about money in the very near future.

After all, the firm had already [generously opened its coffers](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/biglaw-firm-increases-cash-for-first-year-bar-stipend-ahead-of-summer-exam/) to benefit young lawyers this summer, so there was no way it intended to stiff them in the world of the new salary normal.

Then this happened:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Everyone expected the salary bump announcement after the management committee meeting ended at 2 PM central. At 2:05 we get an email from the cochairs with subject “Announcement”…. The email is about how the cochairs are stepping down effective 12/31.

Maybe not as big of an F.U. to the associates as [Vedder Price offered the other day](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/law-firm-fakes-out-its-associates-over-pay-raises/), but nonetheless a faux pas. And the cryptic “Announcement” header? People accuse this website of clickbait headlines, but seriously? Firm co-chairs [Peter John Sacripanti](https://www.mwe.com/en/team/s/sacripanti-peter-john) and [Jeffrey E. Stone](https://www.mwe.com/en/team/s/stone-jeffrey-e) had to know what they were doing. Congratulations, everyone in the firm immediately read about your impending departure from the captains’ chairs.

One reason we can forgive and even laugh about the antics of Sacripanti and Stone is that unlike Vedder, they rectified the situation a few hours later. The firm [just announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/after-jerking-around-associates-mcdermott-raises-salaries/2/) a complete Cravath match up through the Class of ’09 receiving $300K. Beyond that, the compensation of senior lawyers will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, but “in no event will their base salary be less than $300,000.” One tipster said the firm has to do this because of compensation similarities with income partners.

Summers aren’t mentioned in the memo, so the jury’s still out on them. UPDATE (6/15/16 6:24 p.m.): Apparently the summers are on retreat right now and were told in person that they would be getting the raise.

# Yet Another Biglaw Firm Delays Its Reopening Without Announcing A New Return Date
## It's looking more and more like the firms reopening in 2021 will be few and far between.

One by one, firms both small and large have been forced to revise their return-to-office plans due to COVID-19’s hyper-contagious Delta variant. Many firms that once hoped to host reopenings en masse post-Labor Day found themselves rolling those plans back to an October date. Now, with October nearly here, those plans are being changed once again, and formal 2021 reopening dates are simply not being announced.

Loeb & Loeb, ranked 99th in the most recent Am Law 100, with $385,271,000 gross revenue in 2020, is the latest firm to follow this model. The firm’s original reopening plan was quite accomodating for associates and staff, recognizing that flexibility is key to work/life balance. The firm planned to begin the second phase of its return on October 18 (after already pushing those plans back from just after Labor Day), and now plans for phase two are being scrapped once again.

In a memo sent on Friday by Kenneth Florin, the firm’s chair, informed all employees about Loeb’s decision (emphasis added):

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As you know, we had hoped to begin Phase 2 of our reintegration plan on Monday, October 18. Unfortunately, given the continued uncertainty created most acutely by the Delta variant, we have decided to postpone our more robust return to the office.

Knowing exactly when we can bring everyone back together safely and comfortably in our new reality remains incredibly difficult. It depends on many factors, including whether we see another surge in cases in the coming months, if schools remain open, or, on the positive side, if we begin to see a sustained decline in rates of infection. These and other developments are incredibly difficult to predict, so, at this time, we are not setting a new return to office date. We do, however, pledge to provide you with at least three weeks’ advance notice of our planned return date once it is determined so that you all have time to make any necessary arrangements for family or personal responsibilities.

“The pandemic has kept us apart for much longer than any of us expected,” Florin continued, “but continuing to support one another despite this distance will fortify our bonds so that, when we do eventually come back together in our hybrid working environment, we will be ready to move forward with a common purpose.”

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

# Partners Should Make It Easier For Associates To Bill Hours
## Some firms have a penny-wise and pound-foolish approach to billing.

Associates at law firms often have numerous other tasks in addition to billing hours to clients. Indeed, associates often need to deal with expense reimbursements, time entry, and other administrative tasks that can make it difficult to bill as many hours as possible. However, some law firms do not provide their associates with any relief that could make them more efficient at billing hours. Law firm managers need to think about inefficiencies their associates might experience and ensure that it is as easy as possible for associates to bill hours.

When I was an associate at various law firms, I was surprised at how partners would not lift a finger even though it would make it much easier for associates to devote additional time to billing hours and earning more revenue for the firm. For instance, I used to travel in various associate attorney roles, and that required me to submit expense reimbursements. Sometimes, I would appear at depositions, court conferences, and the like for multiple clients, and the clients would only be billed their proportionate share of the expenses. One firm I worked at had a program where we could list all of the clients associated with an expense report at the beginning of a submission, and the program would automatically split up the expenses between the clients without any further calculations.

I later worked at a different firm that did not have this functionality. As a result, I needed to divide the amount of every expense by the number of clients and make an entry for each one of the clients. For instance, if I paid $1.50 on a toll, and I represented three clients at a court conference, I had to make three separate expense entries of 50 cents each. This required much more work than I was used to, since I needed to literally grab a calculator (not for the toll example though), write down all of the calculations, and input the many entries.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
I told partners at the firm that I was spending considerable time on expense entries and that another firm at which I worked had a system that made the process much easier. The partners related that they had spent substantial money on the expense reimbursement program and could not change the program or ask the vendor to add functionality. As a result, each month, many of us spent hours that could have been been used completing tasks for clients on calculations and expense entries that might have been easier if the firm used a different program or updated the existing program with better functionality.

Sometimes law firms establish procedural hurdles as well. For instance, at the beginning of my legal career, I worked at a law firm that required all phone calls, photocopies, etc. to be billed to specific clients. Before using the phone, people needed to input a long client number. Associates sometimes lost time looking up the relevant number for what was a quick phone call. In addition, attorneys would have to input a client number on a tiny screen at the copier before they could make duplicates.

At some point, the law firm decided that they would stop charging clients for local calls and print jobs under a certain number of pages. This was welcome news to associates. I am willing to bet that the increased productivity of associates more than made up for the marginal amount of expenses the firm endured by sucking up the cost of smaller copying jobs and local phone calls. This relaxed policy was also good for morale since associates hated completing tedious procedural tasks before they could complete assignments for clients.

In any case, every law firm has inefficiencies in the way they conduct business that can impact how easy it is for associates to bill hours to clients. Law firm managers should think about some impediments to efficiency in their own shops and ensure that associates can spend the most time possible billing hours and producing revenue for a firm.

# The Wall Between Lawyers And Non-
## When you move from a corporation to a law firm, you'll have to train yourself to re-learn a certain basic truth.

It’s odd:

I started my career — lo, those many years ago — as a law clerk. In 1983-84, in the chambers of The Honorable Dorothy W. Nelson of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, people were people. About a half dozen of us inhabited those chambers — the judge, three clerks, one intern (at a time; there were several across the course of the year), and two secretaries.

And we were all people. When we ran out of sugar for our coffee in the morning, someone ran downstairs to buy more. Sometimes it was the judge (yes, really). Sometimes it was a clerk. Sometimes it was the intern. Sometimes it was a secretary.

Everyone knew the judge was in charge, of course. (Nobody ever called that place the chambers of Mark Herrmann.) But we were all colleagues, working together to pursue a common goal. No one would have considered trying to pull rank on someone in those chambers.

(I know that all chambers were not created equal, and I assume that others have had clerkship experiences that didn’t resemble mine. But that’s how mine worked. In fact, I recently attended the “35 years on the bench” party that Judge Nelson’s current clerks arranged for her, and it’s pretty clear to me that nothing has changed over the course of the decades.

Well, almost nothing: Who were all those young kids running around, claiming that Judge Nelson was their judge, too?)

Anyway, I then went to work at a small firm in northern California. And at that firm, in the 1980s, people were people. The receptionist’s boyfriend batted cleanup for our pitiful softball team. The secretaries were part of the team. Neil Falconer (a pretty important fellow at Steinhart & Falconer) made a point of chatting with the cleaning woman who arrived every night to straighten out the offices: “Noreen is the only person who’s been employed by this firm longer than I have. She’s dedicated to the firm and her job, and we couldn’t get by without her. And she’s a delight.”

I naturally spoke to my buddies who worked at big firms, and I eventually worked for one, and I surely roamed the hallways (sometimes for weeks at a time) of many of our Biglaw co-counsel. Those places typically didn’t feel too much like the spots were I had spent my early years. (Frankly, my former Biglaw home may well have been better on this score than many of its peers. I worked in the Midwest, which is often less stodgy than the Northeast.)

As a general principle, however, there’s a chasm at big law firms between partners and associates. And an abyss between associates and staff attorneys. And a gap between staff attorneys and legal assistants. And perhaps even a thin line between legal assistants and secretaries, receptionists, and the many other people who breathe Biglaw air.

If our presidential contenders need advice on building a wall between the United States and Mexico, I suggest they chat with Biglaw partners. Those guys know how to build an Iron Curtain between lawyers and non-lawyers that would put Stalin to shame.

(In my year between college and law school, I worked as a legal assistant at a big accounting firm. The lawyer for whom I worked was an alum of one of the fanciest Wall Street firms. He sat me down on my first day at the office: “At my law firm, the secretaries referred to the lawyers as ‘Mr.’ or Ms.’ [[‘Ms.’ was finally becoming an accepted term by then](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ms.) — even at stodgy firms.] ‘How can I help you, Mr. Smith?’ The lawyers naturally called the secretaries by their first names: ‘Jane, could you take that call?’ But you, Mark, are a paraprofessional. I don’t know whether you should call me ‘Mr. Smith’ or ‘John.’ On reflection, I guess you can call me ‘John.’ Yes, that will be acceptable.”

I knew it was gonna be a long year.]

Like I said, big law firms draw a line between lawyers and non-. And people pull rank all the time. (Sometimes that’s explicit; sometimes it’s implicit. But it’s constant.)

Now I’ve meandered away from a law firm and into a corporation. And, once again, people are people.

That doesn’t mean there’s no hierarchy at a corporation. Far from it: Everyone knows who reports to whom and who’s running the joint. And people perform their roles, which is a gentle way of pulling rank.

But, when we think about corporate initiatives — we must give everyone open and honest performance reviews; we must strive to improve all of our colleagues’ job satisfaction — we’re not talking only about the professional staff. We’re trying to improve the job satisfaction of everyone — lawyers, legal assistants, administrative assistants, and everyone else.

People who arrive at in-house jobs from big law firms are occasionally surprised to learn this. I recently heard of a lawyer who went to a corporation (not mine) and was dumbstruck by the new environment: “We should invite the administrative assistants to our meeting about improving job satisfaction? Why?”

Because people are people.

When you move from a corporation to a law firm, you’ll have to train yourself to re-learn that basic truth.

— [Joshua Galper](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-p-galper-2a98932/), co-founder of crisis management-focused law firm [Davis Goldberg & Galper](http://dggpllc.com/), commenting on the fact that the Latham & Watkins statement as to [Bill Voge’s sudden resignation as chair](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/latham-watkins-chair-resigns-over-sexual-messages/) was [so vague](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/03/21/latham-had-no-choice-but-to-remove-voge-industry-watchers-say/) that it left open the question of what behavior the firm found to be inappropriate in the first place.

But Guthrie’s bravura performance should have come as no surprise. Although morning shows like Today can be fluffy, with their celebrity interviews and cooking segments—[s’mores cream pie](https://www.today.com/video/make-s-mores-without-the-campfire-using-these-recipes-118278725908), anyone?—Guthrie is a veteran journalist with a hard-news background. Before joining Today in 2011, she racked up more than a decade in local and national news, covering everything from the Martha Stewart trial to Sarah Palin’s vice-presidential campaign to the Obama White House.

Here’s the other reason I wasn’t surprised by Guthrie treating Trump like a hapless witness during cross-examination: she’s a lawyer by training. After graduating from Georgetown Law, magna cum laude and Order of the Coif, she worked at Akin Gump, then scored an offer for a federal judicial clerkship—which she turned down to pursue her news career. Her career in the law, while not long, was impressive.

Earlier this month, not long after Guthrie’s grilling of Trump won the [Emmy Award for Outstanding Live Interview](https://www.today.com/video/savannah-guthrie-s-interview-with-trump-wins-emmy-122266181969), I had the pleasure of interviewing her about this less well-known part of her background. We spoke for almost half an hour via Zoom after a taping of Today (in which she [interviewed William Shatner](https://www.today.com/news/william-shatner-details-historic-trip-space-today-show-rcna3010), 90, about his recent trip to outer space, among other things). Still wearing her make-up, she sipped periodically from a giant bottle of Pellegrino as we discussed her journey from law student to lawyer to host of Today.

As co-anchor of the Today Show, Savannah Guthrie has what is a dream job for many. She meets and interviews some of the most important and interesting people in the world. She’s famous, beamed into the houses of more than three million people every day. She’s paid very nicely for her work, better than most Biglaw partners. How did she get here?

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

According the 2022 Partner Compensation Survey by Major, Lindsey & Africa and Law360, Corporate partners reported the highest percentage increase in compensation in 2021. But what percentage did their compensation climb?

Valentine’s Day is this weekend, and what better way to celebrate love than to give associates what they love most? Money!

It’s a bit late in the game for Biglaw firms to be announcing bonuses, but it’s standard operating procedure at some firms, especially when announcing bonus information for offices outside of New York.

We’ve heard that New York associates at Morrison & Foerster got their bonus news before the New Year, and that all associates outside of the Big Apple have been anxiously awaiting their bonus cash since then. Today is payday for patient MoFo associates, and now they’ll be able to spend their Cravath matches — plus a little extra on the top if they were high billers (2500+ hours) in 2015 — on gifts for themselves and their loved ones.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Here’s the 2015 Morrison & Foerster bonus scale for all associates outside of New York:

Class of 2015	$15,000 (prorated)
Class of 2014	$15,000
Class of 2013	$25,000
Class of 2012	$50,000
Class of 2011	$65,000
Class of 2010	$80,000
Class of 2009	$90,000
Class of 2008 (including prior years)	$100,000
In the bonus memo, firm chair [Larren Nashelsky](http://www.mofo.com/people/n/nashelsky-larren-m) elaborates as to how much more high billers will receive. The full MoFo 2015 bonus memo is available on the next page.

[T]he Firm will pay an additional amount to those associates who had the busiest years, which we are categorizing as 2,500+ hours. For 1st through 3rd year associates, the high hours bonus will be $5,000, and for 4th year and more senior associates, it will be $10,000.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Associates at the firm seem to be generally happy. Here’s what some of them had to say:

- “I feel like it’s hard for firms to win on the issue of hours based performance bumps. Personally, I support doing something to recognize those people that had to work exceptionally hard without overly encouraging people to strive for crazy hours by giving high incentives to hit those crazy hours.”
- “High billers are upset with the high threshold for a bump (2500+ hours) and the paltry amount even if you hit that. The 2300 or 2400 hour billers are irritated. And anyone who barely met hours is, of course, thrilled.”
Congratulations on your hard-earned bonuses, MoFo associates. You’ve had a while to think about how to spend your cash, but if for some reason you haven’t decided yet, we hear that loan repayment is an especially romantic Valentine’s Day gift for lawyers.

If you have compensation news that we haven’t covered yet, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus%20News) or text us (646-820-8477). We’ll continue to keep you informed this bonus season.

# Troubled Biglaw Firm Searches For Merger Partner

Another law firm needs to be rescued?

For months, King & Wood Mallesons, one of the largest law firms in the world by total lawyer headcount, has been plagued by troubling news. From flat revenue to (ultimately halted) capital calls to partners heading for the exits, the firm knew it needed to take action to prevent worse damage from being done to its European and Middle Eastern business.

In search of a white knight to rescue it from certain doom, it looks like the firm has settled on Morgan Lewis & Bockius as a potential merger partner. As we all know, Morgan Lewis is no stranger to heroics in the face of law firm failure — after all, the firm accepted hundreds of attorneys from the now defunct Bingham McCutchen in a mass lateral hire just a few years ago.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Per U.K. publication [Legal Business](http://www.legalbusiness.co.uk/index.php/lb-blog-view/8143-exclusive-morgan-lewis-holds-talks-with-kwm-as-camerons-circles), the firms had been talking for quite some time:

A Morgan Lewis partner has told Legal Business that talks to combine with KWM had been on and off for months but KWM had been eager to press ahead with conversations in recent weeks. With 520 equity partners, the top 20 US law firm has a profit per equity partner (PEP) of $1.54m and revenues in 2015 of $1.84bn. In contrast KWM has over 550 partners around the world and PEP of $900,000.

It is understood that the talks were led by Morgan Lewis chair Jami Wintz McKeon and involved the possibility of a multi-profit centre union using a Swiss verein structure initially to “test the waters.”

Unfortunately, those talks have stalled since KWM funds partner Michael Halford resigned from the firm about two weeks ago, along with several other senior partners. Although Halford had been central to the discussions, they have not yet been completely called off. The Morgan Lewis partner who spoke to Legal Business seemed confident about the potential combination’s promise, noting that while KWM had surely spoken to other firms, “I think they liked us best.”

Will Morgan Lewis be able to save the day for yet another damsel firm in distress? For the sake of King & Wood Mallesons, we certainly hope so. If you have any information on this potential merger, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=KWM%20Morgan%20Lewis%20Merger) or text us (646-820-8477). Thank you!

# Gunderson Announces Summer Bonuses -- Your Move Am Law 100!

Those of you who remember the great salary hike of the late 90s may remember that the great revolution in associate salaries wasn’t kicked off by Cravath or Simpson, but by Gunderson Dettmer. Gunderson’s quest for top-notch talent led them to take a bold first step that changed the legal landscape for a decade. It looks like they’re ready to make the first move again.

We’ve not heard much about summer bonuses this year. [Perkins Coie technically announced a summer bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/biglaw-summer-bonuses-have-arrived/) but they were already behind last year’s compensation so that was more of a catch up. Couple that with news this week that [almost 70 percent of Biglaw](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/70-percent-of-biglaw-firms-are-not-on-board-with-190k-for-first-year-associates/) chose to sit out the great Milbank-Cravath-Simpson salary and bonus cycle and it didn’t sound like associates were going to be getting any paydays any time soon.

But about an hour and a half ago, the firm sent around an email informing all U.S. based associates that they’ll be getting something extra for their troubles this summer. The breakdown is…

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Class of 2018 – From $5,000 to $6,500
Class of 2017 – From $7,500 to $10,000
Class of 2016 – From $10,000 to $13,000
Class of 2015 – From $15,000 to $20,000
Class of 2014 – From $20,000 to $26,000
Class of 2013 – From $25,000 to $32,500
Class of 2012 – From $25,000 to $32,500
Class of 2011 & earlier – From $25,000 to $35,000

Associates must be on track for a 1900-hour year to receive the lower bonus amount and 2100+ hours to get the upper bound. If they miss out now, they’ll get them on the back end if they make annual hours.

A great way to start Memorial Day weekend.

# The Top Biglaw Players Who Are Still Holding Out On Raises
## There are a lot of firms that haven't matched the market salary -- but these firms are facing more vocal pushback from their associates than most.

July 1 has come and gone, and at this point, we have to wonder if [the firms that haven’t raised](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/by-any-metric-these-firms-really-should-have-raised-associate-compensation-by-now/) will ever come around. It’s not necessarily a sin not to raise. As we pointed out in 2016, a lot of firms simply shouldn’t be trying to match the Cravaths of the world, and there’s no shame in staking out a price point below that elite echelon.

That said, these firms really have a hard time convincing their associates that they shouldn’t be getting raises. And the associates are letting us know that they’re getting mighty frustrated.

For example, Boies Schiller, a firm that positions itself as a market leader on compensation, but by all accounts, that image is [fuzzier than it first appears](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/boies-schiller-bonuses-appear-to-underperform-market-but-not-everyone-notices/). The firm employs a complicated formula to determine associate compensation that can earn attorneys huge paydays, but that tipsters say results in midyears often earning less than their peers.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Given the nature of the Boies compensation scheme, perhaps a boost in base pay won’t really change the bottom line for associates, but given the complaints that have piled up over the last couple of bonus cycles, the firm should probably tells its lawyers something about how they intend to make them whole by the end of the year. This is, after all, the top firm [measured by profitability](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/by-any-metric-these-firms-really-should-have-raised-associate-compensation-by-now/?rf=1) that hasn’t moved yet.

No one really expected Greenberg Traurig to run to the front of the raise pack. They’ve already told the world why they [can’t afford to pay their people any more](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/greenberg-traurig-explains-why-its-too-cheap-to-raise-associate-salaries/) despite being the top firm by revenue that still hasn’t joined the market. Greenberg is by no means Cravath, falling way off the rankings when it comes to profits per partner, but it ranks 26th in profitability and could easily issue raises in at least its big market offices. And yet… nothing.

Kasowitz took the associate-friendly step of [moving up their bonus announcement](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/kasowitz-does-right-by-its-associates/) last year, but that love hasn’t carried over to providing an answer — one way or the other — when it comes to associate raises. Last raise cycle, Kasowitz [announced matching raises right before the July 1 deadline](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/in-before-the-wire-another-firm-raises-salaries/). Apparently the modest cost of living increase is turning out to be too much for them.

Locke Lord is at least looking at raises. Sort of.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The only update from the firm on whether Locke Lord is even considering matching the scale and/or issue summer bonuses (which is highly unlikely) came through the Associate Committee (ironically, made up of associates), who took it upon themselves over the weekend to inform the associates that the firm told them that a sub-committee of the Board of Directors is reviewing proposals to restructure associate compensation in response to associate and partner concerns regarding the current compensation system and are re-looking at proposals “in light of recent announcements by other firms.”

So that sounds encouraging. Still, the firm is falling behind some of the other Texas firms that raised their salaries in time for the July 1 deadline.

Fish & Richardson is barely cracking the top 50 in profits per partner, but associates there certainly are restless, hitting us up multiple times over the last two weeks to complain that they’re beginning to feel like the firm plans to move forward without raises despite trying to play in the same recruiting pool as a number of firms that jumped at the new scale.

This is, obviously, not an exhaustive list of the firms that haven’t raised yet, but it is a list of the most vocal of the jilted associate bases from firms that have hard cases to make for holding out.

Will we see some action from one or more of these firms before the upcoming July 13 payday? We’ll see.

# How Do Firms Move Up The Food Chain?

Michael Allen

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors. [Michael Allen](http://www.laterallink.com/about/team/1) is Managing Principal at Lateral Link, focusing exclusively on partner placements with Am Law 200 clients and placements for in-house attorneys.

Although there are a number of ways law firms can move up the food chain, the most important methods are to attract and to retain profitable partners.  It’s simple.  Partners are expected to generate income for the firm — either by servicing firm clients or by generating new business.   Attracting and/or retaining partners who can achieve the latter, i.e., those partners who control client relationships, is how firms either move up or down in the food chain.

Firms should address the issues causing partners to consider a move upfront and resolve them before the partner makes the mental commitment to look elsewhere.

Common concerns are typically related to client conflicts, (i.e., the firm picks a course that presents a conflict — legal or business — to a partner’s practice), compensation, associate staffing (i.e., whether the associates in the group are strong enough to satisfy the client’s expectations), upward mobility (climbing the ladder or getting passed up), recognition (who is receiving credit), and personality conflicts (enough said), to name a few.

To give you a better idea of how volatile the lateral partner market is for the major Am Law 200 law firms, just in the prior rolling 12 months, we have seen 1,952 lateral partner moves.   For example, Greenberg Traurig has hired the most — around 65 partners to date — followed by Lewis Brisbois at 63, then Holland & Knight at 44, K&L Gates at 42, and the list goes on and on.

Unsurprisingly, Cravath, Milbank, Wachtell, and Sullivan Cromwell have hired none.   The reason is because these firms, at least for now, are at the top of the food chain given their steady flow of institutionalized business (where no single partner really controls much of the firm’s revenue).

That said, the other 190 or so firms in the Am Law 200 list do not realize the benefit of institutionalized clients supporting their profitability. Instead, they need to continue to attract and retain profitable partners to help move the firm up the food chain.

Every gain for one firm typically means a loss for another (unless the partner moved from in-house or the government back to a law firm).

So how does a firm best attract lateral partners?

Let’s first dive into more detail regarding what firms want specifically, and by that, I mean the chair driving the strategic plan.  I can give you the perspective from a legal recruiter.  I sit down with decision-makers all the time who have a top priority in mind.   The message is clear:  bring partners who keep themselves (and a few associates) busy from work that they generate on their own.   That means the partner is responsible for generating in excess of around $4mm in portable business at firms where they bill out at $800 / hour (and maybe $2mm at firms where they bill out at much lower rates).  This is what is in the mind of most law firm chairs.

Firms have a few ways to effectively satisfy their lateral partner appetite, or in other words, the desire to increase accretive revenue in their top line, and presumably the bottom line as well.  We see firms with operation margins ranging between 20%-60% across the Am Law 200 law firms — the variance mostly tied to leverage and rates, not so much operating costs.

If a law firm has an appetite to grow, and they are serious in their commitments, we expect decision makers to be able to articulate their strategic plan.   Although we are retained exclusively to assist a few closer clients on their searches, we oftentimes prefer to work on contingency basis, as it’s a candidate driven market.   That said, relationships are very important for us, and even more important for the firm trying to capture our interests.   For firms that really want to see results and drive the process, I foresee more and more movement to the retained world in the legal space, somewhat closer to the Korn Ferry and Heidrick & Struggles world of executive search.

For more information about the market in general, or strategic advice how your firm can play more competitively in the lateral partner game, please feel free to reach out to me or one of my colleagues specializing in partner search.

These are challenging times for the legal profession, especially [Biglaw firms and lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-covid-crisis-law-firm-layoff-tracker-whats-your-firm-doing-to-survive/?rf=1). But in-house counsel are [not immune](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/advice-for-in-house-attorneys-that-have-lost-their-jobs-to-covid-19/) from the downturn, with many lawyers at major companies [losing their jobs](https://www.law.com/2020/05/21/ubers-legal-department-faces-losses-as-company-cuts-positions-pivots-focus-in-response-to-covid-19-292-67625/) as well.

Contrary to the view of some Biglaw lawyers, in-house life is not some sort of professional paradise. In-house lawyers face many of the same challenges that their counterparts at law firms face, including layoffs.

That said, there will always be many Biglaw attorneys who wish to jump to the client side. Even during the current crisis, there are some in-house jobs out there. And once the current tough times are behind us, there will be even more such opportunities.

How can you get an in-house legal job? Here are three tips.

1. Network, network, network.

Yes, this advice is clichéd, but that’s because it’s true. Many of the best in-house positions get filled through networking. Sure, a Fortune 100 company looking for a general counsel might hire a headhunting firm to fill the role (and here at Lateral Link, we are happy to help companies find in-house talent). But a startup or emerging company looking for its first GC — a job that many Biglaw lawyers view as their “dream job” — will often fill it with someone known to a founder or someone in the founder’s network.

As longtime ATL columnist and in-house lawyer Mark Herrmann correctly [points out](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/07/inside-straight-landing-an-in-house-job/), networking is no guarantee that you’ll find that job, but it certainly increases the chances. So even if you’re fairly happy at your current law firm, you should let your network know that you would be open to the right in-house opportunity if it came along. If your network doesn’t know, then they might not mention it to you when they see a great in-house job, thinking (erroneously) that you are firmly planted at your firm.

And when thinking about who’s in your network for this purpose, don’t draw the circle too tightly, e.g., by limiting it to your closest friends. Research shows that people frequently find new jobs through their [weak ties](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2016/08/17/to-get-a-job-use-your-weak-ties/) as opposed to their strong ones. And of course you should try to expand your universe of connections — through networking.

2. Check the major job sites on a regular basis.

Whenever I meet an in-house lawyer, I ask her how she landed her job. And despite the importance of networking, as just discussed, you’d be surprised at how many in-house attorneys found their positions through responding to online postings — on sites including but not limited to [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/), the [Association of Corporate Counsel (ACC) jobs board](https://jobline.acc.com/jobs), [GoInhouse](https://www.goinhouse.com/), [Monster](https://www.monster.com/), and [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/).

Not every in-house legal job gets posted on such sites, but the ones that do get posted are (for the most part) real jobs. When I helped a friend of mine, the GC of a small but publicly traded pharma company, find a deputy GC last year, I posted the position on both LinkedIn and ACC.

When you’re slammed at work because of a deal or trial, it can be difficult to remember to check these sites. But the problem is that sometimes the best in-house opportunities are advertised online only for a limited time. Set a calendar reminder for yourself to check for online in-house jobs at a certain time each week or every other week and try to stick to it, even if you’re extremely busy.

3. Situate yourself at an in-house “feeder firm.”

When it comes to sending their lawyers into in-house jobs, not all firms are created equal. And perhaps surprisingly, it’s not the most prestigious firms that are the best at generating in-house exit options.

In fact, many of these firms are rather poor at preparing their lawyers for the in-house jump. These firms often engage in highly specialized work, while many corporations want their lawyers to have some breadth in their knowledge and skill sets. Also, the top firms often focus on “bet the company” deals or cases — but companies are often looking for lawyers who have familiarity with the more typical events in a company’s life cycle.

So if you’re at a firm that doesn’t seem to send many lawyers into in-house positions, consider moving to a firm that does — i.e., an in-house “feeder firm.” One of the most common ways for a Biglaw lawyer to make the transition to in-house life is to join a client, and in-house feeder firms are those with the best track records of sending their lawyers to clients (or to similar in-house opportunities). A knowledgeable legal recruiter can help you identify — and get hired by — an in-house feeder firm, so you can eventually move into the in-house job of your dreams.

If you’re already in-house and looking to add to your legal department, whether on a permanent or temporary basis — in times of tight budgets, hiring temporary lawyers on a contract basis can be especially attractive — recruiters can help as well. For assistance with your in-house hiring needs, please reach out to [Monique Burt Williams](https://www.laterallink.com/team/monique-burt-williams), who recently assumed the role of [CEO at Cadence Counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/introducing-monique-burt-williams-new-ceo-of-cadence-counsel/), the in-house division of Lateral Link.

Folks polish their credentials, and their egos, when they draft their résumés.

Maybe there should be a rule: If you’re going to draft a résumé, you must simultaneously draft an anti-résumé.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Just to keep your ego in check.

Let me give an example. I knew a litigator (now retired) who bragged about his or her credentials in an online bio: “Has spent more than a year of [his or her] life in trial.” Blah, blah, blah.

In truth, the defense lawyer had tried only one case in his or her life. The case happened to involve a long trial — it ran for more than a year. At the end of the trial that he or she had defended, the jury awarded more in damages than the plaintiff’s lawyer had requested in closing argument.

Any sensible client would look at that experience and think: “That’s not the kind of lawyer that I’d like to hire.” But all you know from reading the résumé is “spent more than a year of [his or her] life in trial.” That sounds like an experienced trial lawyer.

The anti-résumé would be more honest: “Has tried only one case in [his or her] life; served as defense counsel; and the jury awarded more in damages than the plaintiff’s lawyer requested in closing argument.”

Even if you’re not obligated to post the honest description on your firm’s website, maybe you should be obligated to write it up, just to keep your ego in check.

Everyone could write an anti-résumé.  At one end of the spectrum, an anti-résumé would say:

Northwest South Dakota Law School, the only place that accepted me.

More “thank the lordy” than “cum laude.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Law review:  What’s that?

But you’d see the same thing at the other end of the spectrum:

Top 14 Law School  (Yale rejected me).

Note editor, law review (I applied for editor-in-chief; I was rejected).

Federal appellate court clerk (I applied for a Supreme Court clerkship; I was rejected).

And so on.

You’d have to list all your legal failures: All the trials that you’ve lost. All the appeals that went the other way. All the arguments you’ve neglected to make and only noticed after the case was over; questions you asked poorly at deposition, depriving your client of a chance for summary judgment; questions that you neglected to ask at deposition, depriving yourself of ammunition at trial; big clients that you could have landed, but you didn’t say the right thing at a beauty contest; whatever.

Everybody has embarrassments in their past; the anti-résumé is the place to collect them.

Are you a partner at a big firm? Not the managing partner, I bet.

Oh — you’re the managing partner? At what firm? Where’s that firm on the Am Law profits-per-partner list?

Oh — you’re the managing partner at a great firm? Have you applied for any judgeships? Run for political office? Hinted at your desire to become the general counsel of some company? Succeeded in obtaining for your firm all the things you’d hoped? Think honestly about all of your disappointments, and put them in your anti-résumé. It’s good for the soul.

Are you a general counsel?

At that company? Couldn’t you do better?

Oh — that is a good company. Why aren’t you the CEO? When have you embarrassed yourself in legal advice you’ve given?

Think about all of the cringeworthy moments in your past and all of the disappointments that you’ve suffered.

# Where There's A WILL, There's A Way Bigger Bonus
## Firm informs associates that it's beating bonus scale... but in a black box.

We hate black-box compensation over here at Above the Law. It’s not just that it robs us of our ability to report, it robs the whole legal industry of the ability to get a clear picture of the landscape. Everyone’s better off knowing what everyone’s getting.

That said, a lot of black-box employers endeavor to pay even more than market compensation. Which is nice. The problem is we never really know. If everyone gets shorted they may think they’re the only ones and never talk about it. That’s why we like to explode these black boxes whenever we can.

Still, if a firm has to go this route, it helps when it adds a little extra transparency to give us a general sense of what’s up.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
McDermott, Will & Emery — number 24 on the Am Law 100 with $1,381,814,000 in gross revenue — informed associates that it will pay out special bonuses according to the Davis Polk scale, but would otherwise pay individualized bonuses. Though the memo makes it sound like associates will be pretty happy about it.

As we round out 2021, our regular year-end bonuses, which will be paid on 2,000 bonus-eligible hours and class year, are above the Cravath scale.

And for big billers, it sounds like they’ll be way above the scale. For those billing over 2,000 hours, which the firm reports includes a “significant majority” of associates this year…

These Associates will earn, on average, $40,000 more than the purported “top” of market firms, where Associates are generally expected to bill significantly more hours. Those in the upper quartile will earn, on average, $85,000 more.

# The Abusive Boss
## Being abused by a boss can affect your mental AND physical health -- and the cycle of abuse leads to more abuse.

This post isn’t about sexual harassment, although the behavior I am talking about is harmful, and sexual harassment is a component of it.  And it isn’t about my current dean and associate dean, who I think are awesome.  In case you were wondering.

This post is how a mean boss can take your mental health away from you, even if the behavior doesn’t rise to the level of harassment.  And, this is a discussion of how one’s self-esteem and competence can be destroyed by a thousand cuts from such a boss.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Tales of senior partner abuse of associates run deep in the whispers of the legal profession.  Some tales extend generations.  The tales have common themes and characteristics.  It’s the boss who [screams at you](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/abusive-partners-are-still-a-problem-firms-have-a-hard-time-facing/) in front of others; questions whether you are competent to handle even basic tasks; takes credit for your efforts while knifing to your back with other partners; micromanages your every move; controls your time by religiously only sending you tasks when they hear the rattle of your keys as you are about to exit; gives you feedback that isn’t constructive, but rather is designed to question your competence and destroy your confidence; or watches you in the creepy “Every Breath you Take” kind of way to assure you are on task or not otherwise gaining support from others.  There are many ways for a boss to [bully](https://www.workplacebullying.org/individuals/problem/definition/) you, and there are many [degrees of dysfunction](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2015/02/04/how-dysfunctional-is-your-boss/) in how a boss might treat you.

[Research](https://hbr.org/2016/06/why-some-bosses-bully-their-best-employees) suggests that your level of competence doesn’t matter in terms of whether or not you experience workplace abuse.  You could be gloriously good or average and the abusive boss doesn’t discriminate, although the reason for the abuse might be different.  For the average, it might be the abusive boss’s frustration about your perceived level of competence.  For the gloriously gifted, it might be because the abusive boss feels threatened.

And there is a lot of advice out there about dealing with abusive bosses.  Much of it bad, and in the form of “suck it up.” Work harder.  Maybe try being super nice to the bullying boss.  Those of us who have dealt with bullies as a kid know how well that advice works.

There is literature that suggests that fighting back will make things worse, while trying to kill the bullying with kindness won’t help. If you lash out at your bulling boss, you might catch more hell.  But abusive bosses didn’t respond to their employees being nice or empathetic either, according to [research](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2015/10/16/have-a-horrible-emotionally-abusive-boss-heres-what-not-to-do/).  Thus, one can be trapped in a [cycle of abuse at work](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26011719), just as there are cycles of abuse in other relationships.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Being abused by a boss can affect your mental AND physical health.  The headaches, the ulcers, the exhaustion, the panic attacks, the sleepless nights, the dread as you enter work in the morning, the dread every time you check your emails, the dread when your phone rings, the potential to abuse drugs and alcohol to escape the abuse, and the questioning every decision in your life.  The cycle of abuse leads to more abuse.  As you deteriorate, you make yourself more a target for the abuse.

Law firms are starting to take employee [mental health seriously](https://www.law.com/2019/06/17/law-firms-tackle-mental-health-one-initiative-at-a-time/).  They recognize the potential such issues might have on their bottom line.  There are workshops and other measures designed to ease the frustration of law firm life.  But I couldn’t seem to find an article that says “law firm takes bullying seriously!”  So, for many, it’s like saying to someone who has been repeatedly yelled at to have a massage between screams.

So, what can be done?  Sadly, I don’t have the answers.  Well, I do, but telling law firms to stop abusive partners from being abusive is not likely to gain traction.  And many who are in this field don’t think that law firms are willing to [give up](https://www.law.com/2019/05/30/is-the-legal-industry-ready-for-a-culture-shift-on-mental-health/) the cycle of abuse.  Firms priding themselves on lawyers willing to work long hours and sacrifice their bodies and minds to the cause means that firms don’t pride themselves on having lawyers who are happy and more productive because of it.

That’s a problem.  And at the moment, it’s a problem without a solution.

There is an old saying in psychology:  The person who broke you cannot fix you.

# Have You Considered Not Lying Under Oath?

How much continuing power should a judge have over the lives of defendants who plead guilty? A judge recently forced a woman to [withdraw and apologize for statements](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/hey-judge-i-thought-that-state-compelled-speech-was-a-no-no/) diverting blame for an incident that she’d admitted to in court. A January 6th defendant is in hot water for the same thing. Prosecutors use overcharging and the ordeal of trial to leverage defendants into pleading guilty but a guilty plea has to mean something, doesn’t it? Also, we discuss whether Biglaw has a cancel culture problem ([it doesn’t](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/biglaw-isnt-a-cancel-culture-its-a-business-that-cares-more-about-money-than-your-feelings/)) and Judge Ho’s case research ([it’s bad](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/judge-ho-domestic-abuse-gun-rahimi/)).

# Boies Schiller's Corporate Group Finds A New Home
## This sounds like a win-win situation for all involved.

David Boies

We recently [drew your attention](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/on-the-future-of-boies-schiller/) to a seemingly offhand comment made by [Jonathan Schiller](https://www.bsfllp.com/lawyers/jonathan-d-schiller.html), co-founder and managing partner of Boies Schiller & Flexner, in an interesting [interview](https://www.bsfllp.com/lawyers/jonathan-d-schiller.html) with David Parnell for Forbes. Schiller suggested that the litigation powerhouse would, sooner or later, part ways with its small but successful corporate practice.

Make that sooner. This just in, from the [American Lawyer](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202781245993?slreturn=20170214135843):

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Paul Hastings is poised to hire the bulk of Boies Schiller Flexner’s corporate group as the firm winds down the practice.

“I think this was a very successful move,” firm chairman David Boies said Tuesday. “It enables the corporate group to better serve their clients and I think they’ll continue to expand and grow with a corporate platform that has a greater scope and scale. At the same time, it will enable the firm to concentrate on its litigation practice, which has always been [its] core.”

This is why the move makes such sense. As discussed yesterday, Biglaw firms are [focusing](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/ropes-gray-splitting-with-around-100-lawyers-and-staffers/) on their [cores](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/project-rightsize-strikes-again-another-office-bites-the-dust/) with all the avidity of Pilates students. And the transactional practice at BSF, accounting for about 10 percent of the firm’s revenues, was never its center of gravity.

Boies Schiller had been mulling over the fate of its corporate practice for about a year. Here’s how the deal came together:

Two months ago the Boies Schiller lawyers preparing to depart retained Laura Corrao, Robin Miller and Lauren Wiesenthal—name partners at New York-based recruiting firm Corrao Miller Wiesenthal Legal Search Consultants Inc.—to help refine their search. Within five weeks, Paul Hastings emerged as the leading candidate to acquire the group, something that Boies Schiller partner Robert Leung attributes to the firm’s strong energy practice in Houston, as well as its sports, media, entertainment and technology capacity in California.

“We decided that we needed to really grow to a much large critical mass and to have a bigger platform with much broader transactional capabilities to compete in this ever competitive marketplace,” Leung said. “So we’re definitely excited at the new challenges and the opportunity to work with all the folks at Paul Hastings [and] to continue what we have been doing.”

Rob Leung, by the way, is one major reason I’ve been aware for quite some time of the Boies Schiller corporate practice (which not everyone knew about, given the firm’s focus on litigation). He’s my fellow Yale Law grad and a prominent figure within the Asian-American legal community, having served as [president](http://conference2014.aabany.org/speaker-lineup/robert-leung/) of the Asian American Bar Association of New York (AABANY) in 2010.

The [BSF partners moving to Paul Hastings](https://www.paulhastings.com/news/details/?id=1603ec69-2334-6428-811c-ff00004cbded) in New York include Robert Leung, Mike Huang, Stefan dePozsgay, Jason Hill, and Russell Franklin. They will be joined by several associates. Christopher Boies, son of David Boies and head of the practice, will be going in-house to a client of Boies Schiller. (As noted by Am Law, other BSF deal lawyers have already found new homes — six in South Florida [have moved over to Pillsbury Winthrop](http://www.dailybusinessreview.com/id=1202778587352/Pillsbury-Opens-Miami-Office-With-Six-Boies-Schiller-Lawyers?slreturn=20170213175631#comments), to launch a Miami office, and Covington & Burling recently picked up transactional tax partner [Ansgar Simon](https://www.cov.com/en/professionals/s/ansgar-simon) as of counsel in New York.

Congratulations to Boies Schiller Flexner, Paul Hastings, and the dealmakers making this move. Boies Schiller is used to winning, and this deal sounds like a win-win for all involved.

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)
Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

Welcome back to [The Pink Ghetto](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-pink-ghetto/), a series where we take a look at some of the most appalling stories from one of the most sexist industries in the world: the legal profession. Today, we’ll take a look at more instances of the sexism and sexual harassment women are subjected to in their careers as lawyers. These are real emails that we’ve received from real readers.

When you see things like this happening, say something. Together, we can inspire the change necessary to stop this disturbing behavior from being so prevalent in the law. We owe it to ourselves and future generations.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
I was in my first year at a small litigation firm in a major city, after doing government work for five years. I got pregnant shortly after I started. I was due about a month after my one-year anniversary. I received 12 weeks of leave, no pay. No associates received pay for leave, no matter their year. I had every intention of returning to work, ideally part-time, but I was open to telecommuting a couple days a week or other arrangements. The partner I worked closest with was on board to work something out with me, but did not have discussions about it with any of the other partners. Prior to my leave, I was told I had to meet with the managing partner. He told me that, in his experience, “girls like me” don’t come back after having a baby. I assured him I planned to return and had done nothing to indicate otherwise. A couple weeks into my leave, the partner I worked for had a stroke and was hospitalized. The firm was unwilling to work anything out with me in his absence, having not known of our discussions prior to my leave. I wasn’t making enough to offset the cost of childcare if I went back full-time. I resigned, and looked for a new job.

That year, two other women besides me got pregnant, after no attorney getting pregnant for a number of years. One returned to work full-time. The other quit.

I began working at an Am Law 100 firm in October of 2014. I went to orientation in Atlanta with the other first-year associates. A partner took the first year associates out to dinner and drinks. At drinks, he began rubbing my leg under the table. I kept moving my leg away, but he kept doing it. Finally I turned my entire body so he could no longer touch me. He finally left. I was in shock because this was my third day of work straight out of law school. That night – just 30 minutes or so after this interaction – he put me on a case with them. Throughout that first year, he continued to try to touch me at firm events or say inappropriate remarks. He targeted the other female first year associate as well, and would ask her out on dates. He continued to monopolize my time and by the end of my first year, I was almost exclusively working on his cases. I had catalogued every inappropriate interaction, and reported him to HR. He got a big promotion that year. All I can say is that I am no longer working with the firm. I now have my own practice, but it was took a while to land on my feet again.

# Biglaw Leader Expresses Doubts About A&O Shearman 'Merger'

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Let’s be real. It’s not a merger, it’s an acquisition. They can say what they want, but [Shearman] had problems. Debt, pension plan overhang and partners leaving all play a part.

— An anonymous law firm leader, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/06/14/from-neithers-first-choice-to-substantial-benefits-for-both-firms-big-law-leaders-react-to-proposed-ao-shearman-merger-405-123949/) on the recently announced [merger between Shearman & Sterling and Allen & Overy](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/shearman-sterling-allen-overy-merger/). Aside from having doubts about this combination being a merger in name only, the law firm leader said of Shearman and A&O joining together: “Coming off two broken mergers, they likely come into this with more intent and purpose. They won’t let little things get in the way and screw it up.”

On Friday a putative class action lawsuit was filed against Biglaw firm Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP. At issue is a March data breach, which the [complaint ](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/WerleyvOrrickHerringtonSutcliffeInternationalLLPDocketNo323cv0408?doc_id=X7JGCOQ42QD85VPCVS7BS33EFB7)alleges exposed the personal data of 153,000 people.

Data allegedly included in the breach includes names, addresses, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers. The plaintiff, Dennis Werley, says the firm failed to put adequate measures into place to prevent the breach, and failed to provide timely notice of the breach.

Werley and class members have suffered damages in the form of an increase in spam telephone calls, an increased risk of fraud and identity theft, invasion of privacy, reduced value of personal information, and lost time and out-of-pocket costs incurred mitigating the effects of the breach, the complaint said.

The complaint pleads claims of negligence, negligence per se, breach of fiduciary duties, breach of confidence, breach of implied contract, invasion of privacy, and injunctive/declaratory relief.

The firm has not commented on the class action.

# Legalweek And ABA TECHSHOW 2022 Round Up: Connecting In Person For A Change
## The many benefits of connecting in person far outweighed any reservations that I had about socializing face to face.

Over the past two weeks, I was fortunate enough to attend two of my favorite legal technology conferences, in person and back to back: ABA TECHSHOW in Chicago and Legalweek in New York City. Normally these conferences occur two months apart, but due to the spread of the omicron variant, Legalweek was postponed this year and occurred one week after ABA TECHSHOW. This date change resulted in a whirlwind of what felt like nonstop networking and parties — with very few facemasks in sight.

A Jarring, But Fun, Transition

After two long years of pandemic-related social distancing measures, it was absolutely wonderful — albeit a bit jarring — to connect with close friends and colleagues face-to-face. On the heels of years of isolation, it felt incredibly surreal to socialize in large crowds of mostly maskless people. The culture shock was real, but overall the many benefits of connecting in person far outweighed any reservations that I had about socializing face to face.

I wasn’t the only one who struggled to reconcile my conflicting feelings about the conferences. A few of my fellow legaltech colleagues shared their perspectives on the wonderment and weirdness of finally meeting up in person at the conferences, including [Bob Ambrogi](https://www.lawnext.com/2022/03/the-legalweek-2022-conference-a-return-to-the-old-normal.html), [Stephen Embry](https://www.techlawcrossroads.com/#:~:text=and%20the%20Law-,It%E2%80%99s%20Not%20LegalWeek%20Unless%20It%20Snows,-By%20Stephen%20Embry), and [Kevin O’Keefe.](https://kevin.lexblog.com/2022/03/10/alms-legalweek-2022-and-central-park-its-all-good/) Their posts are well worth a read.

Let’s Talk Legaltech

This year, I attended ABA TECHSHOW with my “[MyCase](http://www.mycase.com) hat” on, and it was great to connect with the MyCase team. What made this year special was that my work colleagues from three companies recently acquired by MyCase — [CASEpeer](http://www.casepeer.com), [Soluno](http://www.soluno.legal), and [Woodpecker ](http://www.woodpeckerweb.com)— were in the booth as well.

In comparison, at Legalweek, I was wearing my “press hat” and had the opportunity to connect with folks from a number of companies for purposes of this column and [another that I write](https://www.abajournal.com/authors/64800) for the ABA Journal. A few companies caught my attention this year because they had one thing in common: an innovative approach to streamlining business operations in law firms.

Notable LexisNexis Updates

First, there’s LexisNexis. At Legalweek, I met with representatives from LexisNexis, including Jeff Pfeifer, chief product officer, Canada, UK, USA; Karl Harris, CEO of LexMachina; Mark Koussa — principal product manager, new product development and litigation solutions; and Dave DiCicco, senior director, product management and API strategy. I’m always interested in learning what LexisNexis is up to since they own so much proprietary content and have significantly invested in the AI tools needed to make the data truly useful for law firms.

There were two announcements from LexisNexis at the show that stood out to me. The first was [the launch](https://www.prweb.com/releases/lexisnexis_launches_global_api_developers_portal_to_deliver_industry_leading_data_content_and_insights_directly_into_lawyers_established_workflows/prweb18538335.htm) of their “Global API Developer’s Portal.” The newly released LexisNexis APIs cover 99% of their content, and the goal is to make all insights in LexisNexis available to their customers through a suite of API tools. Using the Global API Developer Portal, organizations will be able to create customized workflows or new applications by leveraging content from LexisNexis.

I found the Lex Machina API to be particularly notable since it provides access to analytics data and insights, including case resolutions, damages, remedies, findings, and up-to-date information on attorneys, law firms, and parties. The analytics can be integrated into an organization’s client relationship management (CRM) system, matter management platform, or other internal applications in order to provide insights on both internal law firm data and external data obtained from other sources within LexisNexis.

I also learned about the planned April release of “Fact and Issue Finder,” a tool that offers another way to avoid context switching between the various applications used by law firms. Instead, it will create a home base for all relevant litigation data by displaying legal and nonlegal content in one location. It will also provide advanced search capabilities so that data can be easily accessed. A visualization and analytics dashboard will include relevant information specific to a matter and will make it easy to locate settlement and verdict amounts by injury or jurisdiction, and will also provide data on expert witnesses used in similar cases. “Fact and Issue Finder” is launching to personal injury users in April and will be expanded to five other practice areas in July: real estate, intellectual property, labor and employment, business and corporate, and insurance.

Billseye: Easily Capture Billable Phone Calls

I also learned about [Billseye](https://billseye.com/), a unique time-tracking tool. We all know that billable time is the bane of existence for many lawyers, but it’s nevertheless of great importance since the failure to accurately track and capture billable time can result in lost revenue.

Unfortunately, capturing billable time can be a challenge if your firm isn’t using the right technology. In fact, according to the [MyCase 2021 Legal Industry Report](https://info.mycase.com/industry.html), the majority of legal professionals surveyed (61%) reported that capturing billable time is a challenge at their firm.

Notably, the survey results also show the vast majority of law firms use some type of time-tracking software (81%) and that doing so pays off: 9% reported that their firms captured more than 15 hours each month with time-tracking tools. Another 8% captured 11 to 15 hours, 17% tracked an additional six to 10 hours, and 21% added one to five hours.

However, sometimes not all billable time is easily captured, even when your firm uses robust law practice management or legal billing software, especially when you’re in the middle of a billable activity and it’s interrupted, often by a phone call. Sometimes you remember to capture the time spent on the phone call; sometimes you don’t. That’s where Billseye software comes in — it fills that time-tracking gap.

I learned about Billseye when I participated on a panel at Legalweek, “[Accelerating Diversity in Legaltech Funding](https://www.event.law.com/legalweek/agenda).” One of my co-panelists, Alcide Honoré, is the co-founder of Billseye and he shared how it works. Billseye is an Android app that interfaces with your mobile phone and when a call from a client comes in, you answer the call using the Billseye client button. From there, the app tracks the length of your call, and once you hang up you can add a note before logging the call. Later, you can export the call log from your device so that you can then enter the time into your firm’s legal billing or case management software, thus ensuring that you never lose track of time spent on billable phone calls.

Until Next Year

So there you have it! From a time-keeping app for mobile phones to the latest offerings from legal technology behemoth LexisNexis. It’s a big jump in one column, but that’s what these conferences are all about: finding out what’s new and innovative in legaltech, whether it’s being delivered by a small startup or a large software company.

Innovation in the legal space can be found in many places, but these two conferences are great places to start. If you weren’t able to attend this year, here’s to seeing you at one of the conferences next year in 2023!

# Deal Value Is Down Big -- Brace Yourself For Hard Times

Perhaps these third quarter numbers are just an outlier. Maybe it’s just an unpleasant bump in the road that won’t carry over into bigger and badder things.

Or maybe the dip in megadeals is just ushering in a new era of middle-market deals that will fuel the M&A coffers of law firms for years to come.

But we’re all lawyers here, so let’s go ahead and assume the worst. Law firms report a [major drop-off in deal value](https://biglawbusiness.com/u-s-deal-value-plunges-in-third-quarter/), and it’s probably the beginning of a slowdown that’s going to bite mightily into firm revenue:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Announced and proposed transactions by U.S. and foreign acquirers to buy U.S. companies fell 45 percent to a little over $300 billion in the third quarter, compared to just over $560 billion in the second quarter, according to Bloomberg Law data.

In third quarter 2016, total deal value involving U.S. targets reached more than $450 billion.

Super! While the market continues to climb — and indeed that can contribute to a slowdown, as acquiring public companies becomes more expensive — there have been rumblings that a reckoning is on the horizon. Optimists hope this is just a jittery investment landscape waiting to see what, if anything, this administration manages to secure in the way of tax reform. Unfortunately, given the legislative acumen of this administration, those deals could be on hold for a while.

And let’s not underestimate the fact that this administration operates in full “Yellow Peril” mode at all times:

Increased scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) also is sparking concern for foreign buyers, particularly the Chinese, who are now unsure about the prospects for their U.S. deals, Vaughn told Bloomberg BNA.

CFIUS is a multi-agency panel headed by the Treasury Department that reviews national security implications of acquisitions of U.S. businesses. In September, President Donald Trump blocked a $1.3 billion deal between U.S. chipmaker Lattice Semiconductor Corp. and Canyon Bridge Capital Partners, a private equity firm backed by a Chinese investor. The president opposed the proposed acquisition based on CFIUS’s recommendation.

But there’s still a lot of small-scale activity out there. Just because the big ticket deals are on hold doesn’t mean there’s no work for transactional attorneys. If this truly is the beginning of a renaissance for the middle-market deal, that’s not so terrible. On the other hand, if the megadeal slowdown is just the beginning of a waterfall of doubt that runs down the transactional food chain, it won’t make for a very happy holiday in Biglaw M&A departments.

If we really want to dwell on the worst case scenario, maybe we’re tumbling into the next recession. When Biglaw announced its raises last year, [David Lat pointed out](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/dear-biglaw-firms-please-dont-raise-salaries/) that the legal industry almost always hands out raises just before the economic hard times hit. The cautious, glacial pace of Biglaw decision cycles always seem to fritter away to 90 percent of a recovery before feeling comfortable hiking salaries. At the time, he predicted trouble within about 18 months.

The Biglaw salary hikes began about 16 months ago….

# Congratulations To The 2017 Skadden Fellows

The high-powered law firm of [Skadden Arps](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/skadden-arps-slate-meagher-flom/) pays [above-market bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-the-skadden-shoe-drops/) to high-performing senior associates, but that is not the firm’s noblest form of generosity. It is far more famous — and justifiably so — for launching and supporting the [Skadden Fellowship program](http://www.skaddenfellowships.org/about-foundation).

Described as “a legal Peace Corps,” the program was established in 1988, in honor of Skadden’s 40th anniversary as a law firm. The two-year fellowships support graduating law students committed to public interest work as they embark upon specific projects at sponsoring organizations. The fellowships are viewed as the public-interest world’s version of Supreme Court clerkships or Rhodes Scholarships. So they are both public-spirited and prestigious — what’s not to like?

The Skadden Foundation just announced its [2017 class of Skadden Fellows](https://www.skaddenfellowships.org/fellows-list/2017). The 30 fellows come from 15 different law schools. Yale has the most fellows in this class, with six; Harvard, [last year’s](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/congratulations-to-the-2016-skadden-fellows/) top producer, takes second place, with five.

Download the full report to get answers to today’s most important questions:

- How much of today’s in-house legal workload is related to contracts?
- What causes problems with internal agreement collaborators?
- How did legal professionals modernize during the transition to remote work?
- Which technologies are legal teams adopting to increase internal influence?

I’ve very rarely had a male candidate accept the offer terms as they were given. Men will negotiate every point of an offer, while women a lot of times will take whatever the offer is at face value.

—Shannan Rahman, managing partner at The Partners Group, [told Law.com](https://www.law.com/2020/01/08/can-better-negotiation-help-women-lawyers-shrink-the-gender-pay-gap/) how negotiation effects the compensation of men versus women. She also noted that men tend to overstate the value of their book of business, while women tend to undervalue it, “It’s as if men are giving the number of what they want their book to be or what it could be, instead of what is actually there.”

## This firm takes no prisoners.

Baker McKenzie is the most dominant global brand in all of Biglaw. It shouldn’t be a surprise — Baker McKenzie has repeatedly topped the list of the best Biglaw brands, according to[ Acritas’s Global Brand Index.](https://www.acritas.com/news/baker-mckenzie-extends-global-brand-lead-be-twice-strong-closest-contender) They’ve held the top spot every single year since the Index was created in 2010, but this year, they extended their margin of victory, with a Brand Index that more than doubles that of the second place firm.

The Brand Index is created through “1,074 interviews with respondents, in $1 billion+ revenue organizations across the world, who have senior responsibility for buying legal services.” So, based on the opinions of the people who actually pick the law firm, which firms make it to the Top 10?

1. Baker McKenzie Brand Strength: 100
2. DLA Piper Brand Strength: 48
3. Clifford Chance Brand Strength: 45
4. Jones Day Brand Strength: 37
4. Norton Rose Fulbright Brand Strength: 37
6. Hogan Lovells Brand Strength: 36
7. Allen & Overy Brand Strength: 34
8. Freshfields Brand Strength: 33
8. Linklaters Brand Strength: 33
10. Dentons Brand Strength: 29

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
According to Acritas CEO Lisa Hart Shepherd, firms that topped the list provide creative solutions to their clients’ complex problems:

“The legal industry is fixated on distinguishing work delivered by lawyers and non-lawyers, but in reality, clients just want effective solutions to their broad portfolio of legal work,” she said.

Another notable aspect of this year’s list include a rising performance by Jones Day. The firm’s U.S. brand rose to the [top of the heap this year](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/the-best-brand-in-biglaw-isnt-skadden-anymore/) — stealing the spot from Skadden — and wins the prize for Most Improved, as [reported by](http://www.law.com/sites/americanlawyer/2017/10/10/baker-mckenzie-brand-twice-as-strong-as-any-other-law-firms-new-survey-finds/) Law.com:

Jones Day has the most improved brand in this year’s survey. Having placed ninth last year, it is now the fourth-strongest legal brand globally—an impressive international showing for a firm that has almost two-thirds of its lawyers based within the U.S., according to The American Lawyer’s recently published Global 100 survey.

# Barber Ranen Leaders Resign From Their Own Firm After Racist, Sexist, Antisemitic Emails Are Leaked
## The rise and incredibly quick fall of a law firm thanks to its leaders’ inappropriate emails.

Earlier today, we reported on the [dozens of offensive emails](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/barber-ranen-offensive-emails/) exchanged between John Barber and Jeffrey Ranen, former Lewis Brisbois partners who left the firm, [leading more than 100 lawyers away](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/becker-ranen-partners-defection-lewis-brisbois/) to join their new firm, Barber Ranen. While still at Lewis Brisbois, Barber and Ranen’s emails ran the gamut from racist to sexist to homophobic to antisemitic.

Per [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/ex-lewis-brisbois-partners-resign-new-firm-after-racist-sexist-emails-found-2023-06-05/), Barber and Ranen have now tendered their resignations from Barber Ranen, at the request of the firm’s CEO Tim Graves.

According to the [New York Post](https://nypost.com/2023/06/03/woke-la-firm-routinely-used-vile-language-to-refer-to-women-poc/amp/) and [Forward](https://forward.com/fast-forward/549265/barber-ranen-lewis-brisbois-bisgaard-and-smith-antisemitism/), Barber and Ranen sent emails using incredibly offensive language. Here are just a few of the derogatory emails called out by the Post:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“Kill her by anal penetration,” Barber emailed Ranen in June 2012, reacting to an overtime request from another Lewis Brisbois attorney. On at least three occasions, Ranen described female attorneys as “c–ts.”

In a March 2022 missive, a Los Angeles judge was described as “sugar t-ts.” when Barber joked about how the judge liked to be addressed.

In a November 2012 note, Ranen noted to Barber that another partner has “huge t–s.” That female partner has since decamped to Ranen and Barber’s new firm.

The Post then details several racist and anti-LGBTQ emails exchanged between Barber and Ranen, where the N-word is used frequently and homophobic remarks are made gratuitously.

These are just some of the antisemitic passages [Forward](https://forward.com/fast-forward/549265/barber-ranen-lewis-brisbois-bisgaard-and-smith-antisemitism/) reprinted:

In a Sept. 13, 2012 email, for example, Ranen wrote to Barber, “I forgot to write that we will not hire Jews” after the latter recommended a person — his or her identity was redacted by the company — for a litigation contract. In another email earlier that year, Ramen told Derek Sachs, a former partner at Lewis Brisbois, “This is the reason why people don’t like Jews,” in response to an invoice submitted to them. In a June 2012 email thread that begins with discussing a new hire, Ranen referred to Barber as a “Jew” for owing him money.

The pair also singled out observant Jews. In a January 2014 email, Ranen boasted to Barber that he deliberately emails a Jewish opposing counsel on Shabbat after the person requested that he not be sent material related to a deposition on Saturdays. “This Jew is cracking me up,” Ranen. “I almost ONLY write to him on Saturday mornings.” Barber responded, “Jew hater.”

In a statement, Graves said in a statement that Barber Ranen — itself a very new firm — will “form a new firm,” and went on to note that its equity partners have expressed “their disappointment and disdain for the language Mr. Barber and Mr. Ranen used.”

UPDATE (6:45 p.m.): John Barber and Jeffrey have released the “Statement of Apology and Responsibility” they issued when resigning from the firm. Read it here in full:

We want to apologize. To everyone. To our families, our friends, our colleagues, and the public who had to read the thoughtless, hurtful and inappropriate words we used and sentiments expressed in the emails recently released by our former law firm. The last 72 hours have been the most difficult of our lives, as we have had to acknowledge and reckon with those emails. They are not, in any way, reflections of the contents of our hearts, or our true values. When we started this firm, we announced to the world the purest and truest description of who we are as men and leaders. We stand by those sentiments and insist they are the true measure of our character. Nonetheless, we know that words have power and whether spoken in private or public, they matter. We are ashamed of the words we wrote, and we are deeply sorry.

We have to be better, more vigilant and protective of our values and unfailingly consistent in representing those values in public and in private. We promise we will be. But that said, we understand that there are consequences for our actions. Therefore, we are resigning from Barber Ranen effective immediately in order to allow our friends and colleagues to continue on without the cloud of our conduct hanging over them. We will be taking time away to explore the ways in which we can most effectively demonstrate our contrition and commitment to a world characterized by inclusion, kindness and grace, all qualities we failed to demonstrate in our private correspondence.

Last month, a former Biglaw paralegal was indicted for allegedly stealing more than $600,000 from the Am Law 200 where she worked, and yesterday, she pleaded not guilty to numerous counts of wire fraud and embezzlement related to her alleged six-figure financial heist.

Becky Louise Sutton, formerly of Saul Ewing’s Chicago office, stands accused of transferring bankruptcy estate funds meant for creditors to her own accounts. She allegedly did this from 2009 to 2018, taking a total of $682,980. According to the indictment, Sutton used the money to pay credit card bills, mortgage bills, and student loan bills, also setting some cash aside in her personal bank account and a PayPal account.

[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/ex-saul-ewing-paralegal-pleads-not-guilty-embezzling-600k-2022-05-05/) has the details on how the firm has reacted to the charges:

“We have cooperated with law enforcement and ensured that any impacted client did not suffer any losses,” the [Saul Ewing] spokesperson said in an April 21 statement.

Saul Ewing declined to comment on Sutton’s plea Thursday. Sutton’s lawyer said he would not comment until the discovery process is carried out.

Sutton has posted $5,000 for bond, and faces up to 60 years in prison for three counts of wire fraud and 15 years for three counts of embezzlement.

# Biglaw Firm Fires Staff Member Who Posted 'Threatening' Message About Being Forced To Wear COVID-19 Mask
## Now is not the time to allegedly suggest shooting up grocery stores.

If you’ve been looking for a way to quickly get out of your longtime career at a Biglaw firm, then perhaps suggesting in a public Facebook post that you have guns and ammo to show to retail staff who dare state that you must wear a mask to enter during the COVID-19 pandemic is the way to go.

On Friday, Kevin Bain, who worked as a document services manager in Thompson & Knight’s Dallas, Texas, office, posted the following rant on Facebook:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Bain, who started working at the firm in 2009, quickly found internet infamy as his post made the rounds on various social media websites. Eventually, the firm caught wind of his ill-advised post and thankfully took immediate action.



According to his now-deleted [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-bain-77096913/), prior to this episode, Bain had worked in the legal industry since 1997. Now he’s thrown away his entire career over a public health and safety requirement. Perhaps it’s all for the best; after all, he may have faced a future furlough or layoff thanks to the austerity measures many firms have taken due to the coronavirus outbreak. He just saved his firm the trouble.

# Here Is The Most Tortured Biglaw/Military/Al-Qaeda Analogy Of 2018

I mean, look, I like clicks too. I get it. But this headline right here is ridiculous:

Beyond the Assembly Line: Could Big Law Firms Defeat Al-Qaeda?

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
I mean, one is a group of well-trained, anti-social people with dark aims, and the other is Al-Qaeda (zing). But, umm, it’s a good headline because when I read it on [Law.com’s Mid-Market Report](https://www.law.com/mid-market-report/2018/07/18/beyond-the-assembly-line-could-big-law-firms-defeat-al-qaeda/), I clicked to see what combination of crazy and market pressure could lead to such a question.

The premise is that Biglaw has an outdated approach to client services, the same way the U.S. military had an outdated, Cold War approach to counter-insurgency and it was only when the military adapted to new realities that it was able to push back against Al-Qaeda.

Or something. I didn’t spend too much time wrestling with the central premise, lest I be sucked into a vortex where John Quinn has his hands on the nuclear button and gives Selendy & Gay 48 hours to disband, “or else.”

Turns out, the piece was written by John Pierce, who is the managing partner of Pierce Bainbridge Beck Price & Hecht, and has a interest in talking about how his firm outcompetes the big boys. Again, I get all that. Please email [advertising@breakingmedia.com](mailto:advertising@breakingmedia.com) and I’ll get it even more.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But… I don’t know what to do with this passage:

Pierce Bainbridge’s history so far only confirms how well [General Stanley McChrystal]’s vision does indeed apply to legal battlefields. In case after case, we’ve bested Big Law firms; their timekeepers and research specialists could not prevail against the kind of software in which we’ve invested, because ours makes “frenetic sharing” possible in ways that conventional email cannot…

In the past, Big Law Goliaths typically massacred small competitors by overwhelming them with sundry documents and motions. That may have been sound strategy once upon a time. But our firm has achieved something comparable to the 10-hour-to-27-minutes transformation achieved by McChrystal’s task force.

This feels like a good time to mention that: LITIGATION IS NOT WAR! It’s not like war. DELIVERING CLIENT SERVICES IS NOT LIKE DEFEATING AL-QAEDA.

Commercial aviation, unlike other industries, faces the constant possibility of disaster; indeed, United’s initiative was inspired by the crash of Flight 173 three years earlier. Like the U.S. military after 9/11, there was compelling motivation to entertain radical change. However, many other types of organizations won’t really adapt until their own ramparts start to tumble like Twin Towers. Alas for large law firms, that day of reckoning may come sooner than their harshest detractors predict.

NOBODY IS FLYING A PLANE INTO SKADDEN BECAUSE THEY DON’T USE SLACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Here’s an analogy I can go with: Small law firm proselytizers sometimes just need to chill instead of trying to blow everything up like Al-Qaeda.

Bonus season is generally divided into three phases. In the first phase, every likely suspect tags along in seriatim, offering not a single surprise and eliciting most knowing Jeremiah Johnson nods from everyone.

In the second phase, we see firms make their swinging genitalia moves. This is where someone announces they’re giving big premiums on the scale, paying 1.5x or 2x over the prevailing scale. We all talk up the firm and marvel at their financial prowess. It’s a great run of recruiting press.

In the third phase — the most interesting phase — solid but not quite elite firms start announcing bonuses and we all rush to the tea leaves. A match? Wow, they must be doing better than we thought! Falling short? Uh oh, trouble on the horizon. Or the most common out: A match but paid out next July with a 3000-hour minimum billables requirement making you wonder if this is a “match” in anything but name only.

Ad campaign sample via Demand Justice

Decisions have consequences. That’s a concept lawyers should be well familiar with. So when Consovoy McCarthy, Gibson Dunn, Kasowitz Benson & Torres, Kirkland & Ellis, Sullivan & Cromwell, and WilmerHale decided to be Gold Circle sponsors of a Federalist Society dinner where Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was the keynote speaker, they probably should have expected some people would be pissed. Maybe they didn’t expect a full-out ad campaign, but that’s what they got.

On Monday, the advocacy group [Demand Justice announced](https://demandjustice.org/demand-justice-expands-campaign-to-hold-federalist-society-accountable-targeting-law-firms/) an ad campaign targeting employees at those firms for the firm’s support of the Kavanaugh event. Demand Justice is holding the line on the normalization of Kavanaugh following the credible accusations of attempted rape made by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford during his confirmation hearing. As Katie O’Connor, senior counsel at Demand Justice, said:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“The Federalist Society is trying to rehabilitate Brett Kavanaugh – who was credibly accused of sexual assault by multiple women – so he can get to work enriching corporations at the expense of women, immigrants, LGBTQ people, and other vulnerable communities. And, they’re using the veneer of legitimacy granted to them by sponsors to do it. The firms supporting the Federalist Society are choosing profits over survivors. It’s time for people at these firms who really care about ending sexual violence to speak up.”

I know a lot of lawyers on both sides of the political spectrum are eager for a return to the legal norms of a pre-Trump world. When it was fine to support an event featuring Supreme Court justice of any political stripe. But that’s not the world we live in. They can’t undo the erosion of those norms brought on by destruction of blue slips, the appointment of unqualified federal judges, and everything surrounding Merrick Garland’s nomination for the Supreme Court.

The reality is the painful truth that Republicans in the Senate did not care about credible accusations of sexual assault during the Kavanaugh confirmation. But that doesn’t mean everyone can — or should — forget what happened and get back to business as usual.

# What Would Legal Sweethearts Candy Say?
## Goofing on Valentine's Day.

The tyranny of those stupid, chalky Sweethearts candies is no more — at least for this year. Who knew making a terrible candy that people only buy once a year wasn’t a winning business model? Unfortunately, the candies are projected to return next year.

But in their absence, the ABA Journal is asking readers to submit their suggestions for [what Sweethearts might say if they were specifically tailored to attorneys](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/if-lawyers-made-candy-hearts-what-would-yours-say). I guess it gives new meaning to “Check Out Our Tender Offer.”

Anyway, feel free to join their discussion over social media and maybe you’ll get a mention from the Journal. I don’t think anyone else has offered “Let’s create some heirs of my body” yet.

If lawyers made candy hearts, what would yours say? How do you say “I love you” in legalese? Let us know in this week's Question of the Week!

This wouldn’t fit on a candy, would it? “I like my first dates like I like my rule 403: probative but not unduly prejudicial.” That’s a shame.
